            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Really nice eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>I purchase this item under promotion with my own honest opinion</li>
            <li>I got mine at a reasonable price and it has been great!</li>
            <li>Nice curler for the price.</li>
            <li>It made my eyelashes look really nice even without applying mascara.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li>I received this at a reduced price for an honest opinion.</li>
            <li>This is perfect, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>my own</li>
            <li>Despite the nice look and feel, I didn&#x27;t notice any curling with this tool.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a nice compromise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But nonetheless, it&#x27;s always nice to have</li>
            <li>It really was the best eyelash curler I have ever used</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve tried just about any kind of curler there is.  </li>
            <li>handles have a nice silicon padding so that your fingers don&#x27;t get sore</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a nice padding on the curler section.</li>
            <li>ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to have something that won&#x27;t pull out what remaining lashes I have.</li>
            <li>She, too, was thrilled with this tool and is ordering her own.  </li>
            <li>product is for an exchange for an unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li>This  is my own Honest review of product.  </li>
            <li>I love it already and the curl lasted a good while with mascara...</li>
            <li>It also leaves your lashes with a really nice curl.</li>
            <li>It is so quick and easy to use and curls my lashes perfectly every time.</li>
            <li>Worth it ladies!!!...</li>
            <li>The main focus of this curler is the fact that it wont pinch or tug and no matter the length of your lashes, it will leave you with perfect curls.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone seeking those perfectly curled lashes!</li>
            <li>I did receive this product for free but opinions expressed are my own!</li>
            <li>I own 4 lash curlers and always had a favorite, but now I have to honestly say Izy is going to be the one I use from now on.</li>
            <li>This is really easy to use and feels so good.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use, good size, no issues with sticking or pulling out lashes -</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>curling is very easy, it doe NOT pinch at all and holds the curl all day, till I take off my mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a very strong hold on lashes and curls them in one turn.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Love love love!</li>
            <li>Nice product :)</li>
            <li>By far the best one I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Best one so far</li>
            <li>So far this is the best of all the three.</li>
            <li>Beautiful curl on the first go around.</li>
            <li>Ok, i&#x27;ve gotta be honest...</li>
            <li>The product itself is sturdy, ergonomic, and does a good job at curling the eyelash in a comfortable manner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been curling my lashes for YEARS and this one has, by far, the best cushion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this product lives up to it name and one of the best eyelash curlers I have owned so far.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes look amazing and there was no pulling or tearing :)  </li>

            <li>Well packaged and very comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;Their</li>

            <li>Comfortable, easy to use and gives good curl</li>
            <li>need to add, very importantly, that you keep them curly and sexy.</li>

            <li>So much better than store purchase.  </li>
            <li>It works just as well or better than the more expensive/name brand ones I have used.</li>
            <li>I also really love the packaging, it&#x27;s so cute.  </li>
            <li>The Lovely Lashes eliminates the pinch and tagging, the curler doesn&#x27;t pull my lashes out.</li>
            <li>love the eyelast curlers...</li>
            <li>I have short lashes, so a curler that is able to do this is wonderful!</li>
            <li>the outcome is just lovely</li>
            <li>You will love this tool...</li>

            <li>And I love the quality.</li>
            <li>i am officially in love with this curler.</li>
            <li>and I love the box it came in as well</li>
            <li>I wanted to contact the seller to see if I could get a replacement, but I wasn&#x27;t able to figure out how to get in touch with them.</li>
            <li>Lovely Lashes Curler</li>
            <li>Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler does just that for you.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re ok.</li>
            <li>So glad I found a quality curler that doesn&#x27;t cause my lashes to fall out.</li>
            <li>Well, i think i need a lot more practice and patience.  </li>
            <li>but I ordered another eyelash curler that works much better for my almond shaped eye and is better quality.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>I love curled lashes</li>
            <li>Many eyelash curlers hurt, tug or squeeze.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask?</li>
            <li>this Lovely Lashes curler beats the others.</li>
            <li>This isn’t the best eyelash curler I’ve ever used, but better than the vast majority I’ve tried.</li>
            <li>There is more padding in the strip, which is</li>
            <li>I believe if I had different shaped eyes, they would be perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>In short, I like this curler, and it&#x27;s probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>works way better then</li>
            <li>The curl looked great  even without mascara or eyeliner and the curler was very sturdy (the curler I had before this one was flimsy).</li>
            <li>You have nothing to worry about with Lovely Lashes</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase more for gift basket fillers or stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li>I could get a better one at the dollar store.</li>
            <li>I love this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>My wife received this product for free, the review and opinions are her own.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>This truly does give you Lovely Lashes.</li>
            <li>and I look more awake than I sometimes feel!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I thought it was cute.  </li>
            <li>That’s important too!  </li>
            <li>This curler really worked great.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product!</li>
            <li>Im extremely glad I was chosen to review this product. :)</li>
            <li>I stopped using eyelash curlers because they always pinch and pull out eyelashes and it will stick to the pad however with this Lovely lashes eyelash curler it</li>
            <li>It definitely exceeded my expectations and is made of great quality!!</li>
            <li>and this one works better than the Revlon ever did.</li>
            <li>The last bonus is that you can still coat the lash line with eyeliner for that perfect line without damaging it or staining the pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works ok.</li>
            <li>This was not my favorite, but if I had nothing else, I&#x27;d use it.</li>
            <li>I received one for free to review, but my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>On top of that, I wear glasses</li>
            <li>Better quality then others I have tried.</li>
            <li>I do wish that it had more cushion strips</li>
            <li>I always assumed mascara would take care of everything but after using Lovely Lashes I have been proved wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lovely Lashes are great especially for a fairly beginner like me to using eyelash curlers.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to be extremely familiar with curlers to be able to use it!</li>
            <li>Through the years I have bought and thrown away more eyelash curlers than I care to count.</li>
            <li>This seems kind of cheaply made to me as well.</li>
            <li>It has a sharper curve than most eyelash curlers.  </li>
            <li>I bought a Revlon curler at the drug store which works better for me.</li>
            <li>The rubber peice at the top is wider than others</li>
            <li>also love that it comes with a replacement silicone refill pad.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work any better then any of the others I tried.</li>
            <li>Love how they don&#x27;t rugged on my lashes.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and love it.</li>
            <li>I noticed her lashes more after using the curler.</li>
            <li>so it was nice that it fit well.</li>
            <li>Just be prepared for all of the compliments!e sure to use the LLEC every day for three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler</li>
            <li>I really love this eyelash curler and the box</li>
            <li>and I was able to curl all of my lashes at once.</li>
            <li>So I was reluctant to order more</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and it grips the lashes pretty good to make nice curls.</li>
            <li>The first thing this lash curler did was pinch my skin...OUCH!!!  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to give to give this eye lash curler a shot.</li>
            <li>Love this, works amazing and its not a bad price</li>
            <li>Light and very easy to use.</li>

            <li>liked using this one because it was easy to use as well as comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is a very comfortable, easy to use eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast &amp; the product was amazing!</li>
            <li>seems to work pretty good</li>
            <li>At first it worked good</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take long to leave a great curl!</li>
            <li>What I like most is that my lashes stay curled and look good all day, really keeps the shape.  </li>
            <li>I feel the curler is of great quality very sturdy doesn&#x27;t feel cheap</li>
            <li>They work very good, and comes with a extra plastic piece.  </li>

            <li>I received this Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler for free in order to review.</li>

            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require much pressure to get a good curl, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes.</li>

            <li>I will preface this by saying that curling my eyelashes isn&#x27;t part of my normal beauty routine, however, I was very pleased with the results and was satisfied with the value of the product based on the price.</li>
            <li>It easy to use.</li>
            <li>The curve allowed me to get all corners of my eye covered in one grip, which allowed for easy, convenient curling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pinch easily, but you can still do it if you aren&#x27;t careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, love the silicone white strips and I also like that they could be replaced.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how easy and efficient this curler is.  </li>
            <li>It easily opens and closes.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t pull your lashes and it is easy to use, convenient, etc.</li>

            <li>Wow this is amazing!</li>
            <li>It fit over my eye perfect, not too curled like some other eyelash curlers.</li>
            <li>it fits my eye perfectly and when i pressed down to curl them THERE IS NO PINCH.</li>

            <li>Applying mascara did make them be even more bold</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>They really work too, most volume I&#x27;ve gotten ever!</li>

            <li>Works fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have had problems with finding an eyelash curler that would fit all my eyelashes at one time.</li>
            <li>I received these free to review</li>
            <li>Their product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t quite fit my eye shape.</li>
            <li>I went and bought a cheap one at the store and threw this away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and works for any eye shape  </li>
            <li>Tried to adjust it but&lt;br /&gt;it wouldn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>This is a comfortable eyelash curler, and my lashes have yet to stick and get pulled out.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or flimsy.</li>
            <li>The scissor movement is nice and smooth, and it gives a nice curl.&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is the white cushion pad, which makes it easier to see your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the pad,</li>
            <li>so your fingers can fit comfortably.  </li>
            <li>The movements were smooth with no hitches.  </li>
            <li>Works great, I had to replace my Revlon curler that I had for several years</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic</li>
            <li>An eyelash curler can make or break a look, that is why it is important to have one that you are comfortable using.</li>
            <li>Not to mention they are fantastic to use.</li>
            <li>Works well but doesn&#x27;t fit my eye shape</li>
            <li>The curler is light weight</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of durability, the LLEC feels durable and is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>The curler fit my eye</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I always struggled to find one that fit correctly and one that wouldn&#x27;t pull my eyelashes out.</li>
            <li>Fits my lashes in comfortably and does not rip my eyelashes out.</li>
            <li>This eyelash curler is OK, but not even nearly as good as Shu Emura - seems like every time I try to save money and try a different product, I lose.</li>
            <li>I love a good curled eye lash but can never seem to actually pull it off!.</li>
            <li>Now, to be very honest this is the second eyelash curler ever.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy and</li>
            <li>I really loved this Eyelash Curler by Izy Trends; not only is this extremely easy to use, but it is really comfortable when using.  </li>
            <li>I was just feeling a bit braver and ambitious and when I had the opportunity to give Lovely Lashes a test drive I went for it.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive my product today</li>
            <li>If you are interested in looking at more reviews you can check out the product here:</li>
            <li>The packaging is super cute with a barbie like doll on it and since Pink is my favorite color it made the packaging more appealing to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Not until recently did I realize how important having a good eyelash curler was.</li>
            <li>Someone who is looking to spend a bit more than your cheap curlers, but not as much as the fancy high-end ones.</li>
            <li>Love this Eyelash Curler, simple yet totally effective.  </li>
            <li>the curler is clean</li>
            <li>The silicone does attract dust and particles, so store it in an airtight and clean</li>
            <li>If you are going to use it after you apply your mascara, clean the tip before redoing it again and after you are finish.</li>
            <li>I loved receiving this item in its adorable pink box.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, easy to clean and curls my eyelashes really well.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>nothing special.</li>
            <li>and I tried it right away!</li>
            <li>It is an amazing eyelash curler, and will now be a staple in my professional makeup collection at work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thankful to have finally found one that is of good quality.</li>
            <li>but I was not blessed with natural curls of any kind.</li>
            <li>The quality is good and I like that it comes with an extra pad, but it just didn&#x27;t work for my eyelid shape.</li>
            <li>my full review at maegal .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a fan of lash curlers since I&#x27;ve never found one that fits properly, but I really loved this one.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used curlers very often, so I have no idea how many additional pads I would need, or how often they should be changed.</li>
            <li>Having poked myself in the eye more times than I care to remember, this is a real bonus.  </li>
            <li>I get the more straight my eyelashes seem to grow</li>
            <li>It really did give my daughter lovely lashes..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, just not for my tiny eyes.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a curler for my lashes to make a full curl.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many different ones but they always pinched or just didn&#x27;t fit my eye</li>
            <li>; don&#x27;t think it was any better than cheaper store brands but not worse, either.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good curler</li>
            <li>I really loved that I was able to fit all my eyelashes through the opening because I&#x27;ve used some curlers in the past</li>
            <li>I love this curler way more than the one I was using, it will definitely be my go to lash tool from here on out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and just a wonderful all round purchase.</li>
            <li>Overall this isn&#x27;t the best eyelash curler out there, the one I&#x27;m currently using is tweezerman</li>
            <li>works super well, doesnt squeeze pinch or hurt.</li>
            <li>results were still the same (all three work about equally as far as what my eyelashes look like in the end), but getting there was more pleasant.</li>
            <li>Even my teen daughter was impressed that she &amp;#34;could actually see&amp;#34; my eyelashes!  </li>
            <li>Was shipped quickly and packaged well as well.</li>
            <li>But again, most of all my favorite part is that I finally have a curler that doesn&#x27;t pinch and pull my lashes.</li>
            <li>I normally just use mascara to darken them, but I often wish they had more curl.</li>
            <li>I bought this item at a promotional price for a review but this eyelash curler is definitely worth the full price.</li>
            <li>When my favorite eyelash curler broke, I went in search of a new one.</li>
            <li>Pretty much what I expect from an eyelash curler :)</li>
            <li>No painful pulling of lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Extra nice thing is the extra replacemnt pad that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;Happy customer!</li>
            <li>This eyelash curler really does do an excellent job at producing pretty, natural-looking curves with as little discomfort as could be possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pad is very soft and allowed some give with I think helped to achieve a better curl.</li>
            <li>This eyelash curler was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Works much better than my old eyelash curler and the curl lasts longer!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product but only if you love your lashes!</li>
            <li>They really work and do what they say they will do!!</li>
            <li>Will purchase again in the future for sure!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used an eyelash curler that a) didn&#x27;t pinch, b) didn&#x27;t pull out any lashes, and c) WORKED!  </li>
            <li>Most curlers are much too large for me.</li>
            <li>Great item, not cheaply made ..</li>
            <li>The curler fit my lashes really conveniently.</li>
            <li>Bright pink</li>
            <li>All round great product</li>
            <li>I read somewhere to hit it with the hair dryer for a second to warm it and thats been working well too.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>Good Quality just as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>eye lash curler was surprisingly simple and effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this eyelash curler for maybe a week, but I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>I only wear my own lashes</li>
            <li>curler does a nice job of curling my lashes, getting them all in at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I received the Lovely Lashes eyelash curler today and is pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>She also used it, and even though she has beautiful long and lush eyelashes anyway,  using this curler</li>
            <li>I am surprised by so many 5 star reviews but again, maybe it&#x27;s the shape of my eye</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth it for the curl you get.</li>
            <li>It looks and feel very nice, while I&#x27;ve had a lot of experience with eyelash curlers that just fall apart after a few uses.  </li>
            <li>I read other good reviews, so</li>
            <li>Product was shipped right away.  </li>
            <li>And I was right</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>I tried right after I received it</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all right.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d easily recommend this to any beginner-curler, teens who like experimenting with new make-up tools, and anyone who needs a convenient eye lash curler that does</li>
            <li>My lashes do look genuinely fuller and longer after using this, and very girl deserves to feel pretty.  </li>
            <li>I had pretty much quit using eyelash curlers because I couldn&#x27;t find one that fit my eye.  </li>
            <li>I wondered what could be so special about an eyelash curler that would make one any different from the next, but I did find that this was more comfortable and easy to use--</li>
            <li>They are very easy and simple to use!</li>
            <li>I admit my first thought was that they might be a little cheap because they were so light, but when I looked them over, the materials are good quality and it was just that my old lash curlers were so bulky!</li>
            <li>Absolutely NOTHING special.  </li>
            <li>She took to it with no problems and her long lashes looked amazing.</li>
            <li>I love the cute little &amp;#34;Lovely Lashes&amp;#34; detail on the curler.</li>
            <li>I saw the difference right away with my first eye done.</li>
            <li>No pinching and great fit to prevent broken lash hairs.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how easy it was and</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use the product and that there was no pain at all.  </li>
            <li>- I made sure my lashes were clean and dry.  </li>
            <li>You can feel it really picking up your eyelashes and giving them a quick curl.</li>
            <li>The soft silicone pad is easy on the lashes and a spare is included.  </li>
            <li>sure your eyelashes are clean and dry</li>
            <li>Super Fast Shipping..</li>
            <li>Works very very well.</li>
            <li>Comes with extra white rubber pad which is very nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple to use with a compact design, white easy to see pad, good grip, never pinches skin, easy to get a good curl that lasts, and not crazy expensive.</li>
            <li>Works good but does tug a little.</li>
            <li>It fits all my eyelashes at once and curls them with the first try.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with an extra pad.</li>
            <li>It makes it look like I have fake eyelashes, as they are so perfectly curled!</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are much more noticeable now and that helps since I have blonde lashes ;D</li>
            <li>It is the first one i have ever had</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Curled my lashes very well!</li>
            <li>Love the extra pad</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely put this on my favorite beauty tools list.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no pinch, no pulling, just pretty curled lashes.</li>
            <li>I love that this comes with extra padding to replace your pads if need be.</li>
            <li>I even received a compliment (from a student) on my eyelashes the first day I used it!&lt;br /&gt;(Great</li>
            <li>, thanks!</li>
            <li>Give me the lift I want and has changed my overall look, for the better of course.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Additionally the package comes with an extra silicone pad, which I was pleased to see included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love that it comes with a refill pad for future use.</li>
            <li>, cute enough I plan to keep it and use it to store away my curler.</li>
            <li>Pretty straight-forward eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>When i first got this eyelash curler (about 5 months ago)</li>
            <li>- I use this first and my eyes look more open and mascara added</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with an extra silicon piece.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used drugstore curlers in the past and this one ranks at the top, much better than my makeup catalog one.</li>
            <li>I got really pretty results with it</li>
            <li>and it really curls your lashes!</li>
            <li>It came in a cute box and an extra curling pad.</li>
            <li>I was really amazed!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Better than any eyelash curler you buy locally.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use an eye lashes curler as from my previews experiences with eye lashes curler, if i don&#x27;t pinch a skin, i get my lashes pull out!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The LLEC includes a spare strip should anything happen to the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage</li>
            <li>An eyelash curler is definitely something that I want to keep in my arsenal, so I made sure to use the LLEC every day for three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The curl on both eyes was consistent and even, so I didn’t have to worry about a lopsided look.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>Lovely Lash Eyelash Curler is a solid product that is constructed well and performs exactly as promised.</li>

            <li>Lovely Lash Eyelash Curler is a solid product that is constructed well and performs exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>Shipping was sooo fast too!</li>
            <li>I initially bought a super cheap one at the grocery store and that was a mistake.</li>
            <li>I wear makeup maybe once a year, more often if there is a wedding or other special event.</li>
            <li>The shape of it lies against your eyelid a little differently (flatter) than others that I&#x27;ve tried, which is cool because of the great curl you get from that, but will take some getting used to for me.</li>
            <li>My lids are more flat, so that&#x27;s why they didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>You would think an eyelash curler is an eyelash curler and one would work about as well as all the others, and I have purchased many others in the past, all with the same fair results.  </li>
            <li>I have a 22 year old and a 16 year old girl who BOTH love this product.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve had a lot of friends who use curlers regularly, and I guess I thought it was only fair</li>
            <li>While the extra rubber pad is a nice touch, it is small and potentially VERY easy to lose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While the extra rubber pad is a nice touch, it is small and potentially VERY easy to lose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>easy and simply to use</li>
            <li>I barely use any pressure and my eyelashes are high and curly very quickly.</li>
            <li>Unlike others I have used, it doesn&#x27;t pinch or tug, and I can be certain of a pain-free experience.</li>
            <li>I grew up as a tomboy, and to a certain degree, I still am one.</li>
            <li>As for the structure of the curler, it is very much the classic style.</li>
            <li>She told me also to say that if you are looking for the extra pad for the curler it is snapped on the handle which she said is nice because now she will not loose it.  </li>
            <li>A good product for the women or girl in your life who wants more of a curl to her eyelashes - an extra silicon pad is included and this is an item you will pass down to your girls it is build to last -</li>
            <li>The claim that this eyelash curler will work on any type of eyelashes has definitely proved to be an accurate statement.</li>
            <li>Really gets the eyelash and mine</li>
            <li>the real deal is the how these curlers work</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter, but I might take it, it works very well.</li>
            <li>that would only fit 1/2 of my eyelashes at once.  </li>
            <li>Packaged in a cute pink box.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>i simply just took them off and the inside was still smooth.</li>
            <li>It is very well made</li>
            <li>Plus I use eye mascara and that really helps to accentuate the curls.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyelids and its curl my lashes very well</li>
            <li>I feel much prettier if I have curled eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Curls very well without pinching</li>
            <li>Thanks IZy Trends</li>
            <li>I’ve been keeping this one in my bathroom cabinet so I can use it every morning because it really gives me that bright-eyed</li>
            <li>I will say that the design feels very sturdy, and it did not pinch or pull my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast to...</li>
            <li>(if it does I will update the review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the curler is a very light-weight metal, with silicone grips on the curler itself.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>do they make the after version so much nicer.</li>
            <li>The one in the picture looks really neat</li>
            <li>Very affordable, very efficient.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t need as much mascara to hold the curl as I do with others.</li>
            <li>and I immediately looked more alert and wide</li>
            <li>I really like this eyelash curler...</li>
            <li>I did receive this product free, but this review is entirely my thoughts and feelings on this product.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t curl my lashes they are sticking straight out no matter what mascara I</li>
            <li>I was very excited.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but these are the absolute cutest.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>- it doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>Okay so I never really knew the importance of curling your lashes.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I have unusual eyes, but I would not recommend this item.  </li>
            <li>Although it did curl my straight eyelashes fantastically.</li>
            <li>it really worked well of curling my eye lashes</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It weighs in at 0.8 ounces (22 grams) and has a solid construction at the joints that appear to be able to withstand frequent use.</li>
            <li>It has small rubber handles, which allow for easy and accurate use of the curler.</li>
            <li>One other thing that impressed me was the cushions for the curler, they are soft but firm, unlike some curlers where they feel like you are crimping your eyelashes between to bricks.</li>
            <li>Better then any other eyelash curler ive used.</li>
            <li>First impression: I love the little box it was packaged in.</li>
            <li>I usually have problems with eyelash curlers pulling on my eyelashes, but this one did nothing but magic!</li>
            <li>The curler I bought to replace it (don&#x27;t remember what my original brand had been) was too big for my eye socket.  </li>
            <li>I could not believe I was having such fun playing with my lashes!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product, and I am so glad I spent the money to buy this.</li>
            <li>I like this eyelash curler, it was easy to use and made my lashes look very long.  </li>
            <li>Whether you eschew mascara due to cost or because of a health issue like I have, the Lovely Lash Eyelash Curler will enable you to have eyelashes that will bring attention to your beautiful eyes without the price tag of expensive eye-related cosmetics.</li>

            <li>Completely above expectations, soft, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my 17yr old daughter as her first eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>However, as I&#x27;ve aged (I&#x27;m 50), my lashes seem more sparse and not as long and full as they once were, so when the opportunity to try this product came along</li>
            <li>Its an okay product, but not worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I was able to curl every eyelash, even down to the corners of my eye, with no discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>I was able to curl every eyelash, even down to the corners of my eye, with no discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>Well these new ones do not pinch!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a super cosmetic pro, I love wearing make-up-</li>
            <li>I stopped using eyelash curlers for many years after a couple black eyes from pinching.  </li>
            <li>This particular curler did not hurt.</li>
            <li>older</li>
            <li>squeeze the handle and hold steady for 5-10 seconds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like most women I know I have tried countless eye lash curlers, they seem to always pinch my skin and for some reason I can never seem to curl my left set of eye lashes!</li>
            <li>So when I was asked to review the Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler (or LLEC, for short), I figured that I would give it a try, just to do something different.</li>
            <li>I am very picky on what I use now after learning my lesson the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was the inscription Lovely Lashes on the eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li>Lovely Lashes Curler has a long base and the finger holes are set the perfect length apart.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>had high hopes for this eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>last and only other curler I owned was not half as effective or comfortable to use as this curler.</li>
            <li>The LLEC cleaned up easily with no stains or other residue; I didn’t even need water at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The LLEC cleaned up easily with no stains or other residue; I didn’t even need water at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to manage and use, Love the fact it glides smoothly, unlike other curler I tried its hard and you need to put on extra effort.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be just another claim at a great eyelash curler, but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li>I tried a few more times and still saw no results.  </li>
            <li>The shipping also seems to be pretty fast, so that is definitely a plus!</li>
            <li>so maybe this is normal.</li>
            <li>Was skeptical but pretty good at curling my lashes lived it</li>
            <li>Just make sure to follow instructions and don&#x27;t put it too far down.</li>
            <li>I could have spent less and gotten just as good an eyelash curler</li>
            <li>I have posted a picture of my lashes without the curler on the left and after using on curler on the right</li>
            <li>This eyelash curler works great and doesn&#x27;t pull at your lashes like other brands that I have purchased in the past</li>
            <li>The handles have a rubber insert along the inside of the loops so that your fingers and thumb do not press against the bare metal (which many other brands do, sometimes leaving a mark).</li>
            <li>would recommend this curler to anyone who is looking to try out a new curler.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to those who are looking for a new eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>I discarded my eyelash curler of some 15 years before purchasing a new one and what a mistake that turned out to be.  </li>
            <li>Eyelashes seem to be new thing now a days</li>
            <li>There is nothing wrong with the quality of this item (though it isn&#x27;t anything special, either), however, unlike most other reviewers, this doesn&#x27;t fit my eye shape.  </li>
            <li>Time and time again ive tried different eyelash curlers and this is one of my absolute favorites!</li>
            <li>I do have almond shaped eyes, but they are not small</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been dealing with my old bulky curler that sometimes required me to curl twice because I couldn&#x27;t get all my lashes in!  </li>
            <li>Naturally, that&#x27;s not the look I want!</li>
            <li>so far I normally have problems with curlers taking my eyelashes</li>
            <li>Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler by Izy Trends, in terms of function, is no different than other eyelash curlers on the market.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler, I have very thin short eyelashes</li>
            <li>This curler really makes it easy to get to the inner corners of the lashes which was the problem with my previous curler.</li>
            <li>For this price, I was expecting something a little more, but this is no better than a  cheaply made drugstore brand eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>i was extremely skeptical at first because eyelash curlers are very tricky for me to love or even just like.</li>
            <li>She is a teen who is starting to want to wear make up, but  always wants to make her eyes look pretty.  </li>
            <li>I was able to curl the lashes in the insides of my eyes, towards my nose, and then in the middle, but then it cut off my lashes half way through them at the outer corners of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Hands down, this one wins!</li>
            <li>Finally, the lower half of the press that is used to curl the lashes is lined with a rubber strip that helps the lashes to curl more gently (as opposed to eyelash curlers that have only metal, which can sometimes damage the hairs).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little surprised there&#x27;s only a cushion on the bottom, and not one on the top as well, but it works well, nonetheless.</li>
            <li>have a disease called Sjogrën’s Syndrome, which is basically a more severe form of dry eye (as well as other mucous membranes).</li>
            <li>Also, I get an actual rounded curl and not a squared off angular curl with my lashes sticking straight up.</li>
            <li>It is well made and works very well at curling my pathetically short eye lashes.</li>
            <li>Neither of them will use there old ones ever again.</li>
            <li>It definitely added some curl to my rather straight lashes.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>It comfortably curls my eyelashes without missing lashes or pinching my eyelid.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any issues with this one so far (I&#x27;ve used it three times since I got it).</li>
            <li>am always scared to put things near m eye</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt and it is because of soft rubber pad that is on the curler.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it enough to be confident about how long it holds a curl, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be horribly long.</li>
            <li>I also appreciated that it came with an extra rubber eyelash protector.</li>
            <li>and I was so surprised at</li>
            <li>The pad is soft and doesn&#x27;t hurt or feel like it&#x27;s pulling.</li>
            <li>The handle has soft grips which is comfort for your fingers as you squeeze the curler.  </li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a extra silicone pad that you can change once the other one gets old and gross!</li>
            <li>With the Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler there is no more pinching!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it came with that because they get dirty pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I was presented with the opportunity to review the Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler and I have now realized why I was using the wrong one this whole time!</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m pretty bummed that it lasted me such a short time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what it is about having such cute eyelash curlers</li>
            <li>But it is a little pricey at full listed price.</li>
            <li>My old eyelash curler was on its last strings and I was way overdue for a new curler.</li>
            <li>Compared to my other curler, the Lovely Lashes has a soft pad design with black rubber grip handle that allows my finger to squeeze it with comfort.</li>
            <li>Very affordable and works well on my not so long lashes.</li>
            <li>Especially if your planning on dressing up just curling your eye lashes &amp; adding a little massacre can make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I feel like it protects my lashes better and pulls less than the rubber inserts used in other brands.</li>
            <li>This one, on the other hand, covers my entire eye and makes for a quick beautifying touch-up in one swift curl of the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was looking for a new one for quite some time as all I could find in the store was a plastic one that actually pinched my eyelid skin.  </li>
            <li>I do feel like this eyelash curler will last for a very long time, as I can replace the pad when the first one displays wear.  </li>
            <li>I did pinch myself with it the first time i used it because i put it to far down on my lashes!  </li>
            <li>I guess mine was a defective one because I had barely used it.</li>
            <li>but apparently I do.</li>
            <li>just can&#x27;t enhance what I barely have.</li>
            <li>I never spent--</li>
            <li>and I nearly injured myself the second time around.  </li>
            <li>That would definitely save some time for busy gal like me.</li>
            <li>I barely had to squeeze the curler.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t tug or pinch at all and with most eyelash curlers they take out an eyelash or two every time (which again with thin eyelashes</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty similar to other lash curlers sold in drugstores.</li>
            <li>Not sure it works better than any other eyelash curler</li>
            <li>I have issues with curlers due to the shape of my eye and my eyelashes are ridiculously straight.</li>
            <li>and when I am trying to aim for a more dramatic look</li>
            <li>If you like the old Revlon curler with the white lash cushion, you will likely not like this curler.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a traditional curler of sanitary metal with a wide head and gentle arch.  </li>
            <li>This is my first pair of lace curlers and I was a little concern that they would hurt or would not work</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few tries I noticed a significant difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li>The pad on the curler was super hard</li>
            <li>It pulls and pinches far too much and curls very little.</li>
            <li>I have long lashes, so mascara usually leaves lovely black spots on my upper lid as soon as I open my eyes.</li>
            <li>I would have to angle it to curl the inner lashes then angle the other way to curl the outer lashes which pretty much left the center lashes uncurled.  </li>

            <li> I got mine at a reasonable price and it has been great!</li>
            <li> Nice curler for the price.</li>
            <li> It made my eyelashes look really nice even without applying mascara.</li>

            <li> I received this at a reduced price for an honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This is perfect, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> my own</li>
            <li> Despite the nice look and feel, I didn&#x27;t notice any curling with this tool.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a nice compromise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But nonetheless, it&#x27;s always nice to have</li>
            <li> It really was the best eyelash curler I have ever used</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried just about any kind of curler there is.  </li>
            <li> handles have a nice silicon padding so that your fingers don&#x27;t get sore</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a nice padding on the curler section.</li>
            <li> ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to have something that won&#x27;t pull out what remaining lashes I have.</li>
            <li> She, too, was thrilled with this tool and is ordering her own.  </li>
            <li> product is for an exchange for an unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This  is my own Honest review of product.  </li>
            <li> I love it already and the curl lasted a good while with mascara...</li>
            <li> It also leaves your lashes with a really nice curl.</li>
            <li> It is so quick and easy to use and curls my lashes perfectly every time.</li>
            <li> Worth it ladies!!!...</li>
            <li> The main focus of this curler is the fact that it wont pinch or tug and no matter the length of your lashes, it will leave you with perfect curls.</li>

            <li> I did receive this product for free but opinions expressed are my own!</li>
            <li> I own 4 lash curlers and always had a favorite, but now I have to honestly say Izy is going to be the one I use from now on.</li>

            <li> It was easy to use, good size, no issues with sticking or pulling out lashes -</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> curling is very easy, it doe NOT pinch at all and holds the curl all day, till I take off my mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a very strong hold on lashes and curls them in one turn.</li>

            <li> So far this is the best of all the three.</li>
            <li> Beautiful curl on the first go around.</li>
            <li> Ok, i&#x27;ve gotta be honest...</li>
            <li> The product itself is sturdy, ergonomic, and does a good job at curling the eyelash in a comfortable manner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been curling my lashes for YEARS and this one has, by far, the best cushion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this product lives up to it name and one of the best eyelash curlers I have owned so far.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look amazing and there was no pulling or tearing :)  </li>
            <li> Really loving the lifetime guarantee though; so I am not worried. :]</li>
            <li> I have not had any of my eyelash curlers hold a nice curl for more than 3 hours anyway</li>
            <li> By far, the best eye lash curler I had use.</li>
            <li> Received these very quickly!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So easy to use!</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t say its exceptional in any way but it works fine.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with how this amazing eyelash curl works.</li>
            <li> Great product and does a great job, super fast delivery</li>
            <li> I also love this product is not bulky very easy to take with you on the go</li>
            <li> Great product and very reasonably priced for the quality</li>
            <li> It worked great at first but broke about a month after I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I use it immediately after my mascara and works fine!</li>
            <li> Well packaged and very comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;Their</li>
            <li> So it very important for me to have a curler that will do it job.</li>

            <li> Make me more pretty :) make my eyelashes attractive.</li>
            <li> I was asked to review this product for free and it could not have come at a better time!</li>
            <li> Comfortable, easy to use and gives good curl</li>
            <li> need to add, very importantly, that you keep them curly and sexy.</li>
            <li> I love this curler.</li>
            <li> So much better than store purchase.  </li>
            <li> It works just as well or better than the more expensive/name brand ones I have used.</li>
            <li> I also really love the packaging, it&#x27;s so cute.  </li>
            <li> The Lovely Lashes eliminates the pinch and tagging, the curler doesn&#x27;t pull my lashes out.</li>
            <li> love the eyelast curlers...</li>
            <li> I have short lashes, so a curler that is able to do this is wonderful!</li>
            <li> the outcome is just lovely</li>
            <li> You will love this tool...</li>
            <li> I hope the replacement pads will be available to purchase soon!</li>
            <li> And I love the quality.</li>
            <li> i am officially in love with this curler.</li>
            <li> and I love the box it came in as well</li>
            <li> I wanted to contact the seller to see if I could get a replacement, but I wasn&#x27;t able to figure out how to get in touch with them.</li>
            <li> Lovely Lashes Curler</li>
            <li> Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler does just that for you.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re ok.</li>
            <li> So glad I found a quality curler that doesn&#x27;t cause my lashes to fall out.</li>
            <li> Well, i think i need a lot more practice and patience.  </li>
            <li> but I ordered another eyelash curler that works much better for my almond shaped eye and is better quality.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I love curled lashes</li>
            <li> Many eyelash curlers hurt, tug or squeeze.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask?</li>
            <li> this Lovely Lashes curler beats the others.</li>
            <li> This isn’t the best eyelash curler I’ve ever used, but better than the vast majority I’ve tried.</li>
            <li> There is more padding in the strip, which is</li>
            <li> I believe if I had different shaped eyes, they would be perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> In short, I like this curler, and it&#x27;s probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> works way better then</li>
            <li> The curl looked great  even without mascara or eyeliner and the curler was very sturdy (the curler I had before this one was flimsy).</li>
            <li> You have nothing to worry about with Lovely Lashes</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase more for gift basket fillers or stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> I could get a better one at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> My wife received this product for free, the review and opinions are her own.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> This truly does give you Lovely Lashes.</li>
            <li> and I look more awake than I sometimes feel!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I thought it was cute.  </li>
            <li> That’s important too!  </li>
            <li> This curler really worked great.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product!</li>
            <li> Im extremely glad I was chosen to review this product. :)</li>
            <li> I stopped using eyelash curlers because they always pinch and pull out eyelashes and it will stick to the pad however with this Lovely lashes eyelash curler it</li>
            <li> It definitely exceeded my expectations and is made of great quality!!</li>
            <li> and this one works better than the Revlon ever did.</li>
            <li> The last bonus is that you can still coat the lash line with eyeliner for that perfect line without damaging it or staining the pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works ok.</li>
            <li> This was not my favorite, but if I had nothing else, I&#x27;d use it.</li>
            <li> I received one for free to review, but my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> On top of that, I wear glasses</li>
            <li> Better quality then others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I do wish that it had more cushion strips</li>
            <li> I always assumed mascara would take care of everything but after using Lovely Lashes I have been proved wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lovely Lashes are great especially for a fairly beginner like me to using eyelash curlers.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to be extremely familiar with curlers to be able to use it!</li>
            <li> Through the years I have bought and thrown away more eyelash curlers than I care to count.</li>
            <li> This seems kind of cheaply made to me as well.</li>
            <li> It has a sharper curve than most eyelash curlers.  </li>
            <li> I bought a Revlon curler at the drug store which works better for me.</li>
            <li> The rubber peice at the top is wider than others</li>
            <li> also love that it comes with a replacement silicone refill pad.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work any better then any of the others I tried.</li>
            <li> Love how they don&#x27;t rugged on my lashes.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and love it.</li>
            <li> I noticed her lashes more after using the curler.</li>
            <li> so it was nice that it fit well.</li>
            <li> Just be prepared for all of the compliments!e sure to use the LLEC every day for three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler</li>
            <li> I really love this eyelash curler and the box</li>
            <li> and I was able to curl all of my lashes at once.</li>
            <li> So I was reluctant to order more</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and it grips the lashes pretty good to make nice curls.</li>
            <li> The first thing this lash curler did was pinch my skin...OUCH!!!  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to give to give this eye lash curler a shot.</li>

            <li> This is a very comfortable, easy to use eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast &amp; the product was amazing!</li>
            <li> seems to work pretty good</li>
            <li> At first it worked good</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take long to leave a great curl!</li>

            <li> I will preface this by saying that curling my eyelashes isn&#x27;t part of my normal beauty routine, however, I was very pleased with the results and was satisfied with the value of the product based on the price.</li>
            <li> It easy to use.</li>
            <li> The curve allowed me to get all corners of my eye covered in one grip, which allowed for easy, convenient curling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pinch easily, but you can still do it if you aren&#x27;t careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product, love the silicone white strips and I also like that they could be replaced.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how easy and efficient this curler is.  </li>

            <li> Works fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with finding an eyelash curler that would fit all my eyelashes at one time.</li>
            <li> I received these free to review</li>
            <li> Their product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t quite fit my eye shape.</li>
            <li> I went and bought a cheap one at the store and threw this away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and works for any eye shape  </li>
            <li> Tried to adjust it but&lt;br /&gt;it wouldn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> This is a comfortable eyelash curler, and my lashes have yet to stick and get pulled out.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or flimsy.</li>
            <li> The scissor movement is nice and smooth, and it gives a nice curl.&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is the white cushion pad, which makes it easier to see your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the pad,</li>
            <li> so your fingers can fit comfortably.  </li>
            <li> The movements were smooth with no hitches.  </li>
            <li> Works great, I had to replace my Revlon curler that I had for several years</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fantastic</li>
            <li> An eyelash curler can make or break a look, that is why it is important to have one that you are comfortable using.</li>
            <li> Not to mention they are fantastic to use.</li>
            <li> Works well but doesn&#x27;t fit my eye shape</li>
            <li> The curler is light weight</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of durability, the LLEC feels durable and is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The curler fit my eye</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I always struggled to find one that fit correctly and one that wouldn&#x27;t pull my eyelashes out.</li>
            <li> Fits my lashes in comfortably and does not rip my eyelashes out.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is OK, but not even nearly as good as Shu Emura - seems like every time I try to save money and try a different product, I lose.</li>
            <li> I love a good curled eye lash but can never seem to actually pull it off!.</li>
            <li> Now, to be very honest this is the second eyelash curler ever.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy and</li>
            <li> I really loved this Eyelash Curler by Izy Trends; not only is this extremely easy to use, but it is really comfortable when using.  </li>
            <li> I was just feeling a bit braver and ambitious and when I had the opportunity to give Lovely Lashes a test drive I went for it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my product today</li>
            <li> If you are interested in looking at more reviews you can check out the product here:</li>
            <li> The packaging is super cute with a barbie like doll on it and since Pink is my favorite color it made the packaging more appealing to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Not until recently did I realize how important having a good eyelash curler was.</li>
            <li> Someone who is looking to spend a bit more than your cheap curlers, but not as much as the fancy high-end ones.</li>
            <li> Love this Eyelash Curler, simple yet totally effective.  </li>
            <li> the curler is clean</li>
            <li> The silicone does attract dust and particles, so store it in an airtight and clean</li>
            <li> If you are going to use it after you apply your mascara, clean the tip before redoing it again and after you are finish.</li>
            <li> I loved receiving this item in its adorable pink box.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, easy to clean and curls my eyelashes really well.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> nothing special.</li>
            <li> and I tried it right away!</li>
            <li> It is an amazing eyelash curler, and will now be a staple in my professional makeup collection at work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thankful to have finally found one that is of good quality.</li>
            <li> but I was not blessed with natural curls of any kind.</li>
            <li> The quality is good and I like that it comes with an extra pad, but it just didn&#x27;t work for my eyelid shape.</li>
            <li> my full review at maegal .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of lash curlers since I&#x27;ve never found one that fits properly, but I really loved this one.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used curlers very often, so I have no idea how many additional pads I would need, or how often they should be changed.</li>
            <li> Having poked myself in the eye more times than I care to remember, this is a real bonus.  </li>
            <li> I get the more straight my eyelashes seem to grow</li>
            <li> It really did give my daughter lovely lashes..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, just not for my tiny eyes.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a curler for my lashes to make a full curl.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many different ones but they always pinched or just didn&#x27;t fit my eye</li>
            <li> ; don&#x27;t think it was any better than cheaper store brands but not worse, either.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good curler</li>
            <li> I really loved that I was able to fit all my eyelashes through the opening because I&#x27;ve used some curlers in the past</li>
            <li> I love this curler way more than the one I was using, it will definitely be my go to lash tool from here on out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and just a wonderful all round purchase.</li>
            <li> Overall this isn&#x27;t the best eyelash curler out there, the one I&#x27;m currently using is tweezerman</li>
            <li> works super well, doesnt squeeze pinch or hurt.</li>
            <li> results were still the same (all three work about equally as far as what my eyelashes look like in the end), but getting there was more pleasant.</li>
            <li> Even my teen daughter was impressed that she &amp;#34;could actually see&amp;#34; my eyelashes!  </li>
            <li> Was shipped quickly and packaged well as well.</li>
            <li> But again, most of all my favorite part is that I finally have a curler that doesn&#x27;t pinch and pull my lashes.</li>
            <li> I normally just use mascara to darken them, but I often wish they had more curl.</li>
            <li> I bought this item at a promotional price for a review but this eyelash curler is definitely worth the full price.</li>
            <li> When my favorite eyelash curler broke, I went in search of a new one.</li>
            <li> Pretty much what I expect from an eyelash curler :)</li>
            <li> No painful pulling of lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Extra nice thing is the extra replacemnt pad that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;Happy customer!</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler really does do an excellent job at producing pretty, natural-looking curves with as little discomfort as could be possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pad is very soft and allowed some give with I think helped to achieve a better curl.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Works much better than my old eyelash curler and the curl lasts longer!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product but only if you love your lashes!</li>
            <li> They really work and do what they say they will do!!</li>
            <li> Will purchase again in the future for sure!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used an eyelash curler that a) didn&#x27;t pinch, b) didn&#x27;t pull out any lashes, and c) WORKED!  </li>
            <li> Most curlers are much too large for me.</li>
            <li> Great item, not cheaply made ..</li>
            <li> The curler fit my lashes really conveniently.</li>
            <li> Bright pink</li>
            <li> All round great product</li>
            <li> I read somewhere to hit it with the hair dryer for a second to warm it and thats been working well too.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> Good Quality just as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> eye lash curler was surprisingly simple and effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this eyelash curler for maybe a week, but I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I only wear my own lashes</li>
            <li> curler does a nice job of curling my lashes, getting them all in at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I received the Lovely Lashes eyelash curler today and is pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> She also used it, and even though she has beautiful long and lush eyelashes anyway,  using this curler</li>
            <li> I am surprised by so many 5 star reviews but again, maybe it&#x27;s the shape of my eye</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth it for the curl you get.</li>
            <li> It looks and feel very nice, while I&#x27;ve had a lot of experience with eyelash curlers that just fall apart after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I read other good reviews, so</li>
            <li> Product was shipped right away.  </li>
            <li> And I was right</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> I tried right after I received it</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all right.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d easily recommend this to any beginner-curler, teens who like experimenting with new make-up tools, and anyone who needs a convenient eye lash curler that does</li>
            <li> My lashes do look genuinely fuller and longer after using this, and very girl deserves to feel pretty.  </li>
            <li> I had pretty much quit using eyelash curlers because I couldn&#x27;t find one that fit my eye.  </li>
            <li> I wondered what could be so special about an eyelash curler that would make one any different from the next, but I did find that this was more comfortable and easy to use--</li>
            <li> They are very easy and simple to use!</li>
            <li> I admit my first thought was that they might be a little cheap because they were so light, but when I looked them over, the materials are good quality and it was just that my old lash curlers were so bulky!</li>
            <li> Absolutely NOTHING special.  </li>
            <li> She took to it with no problems and her long lashes looked amazing.</li>
            <li> I love the cute little &amp;#34;Lovely Lashes&amp;#34; detail on the curler.</li>
            <li> I saw the difference right away with my first eye done.</li>
            <li> No pinching and great fit to prevent broken lash hairs.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how easy it was and</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use the product and that there was no pain at all.  </li>
            <li> - I made sure my lashes were clean and dry.  </li>
            <li> You can feel it really picking up your eyelashes and giving them a quick curl.</li>
            <li> The soft silicone pad is easy on the lashes and a spare is included.  </li>
            <li> sure your eyelashes are clean and dry</li>
            <li> Super Fast Shipping..</li>
            <li> Works very very well.</li>
            <li> Comes with extra white rubber pad which is very nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple to use with a compact design, white easy to see pad, good grip, never pinches skin, easy to get a good curl that lasts, and not crazy expensive.</li>
            <li> Works good but does tug a little.</li>
            <li> It fits all my eyelashes at once and curls them with the first try.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with an extra pad.</li>
            <li> It makes it look like I have fake eyelashes, as they are so perfectly curled!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are much more noticeable now and that helps since I have blonde lashes ;D</li>
            <li> It is the first one i have ever had</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Curled my lashes very well!</li>
            <li> Love the extra pad</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely put this on my favorite beauty tools list.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no pinch, no pulling, just pretty curled lashes.</li>
            <li> I love that this comes with extra padding to replace your pads if need be.</li>
            <li> I even received a compliment (from a student) on my eyelashes the first day I used it!&lt;br /&gt;(Great</li>
            <li> , thanks!</li>
            <li> Give me the lift I want and has changed my overall look, for the better of course.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Additionally the package comes with an extra silicone pad, which I was pleased to see included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also love that it comes with a refill pad for future use.</li>
            <li> , cute enough I plan to keep it and use it to store away my curler.</li>
            <li> Pretty straight-forward eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> When i first got this eyelash curler (about 5 months ago)</li>
            <li> - I use this first and my eyes look more open and mascara added</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with an extra silicon piece.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used drugstore curlers in the past and this one ranks at the top, much better than my makeup catalog one.</li>
            <li> I got really pretty results with it</li>
            <li> and it really curls your lashes!</li>
            <li> It came in a cute box and an extra curling pad.</li>
            <li> I was really amazed!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Better than any eyelash curler you buy locally.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use an eye lashes curler as from my previews experiences with eye lashes curler, if i don&#x27;t pinch a skin, i get my lashes pull out!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The LLEC includes a spare strip should anything happen to the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage</li>
            <li> An eyelash curler is definitely something that I want to keep in my arsenal, so I made sure to use the LLEC every day for three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The curl on both eyes was consistent and even, so I didn’t have to worry about a lopsided look.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> Lovely Lash Eyelash Curler is a solid product that is constructed well and performs exactly as promised.</li>

            <li> Lovely Lash Eyelash Curler is a solid product that is constructed well and performs exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> Shipping was sooo fast too!</li>
            <li> I initially bought a super cheap one at the grocery store and that was a mistake.</li>
            <li> I wear makeup maybe once a year, more often if there is a wedding or other special event.</li>
            <li> The shape of it lies against your eyelid a little differently (flatter) than others that I&#x27;ve tried, which is cool because of the great curl you get from that, but will take some getting used to for me.</li>
            <li> My lids are more flat, so that&#x27;s why they didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> You would think an eyelash curler is an eyelash curler and one would work about as well as all the others, and I have purchased many others in the past, all with the same fair results.  </li>
            <li> I have a 22 year old and a 16 year old girl who BOTH love this product.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve had a lot of friends who use curlers regularly, and I guess I thought it was only fair</li>
            <li> While the extra rubber pad is a nice touch, it is small and potentially VERY easy to lose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While the extra rubber pad is a nice touch, it is small and potentially VERY easy to lose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> easy and simply to use</li>
            <li> I barely use any pressure and my eyelashes are high and curly very quickly.</li>
            <li> Unlike others I have used, it doesn&#x27;t pinch or tug, and I can be certain of a pain-free experience.</li>
            <li> I grew up as a tomboy, and to a certain degree, I still am one.</li>
            <li> As for the structure of the curler, it is very much the classic style.</li>
            <li> She told me also to say that if you are looking for the extra pad for the curler it is snapped on the handle which she said is nice because now she will not loose it.  </li>
            <li> A good product for the women or girl in your life who wants more of a curl to her eyelashes - an extra silicon pad is included and this is an item you will pass down to your girls it is build to last -</li>
            <li> The claim that this eyelash curler will work on any type of eyelashes has definitely proved to be an accurate statement.</li>
            <li> Really gets the eyelash and mine</li>
            <li> the real deal is the how these curlers work</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter, but I might take it, it works very well.</li>
            <li> that would only fit 1/2 of my eyelashes at once.  </li>
            <li> Packaged in a cute pink box.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> i simply just took them off and the inside was still smooth.</li>
            <li> It is very well made</li>
            <li> Plus I use eye mascara and that really helps to accentuate the curls.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyelids and its curl my lashes very well</li>
            <li> I feel much prettier if I have curled eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Curls very well without pinching</li>
            <li> Thanks IZy Trends</li>
            <li> I’ve been keeping this one in my bathroom cabinet so I can use it every morning because it really gives me that bright-eyed</li>
            <li> I will say that the design feels very sturdy, and it did not pinch or pull my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast to...</li>
            <li> (if it does I will update the review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the curler is a very light-weight metal, with silicone grips on the curler itself.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> do they make the after version so much nicer.</li>
            <li> The one in the picture looks really neat</li>
            <li> Very affordable, very efficient.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t need as much mascara to hold the curl as I do with others.</li>
            <li> and I immediately looked more alert and wide</li>
            <li> I really like this eyelash curler...</li>
            <li> I did receive this product free, but this review is entirely my thoughts and feelings on this product.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t curl my lashes they are sticking straight out no matter what mascara I</li>
            <li> I was very excited.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but these are the absolute cutest.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> - it doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> Okay so I never really knew the importance of curling your lashes.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I have unusual eyes, but I would not recommend this item.  </li>
            <li> Although it did curl my straight eyelashes fantastically.</li>
            <li> it really worked well of curling my eye lashes</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It weighs in at 0.8 ounces (22 grams) and has a solid construction at the joints that appear to be able to withstand frequent use.</li>
            <li> It has small rubber handles, which allow for easy and accurate use of the curler.</li>
            <li> One other thing that impressed me was the cushions for the curler, they are soft but firm, unlike some curlers where they feel like you are crimping your eyelashes between to bricks.</li>
            <li> Better then any other eyelash curler ive used.</li>
            <li> First impression: I love the little box it was packaged in.</li>
            <li> I usually have problems with eyelash curlers pulling on my eyelashes, but this one did nothing but magic!</li>
            <li> The curler I bought to replace it (don&#x27;t remember what my original brand had been) was too big for my eye socket.  </li>
            <li> I could not believe I was having such fun playing with my lashes!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product, and I am so glad I spent the money to buy this.</li>
            <li> I like this eyelash curler, it was easy to use and made my lashes look very long.  </li>
            <li> Whether you eschew mascara due to cost or because of a health issue like I have, the Lovely Lash Eyelash Curler will enable you to have eyelashes that will bring attention to your beautiful eyes without the price tag of expensive eye-related cosmetics.</li>

            <li> Completely above expectations, soft, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 17yr old daughter as her first eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> However, as I&#x27;ve aged (I&#x27;m 50), my lashes seem more sparse and not as long and full as they once were, so when the opportunity to try this product came along</li>
            <li> Its an okay product, but not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I was able to curl every eyelash, even down to the corners of my eye, with no discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> I was able to curl every eyelash, even down to the corners of my eye, with no discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> Well these new ones do not pinch!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a super cosmetic pro, I love wearing make-up-</li>
            <li> I stopped using eyelash curlers for many years after a couple black eyes from pinching.  </li>
            <li> This particular curler did not hurt.</li>
            <li> older</li>
            <li> squeeze the handle and hold steady for 5-10 seconds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like most women I know I have tried countless eye lash curlers, they seem to always pinch my skin and for some reason I can never seem to curl my left set of eye lashes!</li>
            <li> So when I was asked to review the Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler (or LLEC, for short), I figured that I would give it a try, just to do something different.</li>
            <li> I am very picky on what I use now after learning my lesson the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was the inscription Lovely Lashes on the eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> Lovely Lashes Curler has a long base and the finger holes are set the perfect length apart.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> had high hopes for this eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> last and only other curler I owned was not half as effective or comfortable to use as this curler.</li>
            <li> The LLEC cleaned up easily with no stains or other residue; I didn’t even need water at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The LLEC cleaned up easily with no stains or other residue; I didn’t even need water at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to manage and use, Love the fact it glides smoothly, unlike other curler I tried its hard and you need to put on extra effort.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be just another claim at a great eyelash curler, but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I tried a few more times and still saw no results.  </li>
            <li> The shipping also seems to be pretty fast, so that is definitely a plus!</li>
            <li> so maybe this is normal.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical but pretty good at curling my lashes lived it</li>
            <li> Just make sure to follow instructions and don&#x27;t put it too far down.</li>
            <li> I could have spent less and gotten just as good an eyelash curler</li>
            <li> I have posted a picture of my lashes without the curler on the left and after using on curler on the right</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler works great and doesn&#x27;t pull at your lashes like other brands that I have purchased in the past</li>
            <li> The handles have a rubber insert along the inside of the loops so that your fingers and thumb do not press against the bare metal (which many other brands do, sometimes leaving a mark).</li>
            <li> would recommend this curler to anyone who is looking to try out a new curler.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to those who are looking for a new eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I discarded my eyelash curler of some 15 years before purchasing a new one and what a mistake that turned out to be.  </li>
            <li> Eyelashes seem to be new thing now a days</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the quality of this item (though it isn&#x27;t anything special, either), however, unlike most other reviewers, this doesn&#x27;t fit my eye shape.  </li>
            <li> Time and time again ive tried different eyelash curlers and this is one of my absolute favorites!</li>
            <li> I do have almond shaped eyes, but they are not small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been dealing with my old bulky curler that sometimes required me to curl twice because I couldn&#x27;t get all my lashes in!  </li>
            <li> Naturally, that&#x27;s not the look I want!</li>
            <li> so far I normally have problems with curlers taking my eyelashes</li>
            <li> Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler by Izy Trends, in terms of function, is no different than other eyelash curlers on the market.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler, I have very thin short eyelashes</li>
            <li> This curler really makes it easy to get to the inner corners of the lashes which was the problem with my previous curler.</li>
            <li> For this price, I was expecting something a little more, but this is no better than a  cheaply made drugstore brand eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> i was extremely skeptical at first because eyelash curlers are very tricky for me to love or even just like.</li>
            <li> She is a teen who is starting to want to wear make up, but  always wants to make her eyes look pretty.  </li>
            <li> I was able to curl the lashes in the insides of my eyes, towards my nose, and then in the middle, but then it cut off my lashes half way through them at the outer corners of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Hands down, this one wins!</li>
            <li> Finally, the lower half of the press that is used to curl the lashes is lined with a rubber strip that helps the lashes to curl more gently (as opposed to eyelash curlers that have only metal, which can sometimes damage the hairs).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little surprised there&#x27;s only a cushion on the bottom, and not one on the top as well, but it works well, nonetheless.</li>
            <li> have a disease called Sjogrën’s Syndrome, which is basically a more severe form of dry eye (as well as other mucous membranes).</li>
            <li> Also, I get an actual rounded curl and not a squared off angular curl with my lashes sticking straight up.</li>
            <li> It is well made and works very well at curling my pathetically short eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Neither of them will use there old ones ever again.</li>
            <li> It definitely added some curl to my rather straight lashes.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> It comfortably curls my eyelashes without missing lashes or pinching my eyelid.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any issues with this one so far (I&#x27;ve used it three times since I got it).</li>
            <li> am always scared to put things near m eye</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt and it is because of soft rubber pad that is on the curler.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough to be confident about how long it holds a curl, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be horribly long.</li>
            <li> I also appreciated that it came with an extra rubber eyelash protector.</li>
            <li> and I was so surprised at</li>
            <li> The pad is soft and doesn&#x27;t hurt or feel like it&#x27;s pulling.</li>
            <li> The handle has soft grips which is comfort for your fingers as you squeeze the curler.  </li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a extra silicone pad that you can change once the other one gets old and gross!</li>
            <li> With the Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler there is no more pinching!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it came with that because they get dirty pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I was presented with the opportunity to review the Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler and I have now realized why I was using the wrong one this whole time!</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m pretty bummed that it lasted me such a short time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it is about having such cute eyelash curlers</li>
            <li> But it is a little pricey at full listed price.</li>
            <li> My old eyelash curler was on its last strings and I was way overdue for a new curler.</li>
            <li> Compared to my other curler, the Lovely Lashes has a soft pad design with black rubber grip handle that allows my finger to squeeze it with comfort.</li>
            <li> Very affordable and works well on my not so long lashes.</li>
            <li> Especially if your planning on dressing up just curling your eye lashes &amp; adding a little massacre can make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I feel like it protects my lashes better and pulls less than the rubber inserts used in other brands.</li>
            <li> This one, on the other hand, covers my entire eye and makes for a quick beautifying touch-up in one swift curl of the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was looking for a new one for quite some time as all I could find in the store was a plastic one that actually pinched my eyelid skin.  </li>
            <li> I do feel like this eyelash curler will last for a very long time, as I can replace the pad when the first one displays wear.  </li>
            <li> I did pinch myself with it the first time i used it because i put it to far down on my lashes!  </li>
            <li> I guess mine was a defective one because I had barely used it.</li>
            <li> but apparently I do.</li>
            <li> just can&#x27;t enhance what I barely have.</li>
            <li> I never spent--</li>
            <li> and I nearly injured myself the second time around.  </li>
            <li> That would definitely save some time for busy gal like me.</li>
            <li> I barely had to squeeze the curler.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t tug or pinch at all and with most eyelash curlers they take out an eyelash or two every time (which again with thin eyelashes</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty similar to other lash curlers sold in drugstores.</li>
            <li> Not sure it works better than any other eyelash curler</li>
            <li> I have issues with curlers due to the shape of my eye and my eyelashes are ridiculously straight.</li>
            <li> and when I am trying to aim for a more dramatic look</li>
            <li> If you like the old Revlon curler with the white lash cushion, you will likely not like this curler.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a traditional curler of sanitary metal with a wide head and gentle arch.  </li>
            <li> This is my first pair of lace curlers and I was a little concern that they would hurt or would not work</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few tries I noticed a significant difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li> The pad on the curler was super hard</li>
            <li> It pulls and pinches far too much and curls very little.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes, so mascara usually leaves lovely black spots on my upper lid as soon as I open my eyes.</li>
            <li> I would have to angle it to curl the inner lashes then angle the other way to curl the outer lashes which pretty much left the center lashes uncurled.  </li>
            <li> The first two ones gave up on me after few tries.</li>
            <li> so it hit my eyebrow area eye pretty hard.  </li>
            <li> Study product that is gonna last a long time for these two divas.</li>
            <li> and review-- I only wish I would have purchased one long ago.  </li>
            <li> It is well made, and my lashes last all day long.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, very straight eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> il try to look for one that sells refills,as i don&#x27;t want to waste 20 bucks each month for a new curler.</li>
            <li> There are a few reasons this one is my new favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> curls last a very long time.</li>
            <li> When I would use my old eyelash curler, my lashes would get stuck every time no matter how little pressure I would use.</li>
            <li> are far and few..</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes look so long.</li>
            <li> As I opened the pink box, I found the eyelash curler and an extra pad.  </li>
            <li> The store brands that didn&#x27;t work for me measured 1 1/2 inches wide and 1/2 deep.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has been curling her lashes all day long.  </li>
            <li> I have long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thin short eyelashes and</li>
            <li> I. I like the extra pads to keep down on possible infections from longtime use.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other eyelash curlers, this one actually grabs all the lashes.</li>
            <li> so much better than an expensive name brand one i bought!</li>
            <li> Due to the lack of tension in the handles it simply does not curl like it did.  </li>
            <li> after they actually all fell out years ago due to some fertility drugs.  </li>
            <li> And believe me when I say, this curler works better than the expensive ones!</li>
            <li> and it caught just about every single hair including the little tiny ones on the inner corners(and</li>
            <li> I usually have to at least use mascara to get full results, but this one its optional.</li>
            <li> It pulls out 2-3 lashes every single time I use it.</li>
            <li> So while I don’t wear makeup, when I do I am limited in what I can use.</li>
            <li> When I was able to use it , it pinched was very uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I have really short stubborn lashes that fall down all the time.</li>
            <li> My answer to that problem is possibly placing the eyelash curler and extra pad in a small pouch or container that I could put in on my vanity.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several different eyelash curlers in the past.</li>
            <li> I think maybe the one I received wasn&#x27;t aligned properly which made curling my eyelashes pretty difficult.</li>
            <li> The product did make my lashes look a little longer and appear fuller without my having to apply multiple coast of mascara to achieve the look.  </li>
            <li> not too wide either.</li>
            <li> You don’t want fingers slipping and sliding</li>
            <li> I placed my lashes in the curler and closed.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Either its too big or it destroy your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I expected from this curler.  </li>
            <li> They operate by inserting your finger and thumb into the handles; spread the arms apart to open the guillotine-style press that curls your eyelashes, and pinch the handles together to bring the base of the curler up to the top metal portion, closing the guillotine and pressing your eyelashes into a curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The soft pad design with rubber grim handles also makes this very easy to curl my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the only issue i had with this product were the little rubbers where you place your fingers!</li>
            <li> They curl your lashes nicely no matter if you have short, medium, or long ones!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought tons of eyelash curlers from beauty supply stores over the past several months.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to keep trying to realign it like I do with my other two.</li>
            <li> It makes it stand out from some of the other eyelash curlers I have seen.</li>
            <li> Preforms as expected!</li>
            <li> Other curlers I have used</li>
            <li> Straight forward-I have thin and pale eyelashes.</li>
            <li> have used some curlers that are hard to open and close.  </li>
            <li> Average.  </li>
            <li> While these still look a bit scary they really worked well after I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> The problem is that they are mostly straight and faint.</li>
            <li> I know everyone had at least one of those curlers that just don’t work properly.</li>
            <li> Completely not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get the tool to the base of my lashes and squeezed for 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li> but they point down</li>
            <li> One side of the curler slides up so half of my lashes don&#x27;t get curled.</li>
            <li> The typical problem I have with eyelash curler is it hurts when I use it.</li>
            <li> all in all i am shocked with the quality of this product because the box makes it looks cheap and just a waste of money BUT TRUST ME</li>
            <li> This curler has slightly changed my opinion of that.</li>
            <li> This one looks like every typical eyelash curler you can buy for way less then this one.</li>
            <li> The handles are outlined with black rubber</li>
            <li> I curl close to the lid then again about half way out</li>
            <li> Maybe I have an odd eye shape.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s odd.  </li>
            <li> The previous eyelash curler I was using never pinched my skin like that</li>
            <li> however this eyelash curler did not take out a single eyelash and I&#x27;ve been using it for the past few days.</li>
            <li> This was really awkward to use and the first rubber insert immediately fell apart and had to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I have used other eyelash curlers in the past and I always seem to pinch myself with them.  </li>
            <li> This is quality and reminds me of the one my mom had when I was little.</li>
            <li> a little aggravated</li>
            <li> but they all pinch a little sometime.</li>
            <li> it does pinch a little</li>
            <li> It can pinch a little if you put it too close to your eyelid</li>
            <li> It sometimes does pinch, but just a little adjusting and no problem at all.</li>
            <li> As soon as i received the curler i ran down stairs and curled my lashes!</li>
            <li> I just had to get it in my head that they weren&#x27;t meant to be cozy bunnies they were a &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; to use just as you would a make-up brush or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it was never comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Made well, not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It takes a few minutes to achieve the look</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t yet, but we shall see here in a few weeks if that becomes an issue</li>
            <li> I know, you’re thinking that not important</li>
            <li> It takes a few times to keep the curl.</li>
            <li> I had never had this problem before I decided it was time to update all my make up tools a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I thought my spare piece was missing</li>
            <li> Will update the review in a few months to see how this product holds up.</li>
            <li> I had a bit of trouble getting it on my eyes</li>
            <li> I curl my eyelashes everyday when applying my makeup for work.</li>
            <li> (I do makeup on the side), as well as for everyday makeup.</li>
            <li> , I had trouble with getting all of my lashes curled at once.</li>
            <li> I have not used an eyelash curler in quite a few years.</li>
            <li> My other complaint is that the silicone pad would pop out sometimes.</li>
            <li> So 5 stars for this product becase this teenager is not easy to please...</li>
            <li> This curler measures approximately 1 3/8 inch wide with the curve being approximately 3/8 inch deep.  </li>
            <li> Now my sister, she of the thick dark (where did those come from?)</li>
            <li> for what ever reason my eye was too small for this.</li>
            <li> this is not okay)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eyelash curlers in the past for years and this has never happened to me.</li>
            <li> but I am disappointed that it broke, especially after only 1 week of usage.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like curling my lashes because it hurts.</li>
            <li> I never thought I had an unusually small eye socket</li>
            <li> And they are also backed by a 100% guarantee if you&#x27;re not satisfied with them for any reason.</li>
            <li> I usually hold it for 15 to 20 seconds</li>
            <li> I was disappointed after reading the positive reviews about the curler.</li>
            <li> I got this to review for my blog and thought it would be hard for me to use since I have never used an eyelash curler in my life.</li>
            <li> The rubber parts on this curler is what makes it a bit of a shoddy product..</li>
            <li> Translation: it sucks.</li>
            <li> On the negative side, I fear they may attract pet hair and dust.</li>
            <li> I have a place to put it but am always afraid of losing tiny pieces.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t curl, the plastic where you place he eyelashes is too thick.</li>
            <li> have thick lashes</li>
            <li> hard to use, very small for fingers &amp; eyes</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull my lashes at all which I have had problems with in the past when it came to eyelash curlers!</li>
            <li> Honestly, don&#x27;t waste your time!!</li>
            <li> I was afraid to use an eyelash curler after seeing a girl on youtube use one incorrectly, but my friends have nagged me to get one for so long, so when I found this deal, it was a no brainer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So needless to say for the small amount of money this curler cost</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve recently noticed that it&#x27;s already coming apart. :(</li>
            <li> Then unfortunately after using for 1 week something snapped when I was compressing the handles and there was no more tension in the curler anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been tough finding an eyelash curler that works for me.</li>
            <li> it lasted almost 2 years, but now it&#x27;s broken</li>
            <li> Have you ever had your eye pinched by a poorly made eyelash curler?</li>
            <li> and I am addicted.  </li>
            <li> that is ridiculous to me!</li>
            <li> I have had issues with other lash curlers where my lashes will get stuck in the corner where the eyelid piece connects to the base</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t spend money on really expensive ones</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry you purchased</li>
            <li> they come out looking weird and crinkly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but I am not a fan of this eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> And when it comes to eye lash curlers, I&#x27;m fearful and extremely inexperienced.</li>
            <li> and I got the cheapo fake one.</li>
            <li> This is useless.</li>
            <li> The curve doesn&#x27;t work with my eyelashes, it pinches, &amp; it&#x27;s freakin&#x27; useless.</li>
            <li> and it was a scary experience</li>
            <li> It did not meet up to the 100% satisfaction guaranteed unfortunately.</li>
            <li> However, I was not able to reach the base of my eyelashes all the way across my eye.  </li>
            <li> I am always afraid of the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I give up my fear of stabbing myself in the eye and try to use these darn things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a result, any type of mascara, eye liner, or eye shadow getting into my eyes is bad juju.</li>
            <li> While it isn’t painful, it does require getting used to positioning the curler so that it grabs just the eyelashes without pulling on your eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> While it isn’t painful, it does require getting used to positioning the curler so that it grabs just the eyelashes without pulling on your eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I cannot say that I am disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> the curler to the base of the lashes but not over the skin</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate it!  </li>
            <li> This is a horrible eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m terrible at putting make-up on.</li>
            <li> Pulling your eyelashes is the worst feeling one could have sometimes</li>
            <li> and ohh it was just a dreadful time.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great! I read somewhere to hit it with the hair dryer for a second to warm it and thats been working well too.&lt;br /&gt;Its fairly easy to use and seems to grab all the eyelashes. Doesn&#x27;t crimp. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic. No pinching. Pretty much what I expect from an eyelash curler :)</li>
            <li> I have had problems with finding an eyelash curler that would fit all my eyelashes at one time. I have tried all of the retail/drug stores brands and always had the same issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyelasher it&#x27;s the best! It fits all my eyelashes at once and curls them with the first try. It makes them look fuller, and I can curl them even after I apply mascara without losing some eyelashes on the way. I love that it comes with an extra pad. Overall very happy with how this amazing eyelash curl works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been curling my lashes for years without any problems.  My japonesque curler broke and I bought this one based on the good reviews.  I hate it!  It pulls out 2-3 lashes every single time I use it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. It works like a charm and gives me picture perfect lashes each and every time. Unlike others I have used, it doesn&#x27;t pinch or tug, and I can be certain of a pain-free experience. It makes it look like I have fake eyelashes, as they are so perfectly curled! It fits all your lashes at once into it, so you don&#x27;t have to do it in stages. Quick and easy and perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this curler!!</li>
            <li> Great product and does a great job, super fast delivery</li>
            <li> I have used other eyelash curlers in the past and I always seem to pinch myself with them.  And it was never comfortable.  With the Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler there is no more pinching!  The soft pad design with rubber grim handles also makes this very easy to curl my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have issues where my eyelashes curl towards my eye and cause irritation.  This solves my problem by curling my eye lashes the way they are supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler, hands down! It is so quick and easy to use and curls my lashes perfectly every time. Until I got this curler to review, I thought my gold Revlon curler was the best, but it has nothing on this Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler. It doesn&#x27;t require much pressure to get a good curl, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes. Also, I get an actual rounded curl and not a squared off angular curl with my lashes sticking straight up. I love this thing! Whenever it stops working or gets worn out, I&#x27;ll definitely get another one! Highly recommended to anyone seeking those perfectly curled lashes!</li>
            <li> I like it- needed a replacement curler and it does the job. Wouldn&#x27;t say its exceptional in any way but it works fine.</li>
            <li> I love this curler. Time and time again ive tried different eyelash curlers and this is one of my absolute favorites! This no pinching and tugging. The curl stands the test of time basically! LOL. its really effective!</li>
            <li> So much better than store purchase.  Really gets the eyelash and mine are far and few.. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> got this eye lash curler today, i used it without mascara and with mascara, worked great both ways! i loved that it didnt hurt my eye lid like others have, made a very flirty curl. def has space and room for all of your eye lashes, i would def buy this product again!</li>
            <li> for what ever reason my eye was too small for this. Every time I tried it I was pinching either the out corner or the inner corner of my lid skin. Ugh. I do have almond shaped eyes, but they are not small so I don&#x27;t get it. Probably go with Tweezerman again or a regular drug store brand.</li>
            <li> Great quality eye lash curler. It is well made and works very well at curling my pathetically short eye lashes. It works just as well or better than the more expensive/name brand ones I have used.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Was looking for a new one for quite some time as all I could find in the store was a plastic one that actually pinched my eyelid skin.  This is quality and reminds me of the one my mom had when I was little. Excellent!</li>
            <li> Well packaged and very comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;Their claim of a no pinch product seems to be holding up. I caught a bit of skin and it didn&#x27;t hurt or cause me to tear up.&lt;br /&gt;The curl is incredible too! I love this curler way more than the one I was using, it will definitely be my go to lash tool from here on out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached a before and after shot.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complementary in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler!  It works great and doesn&#x27;t pull or pinch your eyelashes. Beautiful results everytime.</li>
            <li> I loved receiving this item in its adorable pink box. The eyelash curler is sturdy and comes with a white refill. It fit over my eye perfect, not too curled like some other eyelash curlers. This is definitely something I have been using often and I can tell such a difference. My eyelashes are much more noticeable now and that helps since I have blonde lashes ;D</li>
            <li> I received these free to review and I&#x27;m so glad I did! I admit my first thought was that they might be a little cheap because they were so light, but when I looked them over, the materials are good quality and it was just that my old lash curlers were so bulky! These have the perfect curve to them so you can get all your eye lashes in!  I was surprised how easy it was and a little aggravated I&#x27;d been dealing with my old bulky curler that sometimes required me to curl twice because I couldn&#x27;t get all my lashes in!  The leave a beautiful curl and no &amp;#34;denting&amp;#34; like some curlers do.  Even came with an extra lash pad! I would definitely recommend these!</li>
            <li> Awesome!!  I have a 22 year old and a 16 year old girl who BOTH love this product. Easy to use, does not clump their lashes, and the curl stays all day!!  Study product that is gonna last a long time for these two divas. Neither of them will use there old ones ever again. It even heals up for a bridal party of six and all the girls wanted to know where we got it!!  Great product and very reasonably priced for the quality</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 17yr old daughter as her first eyelash curler. She took to it with no problems and her long lashes looked amazing. She&#x27;s thrilled and so am I. I like the extra pads to keep down on possible infections from longtime use.</li>
            <li> Works great - easy to use and it does what it promises and how many products actually can say that is true?  A good product for the women or girl in your life who wants more of a curl to her eyelashes - an extra silicon pad is included and this is an item you will pass down to your girls it is build to last -</li>
            <li> I received this product for testing review purposes.&lt;br /&gt; I am really impressed with the Lovely Lashes Eyelash curler. They are not flimsy at all and give my lashes a lifted and curled effect. The packaging is super cute with a barbie like doll on it and since Pink is my favorite color it made the packaging more appealing to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;But the real deal is the how these curlers work and they prove to be sturdy and get a good clamp on my lashes without any pain at all. I saw the difference right away with my first eye done. I also included a picture of my results.</li>
            <li> I like this eyelash curler, it was easy to use and made my lashes look very long.  It is the first one i have ever had and i figured it out easily,  I did pinch myself with it the first time i used it because i put it to far down on my lashes!  lesson learned!</li>
            <li> Legitimately does not pull eye lashes! The best eyelash curler I have ever used. I didn&#x27;t even realize I was curling them. A DREAM!!!</li>
            <li> The best curler ever! I used Shu uemura&#x27;s, Tweezerman and Laura Mercier&#x27;s..But this one is the best!!&lt;br /&gt;I;m an asian and a fan of smokey makeup so eyelash curler and mascara are all time must have items.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me. order this.. it would be your best friend ever...!</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler was exactly what I wanted! It&#x27;s simple to use with a compact design, white easy to see pad, good grip, never pinches skin, easy to get a good curl that lasts, and not crazy expensive. Thank you so much! Now I do have lovely lashes!</li>
            <li> works well to my lashes. can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter, but I might take it, it works very well. Works very very well. Bought at a reduced price for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> After using this for about 6 months, it came apart. One side of the curler slides up so half of my lashes don&#x27;t get curled.</li>
            <li> Izy Trends is one of best sellers I&#x27;ve ever dealt with. Their product is fantastic. I definitely recommend this item and Izy Trends for everyone.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on short lashes</li>
            <li> Nice. Worth the money</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t quite fit my eye shape.</li>
            <li> This is a must have item for all those ladies out there. This is really easy to use and feels so good. The build quality is outstanding and the build quality is great. Super fast shipping and just a wonderful all round purchase.</li>
            <li> I really loved this Eyelash Curler by Izy Trends; not only is this extremely easy to use, but it is really comfortable when using.  I found this to be an easy addition to my makeup routine in the mornings and I could definitely tell a difference in my eyelashes.  I also really love the packaging, it&#x27;s so cute.  This would be a perfect stocking stuffer for any lady in your life.  The company provides one additional Silicone Refill pad.  I really loved that I was able to fit all my eyelashes through the opening because I&#x27;ve used some curlers in the past that would only fit 1/2 of my eyelashes at once.  This curler is great and fool-proof.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good eyelash curler that gives you immediate results.</li>
            <li> seems to work pretty good</li>
            <li> Loved it and so does my lashes</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! IT WORKS GREAT!</li>
            <li> Really nice eyelash curler. It curled my eyelashes perfectly. Easy to use with no pinching. It comes with an extra pair of cusions. Packaged in a cute pink box. I am happy to recieve this eyelash curler to review.</li>
            <li> Well made! I have never been able to curl my lashes, but they did curl this time! Stayed all day too. Nice product :)</li>
            <li> Works great! Made well, not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Wonderful eyelash curler! Doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull my lashes at all which I have had problems with in the past when it came to eyelash curlers! I love that it comes with a extra silicone pad that you can change once the other one gets old and gross! Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Good Quality just as I expected it to be. My wife lost hers so i got her this one and she likes it.  She said she can get all her eye lashes in this one at one time which made her very happy. She told me also to say that if you are looking for the extra pad for the curler it is snapped on the handle which she said is nice because now she will not loose it.  She is very pleased and likes it better then her old one.  I got these at a reduced price to test and review and my wife said they are great.!!!</li>
            <li> This was really awkward to use and the first rubber insert immediately fell apart and had to be replaced. It pulls and pinches far too much and curls very little. I went and bought a cheap one at the store and threw this away.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product. By far the best one I&#x27;ve owned. It looked great with my mascara. I could not be happier with it.</li>
            <li> These work great! Curled my lashes very well!</li>
            <li> Better then any other eyelash curler ive used. Thanks. Doesnt pinch</li>
            <li> I really liked it works well and is easy to hold on to</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. Love the extra pad</li>
            <li> I seldom use make up, but when I do, I make sure I look my best. A make up artist told me to always use an eyelash curler to enhance my face since I already have big eyes. The typical problem I have with eyelash curler is it hurts when I use it. I also have to do it several times to achieve the desired look. The Lovely Lashes eliminates the pinch and tagging, the curler doesn&#x27;t pull my lashes out. It takes a few minutes to achieve the look I want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product to review and test and it is to my liking. Compared to my other curler, the Lovely Lashes has a soft pad design with black rubber grip handle that allows my finger to squeeze it with comfort. It also comes with an extra silicone eyelash curler pad. The box also contains instructions on how to ensure the perfect lash it promises. Now, I can use an eyelash curler without the thinking about the pain.</li>
            <li> love the eyelast curlers... don&#x27;t spend money on really expensive ones they all do the same thing...</li>
            <li> Best one so far but they all pinch a little sometime.</li>
            <li> I like that this eyelash curler does not pinch my lashes at all. Makes for an easy smooth device to use. I have difficulty with others but this one glides nicely when opening and closing and does a great job curling my lashes.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot! Unlike the other eyelash curlers, this one actually grabs all the lashes. I have short lashes, so a curler that is able to do this is wonderful! None of my lashes have fallen out, so a big plus! It is very comfortable to use, nice finger grips, and made very well...not a cheap tool at all. No tugs or pinches...the outcome is just lovely lashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls last a very long time. You will love this tool...you won&#x27;t be sorry you purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely put this on my favorite beauty tools list. I hope the replacement pads will be available to purchase soon!</li>
            <li> Work good for me .easy to use . And I love the quality. Im will not worried if my lashes break out or something it is definitely good . I purchase this item under promotion with my own honest opinion</li>
            <li> Wow this is amazing! I&#x27;ve tried this after I received and I really love this product! Make me more pretty :) make my eyelashes attractive. I will buy again for my sister. And I will be proud to recommend this to my friends. I bought this for only $1 in exchange of my review. Thanks</li>
            <li> I recently received a discount code to review this product! i was extremely skeptical at first because eyelash curlers are very tricky for me to love or even just like. I&#x27;ve had an eyelash curler from 3 years and i couldn&#x27;t find a replacement for it that wasn&#x27;t a $20 curler. that is ridiculous to me! As soon as i received the curler i ran down stairs and curled my lashes! i am officially in love with this curler. it fits my eye perfectly and when i pressed down to curl them THERE IS NO PINCH. a lot of the cheaper curlers always pinch you! the only issue i had with this product were the little rubbers where you place your fingers! which is no big deal. i simply just took them off and the inside was still smooth. i trashes the rubber parts the feel of that on my fingers isn&#x27;t good for me. you also get an extra rubber for the bottom of the curler so when it gets a gross and used up. I&#x27;m glad it came with that because they get dirty pretty fast. all in all i am shocked with the quality of this product because the box makes it looks cheap and just a waste of money BUT TRUST ME ITS NOT!!!!</li>
            <li> Great item, not cheaply made .. Works great and very cute</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this curler! There&#x27;s no pinch, no pulling, just pretty curled lashes. It is very well made and I love the box it came in as well haha!This works great even without using mascara, and it curls phenomenally and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to all my friends and family and anyone who is thinking about buying it. I got mine at a reasonable price and it has been great!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd eyelash curler. The first two ones gave up on me after few tries. So far this is the best of all the three. Very affordable and works well on my not so long lashes.</li>
            <li> DISCLAIMER: I received a product discount for this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lovely Lashes, eye lashes curler, is great product. It definitely added some curl to my rather straight lashes. I also like that it comes with a replacement silicone pad. It didn&#x27;t pinch or tug on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and another eyelash curler together in my order. Hands down, this one wins! Beautiful curl on the first go around. No pinching and great fit to prevent broken lash hairs. Love it and highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Broke the second time it was used.When I was able to use it , it pinched was very uncomfortable to use. No curl at all.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as described in good packaging.  Good quality, really gives me a curly lashes. Easy to manage and use, Love the fact it glides smoothly, unlike other curler I tried its hard and you need to put on extra effort.</li>
            <li> It worked great at first but broke about a month after I purchased it. When it broke the spring seemed to break so it hit my eyebrow area eye pretty hard.  I wanted to contact the seller to see if I could get a replacement, but I wasn&#x27;t able to figure out how to get in touch with them.</li>
            <li> Nice curler for the price. Easy to use, works as described. No painful pulling of lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Extra nice thing is the extra replacemnt pad that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;Happy customer!</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!!!!!! It&#x27;s a must have in my make up bag! It&#x27;s easy to use and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I have really short stubborn lashes that fall down all the time. It&#x27;s been tough finding an eyelash curler that works for me. I&#x27;ve bought tons of eyelash curlers from beauty supply stores over the past several months. I&#x27;m so thankful to have finally found one that is of good quality.</li>
            <li> Lovely Lashes Curler I love it!!!  Works great with or w/out mascara. Was shipped on time and well packaged.</li>
            <li> need to add, very importantly, that you keep them curly and sexy. Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler does just that for you. It&#x27;s comfortable and works for any eye shape  I recommend you trying it great for the price.</li>
            <li> This product was provided to me to review without charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not someone who had ever used an eyelash curler as I didn&#x27;t think I needed one.  However, as I&#x27;ve aged (I&#x27;m 50), my lashes seem more sparse and not as long and full as they once were, so when the opportunity to try this product came along I thought....why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use the product and that there was no pain at all.  The product did make my lashes look a little longer and appear fuller without my having to apply multiple coast of mascara to achieve the look.  So yes, this product is a keeper and I would recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> Wow. I actually love this Eyelash curler! I was afraid to use an eyelash curler after seeing a girl on youtube use one incorrectly, but my friends have nagged me to get one for so long, so when I found this deal, it was a no brainer. I&#x27;m so impressed with this eyelash curler. The cushion on the bottom is great! I&#x27;m a little surprised there&#x27;s only a cushion on the bottom, and not one on the top as well, but it works well, nonetheless. :) I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to my mom and girl friends!</li>
            <li> The rubber parts on this curler is what makes it a bit of a shoddy product..&lt;br /&gt;the rubber that curls ur eyelashes don&#x27;t extend from end to end.. so part of ur&lt;br /&gt;eyelashes get messed up so you have to keep adjusting.&lt;br /&gt;The rubber around the finger holes are coming off the brim. Tried to adjust it but&lt;br /&gt;it wouldn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re ok. they don&#x27;t get all my lashes. the end of my lashes don&#x27;t get curled and when i try to move it towards that end to curl they come out looking weird and crinkly. it does pinch a little and i also don&#x27;t like that they don&#x27;t sell refills, my last fill is breaking so i wont be repurchasing this one. il try to look for one that sells refills,as i don&#x27;t want to waste 20 bucks each month for a new curler.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to worry about my eyelashes falling out anymore. When I would use my old eyelash curler, my lashes would get stuck every time no matter how little pressure I would use. So glad I found a quality curler that doesn&#x27;t cause my lashes to fall out.</li>
            <li> I love that this comes with extra padding to replace your pads if need be. This is a comfortable eyelash curler, and my lashes have yet to stick and get pulled out. I even received a compliment (from a student) on my eyelashes the first day I used it!&lt;br /&gt;(Great gift for a teenage girl.)</li>
            <li> Ok, i&#x27;ve gotta be honest...these curlers were not for me.  They were for my wonderful girlfriend and her equally wonderful eyelashes.  I&#x27;ve always admired women with their curly eyelashes and wondered why it was that men don&#x27;t use a curler also.  Well this was the perfect opportunity to do just that.  Well, i think i need a lot more practice and patience.  My girlfriend said they work beautifully and she would gets lots of use out of them.  I guess i will trust her on that and so should you!</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this eyelash curler after my Revlon curler broke after 10 years. I based my decision on reviews and the 100% product guarantee. At first it worked good and I was happy with my choice but then one side broke after a week. The same thing had happened with my Revlon curler but that was after 10 years. I sent it back immediately and decided on not getting a replacement. I guess mine was a defective one because I had barely used it. If it hadn&#x27;t broke I would still be using it but I ordered another eyelash curler that works much better for my almond shaped eye and is better quality. My other complaint is that the silicone pad would pop out sometimes. Overall this isn&#x27;t the best eyelash curler out there, the one I&#x27;m currently using is tweezerman and I love it.</li>
            <li> These are awesome!! As I haven&#x27;t been using eyelash curlers because they have been hurting my eyes when I use them, these don&#x27;t! They are very easy and simple to use! They really work too, most volume I&#x27;ve gotten ever! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
            <li> Love this eyelash curler. works super well, doesnt squeeze pinch or hurt. not too wide either. so much better than an expensive name brand one i bought!</li>
            <li> Very nice curler. Creates the prefect curls every time. Plus I use eye mascara and that really helps to accentuate the curls.</li>
            <li> Product was shipped right away.  Daughter surprised that it was quite easy to use, she still loves it and said it still works great. , thanks!</li>
            <li> I just received this product today as a trial for a review company and tried it out immediately. I will preface this by saying that curling my eyelashes isn&#x27;t part of my normal beauty routine, however, I was very pleased with the results and was satisfied with the value of the product based on the price. Would definetly buy again if needed.  The product itself is sturdy, ergonomic, and does a good job at curling the eyelash in a comfortable manner.</li>
            <li> I been using a bunch of eye curler I even buy a brand name eye curler but it&#x27;s not the best as this one.. This one I been looking for. Easy to clean and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyelids and its curl my lashes very well also it last the curl longer..</li>
            <li> I love curled lashes but I was not blessed with natural curls of any kind. I feel much prettier if I have curled eyelashes. Many eyelash curlers hurt, tug or squeeze. This eyelash curler Did Not&lt;br /&gt;Cause me pain. The desired results were delivered.  I would recommend this eyelash curler. It came with an extra pad too.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed after reading the positive reviews about the curler. If you like the old Revlon curler with the white lash cushion, you will likely not like this curler.</li>
            <li> These work just as described. They&#x27;re pretty similar to other lash curlers sold in drugstores. What sets them apart for me is the silicone insert. I feel like it protects my lashes better and pulls less than the rubber inserts used in other brands. I also like that they include a replacement. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Give me the lift I want and has changed my overall look, for the better of course. I feel absolutely gorgeous after using this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> The claim that this eyelash curler will work on any type of eyelashes has definitely proved to be an accurate statement. I have pretty thin short eyelashes and this eyelash curler curled my eyelashes without ANY problems at all! It made my eyelashes look really nice even without applying mascara. Applying mascara did make them be even more bold but you could actually use this eyelash curler without mascara. It didn&#x27;t tug or pinch at all and with most eyelash curlers they take out an eyelash or two every time (which again with thin eyelashes this is not okay) however this eyelash curler did not take out a single eyelash and I&#x27;ve been using it for the past few days. I love it! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> I received this eyelash curler to review, which was convenient timing because I was already looking for a replacement eyelash curler. I have issues with curlers due to the shape of my eye and my eyelashes are ridiculously straight. This has become my go to eye lash curler. It comfortably curls my eyelashes without missing lashes or pinching my eyelid. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Most curlers are much too large for me.Now,after wasting $ on one&#x27;s that don&#x27;t  work,I found these.</li>
            <li> These just didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  I read other good reviews, so maybe it&#x27;s just my lashes!  All I can say is they are not for me.</li>
            <li> For this price, I was expecting something a little more, but this is no better than a  cheaply made drugstore brand eyelash curler.Translation: it sucks. Save your money!</li>
            <li> Curls very well without pinching</li>
            <li> Love this, works amazing and its not a bad price</li>
            <li> I received this at a reduced price for an honest opinion. This eyelash curler works great! Not sure it works better than any other eyelash curler but it definitely curled my lashes.</li>
            <li> This is perfect, I highly recommend! I didn&#x27;t have to use mascara to get the curl I desired! My curled lashes lasted all day! Which is also amazing! I did receive this product for free but opinions expressed are my own!</li>
            <li> This is a horrible eyelash curler. It pinches when curling and the curl doesn&#x27;t last. Honestly, don&#x27;t waste your time!!</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler! I&#x27;ve been curling my lashes for YEARS and this one has, by far, the best cushion. The shape of it lies against your eyelid a little differently (flatter) than others that I&#x27;ve tried, which is cool because of the great curl you get from that, but will take some getting used to for me. It does come with one extra cushion, which is always a plus! I have had issues with other lash curlers where my lashes will get stuck in the corner where the eyelid piece connects to the base and it HURTS. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with this one so far (I&#x27;ve used it three times since I got it). The shape of it should be awesome no matter what your eye shape is or how long/short your lashes are.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the grip to the handle of the product. It easy to use. The claim to saying that the product won&#x27;t pinch is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product lives up to it name and one of the best eyelash curlers I have owned so far.</li>
            <li> Well it looks a lot like all others I&#x27;ve had.  It does the job and doesn&#x27;t remove my mascara when I use it.  What more could you ask?</li>
            <li> I adore this eyelash curler and have added it to my daily makeup bag. It is easy to use, easy to clean and curls my eyelashes really well. It is a great addition to my collection of makeup and girly goodies. Great quality and inexpensive. Thanks IZy Trends</li>
            <li> Received these very quickly!  I had to try them out as soon as I received them. I didn&#x27;t get them until evening time. I must say when I woke up this morning my lashes still had curl in them. The product is exactly as described. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> It is true what the box says!  It doesn&#x27;t pinch and it doesn&#x27;t tug!&lt;br /&gt;I am always scared to put things near m eye but I don&#x27;t mind the lovely lashes!  I would recommend it to anyone who would want to try out an eye lash curler!</li>
            <li> I recently tested 3 eyelash curlers (this being one of them) and one of them was even a $50 heated eyelash curler from Mirenesse and this Lovely Lashes curler beats the others. This isn’t the best eyelash curler I’ve ever used, but better than the vast majority I’ve tried. I’ve been keeping this one in my bathroom cabinet so I can use it every morning because it really gives me that bright-eyed look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curler also has a rubber grip handle and came with one refill silicone pad, and considering the price point on this, it’s a really good deal.</li>
            <li> I received this for review. I wondered what could be so special about an eyelash curler that would make one any different from the next, but I did find that this was more comfortable and easy to use-- it didn&#x27;t pinch at all and I didn&#x27;t have to keep trying to realign it like I do with my other two. There is more padding in the strip, which is I think what makes the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were still the same (all three work about equally as far as what my eyelashes look like in the end), but getting there was more pleasant. ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but I am not a fan of this eyelash curler.  I will say that the design feels very sturdy, and it did not pinch or pull my eyelashes.  However, I was not able to reach the base of my eyelashes all the way across my eye.  I was able to curl the lashes in the insides of my eyes, towards my nose, and then in the middle, but then it cut off my lashes half way through them at the outer corners of my eyes.  I think it was too curved for my lids.  My lids are more flat, so that&#x27;s why they didn&#x27;t work for me.  I believe if I had different shaped eyes, they would be perfect for me.  The quality is good and I like that it comes with an extra pad, but it just didn&#x27;t work for my eyelid shape.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use! This is my first pair of lace curlers and I was a little concern that they would hurt or would not work however these are great and a great price!&lt;br /&gt;This is a winner if you are looking for a lash curler.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this eyelash curler got so many great reviews. I can&#x27;t use it without it pinching me...and I&#x27;ve been curling my eyelashes for over 20 yrs. I&#x27;ll stick to my drugstore selection next time.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I received this comb at a deep discount for review purposes. However, my review is 100% my own thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for this eyelash curler.  It looks and feel very nice, while I&#x27;ve had a lot of experience with eyelash curlers that just fall apart after a few uses.  Despite the nice look and feel, I didn&#x27;t notice any curling with this tool.  I have long, thick, very straight eyelashes.  I followed all the directions on the box - I made sure my lashes were clean and dry.  I lined up the curler and squeezed for 10 seconds.  Nothing.  I tried a few more times and still saw no results.  As someone who&#x27;s been curling her eyelashes since she was five, I know it wasn&#x27;t user error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary:  A lot of people had great experiences with this eyelash curler, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. It&#x27;s just a basic drug store eyelash curler. Nothing special.</li>
            <li> My basic makeup routine includes eyeliner and mascara on my eyelashes. Not until recently did I realize how important having a good eyelash curler was. I have always used a basic one I have found on sale or was given to me by someone who didn&#x27;t need theirs anymore. I was presented with the opportunity to review the Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler and I have now realized why I was using the wrong one this whole time! This curler is awesome! You can feel it really picking up your eyelashes and giving them a quick curl. It doesn&#x27;t hurt and it is because of soft rubber pad that is on the curler. The only drawback I have is that I sometimes have to reapply my liquid eyeliner because it picks that up as well when curling. Otherwise I am in love with this curler!</li>
            <li> As described. Would recommend. Doesn&#x27;t cut my lashes like the last one. Use BEFORE mascara!</li>
            <li> In short, I like this curler, and it&#x27;s probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used. As for the structure of the curler, it is very much the classic style. It looks almost identical to my current one, but with white pads and the words &amp;#34;Lovely Lashes&amp;#34; engraved on it. Additionally the package comes with an extra silicone pad, which I was pleased to see included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, all eyelash curlers are created mostly equal, whether you spend a $1 or $30. This curler has slightly changed my opinion of that. It is indeed noticeably superior to the $1 curler I once used, and the $3 curler I now use. I&#x27;m not sure if I would be willing to spend $12 on one, but I&#x27;d be tempted for this curler. This is the best curler I&#x27;ve ever used. I haven&#x27;t used it enough to be confident about how long it holds a curl, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be horribly long. That&#x27;s the only reason I rated a 4 star versus a 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this curler to anyone who is looking to try out a new curler. Someone who is looking to spend a bit more than your cheap curlers, but not as much as the fancy high-end ones. I think this is a nice compromise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read my full review at maegal . blogspot . com.</li>
            <li> Very well made. Comes with extra white rubber pad which is very nice. Curls lasted wonderfully does not tug or pull</li>
            <li> Great product.... works way better then the one I had... so happy to b the owner of this product.. shipping was fast to... great buy.. thx a bunch...</li>
            <li> I Love this eyelash curler!! Doesn&#x27;t hurt or pull my lashes and give them that extra curve I wanted!!&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you Nicole S.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of lash curlers since I&#x27;ve never found one that fits properly, but I really loved this one. I was impressed with how this curler got all my lashes at once, even the corner ones, without pinching, and my lashes didn&#x27;t get stuck even when I put a lot of pressure on them. The curl looked great  even without mascara or eyeliner and the curler was very sturdy (the curler I had before this one was flimsy). Definitely recommend this, especially for those like me who don&#x27;t like wearing mascara all the time.</li>
            <li> Its an okay product, but not worth the price.  I could have spent less and gotten just as good an eyelash curler</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler seems to do everything as promised. I love the cute little &amp;#34;Lovely Lashes&amp;#34; detail on the curler. It makes it stand out from some of the other eyelash curlers I have seen. I would recommend this product to those who are looking for a new eyelash curler. The shipping also seems to be pretty fast, so that is definitely a plus! For the price you pay for this Lovely Lashes curler, you get a good product and the result once you use it on your lashes is even better!</li>
            <li> Preforms as expected!</li>
            <li> Product for review: curls lashes great</li>
            <li> This item works great! It is simple to use without any pulling or sticking! When ever I order makeup tools like this I am always afraid of the quality of the product. You have nothing to worry about with Lovely Lashes it is strong and durable and will not pull or tug on your lashes. Its the perfect fit.  I also love that it comes with a refill pad for future use. I plan to purchase more for gift basket fillers or stocking stuffers. Love it!</li>
            <li> Works good but does tug a little.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t curl, the plastic where you place he eyelashes is too thick. I would have returned it but it is a pain. I could get a better one at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> Loved the way it curled my lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a super cosmetic pro, I love wearing make-up- but I&#x27;m terrible at putting make-up on. And when it comes to eye lash curlers, I&#x27;m fearful and extremely inexperienced. But I&#x27;ve had a lot of friends who use curlers regularly, and I guess I thought it was only fair I give up my fear of stabbing myself in the eye and try to use these darn things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye lash curler was surprisingly simple and effective. It has small rubber handles, which allow for easy and accurate use of the curler. The rubber handles allow for a good grip, so even if you&#x27;ve just finished applying lotions or foundations- these won&#x27;t slip out of your hand. Always a plus! On the negative side, I fear they may attract pet hair and dust. They haven&#x27;t yet, but we shall see here in a few weeks if that becomes an issue (if it does I will update the review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the curler is a very light-weight metal, with silicone grips on the curler itself. The curler fit my lashes really conveniently. The curve allowed me to get all corners of my eye covered in one grip, which allowed for easy, convenient curling. It does come with an additional refill silicone pads. I haven&#x27;t used curlers very often, so I have no idea how many additional pads I would need, or how often they should be changed. But nonetheless, it&#x27;s always nice to have extras!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last and only other curler I owned was not half as effective or comfortable to use as this curler. My last curler looked VERY similar, but couldn&#x27;t reach all of my lashes. This one, on the other hand, covers my entire eye and makes for a quick beautifying touch-up in one swift curl of the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So needless to say for the small amount of money this curler cost, it was a &#x27;steal&#x27; of an investment. My lashes do look genuinely fuller and longer after using this, and very girl deserves to feel pretty.  I&#x27;d easily recommend this to any beginner-curler, teens who like experimenting with new make-up tools, and anyone who needs a convenient eye lash curler that does it&#x27;s job well.a convenient eye lash curler that does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is so sweet! First impression: I love the little box it was packaged in. Bright pink, cute enough I plan to keep it and use it to store away my curler. This curler is made well. It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or flimsy. Nice plastic grip cover on the handle makes it more secure and steady in your hand. It even came with an extra replacement pad. Great eyelash curler. I love it! Great buy</li>
            <li> It works well, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.  Pretty straight-forward eyelash curler. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I returned this.  Did not create perfect curls for me.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this eyelash curler for maybe a week, but I&#x27;m happy with it so far. It&#x27;s easy to use and works well. I just hope that it lasts over time.</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly as promised and works great!</li>
            <li> When i first got this eyelash curler (about 5 months ago) it was great, curled just fine and had no problems whatsoever but I&#x27;ve recently noticed that it&#x27;s already coming apart. :( I&#x27;ve had eyelash curlers in the past for years and this has never happened to me. Maybe I just got a defective one but i&#x27;m pretty bummed that it lasted me such a short time.</li>
            <li> Average.  Nothing special.</li>
            <li> The Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler makes a perfect gift for your fashionista bestie or even just for yourself. It works for any length lashes &amp; boy do they make the after version so much nicer. Especially if your planning on dressing up just curling your eye lashes &amp; adding a little massacre can make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of eyelash curlers out there...some pinch and pull, or don&#x27;t line up correctly.&lt;br /&gt;I liked using this one because it was easy to use as well as comfortable. The scissor movement is nice and smooth, and it gives a nice curl.&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is the white cushion pad, which makes it easier to see your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the pad, an extra is included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: Test product received with the option to review</li>
            <li> I got this as a promotional item. I had never curled my eyelashes before, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I love this eyelash curler. I can&#x27;t believe that I had never tried it before. It makes my eyelashes look so long. And my mascara goes on smoother.</li>
            <li> The one I received looks NOTHING like the one I ordered (as shown). This one looks like every typical eyelash curler you can buy for way less then this one. I&#x27;m disappointed. The one in the picture looks really neat and I got the cheapo fake one. Returning.</li>
            <li> My wife received this product for free, the review and opinions are her own. my wife always wondered how she could curl her eyelashes. She never had or used an eyelash curler before. She has some friends who curl their eyelashes, but she never tried it herself. My wife invited her friend over, so they could try this curler. They tried it and it worked well for both of them.She asked me if I noticed the difference, I didn&#x27;t, but what guy looks closely at his wife&#x27;s eyelashes? My wife&#x27;s friend caught on quicker because she has worked in a beauty parlor before. She said this eyelash curler was the best she has ever used. My wife is still trying to figure the thing out, but she is making progress.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler really does do an excellent job at producing pretty, natural-looking curves with as little discomfort as could be possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a traditional curler of sanitary metal with a wide head and gentle arch.  The soft silicone pad is easy on the lashes and a spare is included.  The handles also have a non-slip covering for good control even in a humid bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Izy Trends provided an eyelash curler for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> watched to get this discounted I&#x27;m place of a review. .well it works great and I love it but my Sis took this one ..so will be ordering me one</li>
            <li> This curler really makes it easy to get to the inner corners of the lashes which was the problem with my previous curler. This is an awesome eyelash curler. I barely use any pressure and my eyelashes are high and curly very quickly.</li>
            <li> This truly does give you Lovely Lashes. I got this to review for my blog and thought it would be hard for me to use since I have never used an eyelash curler in my life. To my delight it was easy to use and made my lashes look great! I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Very affordable, very efficient. If you need an eyelash curler this is a good choice. No tugs, no pinching, no pulling on my eyelashes. It also held my curl all day.</li>
            <li> Works much better than my old eyelash curler and the curl lasts longer! It doesn&#x27;t pinch easily, but you can still do it if you aren&#x27;t careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;So it lasted almost 2 years, but now it&#x27;s broken and I can&#x27;t tell how to get a replacement. It was supposed to have a lifetime warranty.</li>
            <li> I was super excited about receiving the Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler by Izy Trends that as soon as it was in my hands I rushed into my bathroom to throw on some makeup! The main focus of this curler is the fact that it wont pinch or tug and no matter the length of your lashes, it will leave you with perfect curls. I own 4 lash curlers and always had a favorite, but now I have to honestly say Izy is going to be the one I use from now on. It does exactly what the packaging says and its very easy to use. My lashes looked fuller as well and I didn&#x27;t need as much mascara to hold the curl as I do with others. I love this curler and you ladies should really give it a try!!  See my blog review http://myblog.thebeautyinsidethebox.com/2015/01/lovely-lashes-eyelash-curler-by-izy.html</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to receive the Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler in the mail!  As I opened the pink box, I found the eyelash curler and an extra pad.  I have always curled my eyelashes be applying mascara and, sometimes, even if I’m not wearing makeup.  I find it makes my eyes look bigger and I look more awake than I sometimes feel!&lt;br /&gt;I have used some curlers that are hard to open and close.  Some have pulled my eyelashes out of my lid and pinched my lid.  I am very picky on what I use now after learning my lesson the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was the inscription Lovely Lashes on the eyelash curler.  I know, you’re thinking that not important but I thought it was cute.  The handles are outlined with black rubber so your fingers can fit comfortably.  That’s important too!  You don’t want fingers slipping and sliding or you may be getting eyelash removal instead of curl.&lt;br /&gt;I tested the eyelash curler by opening and closing the curling tool.  The movements were smooth with no hitches.  I placed my lashes in the curler and closed.  I was able to get the tool to the base of my lashes and squeezed for 10 seconds.  The directions say 5-10 seconds and my lashes can be stubborn!  There was no tugging, no pulling, and no pinching!  When I opened and removed the tool, my lashes were gorgeous, if I do say so myself!  They had the perfect curl and I immediately looked more alert and wide eyed.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish could have been different with this product is something to place the extra pad in.  I have a place to put it but am always afraid of losing tiny pieces.  My answer to that problem is possibly placing the eyelash curler and extra pad in a small pouch or container that I could put in on my vanity.  I do feel like this eyelash curler will last for a very long time, as I can replace the pad when the first one displays wear.  My verdict is five stars.  I recommend this product but only if you love your lashes!</li>
            <li> This curler really worked great.  I was so impressed.  Loved it!  Then unfortunately after using for 1 week something snapped when I was compressing the handles and there was no more tension in the curler anymore. Due to the lack of tension in the handles it simply does not curl like it did.  It really was the best eyelash curler I have ever used but I am disappointed that it broke, especially after only 1 week of usage.  Hopefully, this is an isolated incident.  Still thinking whether I want to order another and try again.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product! Very easy to grip and use! Love the way it curled my lashes!  I got this through amzreview trader!</li>
            <li> I really like this eyelash curler... of course I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using any eyelash curler after you have started applying mascara - I use this first and my eyes look more open and mascara added makes my eyes pop!</li>
            <li> I love it! I love that it comes with an extra silicon piece. It doesnt pull on my eyelashes! I usually have problems with eyelash curlers pulling on my eyelashes, but this one did nothing but magic! It gave me a nice curl for a great finish! Im extremely glad I was chosen to review this product. :)</li>
            <li> I stopped using eyelash curlers because they always pinch and pull out eyelashes and it will stick to the pad however with this Lovely lashes eyelash curler it easy and simply to use and it will not pull out your lashes and stick to the pad.. sturdy... it works for me... highly recommended and great price too..</li>
            <li> works great to curl lashes! no pinching!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes always need a extra help to look bigger and this makes the job! I use it immediately after my mascara and works fine!</li>
            <li> Have you ever had your eye pinched by a poorly made eyelash curler? I have, it hurts!! I absolutely love the Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler, I have very thin short eyelashes and when I am trying to aim for a more dramatic look I have no choice but to use an eyelash curler to give my eyelashes those beautiful fuller look. I did receive this product free, but this review is entirely my thoughts and feelings on this product. One other thing that impressed me was the cushions for the curler, they are soft but firm, unlike some curlers where they feel like you are crimping your eyelashes between to bricks.</li>
            <li> Great product, love the silicone white strips and I also like that they could be replaced. It made my lashes look great and there was no pinching at all</li>
            <li> They really work and do what they say they will do!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I stopped using an eyelash curler because it would always make my eyes tear up or would pull my lashes.  After reading all the reviews I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this product!!  It comes in a very nice package and is very easy to use!  My eyelashes look amazing and there was no pulling or tearing :)  Would definitely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it works as well as my sephora eyelash curler. It is made of quality materials and comes with an extra eyelash pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a discount to write a product review on this item.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler works great and doesn&#x27;t pull at your lashes like other brands that I have purchased in the past have. Will purchase again in the future for sure!</li>
            <li> Love this Eyelash Curler, simple yet totally effective.  Can&#x27;t believe how easy and efficient this curler is.  What I like most is that my lashes stay curled and look good all day, really keeps the shape.  I&#x27;ve used drugstore curlers in the past and this one ranks at the top, much better than my makeup catalog one.</li>
            <li> This little tool is perfect to get the desired curl to your eyelashes! This is my go to eyelash curler and gives me perfect results with every use!  It definitely exceeded my expectations and is made of great quality!!</li>
            <li> Works great, I had to replace my Revlon curler that I had for several years and this one works better than the Revlon ever did. Doesn&#x27;t take long to leave a great curl!</li>
            <li> I have long lashes, so mascara usually leaves lovely black spots on my upper lid as soon as I open my eyes. Naturally, that&#x27;s not the look I want! I&#x27;ve been curling my lashes for years. I think I&#x27;ve tried just about any kind of curler there is.  There are a few reasons this one is my new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handles have a nice silicon padding so that your fingers don&#x27;t get sore and you won&#x27;t skip your grip. Having poked myself in the eye more times than I care to remember, this is a real bonus.  There&#x27;s also a nice padding on the curler section. It helps to not pull the lashes or pinch the eyelid. There&#x27;s even an extra one for when it gets worn. The last bonus is that you can still coat the lash line with eyeliner for that perfect line without damaging it or staining the pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNT I&#x27;M EXCHANGE FOR MY FAIR, HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN. I HAVE IN NO WAY BEEN COMPENSATED BY THE MANUFACTURER, DISTRIBUTOR OR ANY URGE ENTITY ASIDE FROM SAID DISCOUNT*</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it now and it&#x27;s fantastic</li>
            <li> These worked well for my eyelashes. I only wear my own lashes so I added mascara  and then used. The cushion in the inside put my mind at ease.</li>
            <li> It works ok. It takes a few times to keep the curl. Did pull out some lashes. This was not my favorite, but if I had nothing else, I&#x27;d use it.</li>
            <li> An eyelash curler can make or break a look, that is why it is important to have one that you are comfortable using. If I don&#x27;t curl my lashes they are sticking straight out no matter what mascara I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler for free to review I was very excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lovely Lashes Curler has a long base and the finger holes are set the perfect length apart. It easily opens and closes. The pad fits on my eye without any discomfort. Even during use there was no pinching or pulling. This is a very comfortable, easy to use eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I think this eyelash curler works well! I got really pretty results with it and it didn&#x27;t hurt to use. I like that it comes with an extra refill pad because that will help me out later on. I received one for free to review, but my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it is about having such cute eyelash curlers but these are the absolute cutest. Not to mention they are fantastic to use. No pinching, no tugging, no tears. Pulling your eyelashes is the worst feeling one could have sometimes so it&#x27;s nice to have beautifully gorgeous lashes without the pain. I have extremely fragile eyelashes after going through cancer twice so it&#x27;s nice to have something that won&#x27;t pull out what remaining lashes I have. I highly recommend these to anyone who enjoys good looking lashes without the pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll tell ya, I&#x27;m often told, I have the longest and straightest eyelashes! On top of that, I wear glasses so my eyelashes hit them, so I have to curl them. Izy Trends sent this to me for testing purposes, to try and review on my blog, and they are pretty awesome! Before I used these, I used the ones from the drug store. You know, the ones that put a 90 degree angle in your lashes! These don&#x27;t do that! These actually have a nice handle with perfect grip to give you the perfect tension for the perfect curl! What beauty Queen wouldn&#x27;t wanna get these in her stocking!! I promise, she will love you!</li>
            <li> Good eyelash curler.  I usually don&#x27;t like curling my lashes because it hurts. This particular curler did not hurt. Just make sure to follow instructions and don&#x27;t put it too far down. Hold it for 10-15 seconds and your lashes will be swooped up.  I like the extra silicone pad that comes with it and the lifetime guarantee.</li>
            <li> broke after carrying it around my backpack but it&#x27;s probably my fault</li>
            <li> Great curler! Quality made product!!!</li>
            <li> The best eyelash curler I have used. Completely above expectations, soft, easy to use. All round great product</li>
            <li> my teenage daughter tried this and she loves it</li>
            <li> This product work great! I even tried heating it up for 2 seconds with a blowdryer and it really curls your lashes! its a nice size and looks and feels durable!</li>
            <li> Better quality then others I have tried. Works very well. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I had pretty much quit using eyelash curlers because I couldn&#x27;t find one that fit my eye.  I had never had this problem before I decided it was time to update all my make up tools a few years ago.  I discarded my eyelash curler of some 15 years before purchasing a new one and what a mistake that turned out to be.  The curler I bought to replace it (don&#x27;t remember what my original brand had been) was too big for my eye socket.  I would have to angle it to curl the inner lashes then angle the other way to curl the outer lashes which pretty much left the center lashes uncurled.  I never thought I had an unusually small eye socket but apparently I do. I tried a couple of others from various stores but could not find one that worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The older I get the more straight my eyelashes seem to grow and I decided to try again to find a curler that would work for me.  After researching the reviews I decided on this one and another brand and they both worked.  This curler measures approximately 1 3/8 inch wide with the curve being approximately 3/8 inch deep.  The store brands that didn&#x27;t work for me measured 1 1/2 inches wide and 1/2 deep.  You wouldn&#x27;t think that 1/8 inch difference in size would matter but for me it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curler does a nice job of curling my lashes, getting them all in at the same time.  I curl close to the lid then again about half way out and this gives me a pleasing curl. This curler comes with one spare cushion strip that is attached to the curler. I thought my spare piece was missing then I noticed it was in a holder that snaps on the handle of the curler, neat way to keep it.  I do wish that it had more cushion strips but hopefully they will last a while.</li>
            <li> I received this awesome eyelash curler yesterday.  It came in a cute box and an extra curling pad. I&#x27;ve used it twice already and I love it! I use the Kevyn Aucoin and the Shisiedo eyelash curlers, which I consider the best of the best for me, and honestly, this is just as good! I won&#x27;t be replacing thoese curlers but will definately use this one regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick lashes but they point down so I have to curl to get the effect I want. This curler does what it says- curling is very easy, it doe NOT pinch at all and holds the curl all day, till I take off my mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, very happy with it!</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is OK, but not even nearly as good as Shu Emura - seems like every time I try to save money and try a different product, I lose.</li>
            <li> Works well but doesn&#x27;t fit my eye shape</li>
            <li> I received the Lovely Lashes eyelash curler today and is pleasantly surprised. This curler works absolutely wonderfully. No tugs or pinches just as advertised! I curled my lashes a couple hours ago and my eyelashes are still curled! Will update the review in a few months to see how this product holds up. Really loving the lifetime guarantee though; so I am not worried. :]</li>
            <li> Straight forward-I have thin and pale eyelashes. I had never thought an eyelash curler would do me much good. But since I could get this for giving a review I thought I would give it a shot. And I was right - it doesn&#x27;t do much for me. It was easy to use, good size, no issues with sticking or pulling out lashes - just can&#x27;t enhance what I barely have. I&#x27;ll just stick to primer and mascara. Now my sister, she of the thick dark (where did those come from?) eyelashes, had a much different experience. For her they made her already gorgeous lashes &#x27;pop&#x27;. If curlers work for you this should be a great product.</li>
            <li> I received this to try and review-- I only wish I would have purchased one long ago.  It&#x27;s wonderful- I love it!!  You would think an eyelash curler is an eyelash curler and one would work about as well as all the others, and I have purchased many others in the past, all with the same fair results.  I currently have very short, skimpy lashes  after they actually all fell out years ago due to some fertility drugs.  This is the first time I have used an eyelash curler that a) didn&#x27;t pinch, b) didn&#x27;t pull out any lashes, and c) WORKED!  Even my teen daughter was impressed that she &amp;#34;could actually see&amp;#34; my eyelashes!  She also used it, and even though she has beautiful long and lush eyelashes anyway,  using this curler made her lashes almost look as if she had applied falsies!  She, too, was thrilled with this tool and is ordering her own.  It also came with an extra cushion.  Best $10 I never spent-- but I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase one and will definitely be recommending this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> Got this in the mail today.  It really did give my daughter lovely lashes..The curler is light weight and it does what it says its going to do.  My daughter has been curling her lashes all day long.  Without any products on her lashes, she curled her lashes and instantly it made her eyes look different.  She is very happy to have tested this product out.  She is a teen who is starting to want to wear make up, but  always wants to make her eyes look pretty.  This curler really makes her feel good when her lashes are curled.  So 5 stars for this product becase this teenager is not easy to please...</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler!!! It is well made, and my lashes last all day long. Works great with and without mascara. Was shipped quickly and packaged well as well.</li>
            <li> This is useless. The curve doesn&#x27;t work with my eyelashes, it pinches, &amp; it&#x27;s freakin&#x27; useless. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Okay so I never really knew the importance of curling your lashes. I always assumed mascara would take care of everything but after using Lovely Lashes I have been proved wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a pair of lash curlers way back when I was younger and it was a scary experience and they pinched my eyes and ohh it was just a dreadful time. I was just feeling a bit braver and ambitious and when I had the opportunity to give Lovely Lashes a test drive I went for it. While these still look a bit scary they really worked well after I got the hang of it. I just had to get it in my head that they weren&#x27;t meant to be cozy bunnies they were a &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; to use just as you would a make-up brush or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few tries I noticed a significant difference in my lashes. I was really amazed! I could not believe I was having such fun playing with my lashes! They appeared fuller and made my eyes &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; so to speak. How have I lived without this product all these years?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lovely Lashes are great especially for a fairly beginner like me to using eyelash curlers. They don&#x27;t pinch and they have rubber grips for your fingers so they don&#x27;t move around in your hand. They curl your lashes nicely no matter if you have short, medium, or long ones! And they are also backed by a 100% guarantee if you&#x27;re not satisfied with them for any reason.</li>
            <li> I have smaller eyes, I always have. I had a bit of trouble getting it on my eyes just right. Maybe I am just out of practice. It&#x27;s a good product, just not for my tiny eyes.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product &amp; company! The shipping was fast &amp; the product was amazing! This lash curler is a wonderful addition to my collection. As a beauty blogger I always look around for the newest most effective products &amp; I have found something wonderful in Izy Trends Lovely Lashes Curler! I recommend this for all women. You don&#x27;t have to be extremely familiar with curlers to be able to use it! 5 of 5 stars no doubt! I love it!</li>
            <li> pinches your lashes after like 10 uses</li>
            <li> I like it so far I normally have problems with curlers taking my eyelashes out but so far so good :)</li>
            <li> Through the years I have bought and thrown away more eyelash curlers than I care to count. Hands down these are the best I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Maybe I have an odd eye shape.  The first thing this lash curler did was pinch my skin...OUCH!!!  I didn&#x27;t find that it curled my lashes well either.  I thought I would try it again and I nearly injured myself the second time around.  This seems kind of cheaply made to me as well. I am surprised by so many 5 star reviews but again, maybe it&#x27;s the shape of my eye that&#x27;s odd.  The previous eyelash curler I was using never pinched my skin like that so I will stick to that one.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the quality of this item (though it isn&#x27;t anything special, either), however, unlike most other reviewers, this doesn&#x27;t fit my eye shape.  I can&#x27;t use it without it pulling my lashes. I&#x27;ve made several attempts, and no matter how I place it on my lashes, it pulls.  It has a sharper curve than most eyelash curlers.  Perhaps I have unusual eyes, but I would not recommend this item.  I bought a Revlon curler at the drug store which works better for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome!! This is my absolute favorite eyelash curler. The rubber peice at the top is wider than others so it doesn&#x27;t pull your lashes and it is easy to use, convenient, etc. But again, most of all my favorite part is that I finally have a curler that doesn&#x27;t pinch and pull my lashes. Worth it ladies!!!... And gents! ;)</li>
            <li> I have long eyelashes. The problem is that they are mostly straight and faint. I normally just use mascara to darken them, but I often wish they had more curl. I received this Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler for free in order to review. I must say that it makes a difference! The eyelash curler is easy to use. Here are the directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Ensure the curler is clean&lt;br /&gt;-Make sure your eyelashes are clean and dry&lt;br /&gt;-Open the mouth of the curler and place your upper lashes inside&lt;br /&gt;-Position the curler to the base of the lashes but not over the skin&lt;br /&gt;-Gently squeeze the handle and hold steady for 5-10 seconds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So easy to use! It did not pull out any of my eyelashes or cause any pain. I did 10 seconds on both of my eyes and my eyelashes curled! They look even prettier when I put mascara on my curled lashes. I will definitely be using this product daily now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it comes with a replacement silicone refill pad. The silicone does attract dust and particles, so store it in an airtight and clean container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this eyelash curler!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work any better then any of the others I tried. I need an eyelash curler to work on the outside corners of my lashes.  The extra refill pad was not in the package.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler work as advertised. I curl my eyelashes everyday when applying my makeup for work. So it very important for me to have a curler that will do it job. I know everyone had at least one of those curlers that just don’t work properly. Either its too big or it destroy your eyelashes. The next thing you want after that is your eyelash falling off. I have very short eyelashes, so I need all of mine. The best thing I recommend with any curler is to first use the eye curler and then apply the mascara. Otherwise your lashes will get stuck and then you will have the pulling. If you are going to use it after you apply your mascara, clean the tip before redoing it again and after you are finish. Bottom line, this is a great eyelash curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This product is for an exchange for an unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Great value for its price! It has a very strong hold on lashes and curls them in one turn. I can&#x27;t believe how low the price is for these. I also appreciated that it came with an extra rubber eyelash protector.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NOTHING special.  Completely not worth the money.  I feel entirely cheated.  Wish I could send back but it isn&#x27;t sanitary.</li>
            <li> Better than any eyelash curler you buy locally. But still not convinced it&#x27;s the best one out there. There is a difference.</li>
            <li> I was asked to review this product for free and it could not have come at a better time! My old eyelash curler was on its last strings and I was way overdue for a new curler. I cannot say that I am disappointed with the results. This eye lash curler is very effective and delivers immediate results. The pad is very soft and allowed some give with I think helped to achieve a better curl. I do have to say that the curl did not last all day though, probably about 3 hours. I have not had any of my eyelash curlers hold a nice curl for more than 3 hours anyway so maybe this is normal. I did not have any problems with my eyelashes getting pulled out by the curlers when I tried curling them with mascara on my lashes.It can pinch a little if you put it too close to your eyelid but that seemed like a probable outcome anyway. I have posted a picture of my lashes without the curler on the left and after using on curler on the right</li>
            <li> Eyelashes seem to be new thing now a days and I am addicted.  This  is my own Honest review of product.  I stopped using eyelash curlers for many years after a couple black eyes from pinching.  Well these new ones do not pinch!  Absolutely Love!  They work very good, and comes with a extra plastic piece.  Give them a try</li>
            <li> Although it did curl my straight eyelashes fantastically. The silicone pads ripped after 2 weeks of moderate use and this started pulling out my eyelashes. It did not meet up to the 100% satisfaction guaranteed unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Good curler didn&#x27;t break or rip any of my eyelashes when curling them</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use an eye lashes curler as from my previews experiences with eye lashes curler, if i don&#x27;t pinch a skin, i get my lashes pull out! But with this curler it it really worked well of curling my eye lashes, it curl/get them all in the same time. I don&#x27;t even have to do it twice or trice, i only have to do it one time and that&#x27;s it i got a perfect curled eye lashes! One thing more i loved about this Lovely Lashes eye lashes curler is that no pain at all, no pinching, no pulling off of eye lashes just worked perfectly well!&lt;br /&gt;This also came with an spare curl cushion/refill pad! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Does its job! Love how they don&#x27;t rugged on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a curler for my lashes to make a full curl. It is easy to use and it grips the lashes pretty good to make nice curls. I don&#x27;t have to go back the second time for extra effect. That would definitely save some time for busy gal like me. I purchased this at promotional cost. But it is a little pricey at full listed price. I would buy again with a lower cost through.</li>
            <li> Like most women I know I have tried countless eye lash curlers, they seem to always pinch my skin and for some reason I can never seem to curl my left set of eye lashes! I love a good curled eye lash but can never seem to actually pull it off!. I was very excited to give to give this eye lash curler a shot.I received my order very quickly. I tried right after I received it and I was so surprised at just how well it worked, it didn&#x27;t pinch my skin at all and it caught just about every single hair including the little tiny ones on the inner corners(and my left eye lashes also). The Lovely Lashes eye lash curler is my ultimate favorite eye lash curler!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great deal. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different eyelash curlers in the past. I even had one of those $40 heated ones. I was really impressed with how much better this one performed compared to others. I usually have to at least use mascara to get full results, but this one its optional. I find that my lashes look great even without mascara. However, if I add mascara my lashes are va-va-VOOM! I thought it would be just another claim at a great eyelash curler, but boy was I wrong. It is an amazing eyelash curler, and will now be a staple in my professional makeup collection at work (I do makeup on the side), as well as for everyday makeup. Not to mention it also comes with an extra cushion (as I call it), so you won&#x27;t need to replace it for quite sometime. I would highly recommend this product, and I am so glad I spent the money to buy this. If your looking for a quality eyelash curler than this is definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li> Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler is the BEST curler I have found! I have tried many many different ones but they always pinched or just didn&#x27;t fit my eye right and this one doesn&#x27;t pinch and makes my lashes look great</li>
            <li> I use it every day and love it. Comfortable, easy to use and gives good curl</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my product today and I tried it right away! I love it already and the curl lasted a good while with mascara...</li>
            <li> Curls great and doesn&#x27;t rip out your lashes!  When my favorite eyelash curler broke, I went in search of a new one. I initially bought a super cheap one at the grocery store and that was a mistake. The pad on the curler was super hard and I couldn&#x27;t use it without feeling like it was goin to pull out all my lashes. Then I found this one online and decided to try it. I&#x27;m very satisfied. The pad is soft and doesn&#x27;t hurt or feel like it&#x27;s pulling. And it comes with a refill pad! It also leaves your lashes with a really nice curl. I bought this item at a promotional price for a review but this eyelash curler is definitely worth the full price. It&#x27;s a good quality curler that falls at the perfect price point. Better than the $2 curler from the grocery store and leaves your lashes looking like an expensive one from the makeup store.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Love love love! &amp;#34; my wife says  this is the best eyelash curler she&#x27;s used.  I noticed her lashes more after using the curler. We both would recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> Was a nice eyelash curler! No tug or pull on my lashes. I have smaller eyes so it was nice that it fit well. Would purchase again! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Was skeptical but pretty good at curling my lashes lived it</li>
            <li> I feel the curler is of great quality very sturdy doesn&#x27;t feel cheap but it doesn&#x27;t tend to pinch your eyelashes. I think maybe the one I received wasn&#x27;t aligned properly which made curling my eyelashes pretty difficult.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Comes with an extra rubber pad.</li>
            <li> I am the last person on Earth to ask about beauty advice. I grew up as a tomboy, and to a certain degree, I still am one. I wear makeup maybe once a year, more often if there is a wedding or other special event. So when I was asked to review the Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler (or LLEC, for short), I figured that I would give it a try, just to do something different. So, without further ado, here is my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lovely Lashes Eyelash Curler by Izy Trends, in terms of function, is no different than other eyelash curlers on the market. They operate by inserting your finger and thumb into the handles; spread the arms apart to open the guillotine-style press that curls your eyelashes, and pinch the handles together to bring the base of the curler up to the top metal portion, closing the guillotine and pressing your eyelashes into a curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of durability, the LLEC feels durable and is comfortable to use. It weighs in at 0.8 ounces (22 grams) and has a solid construction at the joints that appear to be able to withstand frequent use. The handles have a rubber insert along the inside of the loops so that your fingers and thumb do not press against the bare metal (which many other brands do, sometimes leaving a mark). Finally, the lower half of the press that is used to curl the lashes is lined with a rubber strip that helps the lashes to curl more gently (as opposed to eyelash curlers that have only metal, which can sometimes damage the hairs). The LLEC includes a spare strip should anything happen to the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a disease called Sjogrën’s Syndrome, which is basically a more severe form of dry eye (as well as other mucous membranes). As a result, any type of mascara, eye liner, or eye shadow getting into my eyes is bad juju. So while I don’t wear makeup, when I do I am limited in what I can use. An eyelash curler is definitely something that I want to keep in my arsenal, so I made sure to use the LLEC every day for three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;• Works best when the eyelashes are wet; immediately after washing your face or a shower is ideal.&lt;br /&gt;• I was able to curl every eyelash, even down to the corners of my eye, with no discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;• The curl on both eyes was consistent and even, so I didn’t have to worry about a lopsided look.&lt;br /&gt;• The LLEC cleaned up easily with no stains or other residue; I didn’t even need water at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;• Manipulating the LLEC to the correct angle to get to the corners takes a bit of practice. While it isn’t painful, it does require getting used to positioning the curler so that it grabs just the eyelashes without pulling on your eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;• While the extra rubber pad is a nice touch, it is small and potentially VERY easy to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lovely Lash Eyelash Curler is a solid product that is constructed well and performs exactly as promised. It is comfortable to use and includes an extra pad to extend the life of its guillotine-style curling press, and when combined with the Lifetime Warranty offered by the manufacturer, it makes the LLEC a great value. Whether you eschew mascara due to cost or because of a health issue like I have, the Lovely Lash Eyelash Curler will enable you to have eyelashes that will bring attention to your beautiful eyes without the price tag of expensive eye-related cosmetics. Just be prepared for all of the compliments!e sure to use the LLEC every day for three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;• Works best when the eyelashes are wet; immediately after washing your face or a shower is ideal.&lt;br /&gt;• I was able to curl every eyelash, even down to the corners of my eye, with no discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;• The curl on both eyes was consistent and even, so I didn’t have to worry about a lopsided look.&lt;br /&gt;• The LLEC cleaned up easily with no stains or other residue; I didn’t even need water at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;• Manipulating the LLEC to the correct angle to get to the corners takes a bit of practice.

            <li> FINALLY AND EYELASH CURLER THAT FITS MY EYE SHAPE AND ITS AMAZING TOO MY LASHES NEVER LOOKED BETTER!</li>
            <li> hard to use, very small for fingers &amp; eyes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all right.  I read some rave reviews and got it; don&#x27;t think it was any better than cheaper store brands but not worse, either.</li>
            <li> Now, to be very honest this is the second eyelash curler ever. So, I am not a pro lash curler or anything. I thought the curler I did have worked good, but when I tried this one I was blown away. I usually hold it for 15 to 20 seconds and I get amazing lashes. It sometimes does pinch, but just a little adjusting and no problem at all. It&#x27;s well worth it for the curl you get. I&#x27;ve even had to curl last till the next day.  The quality of the curler is good. It&#x27;s strong and comfortable to hold. The shape of it is very different then the curler I have. Overall it&#x27;s a good curler and I would recommend it.

            <li> Super Fast Shipping..I really love this eyelash curler and the box it came in..&lt;br /&gt;Curls great and no pinching..</li>
            <li> Good curler - didn&#x27;t pinch my cheek like another brand did (where the metal of the handles come together) - did not pinch the corners of my eyes, curls well, I&#x27;m happy with it :)</li>
            <li> By far, the best eye lash curler I had use. And believe me when I say, this curler works better than the expensive ones! The curler easily fits in your hand. The handle has soft grips which is comfort for your fingers as you squeeze the curler.  Light and very easy to use. The curler fit my eye and I was able to curl all of my lashes at once. Other curlers I have used, I had trouble with getting all of my lashes curled at once. I experienced no tugging or pulling. I barely had to squeeze the curler. The results were amazing! The package comes with an extra silicone refill pad. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have not used an eyelash curler in quite a few years. I always struggled to find one that fit correctly and one that wouldn&#x27;t pull my eyelashes out. So I was reluctant to order more this product does these perfectly. Fits my lashes in comfortably and does not rip my eyelashes out. Very happy to have curly eyelashes again that stay curled  I also love this product is not bulky very easy to take with you on the go</li>
            <li> This is absolutely wonderful! Never had an eyelash curler work so well! My lashes look great!! Definitely recommend it! Shipping was sooo fast too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I expected from this curler.  It is just a basic curler nothing special.</li>
    </ol>
