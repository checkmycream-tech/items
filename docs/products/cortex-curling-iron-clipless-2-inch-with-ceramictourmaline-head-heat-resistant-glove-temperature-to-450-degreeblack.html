            <li>I LOVED THIS ITEM...</li>
            <li>You have to hold it curled for twenty seconds before it will make a good curl.</li>
            <li>I have a skinny want and it takes like five seconds max to get a good curl.</li>
            <li>I went to Walmart to buy a cheap curling iron and it works great!!!</li>

            <li>great quality and cheap!</li>

            <li>good product &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a glove and then a velcro tape thing to tidy up cord.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly and packaged nicely!  </li>
            <li>This is a great wand &amp; perfect barrel for long hair.</li>
            <li>love love thank you amazon!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good at keeping its curls in and it doesnt hurt my hair as much because its ceramic.</li>
            <li>Though it is fairly unclear in the details, it&#x27;s two inches, huge.</li>
            <li>It came packaged suitable for a gift.</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>Their irons get very hot and can make your hair look amazing in under 10 minutes!</li>
            <li>It work good heats up really high, But that a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love the cortex curling irons.  </li>
            <li>I love these irons.</li>
            <li>it would be easier than irons with the clip but not even sure about that anymore.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain :)</li>
            <li>Love this heats up</li>
            <li>but the size isn&#x27;t a 2inch its more of a 1 inch</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like... 1 inch or maybe 1 1/4 inch.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but nothing to write home about.  </li>
            <li>but you have way more control over your curls.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great price and got to the house very soon.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>works great and very reliable.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t get a better one for the price.</li>
            <li>The price was even better.</li>
            <li>it was ok t</li>
            <li>all in all - i love it.</li>
            <li>I love this wand</li>
            <li>and I will not be purchasing anything more from this company.</li>
            <li>I gave the product two stars because the curling iron itself is an okay product - it was just not what was advertised on the website or box.</li>
            <li>This iron is perfect for making loose waves.</li>
            <li>I had the Cortx Curling Iron in 1.5 and loved it so much I wanted to buy this one.</li>
            <li>However the cord gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li>It comes up to heat very quick.</li>
            <li>I think it would be perfect for all lengths of hair to give you those loose waves which are very in right now.</li>
            <li>I only gave this hot &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; 4 stars because I&#x27;d really prefer the tappered barrel instead of the one-size diameter, but otherwise, it works perfectly and the glove is as good as any glove could be holding up to 450 degree heat.  </li>
            <li>This curling iron came fast (2 day shipping) and in a very stylish box.</li>
            <li>Gives me beautiful curls that last!</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t able to get the full strand on the wand.</li>
            <li>This Iron gets very hot very quickly and creates perfect loose beach waves.</li>
            <li>Awesome product...one of the only 2 inch clipless curling irons I could find after shopping around.&lt;br /&gt;Great product at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>BUT I HAVE FINE HAIR</li>
            <li>it works fine.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve used my fair share of wands and so far this is one of my favorites!  </li>
            <li>I found the iron very easy to use from the get-go, despite my first use of a clip-less iron.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Package is nice and fitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curler heats up fast and works well.</li>
            <li>a great tool for creating larger curls/waves!</li>
            <li>and this is perfect for creating nice loose curls that last!  </li>
            <li>This curling wand creates beautiful loose waves in my hair!</li>
            <li>However, my new curling iron and this glove are super effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot which I love.  </li>
            <li>Great size curls for medium to long hair.</li>
            <li>HAVING IT REALLY HOT WORKS BETTER FOR ME</li>
            <li>It gets really hot, so the top of your ear, forearm and neck tend to get it.</li>
            <li>so i was happy when this want curled and kept the curl all day long.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair very full, large waves!  </li>
            <li>The curling iron itself is very light (much lighter than my 1&amp;#34; curling wand).</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t imagine having a true 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Overall a good iron..</li>
            <li>Thanks she love it</li>
            <li>comes in a great little box that&#x27;s easy to travel with as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Beautiful for big soft waves, so easy to use and for every hair type.</li>
            <li>I have very straight fine hair</li>
            <li>...spend a little more and get a good one</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super fast.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>It gets very hot.  </li>
            <li>I love my smaller Cortex iron which still works fine.</li>
            <li>Amazing, so simple to use though the wire gets in the way at times.</li>
            <li>I never had a curling iron that didn&#x27;t have a clasp before, so the whole idea of using this glove seemed totally bizarre t me.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the money though.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite hair tool.</li>
            <li>You only have to leave your hair wrapped around this wand about 7 seconds which minimizes the amount of heat damage which is nice.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t know how to use it, your hair will look the same, just warm because of the heat.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a recommended product.</li>
            <li>Have gotten many compliments so far.</li>
            <li>With that being said, this is my only wand that I own right now</li>
            <li>Gets super hot.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, retains heat for the 30-40 minutes it takes to curl my whole head and easy to use unlike the tapered wands.</li>
            <li>The iron does heat to a very high heat and it is very easy to burn yourself if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>i got the 2 inch curler and it works as promised, createing exactly the right size lose waves.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a large curling iron like I was, do not buy this!</li>
            <li>You have to make sure the cord is set up the right way so that it actually stays on the counter and not fall over.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that...</li>
            <li>It does get super hot... but almost too much of a pain to work with.</li>
            <li>This curling iron works fine as far as curling irons go.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the curl definition that this curling wand gives my hair; much different than a curling iron.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was expecting in a 2 inch curling iron.</li>
            <li>so if you are wanting this iron because you think it might work better than a regular one- don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>and I needed up curling most of the girls hair with my wand because the clipping iron that was being used was not creating a lasting curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it no longer gets hot.</li>
            <li>first of all, i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s 2 inches...  </li>
            <li>Other than that I love this!</li>
            <li>Pretty deceiving imho...</li>
            <li>It does get really hot</li>
            <li>it gets hot and the curl stays.</li>
            <li>The wands are so easy to use (though, it does take a few too many burns to get used to) and my hair has never held a curl in my life before I started using Cortex curling irons.</li>
            <li>Curling wand gets super hot, and works perfectly with my hairstyle (long medium thick straight hair).</li>
            <li>i still have my shi flat iron, but i do love these curling wands.</li>
            <li>First off -- this wand isn&#x27;t really 2&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended a clip less curling iron and her hair loos amazing ...</li>
            <li>At first I thought it short circuited and stopped working, but realized it was still on, the light just went out.</li>
            <li>Today while I was using it, I sat it on the counter to grab another section of hair, and a large spark exploded from the bottom of the wand.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy another large barrel iron when I get around to it.</li>
            <li>It is very high quality iron</li>
            <li>so it gives it a nice little wave and makes it so bouncy.  </li>
            <li>and it heats up fast</li>
            <li>The only thing that happened was the light to say that it was on went out.</li>
            <li>AND IT HEATS REALLY FAST.</li>
            <li>but I am still really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, unit is dual voltage can be used in 110v or 220v</li>
            <li>Very hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tip of the curler could be covered with a rubber to prevent getting burnt.</li>
            <li>Had the Sedu which costs 4x as much and didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>I really like this wand...</li>
            <li>I really do like this curling iron.</li>
            <li>I really hope Cortex has updated this iron</li>
            <li>because I was looking for a much wider wand.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li>It does not have a temperature guage, nor a way of indicating the it has reached a temperature ready for use, in any case.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair as much even though there is no temperature adjustment.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not really quite sure how the 2&amp;#34; was measured for this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>I loved it until it shorted out slowly within about a year of having it.</li>
            <li>I bought the smaller size first and loved it so much inbought this one as well (all for half the price of a salon one)</li>
            <li>Product works great, heats up to 450, I have coarse hair and the heat is sufficient for long lasting curls.</li>
            <li>Although this is not 2&amp;#34; in diameter, it IS 2&amp;#34; from the top to the bottom (half the circumference).  </li>
            <li>But all in all its a decent wand.</li>
            <li>People with finer hair may be prone to damage at the high temperature.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend buying this 2&amp;#34; curling wand.</li>
            <li>I have thick, straight long hair with medium-course texture and the iron created beautiful soft curls.</li>
            <li>With a little repositioning, I was able to get it to work, but that was probably the biggest mistake.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so simple to use and it gets extremely hot, 450 degrees Fahrenheit!</li>
            <li>its a nice curling iron, sturdy but stil hard to use..</li>
            <li>So far after having this product for a month and using it a handful of times I do really like the way it curls my hair.  </li>
            <li>Also, user must make sure they know how to read the on/off button correctly since there is no light.</li>
            <li>I really love the clip less curling iron!</li>
            <li>other than that its fine</li>
            <li>this wand makes decent curls but does not get hot enough.</li>
            <li>I purchased a Hot Tools 2&amp;#34; clipped curling iron in the same order and there is a severely visible difference that it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t care to use the glove, but a couple times I forgot how hot the tip was since there&#x27;s no plastic protector and came a bit too close to my fingers.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast (&lt;45 secs) and switch to turn on lights up blue when ON, which is an improvement from my older Cortex iron that had no indicator showing iron was on.</li>
            <li>I know this all sounds super fake, but I&#x27;m being sincere.</li>
            <li>you get  a professional curl since there is no clamp</li>
            <li>far-</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 19 year old daughter and she loves it.  </li>
            <li>The Cortex representative even said that the curling iron is maybe 1.7 inches, which is not too far off from two inches.</li>
            <li>First, it is not clear from the product description, but the barrel of this iron is 2 inches.</li>
            <li>I really liked this wand, my hair is difficult to curl and it has worked really well.</li>
            <li>I love that I finally found a clip less curling iron that is 2 inches without having to pay over 100$!</li>
            <li>It is very easy to burn yourself (granted, my hair is very long), and the glove does very little.</li>
            <li>This product though is probably better as a second curler simply because it has such a large barrel if you&#x27;re just starting out with a clip less.</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair and it works so well.</li>
            <li>That said, be careful, it gets extremely hot.</li>
            <li>It is not a 2&amp;#34; wand (maybe 1.5&amp;#34;) and it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; in that it does get hot but not hot  enough to actually curl hair.</li>
            <li>Also, it claims to be a professional grade, but I feel like it&#x27;s not very hot nor is it THAT fast heating.  </li>
            <li>I really like the loose curl/wave look</li>
            <li>Recommend to anyone with long hair and steady hands.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work too well with my fine, thick hair.</li>
            <li>Apparently you can&#x27;t insert pictures because I took one for you to advise how big/wide</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t stay curly for very long and it goes back to being straight after a couple of hours (about 2-3).</li>
            <li>Other than that, it heats up fast and has a lifetime warranty.</li>
            <li>Finally found a curling iron to give soft curls that last all day.  </li>
            <li>Either way, it certainly was NOT hot enough.</li>
            <li>I have several clip less curling irons (pro curling iron, babyliss pro and hot tools)</li>
            <li>Takes a  long time to heat up and doesn&#x27;t get as hot as other wands I have used.</li>
            <li>I have long and thick hair, but I can get perfect loose curls with no effort in 20 minutes (very thick and long hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> The glove is a great bonus and also a great quality.</li>
            <li> The curling iron itself is great.</li>
            <li> but it works great.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s great compared to 30-40).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> in all, I think this is definitely a great buy</li>
            <li> Works amazing!</li>
            <li> I am giving as a christmas gift, so I cannot give a review, but I am sure it will be great!</li>
            <li> I LOVED THIS ITEM...</li>
            <li> You have to hold it curled for twenty seconds before it will make a good curl.</li>
            <li> I have a skinny want and it takes like five seconds max to get a good curl.</li>
            <li> I went to Walmart to buy a cheap curling iron and it works great!!!</li>
            <li> quick makes the perfect waves or curl!</li>
            <li> great quality and cheap!</li>
            <li> The price is phenomenal though, just look at that list price!</li>

            <li> This is a great wand &amp; perfect barrel for long hair.</li>
            <li> love love thank you amazon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good at keeping its curls in and it doesnt hurt my hair as much because its ceramic.</li>
            <li> Though it is fairly unclear in the details, it&#x27;s two inches, huge.</li>
            <li> It came packaged suitable for a gift.</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>

            <li> It work good heats up really high, But that a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love the cortex curling irons.  </li>
            <li> I love these irons.</li>
            <li> it would be easier than irons with the clip but not even sure about that anymore.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain :)</li>
            <li> Love this heats up</li>
            <li> but the size isn&#x27;t a 2inch its more of a 1 inch</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like... 1 inch or maybe 1 1/4 inch.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but nothing to write home about.  </li>
            <li> but you have way more control over your curls.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great price and got to the house very soon.</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> works great and very reliable.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t get a better one for the price.</li>
            <li> The price was even better.</li>
            <li> it was ok t</li>
            <li> all in all - i love it.</li>
            <li> I love this wand</li>
            <li> and I will not be purchasing anything more from this company.</li>
            <li> I gave the product two stars because the curling iron itself is an okay product - it was just not what was advertised on the website or box.</li>
            <li> This iron is perfect for making loose waves.</li>
            <li> I had the Cortx Curling Iron in 1.5 and loved it so much I wanted to buy this one.</li>
            <li> However the cord gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li> It comes up to heat very quick.</li>
            <li> I think it would be perfect for all lengths of hair to give you those loose waves which are very in right now.</li>
            <li> I only gave this hot &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; 4 stars because I&#x27;d really prefer the tappered barrel instead of the one-size diameter, but otherwise, it works perfectly and the glove is as good as any glove could be holding up to 450 degree heat.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron came fast (2 day shipping) and in a very stylish box.</li>
            <li> Gives me beautiful curls that last!</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t able to get the full strand on the wand.</li>
            <li> This Iron gets very hot very quickly and creates perfect loose beach waves.</li>
            <li> Awesome product...one of the only 2 inch clipless curling irons I could find after shopping around.&lt;br /&gt;Great product at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> BUT I HAVE FINE HAIR</li>
            <li> it works fine.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve used my fair share of wands and so far this is one of my favorites!  </li>
            <li> I found the iron very easy to use from the get-go, despite my first use of a clip-less iron.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Package is nice and fitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curler heats up fast and works well.</li>
            <li> a great tool for creating larger curls/waves!</li>
            <li> and this is perfect for creating nice loose curls that last!  </li>
            <li> This curling wand creates beautiful loose waves in my hair!</li>
            <li> However, my new curling iron and this glove are super effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot which I love.  </li>
            <li> Great size curls for medium to long hair.</li>
            <li> HAVING IT REALLY HOT WORKS BETTER FOR ME</li>
            <li> It gets really hot, so the top of your ear, forearm and neck tend to get it.</li>
            <li> so i was happy when this want curled and kept the curl all day long.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair very full, large waves!  </li>
            <li> The curling iron itself is very light (much lighter than my 1&amp;#34; curling wand).</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t imagine having a true 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Overall a good iron..</li>
            <li> Thanks she love it</li>
            <li> comes in a great little box that&#x27;s easy to travel with as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beautiful for big soft waves, so easy to use and for every hair type.</li>
            <li> I have very straight fine hair</li>
            <li> ...spend a little more and get a good one</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super fast.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> It gets very hot.  </li>
            <li> I love my smaller Cortex iron which still works fine.</li>
            <li> Amazing, so simple to use though the wire gets in the way at times.</li>
            <li> I never had a curling iron that didn&#x27;t have a clasp before, so the whole idea of using this glove seemed totally bizarre t me.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth the money though.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite hair tool.</li>
            <li> You only have to leave your hair wrapped around this wand about 7 seconds which minimizes the amount of heat damage which is nice.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know how to use it, your hair will look the same, just warm because of the heat.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a recommended product.</li>
            <li> Have gotten many compliments so far.</li>
            <li> With that being said, this is my only wand that I own right now</li>
            <li> Gets super hot.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, retains heat for the 30-40 minutes it takes to curl my whole head and easy to use unlike the tapered wands.</li>
            <li> The iron does heat to a very high heat and it is very easy to burn yourself if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> i got the 2 inch curler and it works as promised, createing exactly the right size lose waves.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a large curling iron like I was, do not buy this!</li>
            <li> You have to make sure the cord is set up the right way so that it actually stays on the counter and not fall over.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that...</li>
            <li> It does get super hot... but almost too much of a pain to work with.</li>
            <li> This curling iron works fine as far as curling irons go.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the curl definition that this curling wand gives my hair; much different than a curling iron.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was expecting in a 2 inch curling iron.</li>
            <li> so if you are wanting this iron because you think it might work better than a regular one- don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> and I needed up curling most of the girls hair with my wand because the clipping iron that was being used was not creating a lasting curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it no longer gets hot.</li>
            <li> first of all, i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s 2 inches...  </li>
            <li> Other than that I love this!</li>
            <li> Pretty deceiving imho...</li>
            <li> It does get really hot</li>
            <li> it gets hot and the curl stays.</li>
            <li> The wands are so easy to use (though, it does take a few too many burns to get used to) and my hair has never held a curl in my life before I started using Cortex curling irons.</li>
            <li> Curling wand gets super hot, and works perfectly with my hairstyle (long medium thick straight hair).</li>
            <li> i still have my shi flat iron, but i do love these curling wands.</li>
            <li> First off -- this wand isn&#x27;t really 2&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended a clip less curling iron and her hair loos amazing ...</li>
            <li> At first I thought it short circuited and stopped working, but realized it was still on, the light just went out.</li>
            <li> Today while I was using it, I sat it on the counter to grab another section of hair, and a large spark exploded from the bottom of the wand.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy another large barrel iron when I get around to it.</li>
            <li> It is very high quality iron</li>
            <li> so it gives it a nice little wave and makes it so bouncy.  </li>
            <li> and it heats up fast</li>
            <li> The only thing that happened was the light to say that it was on went out.</li>
            <li> AND IT HEATS REALLY FAST.</li>
            <li> but I am still really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, unit is dual voltage can be used in 110v or 220v</li>
            <li> Very hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tip of the curler could be covered with a rubber to prevent getting burnt.</li>
            <li> Had the Sedu which costs 4x as much and didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I really like this wand...</li>
            <li> I really do like this curling iron.</li>
            <li> I really hope Cortex has updated this iron</li>
            <li> because I was looking for a much wider wand.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li> It does not have a temperature guage, nor a way of indicating the it has reached a temperature ready for use, in any case.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair as much even though there is no temperature adjustment.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not really quite sure how the 2&amp;#34; was measured for this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I loved it until it shorted out slowly within about a year of having it.</li>
            <li> I bought the smaller size first and loved it so much inbought this one as well (all for half the price of a salon one)</li>
            <li> Product works great, heats up to 450, I have coarse hair and the heat is sufficient for long lasting curls.</li>
            <li> Although this is not 2&amp;#34; in diameter, it IS 2&amp;#34; from the top to the bottom (half the circumference).  </li>
            <li> But all in all its a decent wand.</li>
            <li> People with finer hair may be prone to damage at the high temperature.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend buying this 2&amp;#34; curling wand.</li>
            <li> I have thick, straight long hair with medium-course texture and the iron created beautiful soft curls.</li>
            <li> With a little repositioning, I was able to get it to work, but that was probably the biggest mistake.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so simple to use and it gets extremely hot, 450 degrees Fahrenheit!</li>
            <li> its a nice curling iron, sturdy but stil hard to use..</li>
            <li> So far after having this product for a month and using it a handful of times I do really like the way it curls my hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, user must make sure they know how to read the on/off button correctly since there is no light.</li>
            <li> I really love the clip less curling iron!</li>
            <li> other than that its fine</li>
            <li> this wand makes decent curls but does not get hot enough.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Hot Tools 2&amp;#34; clipped curling iron in the same order and there is a severely visible difference that it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t care to use the glove, but a couple times I forgot how hot the tip was since there&#x27;s no plastic protector and came a bit too close to my fingers.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast (&lt;45 secs) and switch to turn on lights up blue when ON, which is an improvement from my older Cortex iron that had no indicator showing iron was on.</li>
            <li> I know this all sounds super fake, but I&#x27;m being sincere.</li>
            <li> you get  a professional curl since there is no clamp</li>
            <li> far-</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 19 year old daughter and she loves it.  </li>
            <li> The Cortex representative even said that the curling iron is maybe 1.7 inches, which is not too far off from two inches.</li>
            <li> First, it is not clear from the product description, but the barrel of this iron is 2 inches.</li>
            <li> I really liked this wand, my hair is difficult to curl and it has worked really well.</li>
            <li> I love that I finally found a clip less curling iron that is 2 inches without having to pay over 100$!</li>
            <li> It is very easy to burn yourself (granted, my hair is very long), and the glove does very little.</li>
            <li> This product though is probably better as a second curler simply because it has such a large barrel if you&#x27;re just starting out with a clip less.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair and it works so well.</li>
            <li> That said, be careful, it gets extremely hot.</li>
            <li> It is not a 2&amp;#34; wand (maybe 1.5&amp;#34;) and it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; in that it does get hot but not hot  enough to actually curl hair.</li>
            <li> Also, it claims to be a professional grade, but I feel like it&#x27;s not very hot nor is it THAT fast heating.  </li>
            <li> I really like the loose curl/wave look</li>
            <li> Recommend to anyone with long hair and steady hands.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work too well with my fine, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Apparently you can&#x27;t insert pictures because I took one for you to advise how big/wide</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t stay curly for very long and it goes back to being straight after a couple of hours (about 2-3).</li>
            <li> Other than that, it heats up fast and has a lifetime warranty.</li>
            <li> Finally found a curling iron to give soft curls that last all day.  </li>
            <li> Either way, it certainly was NOT hot enough.</li>
            <li> I have several clip less curling irons (pro curling iron, babyliss pro and hot tools)</li>
            <li> Takes a  long time to heat up and doesn&#x27;t get as hot as other wands I have used.</li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair, but I can get perfect loose curls with no effort in 20 minutes (very thick and long hair</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair (down to my lower back) and this wand gave me the big loose curls I was going for.</li>
            <li> even took it to a pre-wedding party to get ready with all the girls this past weekend</li>
            <li> I let it heat up while I&#x27;m drying my hair, which usually takes about 7 minutes, and by the time I&#x27;m ready to curl my hair</li>
            <li> The barrell seems short, I have long hair</li>
            <li> It also has a cord which is covered in a type of red netting no difference in the quality though, just a minor detail gone unmentioned.</li>
            <li> the curls don&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> This wand gave me big, loose, wavy curls.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t adjust the temp, but there really is no need to...keep your hair wrapped around it long enough to curl but not so long it burns...pretty simple.</li>
            <li> For me, this was very easy to use, however my sisters seemed to have a very difficult time trying to curl their hair with it.</li>
            <li> She has long thick hair and this wand allows her to create large flowing curls.  </li>
            <li> If you have very thick or curly hair, it may not be hot enough.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> but herd grey reviews about Cortex.</li>
            <li> The only thing I have to say about it is: be careful using it!</li>
            <li> Plus your hair will keeps its curl for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It turns off and on while I&#x27;m using it like the electrical cord is loose.  </li>
            <li> this is geat for loose flowy curls.</li>
            <li> The size of the barrel gives me loose Kardashian style waves.</li>
            <li> ONLY DOWN SIDE IS THAT IT DOESNT HAVE A TEMP CONTROL...</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a smaller curl wand that gives tight curls...</li>
            <li> The size seems to be a little smaller than 2 inches</li>
            <li> Nowhere near 1.5 inches at least, if it were I would have kept it...</li>
            <li> Just gotta be careful about burning yourself.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected, could not return since I missed the deadline.  </li>
            <li> After regular use for a few months, it had stopped working intermittently.</li>
            <li> The delivery came as expected with no problems.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was after a few months, the plug and cord separated, causing it to spark every time I plug it in.</li>
            <li> I called Cortex to see what they would say and their response was that the curling iron was measured in millimeters so when it was converted to inches, it was thrown off a bit (this response makes absolutely no sense).</li>
            <li> I searched for a very long time for an iron that would not give me &amp;#34;prom curls&amp;#34; this iron is IT!!  </li>
            <li> they do not hold as long as the tighter waves with my other curler, but it is to be expected, since the diameter is much larger than the usual inch  or inch and a half curling irons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to buy a new one (after the price also went up $20) but if this happens again, I&#x27;ll be extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I want to also add that my curls stay in place for days until i wash it and isnt as damaging as other curling irons i have used.  </li>
            <li> my stylist had the other brand of cortex they make one brazzilia (spell)??</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first based on some of the reviews, but decided to go for it and make the purchase.</li>
            <li> Extremely deceiving and the seller does not accept returns so now I&#x27;m stuck with</li>
            <li> Offered here for much less than other places.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t heat up enough and hardly curls the hair.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews that complained that this curling iron heats up too much--I beg to differ.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve been getting tired of always wearing it straight or in a pony tail (my go-to style when i&#x27;m too lazy to wash it).</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a temperature control.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that there is nothing to stabilize it and it can roll off of the counter.</li>
            <li> When I set it down somewhere it would just roll all over the place.</li>
            <li> Huge disappointment!</li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t get a tight curl which also means it wont hold as well.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a few months but have used it less than 10 times</li>
            <li> but it takes a little while to heat</li>
            <li> /&gt;The biggest con with this iron is that there is no temperature control and no light for the on off switch.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get it, the box says 2&amp;#34; the Amazon item description says 2&amp;#34; but what is given to you falls extremely short on 2&amp;#34;... Absolutely false advertisement on Cortex&#x27;s side.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick and long hair</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that since the barrel is larger/heavier than the handle, it tends to rest directly on the heated barrel when placed on a table (afraid that it may scorch my dresser!).</li>
            <li> As I was curling my hair, there was a spark and a small flame where the cord and curling iron was connected.  </li>
            <li> , however I bought this specifically because I need at MINIMUM a 1.5 inch barrel for my hair, so this sadly has to go back.</li>
            <li> Electrical cord is wrapped in black/red cloth cord (not sure if this will hold up with time).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Anyway, i bought this 2&amp;#34; curling iron because I already have a 1&amp;#34; and got a little tired of how the 1&amp;#34; made my hair look.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, which may be why this didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> have thick hair and it did not hold a curl.</li>
            <li> But I am truly disappointed that its sold as something it is definitely not!</li>
            <li> ; look.&lt;br /&gt;However, for those that do not really know how to curl their hair with even the irons with clips, this would probably be very difficult.</li>
            <li> What a waste of Money!!!</li>
            <li> waste of money.  :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they measure this weird</li>
            <li> My hair is difficult to curl</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;instructions&amp;#34; that come with it are for an iron with two plates, so they are useless, too.</li>
            <li> Product description is wrong, it&#x27;s a 1-in curling iron.</li>
            <li> The glove doesn&#x27;t help protect from heat and is also awkward to use with your hair.</li>
            <li> However, with practice, you shall become a master and have celebrity-like hair without an expensive stylist!</li>
            <li> bad if that&#x27;s what you are looking for</li>
            <li> So thats why i bought the 2 inch; but it seems it doesnt work as well. :(</li>
            <li> cord is sort of annoying because it tends to not be stable when placing the iron on a counter.</li>
            <li> I hate the visible marks they leave.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely love the curl definition that this curling wand gives my hair; much different than a curling iron. The only thing I have to say about it is: be careful using it! It is very easy to burn yourself (granted, my hair is very long), and the glove does very little. However, with practice, you shall become a master and have celebrity-like hair without an expensive stylist!</li>
            <li> First, it is not clear from the product description, but the barrel of this iron is 2 inches. I found the iron very easy to use from the get-go, despite my first use of a clip-less iron. I have thick, straight long hair with medium-course texture and the iron created beautiful soft curls. The iron does heat to a very high heat and it is very easy to burn yourself if you are not careful. The glove provided does help you hold the hair around the iron to allow curls to set. Curler seems to heat up in about 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest con with this iron is that there is no temperature control and no light for the on off switch. People with finer hair may be prone to damage at the high temperature. Also, user must make sure they know how to read the on/off button correctly since there is no light. I leave unplugged when not in use, to be safest.</li>
            <li> I am giving as a christmas gift, so I cannot give a review, but I am sure it will be great!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife as a present. She uses it just about every day! The size seems to be a little smaller than 2 inches but she is still very happy with it. It comes with a glove that she also uses. 5 stars because my wife didn&#x27;t want to return it xD</li>
            <li> Love it but the glove could be thicker</li>
            <li> Although this is not 2&amp;#34; in diameter, it IS 2&amp;#34; from the top to the bottom (half the circumference).  I have long hair and I can&#x27;t imagine having a true 2&amp;#34; diameter barrel.  I don&#x27;t think it would hold a curl in anybody&#x27;s hair at that size!  This is almost too big for my hair.  It gets really hot which I love.  Just gotta be careful about burning yourself.  I don&#x27;t like to use the glove so I hold the bottom of my hair away from the barrel for a straight-end look.</li>
            <li> I love the cortex curling irons.  you get  a professional curl since there is no clamp and it heats up fast and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  love love thank you amazon!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, could not return since I missed the deadline.  waste of money.  :(</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product. When mine arrived I tryied it but never got to work, it just never turned on. What a waste of time!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> 1 inch is perfect! So thats why i bought the 2 inch; but it seems it doesnt work as well. :(</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was expecting in a 2 inch curling iron. The only thing that happened was the light to say that it was on went out. At first I thought it short circuited and stopped working, but realized it was still on, the light just went out. Not a huge deal. The curling iron is awesome! Great size curls for medium to long hair.</li>
            <li> Finally found a curling iron to give soft curls that last all day.  My hair is shoulder length so it gives it a nice little wave and makes it so bouncy.  When I go out I wear human hair 18&amp;#34; ext. and this is perfect for creating nice loose curls that last!  You can&#x27;t adjust the temp, but there really is no need to...keep your hair wrapped around it long enough to curl but not so long it burns...pretty simple.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually start using the product until 2 months after I purchased it.  It worked great until one day I noticed it didn&#x27;t heat up when I turned it on.  With a little repositioning, I was able to get it to work, but that was probably the biggest mistake.  As I was curling my hair, there was a spark and a small flame where the cord and curling iron was connected.  MY HAIR ALMOST CAUGHT ON FIRE!  I didn&#x27;t register my warranty within 90days and the company has not returned any emails regarding this matter.  Very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing, so simple to use though the wire gets in the way at times.</li>
            <li> This curling iron works fine as far as curling irons go. I feel like the barrel is smaller than depicted. It does get super hot... but almost too much of a pain to work with. The glove doesn&#x27;t help protect from heat and is also awkward to use with your hair. I think the clipless iron is overrated. I get the same results from a clip iron...so if you are wanting this iron because you think it might work better than a regular one- don&#x27;t bother. The curls I get were also not big and voluminous they were the same curls you would expect to get using a 1&amp;#34; curling iron. Wish I had the money back rather than this curling iron collecting dust in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> Awesome product...one of the only 2 inch clipless curling irons I could find after shopping around.&lt;br /&gt;Great product at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, smooth transaction. I would purchase again and would recommend. Also the item was just as described online.</li>
            <li> Overall a good iron.. However the cord gets tangled easily. I&#x27;m gunna stick to my regular clip curling iron. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Works as well as my MUCH more expensive, smaller curling wand so I&#x27;m very happy with that!! Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I LOVED THIS ITEM... WILL BUY IF I HAVE TOO. I HAD IT FOR 2 WEEKS AND IT HEATS REALLY FAST. THE ONLY DOWN SIDE IS THAT IT DOESNT HAVE A TEMP CONTROL... BUT I HAVE FINE HAIR SO, HAVING IT REALLY HOT WORKS BETTER FOR ME</li>
            <li> I love these irons. I to this day can not use a clipping curling iron. The wands are so easy to use (though, it does take a few too many burns to get used to) and my hair has never held a curl in my life before I started using Cortex curling irons. I know this all sounds super fake, but I&#x27;m being sincere. With my smaller iron I don&#x27;t even use hair spray or any setting/holding spray even. With the bigger wand my hair tend to give into gravity and it will loosen if I don&#x27;t use a hair spray of some sort... but I am still really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even took it to a pre-wedding party to get ready with all the girls this past weekend and I needed up curling most of the girls hair with my wand because the clipping iron that was being used was not creating a lasting curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a few months but have used it less than 10 times and it no longer gets hot.</li>
            <li> I only gave this hot &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; 4 stars because I&#x27;d really prefer the tappered barrel instead of the one-size diameter, but otherwise, it works perfectly and the glove is as good as any glove could be holding up to 450 degree heat.  It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> its a nice curling iron, sturdy but stil hard to use..so i dont use it its just collecting dust.&lt;br /&gt;thought it would be easier than irons with the clip but not even sure about that anymore.</li>
            <li> It works great, heats up just fine. I can&#x27;t complain :) I definitely recommend it! A must buy! ........... .</li>
            <li> Love this heats up quick makes the perfect waves or curl! but the size isn&#x27;t a 2inch its more of a 1 inch</li>
            <li> I read several reviews that complained that this curling iron heats up too much--I beg to differ. This curling iron doesn&#x27;t heat up enough. I have several clip less curling irons (pro curling iron, babyliss pro and hot tools) but herd grey reviews about Cortex. I am very disappointed. I have thick hair, which may be why this didn&#x27;t work for me. Either way, it certainly was NOT hot enough. You could touch the curling iron and it won&#x27;t singe your fingers like my others do lol.</li>
            <li> first of all, i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s 2 inches...  It&#x27;s more like... 1 inch or maybe 1 1/4 inch.  Also, it claims to be a professional grade, but I feel like it&#x27;s not very hot nor is it THAT fast heating.  The fact that there is no digital read on the temperature is a bummer too.  With that being said, this is my only wand that I own right now so I still use it rather regularly.  It does the job... but then again, my hair holds curl rather well.  It&#x27;s ok, but nothing to write home about.  Worth the money though.</li>
            <li> Love love love! Gives me beautiful curls that last! Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended a clip less curling iron and her hair loos amazing ...but this did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair and it did not hold a curl. I also burned myself several times.</li>
            <li> I wanted a curling iron made of ceramic because is eassy for me to use but when I saw it i realized that it is made of titanium</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, unit is dual voltage can be used in 110v or 220v environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package is nice and fitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curler heats up fast and works well. Very hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tip of the curler could be covered with a rubber to prevent getting burnt.</li>
            <li> Offered here for much less than other places. Very satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> Takes a  long time to heat up and doesn&#x27;t get as hot as other wands I have used. The barrell seems short, I have long hair and I wasn&#x27;t able to get the full strand on the wand.</li>
            <li> When I set it down somewhere it would just roll all over the place. I wish it had something to hold it in place.</li>
            <li> I love that I finally found a clip less curling iron that is 2 inches without having to pay over 100$! and it works so well!!!</li>
            <li> It turns off and on while I&#x27;m using it like the electrical cord is loose.  Not worth the money...spend a little more and get a good one</li>
            <li> I really love the clip less curling iron! It&#x27;s so simple to use and it gets extremely hot, 450 degrees Fahrenheit! Though it is fairly unclear in the details, it&#x27;s two inches, huge. Now if you have longer hair this is geat for loose flowy curls. It also has a cord which is covered in a type of red netting no difference in the quality though, just a minor detail gone unmentioned. This product though is probably better as a second curler simply because it has such a large barrel if you&#x27;re just starting out with a clip less. The price is phenomenal though, just look at that list price! Got to love Amazon!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t say it but it comes with a glove.  I bought one when I didn&#x27;t need to.  But it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Works amazing! Had the Sedu which costs 4x as much and didn&#x27;t work as well. This one gets hotter and works perfectly. I don&#x27;t know why they measure this weird but it&#x27;s not 2&amp;#34;! I believe this one is 1 1/4&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Product works great, heats up to 450, I have coarse hair and the heat is sufficient for long lasting curls.</li>
            <li> Only used it once or twice a week for six months and it stopped working. Doesn&#x27;t heat up at all. Lifetime guarantee if I could get a return email on how to send it back</li>
            <li> I really like this wand...but it takes a little while to heat up.&lt;br /&gt;The cord is sort of annoying because it tends to not be stable when placing the iron on a counter. You have to make sure the cord is set up the right way so that it actually stays on the counter and not fall over.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that...it works fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for over a year and only recently started using it regularly. After regular use for a few months, it had stopped working intermittently. Today while I was using it, I sat it on the counter to grab another section of hair, and a large spark exploded from the bottom of the wand. I have reached out to Cortex customer service, as they advertise a lifetime warranty on their website, if they take care of my issue, I will increase my rating.. I really liked this wand, my hair is difficult to curl and it has worked really well.</li>
            <li> I really do like this curling iron. It gives you the ability to create different kinds of curls and/or waves.  That said, be careful, it gets extremely hot. Not only can it burn your hair, it can burn you.</li>
            <li> I had purchased one of these at a clearance store and lost it.&lt;br /&gt;I was devastated cause it is the best hair styling product I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;It takes some getting used to but you have way more control over your curls.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s super fast.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is, I have burned my self ALOT.  It gets really hot, so the top of your ear, forearm and neck tend to get it.</li>
            <li> The only curling iron I will use on my hair. It comes up to heat very quick. Plus your hair will keeps its curl for a very long time. AAA+++++++++</li>
            <li> This is NOT a 2&amp;#34; iron, maybe 1.5, def not 2&amp;#34;. I have not used the iron as I have another cortex iron and I know they work great. But I am truly disappointed that its sold as something it is definitely not!</li>
            <li> This is a great wand &amp; perfect barrel for long hair. My hair is about to my bra line. And I wanted celebrity hair. Works great!</li>
            <li> I loved it until it shorted out slowly within about a year of having it. It no longer works at all. WIsh I could get a refund or replacement but haven&#x27;t looked into it&#x27;s warranty. I love my smaller Cortex iron which still works fine. Great price. I plan to buy another large barrel iron when I get around to it. I really hope Cortex has updated this iron so my next won&#x27;t short out and die on me. Their irons get very hot and can make your hair look amazing in under 10 minutes! I have very straight fine hair and I never want to use another iron with a clip again... I hate the visible marks they leave.</li>
            <li> This Iron gets very hot very quickly and creates perfect loose beach waves. I searched for a very long time for an iron that would not give me &amp;#34;prom curls&amp;#34; this iron is IT!!  I have had mine for over a year now and it still works perfectly. I want to also add that my curls stay in place for days until i wash it and isnt as damaging as other curling irons i have used.  I definately reccommend this iron to anyone who is looking for those celebrity waves without paying a fortune !</li>
            <li> Love these curling wands! They are 100% ceramic, and heat up in seconds! I bought the smaller size first and loved it so much inbought this one as well (all for half the price of a salon one) my stylist had the other brand of cortex they make one brazzilia (spell)?? She reccomended it because it is 100% ceramic, she said the chi is only ceramic plated. i still have my shi flat iron, but i do love these curling wands. I have long straight hair and it works so well. I always wake up with beach waves for the next day or even two days.</li>
            <li> Great item that my daughter was looking for. Great price and got to the house very soon. Thanks she love it</li>
            <li> So far after having this product for a month and using it a handful of times I do really like the way it curls my hair.  I&#x27;ve been using wands for numerous years now so I&#x27;ve used my fair share of wands and so far this is one of my favorites!  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it is advertised as 2&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m thinking that is the circumference rather than the diameter (which I thought it was) because I was looking for a much wider wand.  All in all -so far- a great tool for creating larger curls/waves!</li>
            <li> I was relatively impressed with this wand. My hair is difficult to curl so i was happy when this want curled and kept the curl all day long. The delivery came as expected with no problems. I recommend this curling wand to anyone with difficulty styling their hair.</li>
            <li> Wish i would have gotten a smaller one too! great quality and cheap! My friend paid $100 for the same thing in the mall!</li>
            <li> By far my favorite hair tool. It also came with a lifetime warranty! It is very high quality iron and I love the results.!,</li>
            <li> I love the product. I have very thick, long hair and it works perfectly awesome. Glove is a plus! good product &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this iron. It is a larger barrel so you won&#x27;t get a tight curl which also means it wont hold as well. I really like the loose curl/wave look so it works for me. I do wish it had a heat adjustment. But all in all I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works great. Gets super hot. Smoothes your hair as you curl.</li>
            <li> works great and very reliable. doesn&#x27;t get any better than this. you can&#x27;t get a better one for the price.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first based on some of the reviews, but decided to go for it and make the purchase. I am very happy with the curling rod. It came with a glove, but it doesn&#x27;t have settings. Just an on and off switch.  So if you are looking for something that you can change the temperature this isn&#x27;t the one for you.  Other than that I love this! With a regular curing iron or straightner curls don&#x27;t want to hold even with hair spray, but with this I can curl my hair with no hair spary and it will stay in all day and night.  I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and long hair and this gives me the curl I need!  The price was even better.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 19 year old daughter and she loves it.  She has long thick hair and this wand allows her to create large flowing curls.  It came packaged suitable for a gift. The glove is a great bonus and also a great quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this 2&amp;#34; curling wand to do something different with my hair. My hair is about collar bone length and i&#x27;ve been getting tired of always wearing it straight or in a pony tail (my go-to style when i&#x27;m too lazy to wash it). Anyway, i bought this 2&amp;#34; curling iron because I already have a 1&amp;#34; and got a little tired of how the 1&amp;#34; made my hair look. This curling iron came fast (2 day shipping) and in a very stylish box. It came with a glove so you don&#x27;t burn yourself while curling your hair. I personally find the gloves a nuisance so I just threw it away. The curling iron itself is very light (much lighter than my 1&amp;#34; curling wand). The blue button lights up when the curling iron is plugged in and turned on so you know not to touch it. I let it heat up while I&#x27;m drying my hair, which usually takes about 7 minutes, and by the time I&#x27;m ready to curl my hair it&#x27;s ready to go. This curling wand creates beautiful loose waves in my hair! You only have to leave your hair wrapped around this wand about 7 seconds which minimizes the amount of heat damage which is nice. I would HIGHLY recommend buying this 2&amp;#34; curling wand. I think it would be perfect for all lengths of hair to give you those loose waves which are very in right now. I love this!</li>
            <li> This product is not as described by the seller. It is not a 2&amp;#34; wand (maybe 1.5&amp;#34;) and it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; in that it does get hot but not hot  enough to actually curl hair. It does not have a temperature guage, nor a way of indicating the it has reached a temperature ready for use, in any case. The &amp;#34;instructions&amp;#34; that come with it are for an iron with two plates, so they are useless, too. Also, the glove does not protect enough for the heat the iron does generate. Huge disappointment!</li>
            <li> this wand makes decent curls but does not get hot enough. You have to hold it curled for twenty seconds before it will make a good curl. I have a skinny want and it takes like five seconds max to get a good curl. But all in all its a decent wand.</li>
            <li> I never had a curling iron that didn&#x27;t have a clasp before, so the whole idea of using this glove seemed totally bizarre t me. However, my new curling iron and this glove are super effective and easy to use. Recommend to anyone with long hair and steady hands.</li>
            <li> As of 04/03/2014 I can assure you that the Cortex Curling Iron Clipless 2&amp;#34; is NOT -- let me emphasize NOT 2&amp;#34; in diameter. I purchased a Hot Tools 2&amp;#34; clipped curling iron in the same order and there is a severely visible difference that it isn&#x27;t. I grabbed my tape measure out and at best, it&#x27;s MAYBE 1 1/2, I think it may be slightly smaller than that from my estimations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get it, the box says 2&amp;#34; the Amazon item description says 2&amp;#34; but what is given to you falls extremely short on 2&amp;#34;... Absolutely false advertisement on Cortex&#x27;s side. I&#x27;d recommend them making a statement that it is not 2&amp;#34; and have the boxes re-printed.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a smaller curl wand that gives tight curls... but wanted something that was quite larger.  This is a really great curling iron!  Gives my hair very full, large waves!  Love it!  Arrived very quickly and packaged nicely!  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a temperature control.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t stay curly for very long and it goes back to being straight after a couple of hours (about 2-3). With this curling iron, it lasts all day and the next! It&#x27;s very good at keeping its curls in and it doesnt hurt my hair as much because its ceramic. However, the curls are very different from what one would expect from an iron with a clip. I don&#x27;t have a lot of problems with it, it&#x27;s just those &amp;#34;everyday curls&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;However, for those that do not really know how to curl their hair with even the irons with clips, this would probably be very difficult. For me, this was very easy to use, however my sisters seemed to have a very difficult time trying to curl their hair with it. If you don&#x27;t know how to use it, your hair will look the same, just warm because of the heat.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a recommended product.</li>
            <li> I had the Cortx Curling Iron in 1.5 and loved it so much I wanted to buy this one. This is the 2 inch barrel and its everything I hoped for. Beautiful for big soft waves, so easy to use and for every hair type. Must buy!!</li>
            <li> Apparently you can&#x27;t insert pictures because I took one for you to advise how big/wide this barrel actually is before you buy it.&lt;br /&gt;The description and box say it is a 2\\&quot; barrel, however, it is closer to a 1\\&quot; than 1+1/4\\&quot; even. Nowhere near 1.5 inches at least, if it were I would have kept it... I put a ruler against it and it measured at 1+1/8in. Pretty deceiving imho...&lt;br /&gt;Not bad if that&#x27;s what you are looking for, however I bought this specifically because I need at MINIMUM a 1.5 inch barrel for my hair, so this sadly has to go back.</li>
            <li> Product description is wrong, it&#x27;s a 1-in curling iron. I don&#x27;t know how they measured this to say it&#x27;s a 2-in. Then I had the inconvenience of returning and shipping it back.</li>
            <li> I use this curling iron religiously!! It is amazing. The only complaint is that there is nothing to stabilize it and it can roll off of the counter. (Got burned) Other than that, it heats up fast and has a lifetime warranty.</li>
            <li> The curling iron itself is great. It does get really hot but it works great. however, the reason I give this 1 star is because it is NOT 2 inches. I already have a 1 inch curling iron and purchased this one because I needed a 2 INCH CLIPLESS curling iron and this was the only one I found. Extremely deceiving and the seller does not accept returns so now I&#x27;m stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE!!!</li>
            <li> I am so happy I decided to purchase this item! Curling wand gets super hot, and works perfectly with my hairstyle (long medium thick straight hair). The size of the barrel gives me loose Kardashian style waves. Have gotten many compliments so far. The temperature works perfectly for my hair, but there is no temperature control. If you have very thick or curly hair, it may not be hot enough. I recommend this product 100%!</li>
            <li> What a waste of Money!!! The packaging wasn&#x27;t even what was on the box!! I went to Walmart to buy a cheap curling iron and it works great!!!</li>
            <li> it was ok t the curls don&#x27;t last very long but I like how it makes the hair look wavy</li>
            <li> i got the 2 inch curler and it works as promised, createing exactly the right size lose waves. they do not hold as long as the tighter waves with my other curler, but it is to be expected, since the diameter is much larger than the usual inch  or inch and a half curling irons. they surface is ceramic so it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair as much even though there is no temperature adjustment. all in all - i love it.</li>
            <li> This iron is perfect for making loose waves. This way you don&#x27;t have to curl and then straighten. Only benefit would have been an auto-shut off feature.</li>
            <li> This wand gave me big, loose, wavy curls. It gets very hot.  Doesn&#x27;t work too well with my fine, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I had looked into purchasing the Sedu irons and I purchased this one instead. I love this wand it gets hot and the curl stays. I just wish it had a temperature adjustment.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is so amazing. I have long and thick hair, but I can get perfect loose curls with no effort in 20 minutes (very thick and long hair so that&#x27;s great compared to 30-40). The only issue I had was after a few months, the plug and cord separated, causing it to spark every time I plug it in. I&#x27;m willing to buy a new one (after the price also went up $20) but if this happens again, I&#x27;ll be extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a large curling iron like I was, do not buy this! Even though the box advertises it as 2 inches, it is maybe 1 1/2 inches. I called Cortex to see what they would say and their response was that the curling iron was measured in millimeters so when it was converted to inches, it was thrown off a bit (this response makes absolutely no sense). The Cortex representative even said that the curling iron is maybe 1.7 inches, which is not too far off from two inches. However, it is the principle of the matter and I will not be purchasing anything more from this company. I gave the product two stars because the curling iron itself is an okay product - it was just not what was advertised on the website or box.</li>
            <li> Diameter when measured is around 1.25 inches max. Heats up fast (&lt;45 secs) and switch to turn on lights up blue when ON, which is an improvement from my older Cortex iron that had no indicator showing iron was on. Electrical cord is wrapped in black/red cloth cord (not sure if this will hold up with time). There&#x27;s also a glove and then a velcro tape thing to tidy up cord. Only complaint is that since the barrel is larger/heavier than the handle, it tends to rest directly on the heated barrel when placed on a table (afraid that it may scorch my dresser!).</li>
            <li> First off -- this wand isn&#x27;t really 2&amp;#34;. I compared it with my 1 1/4&amp;#34; curling iron and it&#x27;s almost identical in diameter, so I&#x27;m not really quite sure how the 2&amp;#34; was measured for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, it&#x27;s great. I have pretty long hair (down to my lower back) and this wand gave me the big loose curls I was going for. Heats up fast, retains heat for the 30-40 minutes it takes to curl my whole head and easy to use unlike the tapered wands. I personally don&#x27;t care to use the glove, but a couple times I forgot how hot the tip was since there&#x27;s no plastic protector and came a bit too close to my fingers. comes in a great little box that&#x27;s easy to travel with as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think this is definitely a great buy and you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t heat up enough and hardly curls the hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> It work good heats up really high, But that a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;the only thing is that you have to let it heat up for a while, But other than that its fine</li>
