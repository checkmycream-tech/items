            <li>I cut my own hair and these help keep my hair thinned</li>
            <li>Nice lightweight thinning shears.</li>
            <li>I always liked how they thinned my hair out as it made it feel lighter and cooler as the wind blows through it.  </li>
            <li>Nice thinning shears.</li>
            <li>I also used them on my own hair.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m sure they would work just as good if I used them on my own hair...</li>
            <li>Works nicely, if aggressively.</li>
            <li>I bought these to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the results and these scissors are cheap but are great quality in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>

            <li>Great product, after using it several times still works great.</li>
            <li>The scissors cut cleanly and easily, and the results look great.  </li>
            <li>Being the intelligent, cautious person I am, I go right at my hair with these, making sure not to snip at each section</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I like my hair better now than when I came out from the hair salon. :)</li>
            <li>I prefer for my hair to appear to have some more weight to it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s what most people want.</li>
            <li>what a FANTASTIC deal when I purchased them, under $10!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cutting Capability: 5 stars (thinning functionality is excellent, not only cuts hair, also rubber strands in fishing lures no problem!)&lt;br</li>
            <li>: 5 stars (absolutely)&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: 3 stars-no storage for shears provided</li>
            <li>I wanted to remove damage, not create more.</li>
            <li>but I love them.</li>
            <li>Not that I didn&#x27;t love my salon-</li>
            <li>/&gt;Happy Styling! :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Sure, it isn&#x27;t a fancy pair of shears, but it works for the price.</li>
            <li>I ordered these shears based on the reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It will be better if it&#x27;s sharper</li>
            <li>Too many cuts will make your hair look stringy and that&#x27;s not a look any one is going for.</li>
            <li>I was expecting to have to pay a lot more for shears that worked as well as these.</li>
            <li>Such a good price that I thought they might not work very good, read the previous reviews and I agree that they work very good!</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price for a good product.</li>
            <li>Needed these for my dad&#x27;s thick hair, these work wonderful and was a good price.  </li>
            <li>Used it primarily for texturizing, but think it may be more suited for thinning.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough good about them!</li>
            <li>Easy transaction and speedy delivery.  </li>
            <li>If u are looking for shears that are cheap and that are good for straight hair these are for u.</li>
            <li>Put together we well and easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to use and cut your hair, saves you lot of money.</li>
            <li>like these scissors because they&#x27;re easy to use in one hand and feel</li>
            <li>and it seemed fine.</li>
            <li>They should be fine for people,however.</li>
            <li>Thanks for fast delivery of exactly what I ordered and sending the product in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>They work great, so I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>I have cut my own hair for years, and these make blending the layers much easier.</li>
            <li>Great product for occasional home use.  </li>
            <li>No wonder it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>Does a fantastic job on her hair.</li>
            <li>They are cheap, and work well..</li>
            <li>Pretty good thinning shears (admit they&#x27;re the first I&#x27;ve ever used).</li>
            <li>They are nicely made, look good, are comfortable to hold and very sharp.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t normally cut my own hair or anyone else&#x27;s, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on the shears or scissors.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with them thus far (one use).</li>
            <li>I originally just bought shears, but the edges were a bit too blunt</li>
            <li>The Goody Styling Thinning Shears work great to give my daughter&#x27;s bangs and hair in the back a nice soft edge.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special, and yet will do the job without question.  </li>
            <li>again they are a good, basic and inexpensive scissors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>product is good and works properly</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, easy, exactly what you want in thinning shears.  </li>
            <li>They are sharp and do a great job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to exercise more caution when I&#x27;m using these shears in the future.</li>
            <li>And every time I use these my hair grows quick.</li>
            <li>They work great and let me cut my own and thin it with ease.</li>
            <li>You might better pay a few dollars more to get a better pair of shears.</li>
            <li>I gave this product a good rating because its a nice instead of buying a more expensive one.  </li>
            <li>Very happy for under ten bucks, and will use them for a long time.</li>
            <li>These are great for when my hair needs just a little trim</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s more fine than course, so I found these shears left my hair flying all over the place.  </li>
            <li>but i guess u cant expect too much from them for being so cheap.</li>
            <li>your 8 dollars worth it</li>
            <li>I have now ventured into cutting my own pixie hair cuts and love, love, LOVE these for that...</li>
            <li>We have already gotten our money&#x27;s worth out of them...</li>
            <li>but I cut my hair and my boyfriends at home by watching youtube and learning from the different tips provided there and have done a great job so far with help of these shears.</li>
            <li>These help thin it out easily, giving us a bit more time in between haircuts, not to mention, it helps their hair lay much better!  </li>
            <li>Amazon has not made an effort to make things right; I would like a refund please.</li>
            <li>Just the right product for my need.</li>
            <li>Time will tell if these shears last more than a couple of months (and I&#x27;ll be sure to update as I use &#x27;em!), but considering that they cost about a third of the price of the cheapest &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; shears I could find, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>Might be good for adult hair and someone that is experienced with cutting hair, but still seem pretty cheaply made.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s sharp and still works as good as the first time we used it.  </li>
            <li>They do a great job of blending the tips without that chopped look for her fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was super fast delivery</li>
            <li>They produce a fine and natural look around the muzzle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These are the first pair of thinning shears I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>first then go over everything with this</li>
            <li>This is my first year with them and they worked like a charm.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better - especially at this price point.</li>
            <li>Pretty fool-proof product when it comes to taking off some bulk.  </li>
            <li>I also know myself well, and know exactly what I want from a haircut, so after following Farah&#x27;s video, I was able to trim and edit to my liking.</li>
            <li>They are exactly as described on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I got these thinning scissors yesterday and used them for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>an my boyfriend has thick hair and it works great on both of us.</li>
            <li>It does exactly as it says.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut as nicely as some other shears i have used.</li>
            <li>very much a DIY person with all things beauty, so I really don&#x27;t know what took me so long to cut my own hair; after using these, and following farahdhukai&#x27;s video on youtube to the T, I can honestly say I will never be going back to a salon.</li>
            <li>These are pretty decent scissors for the price!</li>
            <li>I received these not too long ago and was super excited to try them out.</li>
            <li>I have short hair cut in a pixie style and a strong aversion to visiting beauty shops.</li>
            <li>If you try to cut a large chunk, the blades bend apart and nothing gets cut.</li>
            <li>Super sharp and easy to use thinning shears.</li>
            <li>This is great for those of us women that have thick hair to manage!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I bought for husband and he absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>but no, it was all thanks to the greatness of thinning shears</li>
            <li>My wavy hair requires some shears that are better with blending and not straight cuts</li>
            <li>These help with some layering for straight hair, they work as well as I would expect</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Construction Quality: 5 stars (very rust</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to usd this much</li>
            <li>These are perfect for cutting my son&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>They blend his hair very well.  </li>
            <li>These shears also helped blended the layers very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These cutting shears are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>and it really cuts well..</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t pull or cut off too much hair at a time.</li>
            <li>so you won&#x27;t cut off too much at once</li>
            <li>Helps me thin joy hair out between appts.</li>
            <li>I try to use it, it just feels like it&#x27;s not doing much.</li>
            <li>I was using a razor comb to add some softness to my kids hair cuts, but it pulled too much.  </li>
            <li>and there was no mention of just how much they take off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m learning how to cut my own hair and these were just the things that I was missing.</li>
            <li>and WOW it make a world of a difference!!!</li>
            <li>, they didn&#x27;t rust at all, like some of my other tools that are supposed to be stainless and rust free!  </li>
            <li>cuz I wanted a pair of decent thinning shears at hand but didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on it.</li>
            <li>I think this is a fine product as long as you know what you&#x27;re doing.  </li>
            <li>I bought these shears for their most general purpose; simply thinning out hair.</li>
            <li>Feels a little cheap but totally adequate if you&#x27;re not a pro.</li>
            <li>I have a new wig I bought, used these shears to thin out the hair, and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>That said, if you want your hair to be shorter in addition to being thinner, cut off some length with normal scissors first--but not too much, since thinning your hair makes it look a bit shorter.</li>
            <li>These work as expected, arrived quickly and appropriately packaged, and have the useful little balancing handle on the corner.  </li>
            <li>lol, when thinning a portion of hair only very minimal amounts of hair are left over.</li>
            <li>watched a youtube tutorial showing to cut the main shape and layers</li>
            <li>Decent shears.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>, I highly recommend these shears and checking out Farah&#x27;s video!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The material is of high quality.</li>
            <li>Sure, they were cheaper than nearly every other competitor, but the reviews spoke for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed to thin out my thick hair and these work good very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Not sure how they would hold up to constant use but for my needs of an occasional thinning they work great.</li>
            <li>These scissors are very sharp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It works great for in between haircuts when you need a little less hair!</li>
            <li>thinning out my thick blonde hair is super easy now, and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>, I had which was pretty much same price.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it looks better since it actually, you know, lies down like a normal person&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are opening the shears all the way and then putting it to your hair it will not be able to function the way the it should work The shears should only be opened about half way before putting it to your head.</li>
            <li>Worked great for cutting my hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it is professional grade</li>
            <li>No missing sections of hair, no bald spots, nothing.</li>
            <li>but it causes split ends to form when the \\&quot;thinning tips\\&quot; do not make a complete cut of the hair.</li>
            <li>I am by no means a professional</li>
            <li>Gives a professional look.</li>
            <li>Plus they can really give your dog a shaggy look if you don&#x27;t know how to properly groom with these.</li>
            <li>With two young kids, haircuts costs can add up</li>
            <li>This shears is sharp and thins your thick hair quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that they usually have much more hair than I prefer.  </li>
            <li>I marked them down one star because I felt they take off a lot more than other thinning shears I have seen</li>
            <li>I do recommend knowing what you are doing before you start cutting your own hair!</li>
            <li>Normally I go to a stylist every three or four weeks to get it trimmed/thinned out a bit, but it still wasn&#x27;t enough for my tastes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very sharp and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t been able to afford going back lately.</li>
            <li>Screw broke in less than two years though, not quite worth the $9 paid.</li>
            <li>more than twice (I gotta emphasize that my hair is REALLY thick, hence the double pass).</li>
            <li>The scissors are dull and dont cut well  - cheap product.  </li>
            <li>Barely works: lack of rigidity, and lack of sharpness</li>
            <li>Just what I need as I cut and style my own hair and couldn&#x27;t find shears that weren&#x27;t so expensive.  </li>
            <li>These shears are very sharp and can create a soft, natural thinning effect as long as you&#x27;re willing to work at your hair a bit.  </li>
            <li>These are very sharp and do exactly what they are supposed to.</li>
            <li>I know typically you wouldn&#x27;t use thinning shears on fine hair, but it worked out extremely well for me-</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I had to go over the same spot several times to get his hair more even, but if I had cut it sooner that probably would not have been an issue.</li>
            <li>The shears I purchased are sharp and cut very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like when I use other scissors and it leaves it too straight</li>
            <li>The clippers cutting edges are tight fitting, with a smooth operation.</li>
            <li>Thanks to all the previous good reviews, I ordered this to tame my VERY thick hair.</li>
            <li>I didnt find them particularly sharp, my Conair regular shears were much sharper.</li>
            <li>I was frankly surprised considering they are not a &#x27;professional&#x27; brand.</li>
            <li>Only problem you may face is that if hair is extremely thick, cuts won&#x27;t be so clean.</li>
            <li>Had them for several months and still as sharp as they were when new.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> These are great , lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see this order come so quickly!</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and these help keep my hair thinned</li>
            <li> Nice lightweight thinning shears.</li>
            <li> I always liked how they thinned my hair out as it made it feel lighter and cooler as the wind blows through it.  </li>
            <li> Nice thinning shears.</li>
            <li> I also used them on my own hair.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m sure they would work just as good if I used them on my own hair...</li>
            <li> Works nicely, if aggressively.</li>
            <li> I bought these to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the results and these scissors are cheap but are great quality in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> they are VERY durable, and a good value!</li>
            <li> Great product, after using it several times still works great.</li>
            <li> The scissors cut cleanly and easily, and the results look great.  </li>
            <li> Being the intelligent, cautious person I am, I go right at my hair with these, making sure not to snip at each section</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I like my hair better now than when I came out from the hair salon. :)</li>
            <li> I prefer for my hair to appear to have some more weight to it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s what most people want.</li>
            <li> what a FANTASTIC deal when I purchased them, under $10!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cutting Capability: 5 stars (thinning functionality is excellent, not only cuts hair, also rubber strands in fishing lures no problem!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> : 5 stars (absolutely)&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: 3 stars-no storage for shears provided</li>
            <li> I wanted to remove damage, not create more.</li>
            <li> but I love them.</li>
            <li> Not that I didn&#x27;t love my salon-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Happy Styling! :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Sure, it isn&#x27;t a fancy pair of shears, but it works for the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered these shears based on the reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> It will be better if it&#x27;s sharper</li>
            <li> Too many cuts will make your hair look stringy and that&#x27;s not a look any one is going for.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to have to pay a lot more for shears that worked as well as these.</li>
            <li> Such a good price that I thought they might not work very good, read the previous reviews and I agree that they work very good!</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price for a good product.</li>
            <li> Needed these for my dad&#x27;s thick hair, these work wonderful and was a good price.  </li>
            <li> Used it primarily for texturizing, but think it may be more suited for thinning.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough good about them!</li>
            <li> Easy transaction and speedy delivery.  </li>
            <li> If u are looking for shears that are cheap and that are good for straight hair these are for u.</li>
            <li> Put together we well and easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy to use and cut your hair, saves you lot of money.</li>
            <li> like these scissors because they&#x27;re easy to use in one hand and feel</li>
            <li> and it seemed fine.</li>
            <li> They should be fine for people,however.</li>
            <li> Thanks for fast delivery of exactly what I ordered and sending the product in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> They work great, so I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I have cut my own hair for years, and these make blending the layers much easier.</li>
            <li> Great product for occasional home use.  </li>
            <li> No wonder it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job on her hair.</li>
            <li> They are cheap, and work well..</li>
            <li> Pretty good thinning shears (admit they&#x27;re the first I&#x27;ve ever used).</li>
            <li> They are nicely made, look good, are comfortable to hold and very sharp.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t normally cut my own hair or anyone else&#x27;s, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on the shears or scissors.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with them thus far (one use).</li>
            <li> I originally just bought shears, but the edges were a bit too blunt</li>
            <li> The Goody Styling Thinning Shears work great to give my daughter&#x27;s bangs and hair in the back a nice soft edge.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special, and yet will do the job without question.  </li>
            <li> again they are a good, basic and inexpensive scissors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> product is good and works properly</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, easy, exactly what you want in thinning shears.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp and do a great job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sure to exercise more caution when I&#x27;m using these shears in the future.</li>
            <li> And every time I use these my hair grows quick.</li>
            <li> They work great and let me cut my own and thin it with ease.</li>
            <li> You might better pay a few dollars more to get a better pair of shears.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a good rating because its a nice instead of buying a more expensive one.  </li>
            <li> Very happy for under ten bucks, and will use them for a long time.</li>
            <li> These are great for when my hair needs just a little trim</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s more fine than course, so I found these shears left my hair flying all over the place.  </li>
            <li> but i guess u cant expect too much from them for being so cheap.</li>
            <li> your 8 dollars worth it</li>
            <li> I have now ventured into cutting my own pixie hair cuts and love, love, LOVE these for that...</li>
            <li> We have already gotten our money&#x27;s worth out of them...</li>
            <li> but I cut my hair and my boyfriends at home by watching youtube and learning from the different tips provided there and have done a great job so far with help of these shears.</li>
            <li> These help thin it out easily, giving us a bit more time in between haircuts, not to mention, it helps their hair lay much better!  </li>
            <li> Amazon has not made an effort to make things right; I would like a refund please.</li>
            <li> Just the right product for my need.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if these shears last more than a couple of months (and I&#x27;ll be sure to update as I use &#x27;em!), but considering that they cost about a third of the price of the cheapest &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; shears I could find, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Might be good for adult hair and someone that is experienced with cutting hair, but still seem pretty cheaply made.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s sharp and still works as good as the first time we used it.  </li>
            <li> They do a great job of blending the tips without that chopped look for her fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was super fast delivery</li>
            <li> They produce a fine and natural look around the muzzle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These are the first pair of thinning shears I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> first then go over everything with this</li>
            <li> This is my first year with them and they worked like a charm.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better - especially at this price point.</li>
            <li> Pretty fool-proof product when it comes to taking off some bulk.  </li>
            <li> I also know myself well, and know exactly what I want from a haircut, so after following Farah&#x27;s video, I was able to trim and edit to my liking.</li>
            <li> They are exactly as described on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I got these thinning scissors yesterday and used them for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> an my boyfriend has thick hair and it works great on both of us.</li>
            <li> It does exactly as it says.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut as nicely as some other shears i have used.</li>
            <li> very much a DIY person with all things beauty, so I really don&#x27;t know what took me so long to cut my own hair; after using these, and following farahdhukai&#x27;s video on youtube to the T, I can honestly say I will never be going back to a salon.</li>
            <li> These are pretty decent scissors for the price!</li>
            <li> I received these not too long ago and was super excited to try them out.</li>
            <li> I have short hair cut in a pixie style and a strong aversion to visiting beauty shops.</li>
            <li> If you try to cut a large chunk, the blades bend apart and nothing gets cut.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and easy to use thinning shears.</li>
            <li> This is great for those of us women that have thick hair to manage!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I bought for husband and he absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> but no, it was all thanks to the greatness of thinning shears</li>
            <li> My wavy hair requires some shears that are better with blending and not straight cuts</li>
            <li> These help with some layering for straight hair, they work as well as I would expect</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Construction Quality: 5 stars (very rust</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to usd this much</li>
            <li> These are perfect for cutting my son&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> They blend his hair very well.  </li>
            <li> These shears also helped blended the layers very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These cutting shears are wonderful.  </li>
            <li> and it really cuts well..</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t pull or cut off too much hair at a time.</li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t cut off too much at once</li>
            <li> Helps me thin joy hair out between appts.</li>
            <li> I try to use it, it just feels like it&#x27;s not doing much.</li>
            <li> I was using a razor comb to add some softness to my kids hair cuts, but it pulled too much.  </li>
            <li> and there was no mention of just how much they take off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m learning how to cut my own hair and these were just the things that I was missing.</li>
            <li> and WOW it make a world of a difference!!!</li>
            <li> , they didn&#x27;t rust at all, like some of my other tools that are supposed to be stainless and rust free!  </li>
            <li> cuz I wanted a pair of decent thinning shears at hand but didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on it.</li>
            <li> I think this is a fine product as long as you know what you&#x27;re doing.  </li>
            <li> I bought these shears for their most general purpose; simply thinning out hair.</li>
            <li> Feels a little cheap but totally adequate if you&#x27;re not a pro.</li>
            <li> I have a new wig I bought, used these shears to thin out the hair, and it looks great.  </li>
            <li> That said, if you want your hair to be shorter in addition to being thinner, cut off some length with normal scissors first--but not too much, since thinning your hair makes it look a bit shorter.</li>
            <li> These work as expected, arrived quickly and appropriately packaged, and have the useful little balancing handle on the corner.  </li>
            <li> lol, when thinning a portion of hair only very minimal amounts of hair are left over.</li>
            <li> watched a youtube tutorial showing to cut the main shape and layers</li>
            <li> Decent shears.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> , I highly recommend these shears and checking out Farah&#x27;s video!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The material is of high quality.</li>
            <li> Sure, they were cheaper than nearly every other competitor, but the reviews spoke for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed to thin out my thick hair and these work good very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not sure how they would hold up to constant use but for my needs of an occasional thinning they work great.</li>
            <li> These scissors are very sharp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It works great for in between haircuts when you need a little less hair!</li>
            <li> thinning out my thick blonde hair is super easy now, and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> , I had which was pretty much same price.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it looks better since it actually, you know, lies down like a normal person&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are opening the shears all the way and then putting it to your hair it will not be able to function the way the it should work The shears should only be opened about half way before putting it to your head.</li>
            <li> Worked great for cutting my hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it is professional grade</li>
            <li> No missing sections of hair, no bald spots, nothing.</li>
            <li> but it causes split ends to form when the \\&quot;thinning tips\\&quot; do not make a complete cut of the hair.</li>
            <li> I am by no means a professional</li>
            <li> Gives a professional look.</li>
            <li> Plus they can really give your dog a shaggy look if you don&#x27;t know how to properly groom with these.</li>
            <li> With two young kids, haircuts costs can add up</li>
            <li> This shears is sharp and thins your thick hair quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that they usually have much more hair than I prefer.  </li>
            <li> I marked them down one star because I felt they take off a lot more than other thinning shears I have seen</li>
            <li> I do recommend knowing what you are doing before you start cutting your own hair!</li>
            <li> Normally I go to a stylist every three or four weeks to get it trimmed/thinned out a bit, but it still wasn&#x27;t enough for my tastes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very sharp and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been able to afford going back lately.</li>
            <li> Screw broke in less than two years though, not quite worth the $9 paid.</li>
            <li> more than twice (I gotta emphasize that my hair is REALLY thick, hence the double pass).</li>
            <li> The scissors are dull and dont cut well  - cheap product.  </li>
            <li> Barely works: lack of rigidity, and lack of sharpness</li>
            <li> Just what I need as I cut and style my own hair and couldn&#x27;t find shears that weren&#x27;t so expensive.  </li>
            <li> These shears are very sharp and can create a soft, natural thinning effect as long as you&#x27;re willing to work at your hair a bit.  </li>
            <li> These are very sharp and do exactly what they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> I know typically you wouldn&#x27;t use thinning shears on fine hair, but it worked out extremely well for me-</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I had to go over the same spot several times to get his hair more even, but if I had cut it sooner that probably would not have been an issue.</li>
            <li> The shears I purchased are sharp and cut very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like when I use other scissors and it leaves it too straight</li>
            <li> The clippers cutting edges are tight fitting, with a smooth operation.</li>
            <li> Thanks to all the previous good reviews, I ordered this to tame my VERY thick hair.</li>
            <li> I didnt find them particularly sharp, my Conair regular shears were much sharper.</li>
            <li> I was frankly surprised considering they are not a &#x27;professional&#x27; brand.</li>
            <li> Only problem you may face is that if hair is extremely thick, cuts won&#x27;t be so clean.</li>
            <li> Had them for several months and still as sharp as they were when new.</li>
            <li> they are very sharp, and very sturdy thinning shears, my only problem with them is that they thin too much at once, it might as well just be a normal pair of scissors</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I first took this out of the package as it looked flimsy - but I have used it several times and it cuts well and is performing just fine.</li>
            <li> I started looking into a pair of thinning  shears of my own (after ensuring that I couldn&#x27;t end up hacking off half of my hair if I looked at it the wrong way with a pair of these things) and ran into these.</li>
            <li> I cut my family&#x27;s hair (no, I&#x27;m not school trained/licensed, but it really is not that hard), and have two family members with nice, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> They cut well, do not pull and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Does pull your hair sometimes but other than that decent product with sharp blades to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Goody has never let me down as far as quality...</li>
            <li> I thin out my own and my sister&#x27;s thick hair.</li>
            <li> have very long, thin blonde hair that&#x27;s prone to breakage, and is easily weighed down by products.</li>
            <li> These snips, when used properly, can help you avoid the constant trips to the salon that short haircuts typically require.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to using them to maintain my long layers.</li>
            <li> I use these for trimming my dog&#x27;s long, wispy hairs.  </li>
            <li> Use these for my long haired dog</li>
            <li> These are not professional thinning shears that you will use in a salon or to use often on clients.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to use them too much in one place or your hair will look very uneven.</li>
            <li> Remember if you have long hair to cut only the lower half</li>
            <li> Very sharp, and sturdy enough for home use.</li>
            <li> I can imagine using this for a very long time!</li>
            <li> The shears did not have any \\&quot;pull\\&quot; on any of my hair as long as you cut a little bit of a hair at a time and closed the shears entirely before lifting the scissors off your head.  </li>
            <li> Hope it stays sharp for a long time!</li>
            <li> Parts were only cut halfway vertically, creating split ends that were not originally there.</li>
            <li> and after several tries, a little is done.  </li>
            <li> looked cheap and home done, then after cutting and going over with these shears</li>
            <li> I just used to trim my asian mop-top and now my hair isn&#x27;t too fluffy and just how I like it.</li>
            <li> I have perfectly straight hair, but a ton of it, so I wanted to thin out the ends.  </li>
            <li> I use them to thin out my bangs and give me hair some texture, in which these work really well.</li>
            <li> My 20 month old little boy has beautiful curls, but his hair is so thick, that I wanted to thin it out a little, so it didn&#x27;t look so crazy.</li>
            <li> To save on money, I&#x27;ve started cutting my kids hair, but found that using a straight scissor blade led to very harsh blunt cuts, particularly on my daughter&#x27;s bangs.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp and cut well.</li>
            <li> The scissors are sharp just what i needed.</li>
            <li> We use these to cut our Yorkie&#x27;s hair and they are sharp and do the job.</li>
            <li> It can only cut through a small amount of hair at a time.  </li>
            <li> , I bought a small, simple pair of shears just for touch</li>
            <li> can not find any other</li>
            <li> It is not as sharp as I thought.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and well balanced for my use.</li>
            <li> and frankly they seem to need cuts every other week or so.  </li>
            <li> But I usually spent about $65 per cut, and the cost of all my materials was less than half that.</li>
            <li> Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> So WARNING to those who have thick coarse strands of hair, this may NOT be the pair of thinning shears for you!</li>
            <li> Very sharp.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp, and well made.</li>
            <li> It is still very sharp after a year.</li>
            <li> The sharpness is therefore a double edged sword: great for cutting hair, bad for careless people such as myself.</li>
            <li> I have really long, thick, and</li>
            <li> This shears definitely improves the home haircut but preventing (generally) over cutting and uneven trims.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in these because i was so excited to try them</li>
            <li> It still takes a little precision and patience but it extends the time between salon visits</li>
            <li> I bought these to texture my hair, although I was a little worried because the price is so low.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried cutting straight across versus diagonally and did not help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in college, and at such a high price for a cut, I could only afford to get it done every 3 monthes, and my hair was miserable by then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Completely unable to use - a total waste of money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically impossible to ruin your haircut with these since they don&#x27;t remove much hair per snip.  </li>
            <li> I bought these when I was really broke to lengthen salon visits and the hairdresser was aghast -- she said thinning shears are never a good idea.  </li>
            <li> When cutting, the shears were tugging my hair which was uncomfortable but not painful.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse strands and unfortunately, these shears just would not cut through them.</li>
            <li> A little small but will thin hair as needed, worked well for the price.</li>
            <li> but my hurr gets hard to manage and this helps yo</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I should have to keep trying that hard to get the result I want.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product is so difficult to find offline, it&#x27;s inexpensive, but expected &amp;#34;Goody&amp;#34; quality.  </li>
            <li> You can fix that just by separating the hair and cutting in smaller sections.</li>
            <li> find that thinning the longest 2\\&quot; of my hair ends allows for an easier curl, whereas my thick ends if bluntly cut will not hold a curl.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes 2 or 3 snips sometimes to cut through thick clumps of hair.</li>
            <li> I followed a youtube video for cutting long hair, and got these</li>
            <li> My hair is long, so I decided to start cutting it myself.  </li>
            <li> Its less expensive than others, but it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> makes this a very mediocre product.&lt;br /&gt; Usable though, but compares very poorly with the previous (similar product)</li>
            <li> it was sharp and i used it to trim and thin my bangs!!</li>
            <li> I use these for thinning my bushy negro hair and boy does it chop chop through my thick nappy hair!</li>
            <li> - it is naturally very thick.</li>
            <li> My husband has very thick hair and hates going to the barber.  </li>
            <li> Asians have thick hair that can become difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> They thin the hair just as they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to thin MY hair anymore, but I like to wear wigs a lot for the variety and convenience.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thin</li>
            <li> They do thin rather aggressively for my taste.</li>
            <li> Today, I got a minor cut on my finger by accidentally getting my finger caught between the cutting blade and the combed blade during the cutting process.</li>
            <li> I know very little about hair cutting.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair but tons of it</li>
            <li> I am experimenting cutting my 3yo&#x27;s hair as I cannot stomach $17 to go to the kid&#x27;s salon in town.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking to start cutting your hair at home</li>
            <li> The handle sticks; the blades pull and tug instead of cutting hair.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are pretty decent scissors for the price! No complaints here! They cut the hair and don&#x27;t pull or ruin the hair.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see this order come so quickly! Thanks for fast delivery of exactly what I ordered and sending the product in excellent condition. I thinned my daughter&#x27;s hair the second these scissors arrived! They work great, so I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I first took this out of the package as it looked flimsy - but I have used it several times and it cuts well and is performing just fine.</li>
            <li> Perfect thinning shears, still using it for 3 years in a row for now.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and cut well. I needed to thin out my thick hair and these work good very easy to use. Good quality for the price. Goody has never let me down as far as quality... Impressed</li>
            <li> The shears I purchased are sharp and cut very well. I&#x27;ve had others and this is the best one yet.</li>
            <li> Just what I need as I cut and style my own hair and couldn&#x27;t find shears that weren&#x27;t so expensive.  Easy transaction and speedy delivery.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> it looks exactly same as the picture. The scissors are sharp just what i needed.I love it. your 8 dollars worth it haha. I recommend this one. buy it</li>
            <li> This shears definitely improves the home haircut but preventing (generally) over cutting and uneven trims. I bought for husband and he absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Asian guy. I decided to start cutting my own hair. Asians have thick hair that can become difficult to manage. These are the first pair of thinning shears I&#x27;ve ever owned. The sharpness of the blade cannot be overstated. Today, I got a minor cut on my finger by accidentally getting my finger caught between the cutting blade and the combed blade during the cutting process. The sharpness is therefore a double edged sword: great for cutting hair, bad for careless people such as myself. I&#x27;ll be sure to exercise more caution when I&#x27;m using these shears in the future. I would recommend these to a friend.</li>
            <li> I know very little about hair cutting. Got a descent hair cut recently but the end of the hair line was a bit bulkier/heavier than I&#x27;d like, so I decide to trim it by myself. Since I don&#x27;t normally cut my own hair or anyone else&#x27;s, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on the shears or scissors. This pair is great! It did the job, no dragging or anything. I like my hair better now than when I came out from the hair salon. :)</li>
            <li> Does pull your hair sometimes but other than that decent product with sharp blades to get the job done.</li>
            <li> This is great for those of us women that have thick hair to manage! It really thinned my hair and did not make it look choppy at all.You should try it out!</li>
            <li> What can you expect for $9 pair of shears!  When cutting, the shears were tugging my hair which was uncomfortable but not painful.</li>
            <li> These work as expected, arrived quickly and appropriately packaged, and have the useful little balancing handle on the corner.  I use these to cut my kids&#x27; hair and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> I love these! I thin out my own and my sister&#x27;s thick hair. It works great for in between haircuts when you need a little less hair! haha</li>
            <li> This shears is sharp and thins your thick hair quickly and easily.  I don&#x27;t believe it is professional grade but I would use it if I were a pro!</li>
            <li> Great quality, Great price!&lt;br /&gt;I will never cut hair without these again, the thinning shears can make anything look good.&lt;br /&gt;I watched a youtube tutorial showing to cut the main shape and layers first then go over everything with this and WOW it make a world of a difference!!! My hair cuts I was doing on my family looked cheap and home done, then after cutting and going over with these shears I had a lady come up to me and say \\&quot;so you ended up taking them into the salon?\\&quot; but no, it was all thanks to the greatness of thinning shears lol</li>
            <li> Excellent shears! I have cut my own hair for years, and these make blending the layers much easier. The clippers cutting edges are tight fitting, with a smooth operation. I am very pleased with them thus far (one use). Shipping was excellent.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in these because i was so excited to try them but i guess u cant expect too much from them for being so cheap. Amazon was super fast delivery so i was happy about that. I have really long, thick, and wavy hair and these shears made it look like my hair had been chewed on :( It doesn&#x27;t cut as nicely as some other shears i have used. I didnt find them particularly sharp, my Conair regular shears were much sharper. My wavy hair requires some shears that are better with blending and not straight cuts (it looks like that even when i angle them) If u are looking for shears that are cheap and that are good for straight hair these are for u.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hated these thinning shears. I had read reviews on how some thinning shears can cause split ends so I decided to use on an extra remy hair extension pieces. This indeed splits the hair ends. Decided to just try it on my hair since the extensions were thicker than my hair and it still caused split ends. Tried cutting straight across versus diagonally and did not help. Would NOT recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Worked great for cutting my hair.  I followed a youtube video for cutting long hair, and got these so I could see how jagged edged scissors would work for my hair.  I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s more fine than course, so I found these shears left my hair flying all over the place.  I prefer for my hair to appear to have some more weight to it.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, easy, exactly what you want in thinning shears.  These are the basics, nothing fancy here but it&#x27;s what most people want.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and these help keep my hair thinned - it is naturally very thick. Just be careful not to use them too much in one place or your hair will look very uneven.</li>
            <li> The scissors are dull and dont cut well  - cheap product.  Completely unable to use - a total waste of money</li>
            <li> I am experimenting cutting my 3yo&#x27;s hair as I cannot stomach $17 to go to the kid&#x27;s salon in town.  These help with some layering for straight hair, they work as well as I would expect</li>
            <li> Needed these for my dad&#x27;s thick hair, these work wonderful and was a good price.  Arrived on time which is always idea. Thanks.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp and do exactly what they are supposed to. I was frankly surprised considering they are not a &#x27;professional&#x27; brand.</li>
            <li> We use these to cut our Yorkie&#x27;s hair and they are sharp and do the job. Nice price, great product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these!!  I cut my family&#x27;s hair (no, I&#x27;m not school trained/licensed, but it really is not that hard), and have two family members with nice, thick hair.  These help thin it out easily, giving us a bit more time in between haircuts, not to mention, it helps their hair lay much better!  I have now ventured into cutting my own pixie hair cuts and love, love, LOVE these for that...what a FANTASTIC deal when I purchased them, under $10!  We have already gotten our money&#x27;s worth out of them...can&#x27;t say enough good about them!</li>
            <li> I bought these when I was really broke to lengthen salon visits and the hairdresser was aghast -- she said thinning shears are never a good idea.  Although I did use them on someone else and it seemed fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price for quality thinning shears.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been successfully thinning my hair with them.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price!</li>
            <li> Not sure how they would hold up to constant use but for my needs of an occasional thinning they work great. Nice price and a good value.</li>
            <li> Nice lightweight thinning shears. Excellent for self trimming.</li>
            <li> These are great , lightweight and easy to use. They are sharp and do a great job. You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I have short hair cut in a pixie style and a strong aversion to visiting beauty shops. These snips, when used properly, can help you avoid the constant trips to the salon that short haircuts typically require.</li>
            <li> Seems to pull rather than cut.</li>
            <li> I just bought the regular haircut shears and bought this thinning shears to go with it.  Lightweight and feels good in the hand.  Very sharp.  Hope it stays sharp for a long time!</li>
            <li> I use these scissors regularly to cut mine and my sisters an I like the way it cuts. I don&#x27;t like when I use other scissors and it leaves it too straight these make them look like I cut with a razor. And every time I use these my hair grows quick.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t use these shears for hair, I used them for trimming and thinning fishing lures.  Which means they are outside a bunch in the moisture.  This is my first year with them and they worked like a charm.  Not only did they do the job, they didn&#x27;t rust at all, like some of my other tools that are supposed to be stainless and rust free!  Highly recommended.  Only draw back is the lack of a case to store them in.  For me not such a big deal, but for a parent looking to unclutter or protect the blades a case might be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction Quality: 5 stars (very rust resistant)&lt;br /&gt;Durability: 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Value for price: 5 stars (inexpensive yet quality)&lt;br /&gt;Cutting Capability: 5 stars (thinning functionality is excellent, not only cuts hair, also rubber strands in fishing lures no problem!)&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend?: 5 stars (absolutely)&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: 3 stars-no storage for shears provided</li>
            <li> I actually bought these for trimming around the snout of my Yorkshire Terrier. They produce a fine and natural look around the muzzle.&lt;br /&gt;I did start using them on myself as well and again they are a good, basic and inexpensive scissors.&lt;br /&gt;I find that thinning the longest 2\\&quot; of my hair ends allows for an easier curl, whereas my thick ends if bluntly cut will not hold a curl.&lt;br /&gt;Between my dog and myself, we are two happy customers.&lt;br /&gt;Nice, inexpensive choice.</li>
            <li> Great product for occasional home use.  Feels a little cheap but totally adequate if you&#x27;re not a pro.</li>
            <li> These shears fell apart after a couple uses. Every time I use them now I need to tighten the screw but by the time I finished the screw has unscrewed. No wonder it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> I have just started cutting my own hair.  I have asian ethnic hair and tons of volume on my head and have seen barbers use shears similar to this on my head.  I always liked how they thinned my hair out as it made it feel lighter and cooler as the wind blows through it.  The shears did not have any \\&quot;pull\\&quot; on any of my hair as long as you cut a little bit of a hair at a time and closed the shears entirely before lifting the scissors off your head.  If you are opening the shears all the way and then putting it to your hair it will not be able to function the way the it should work The shears should only be opened about half way before putting it to your head.</li>
            <li> What can I say...they work as advertized.  Great quality and price from Amazon.  Had them for several months and still as sharp as they were when new.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my story: I&#x27;m a redheaded male. Yep, I&#x27;m a guy, and my hair likes to become a puffball of thickness once I start to let it grow out. Normally I go to a stylist every three or four weeks to get it trimmed/thinned out a bit, but it still wasn&#x27;t enough for my tastes. I started looking into a pair of thinning  shears of my own (after ensuring that I couldn&#x27;t end up hacking off half of my hair if I looked at it the wrong way with a pair of these things) and ran into these. Sure, they were cheaper than nearly every other competitor, but the reviews spoke for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I take the plunge and buy a pair (after waiting over a month while these things were backordered... darn you, Amazon). Being the intelligent, cautious person I am, I go right at my hair with these, making sure not to snip at each section more than twice (I gotta emphasize that my hair is REALLY thick, hence the double pass). Guess what? No missing sections of hair, no bald spots, nothing. My hair&#x27;s felt a LOT lighter and it&#x27;s a heck of a lot easier to straighten, too! Oh, and it looks better since it actually, you know, lies down like a normal person&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better - especially at this price point. Time will tell if these shears last more than a couple of months (and I&#x27;ll be sure to update as I use &#x27;em!), but considering that they cost about a third of the price of the cheapest &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; shears I could find, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> It can only cut through a small amount of hair at a time.  If you try to cut a large chunk, the blades bend apart and nothing gets cut.</li>
            <li> Nice thinning shears.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product is so difficult to find offline, it&#x27;s inexpensive, but expected &amp;#34;Goody&amp;#34; quality.  Nothing special, and yet will do the job without question.  Looking forward to using them to maintain my long layers.</li>
            <li> Quality is good and it cuts as well.  I just used to trim my asian mop-top and now my hair isn&#x27;t too fluffy and just how I like it.</li>
            <li> Works well enough for the price. Used it primarily for texturizing, but think it may be more suited for thinning.</li>
            <li> A little small but will thin hair as needed, worked well for the price. Put together we well and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price for a good product. They work great and let me cut my own and thin it with ease.</li>
            <li> Such a good price that I thought they might not work very good, read the previous reviews and I agree that they work very good!</li>
            <li> My hair is long, so I decided to start cutting it myself.  I originally just bought shears, but the edges were a bit too blunt so I invested in these as well.  These scissors are very sharp and easy to use.  I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I use these for thinning my bushy negro hair and boy does it chop chop through my thick nappy hair!</li>
            <li> My husband has very thick hair and hates going to the barber.  I&#x27;ve been using these shears in between his routine cuts and they work great!  Pretty fool-proof product when it comes to taking off some bulk.  They&#x27;re very sharp and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> These work well. My 20 month old little boy has beautiful curls, but his hair is so thick, that I wanted to thin it out a little, so it didn&#x27;t look so crazy. I also used them on my own hair. No complaints!</li>
            <li> I use these for trimming my dog&#x27;s long, wispy hairs.  Does a fantastic job on her hair. Would probably also be good if I needed to trim my girlfriends hair.</li>
            <li> These shears don&#x27;t cut at all, so that it hurts to use them - I dont use them at all.</li>
            <li> Works great, and the cheapest one on amazon I could find. I don&#x27;t need to usd this much but my hurr gets hard to manage and this helps yo</li>
            <li> These are perfect for cutting my son&#x27;s hair.  They blend his hair very well.  My only complaint is that I had to go over the same spot several times to get his hair more even, but if I had cut it sooner that probably would not have been an issue.</li>
            <li> I received these not too long ago and was super excited to try them out. I have thick coarse strands and unfortunately, these shears just would not cut through them. I tested them out on my bangs and boy oh boy, it did not cut well and instead, broke and split the ends of my hair. Parts were only cut halfway vertically, creating split ends that were not originally there. I wanted to remove damage, not create more. I was really disappointed cuz I wanted a pair of decent thinning shears at hand but didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on it. So WARNING to those who have thick coarse strands of hair, this may NOT be the pair of thinning shears for you! However, I do believe this will work very well with straight thin strands of hair.</li>
            <li> Use these for my long haired dog so she doesn&#x27;t look chopped.  They do a great job of blending the tips without that chopped look for her fine thin hair.  Not a pro and don&#x27;t know any correct techniques to use but I love them.</li>
            <li> Worked just like they were supposed to! Super sharp and easy to use thinning shears. Would recommend buying these shears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to cut my own hair forever to save money, but I&#x27;ve always been so afraid. Finally, weeks of scheduling conflicts with my salon, and desperation for a haircut drove me to the breaking point, and I decided to go for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very much a DIY person with all things beauty, so I really don&#x27;t know what took me so long to cut my own hair; after using these, and following farahdhukai&#x27;s video on youtube to the T, I can honestly say I will never be going back to a salon. Not that I didn&#x27;t love my salon- I did! But I usually spent about $65 per cut, and the cost of all my materials was less than half that. I also know myself well, and know exactly what I want from a haircut, so after following Farah&#x27;s video, I was able to trim and edit to my liking. I&#x27;m in college, and at such a high price for a cut, I could only afford to get it done every 3 monthes, and my hair was miserable by then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, thin blonde hair that&#x27;s prone to breakage, and is easily weighed down by products. I know typically you wouldn&#x27;t use thinning shears on fine hair, but it worked out extremely well for me- weight is the enemy of thin hair!! These shears also helped blended the layers very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to these, I bought a small, simple pair of shears just for touch ups!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to start cutting your hair at home, I highly recommend these shears and checking out Farah&#x27;s video!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Styling! :)</li>
            <li> I want to find a cissor to trim my hair. This one works greatly. Very easy to use. Love it.</li>
            <li> These cutting shears are wonderful.  The name has been excellent for many years.  They cut well, do not pull and last a long time.</li>
            <li> The Goody thinning shears arrived in a timely fashion.  They are exactly as described on Amazon.  They thin the hair just as they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have it in me to go to salon a lot. I use these guys to trim my bangs without looking like a third grader did it. They work. It still takes a little precision and patience but it extends the time between salon visits and I think I look ok!</li>
            <li> The material is very solid and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to even out the hairs on my side after using a rechargeable clipper.</li>
            <li> Tried using the thinning shears to layer my fringe but it causes split ends to form when the \\&quot;thinning tips\\&quot; do not make a complete cut of the hair. And like others had reviewed, it tugged on my hair as well. Would not recommend</li>
            <li> I think this is a fine product as long as you know what you&#x27;re doing.  Sure, it isn&#x27;t a fancy pair of shears, but it works for the price.</li>
            <li> same as description and it really cuts well..it was sharp and i used it to trim and thin my bangs!!</li>
            <li> I got these thinning scissors yesterday and used them for the first time today.  THESE SCISSORS SUCK!  The handle sticks; the blades pull and tug instead of cutting hair.  I wish I could rate this item a zero!  Amazon has not made an effort to make things right; I would like a refund please.</li>
            <li> They are cheap, and work well..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not find any other specialty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my hair cut by myself, and it was very handy to use.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these scissors!! I always loved how my stylist used them but I haven&#x27;t been able to afford going back lately. I NEEDED to layer my hair and thought I&#x27;d give it a go. I absolutely love the results and these scissors are cheap but are great quality in my opinion. They didn&#x27;t pull or cut off too much hair at a time. I do recommend knowing what you are doing before you start cutting your own hair! If you know how to use them, I definitely recommend buying these!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these shears based on the reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I don&#x27;t have to thin MY hair anymore, but I like to wear wigs a lot for the variety and convenience.  The only thing is that they usually have much more hair than I prefer.  That&#x27;s why I bought these and they work GREAT for this.  I have a new wig I bought, used these shears to thin out the hair, and it looks great.  So, I&#x27;m sure they would work just as good if I used them on my own hair...or if you did.  I recommend them.</li>
            <li> I have perfectly straight hair, but a ton of it, so I wanted to thin out the ends.  These shears are very sharp and can create a soft, natural thinning effect as long as you&#x27;re willing to work at your hair a bit.  It&#x27;s basically impossible to ruin your haircut with these since they don&#x27;t remove much hair per snip.  That said, if you want your hair to be shorter in addition to being thinner, cut off some length with normal scissors first--but not too much, since thinning your hair makes it look a bit shorter.</li>
            <li> These are not professional thinning shears that you will use in a salon or to use often on clients. These are perfect for at home haircuts and they do a perfect job at getting rid of volume in your hair, thinning out your ends to give you a nice soft look and for blending layers. I am by no means a professional but I cut my hair and my boyfriends at home by watching youtube and learning from the different tips provided there and have done a great job so far with help of these shears. I have very thin hair but tons of it an my boyfriend has thick hair and it works great on both of us.</li>
            <li> These are great for when my hair needs just a little trim and I don&#x27;t have time to get to the hairdresser.  I can do this myself and it does not look like my hair was chopped on.  Gives a professional look.</li>
            <li> Im a guy, and I cut my hair at home so I can control my look, and save some dough. I bought these to texture my hair, although I was a little worried because the price is so low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the shears work wonders! Very sharp, and well made. thinning out my thick blonde hair is super easy now, and I highly recommend! they are VERY durable, and a good value!</li>
            <li> Shears are not regular scissors. They can get caught in the fur if you don&#x27;t know how to use them. Plus they can really give your dog a shaggy look if you don&#x27;t know how to properly groom with these.</li>
            <li> Great product, after using it several times still works great.</li>
            <li> easy to use and cut your hair, saves you lot of money. it&#x27;s thin so you won&#x27;t cut off too much at once</li>
            <li> I gave this product a good rating because its a nice instead of buying a more expensive one.  Its less expensive than others, but it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;I like these scissors because they&#x27;re easy to use in one hand and feel comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works nicely, if aggressively. Screw broke in less than two years though, not quite worth the $9 paid.</li>
            <li> I got these for my house rabbit...They don&#x27;t work well at all on rabbit fur. They should be fine for people,however.</li>
            <li> These thinning shears are cheaper then others but the quality is still there. I bought these shears for their most general purpose; simply thinning out hair. They work awesomely. Only problem you may face is that if hair is extremely thick, cuts won&#x27;t be so clean. You can fix that just by separating the hair and cutting in smaller sections. If you want a great pair of thinning shears without breaking your budget, then this is a great one to buy. Very satisfied here.</li>
            <li> Good scissors. Helps me thin joy hair out between appts.</li>
            <li> It is not as sharp as I thought.  It will be better if it&#x27;s sharper but it can still somewhat cut my hair.  You might better pay a few dollars more to get a better pair of shears.</li>
            <li> Decent shears. Well made, great price. Remember if you have long hair to cut only the lower half so you don&#x27;t lose the volume towards the crown. Too many cuts will make your hair look stringy and that&#x27;s not a look any one is going for.</li>
            <li> i bought it just in case i need to cut my bangs or hair. but i have not yet use it. so, i will update when i do.</li>
            <li> EH you get what you pay for.  These pulled my son&#x27;s hair a lot and made him cry.  The have no instructions on the back about how to hold them or which direction to cut so I tried it all different ways and it still pulled his hair.  Might be good for adult hair and someone that is experienced with cutting hair, but still seem pretty cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m learning how to cut my own hair and these were just the things that I was missing. It does exactly as it says. My hair was not snagged while using these, either. Stop looking and buy these if you need hair thinning scissors.</li>
            <li> Just the right product for my need. Sharp and well balanced for my use. The material is of high quality.</li>
            <li> These are great thinning shears at a great price.  I use them to thin out my bangs and give me hair some texture, in which these work really well.</li>
            <li> Pretty good thinning shears (admit they&#x27;re the first I&#x27;ve ever used). Takes 2 or 3 snips sometimes to cut through thick clumps of hair. Very happy for under ten bucks, and will use them for a long time.</li>
            <li> Did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s the texture.. or maybe it&#x27;s the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I know, is for you dog lovers, if you&#x27;re getting this for a Pom, you might not be happy with the end result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I try to use it, it just feels like it&#x27;s not doing much. It bunches up the hair..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind of like, it bends the hair.. and after several tries, a little is done.  I don&#x27;t feel like I should have to keep trying that hard to get the result I want.</li>
            <li> they are very sharp, and very sturdy thinning shears, my only problem with them is that they thin too much at once, it might as well just be a normal pair of scissors lol, when thinning a portion of hair only very minimal amounts of hair are left over.</li>
            <li> Thanks to all the previous good reviews, I ordered this to tame my VERY thick hair. I was expecting to have to pay a lot more for shears that worked as well as these. Very sharp, and sturdy enough for home use. Now my hair doesn&#x27;t stick out like a lampshade.</li>
            <li> I was using a razor comb to add some softness to my kids hair cuts, but it pulled too much.  So, this does the trick!</li>
            <li> I use this on myself and my friend&#x27;s hair and it is great! It does the job and I recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> With two young kids, haircuts costs can add up and frankly they seem to need cuts every other week or so.  To save on money, I&#x27;ve started cutting my kids hair, but found that using a straight scissor blade led to very harsh blunt cuts, particularly on my daughter&#x27;s bangs.  The Goody Styling Thinning Shears work great to give my daughter&#x27;s bangs and hair in the back a nice soft edge.  The scissors cut cleanly and easily, and the results look great.  We&#x27;ve used the scissors a couple of times now and it&#x27;s sharp and still works as good as the first time we used it.  I can imagine using this for a very long time!</li>
            <li> It is still very sharp after a year.</li>
            <li> Barely works: lack of rigidity, and lack of sharpness makes this a very mediocre product.&lt;br /&gt; Usable though, but compares very poorly with the previous (similar product), I had which was pretty much same price.</li>
            <li> use it to cut my pets hair.  works great</li>
            <li> I bought these to cut my own hair. They do thin rather aggressively for my taste. That wasn&#x27;t quite what I was looking for but that is not the product&#x27;s fault. They are nicely made, look good, are comfortable to hold and very sharp. There was no tugging at all. I marked them down one star because I felt they take off a lot more than other thinning shears I have seen and there was no mention of just how much they take off.</li>
            <li> Not worth buying. They don&#x27;t cut.</li>
            <li> Good product, good quality.&lt;br /&gt;Meets expectations I had.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was adequate and arrived in very good condition&lt;br /&gt;The product is good and works properly</li>
