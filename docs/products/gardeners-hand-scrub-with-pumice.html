            <li>Best hand cleanser ever!!</li>
            <li>Best hand cleaner ever, great for getting the dirt under nails.</li>

            <li>The Hand Scrub with Pumice is great.</li>
            <li>He was happy to get it.</li>
            <li>If you like to play in the garden, but then have dirt under your nails and in the cuticles, this is a very nice wash to keep handy.  </li>
            <li>Cleans nicely, and besides getting the grime off, it is pleasant smelling.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased to have found it for sale on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the scrub has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this hand scrub.</li>
            <li>I just LOVE it</li>
            <li>I garden a lot and love this product.</li>
            <li>I thought this was full of herbs and pumice, but it&#x27;s also full of every kind of parabens.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s gentle on my hands and makes them smell nice afterwards.</li>
            <li>Have used this for several years and does a great job gently removing the grime of yardwork (can&#x27;t be bothered with&lt;br /&gt;wearing gloves) and leaves my hands feeling silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Clean, fresh scent, too.</li>
            <li>This is a tremendous product...have used it for years ...</li>
            <li>I love this hand scrub because it&#x27;s strong enough to do the job</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the price since nothing else found works.</li>
            <li>The pumice in this hand scrub really helps clean hands thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a fan of C&amp;E and don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t look there first.</li>
            <li>This is my second tube, as I was so pleased with the first.</li>
            <li>This scrub leaves your hands soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for a long time and everyone in our household love it; and that includes a gardener, mechanic and a woodworker.  </li>
            <li>It cleans grit and grime off my hands easily because of the pumice it contains, but it also moisturizes and smells yummy at the same time!  </li>
            <li>Maybe a bit pricey but highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It may clean hands well, but No thanks, I&#x27;ll try something else.</li>
            <li>It thoroughly cleans soil and is very soft on your hands.</li>
            <li>It also lasts a very long time, as you only need about a nickel-sized amount to do a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a number of partially used &amp;#34;after-gardening&amp;#34; products, but this and the Hand Therapy really work.  </li>
            <li>My hands were so soft and soaked up the cream in a second.</li>
            <li>My husband is an avid gardener and uses this product nearly every day during the growing season and also for any time his hands seem to be too dirty for regular soap, such as after doing a garage clean up.  </li>

            <li> Have used this for several years and does a great job gently removing the grime of yardwork (can&#x27;t be bothered with&lt;br /&gt;wearing gloves) and leaves my hands feeling silky smooth.  Ordered this for a gift for another gardening friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a number of partially used &amp;#34;after-gardening&amp;#34; products, but this and the Hand Therapy really work.  I&#x27;ve always been a fan of C&amp;E and don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t look there first.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, but my local store stopped carrying it. I was very pleased to have found it for sale on Amazon. This product removes all dirt and grime, even the dirt which seems to imbed in callouses. This scrub leaves your hands soft and clean. It also lasts a very long time, as you only need about a nickel-sized amount to do a fantastic job. I will definitely reorder this product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this hand scrub. I tried it in a friends bathroom a few months ago and then put some handcream on. My hands were so soft and soaked up the cream in a second.</li>

            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.  It cleans grit and grime off my hands easily because of the pumice it contains, but it also moisturizes and smells yummy at the same time!  I just LOVE it and I spend a lot of time \\&quot;playing in the dirt\\&quot; in my garden.  Try it...you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My go- to hand cleanser after gardening. I wear garden gloves, but even then my hands get dried out. This pumice gel scrub cleans, moisturizes, and smells great. It is like a mini manicure hand massage! Clean, fresh scent, too. Don&#x27;t change a thing.</li>
            <li> The Hand Scrub with Pumice is great. It thoroughly cleans soil and is very soft on your hands. I garden a lot and love this product.</li>
            <li> It was for my brother &amp; I already knew he like it.  He was happy to get it.</li>
            <li> This is a tremendous product...have used it for years ...I never wear gloves gardening but this pumice easily removes all the grim and dirt from my hands and fingers!!</li>
            <li> I love this hand scrub because it&#x27;s strong enough to do the job but it&#x27;s gentle on my hands and makes them smell nice afterwards. I use this all the time when I come in from the garden and my hands are all grubby from working in the dirt. It gets all the junk off my hands and from under my nails without leaving me feeling like I&#x27;ve put my hands through a chemical bath.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time and everyone in our household love it; and that includes a gardener, mechanic and a woodworker.  It is definitely worth the price since nothing else found works.</li>
            <li> Best hand cleaner ever, great for getting the dirt under nails.</li>
            <li> Cannot imagine coming in from the garden and not using the C&amp; E hand scrub.  I am never without it.  Cleans nicely, and besides getting the grime off, it is pleasant smelling.  Maybe a bit pricey but highly recommended.</li>
            <li> our very favorite!!!  works like a charm</li>
            <li> This product works miracles!!  My husband is an avid gardener and uses this product nearly every day during the growing season and also for any time his hands seem to be too dirty for regular soap, such as after doing a garage clean up.  The price through Amazon is great!!</li>
