            <li> This is the biggest crock of s*** I have ever seen!!!! I get a tube that has NOT FOR SALE on it and said it was a sample, guess what? Not what I thought I was suppose to get but, what I got!!!!! Biggest SCAM I have ever seen.....</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!! This is a Tiny Free Sample!!! HUGE SCAM!!!</li>
            <li> What a joke...thought i was getting almost an ounce and i got 0.1 oz. Plus it even said on the packaging  enjoy your free sample!  Cheat and a liar !</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference using this product.</li>
            <li> The product I received and paid for, was a FREE sample.  I&#x27;ve never paid for a FREE sample before.</li>
            <li> Wish I could have given it a NO STAR!! This came in a teeny, tiny tube.....almost dried up!! And on the package it said &amp;#34;Not for Resale&amp;#34;....meaning it was a Sample!! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS.....rip off!!</li>
            <li> This has got to be the Biggest Scam on the market today.  Do not Buy.  You get a sample. That&#x27;s all.  And they are charging  outrageous prices for something that says not to be &amp;#34;Resold&amp;#34;  I have contacted Amazon to take them off their lists of business that they deal with. If I could give it a minus 5 stars I would</li>
            <li> So disappointed. No idea this was a sample. Only had one use. Never again. üòÅ</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Non greasy. Fast absorbing, great on sensitive skin, great results.</li>
            <li> This is a tiny sample that reads \\&quot;NOT FOR SALE\\&quot; it was most definitely not meant to be sold separately. This tiny thing was never $140, they are trying to trick you into believing it is bigger. Don&#x27;t give them your money.</li>
            <li> Do not be fooled!  This is the free sample from the website.  Someone is being dirty and cheap.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any difference in my skin since start using two weeks ago.</li>
            <li> This is a small sample and not worth it.  The picture is blown up to make it look bigger.  Look at the shipping weight  and product volume Before buying People</li>
            <li> Someone is trying to make a ton of money from this! Its best to buy from a honest Jeunesse rep!!</li>
            <li> Not doing anything seems like. so I threw it out.</li>
