            <li>Best self tanner of them all!</li>
            <li>Works great!!!!</li>
            <li>Service with this vendor was great!</li>
            <li>It is the best tanning product ever</li>
            <li>Great product otherwise.  </li>
            <li>Towels did not work or tan that great after one application.</li>
            <li>Package arrived in great condition and on time.</li>
            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>I think it is amazing!</li>
            <li>I have fair skin that is prone to burning so tanning on summer vacations</li>
            <li>Recommend applying with gloves good color.</li>
            <li>My skin is so fair, it&#x27;s practically translucent.  </li>
            <li>I have been using  these for years and this is a good price for them.</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Be sure to wash your hands after or you&#x27;ll be walking around with a nice tan on the palm of your hands!</li>
            <li>I LOVE Tan Towels!</li>
            <li>Great product, great buy, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Great product, I have been using it on and off for years since it first was sold on HSN.  </li>
            <li>I have used countless self tanners but Tan Towel is the best.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to moisturize afterwards.   </li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!  </li>
            <li>so I could afford to use them more often.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to apply - never</li>
            <li>It works best to use the towel over your legs and body first and end with knees, elbows and feet last when the towel is dryer.  </li>
            <li>The Tan Towels are easy to use and practically error free.  </li>
            <li>The towel application assures a smooth even outcome.</li>
            <li>Several years ago I tried this product through on-line shopping network and they worked great.</li>
            <li>I love using these to get just enough color on my legs to look good in shorts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many tanning products/methods and this one is the best in all categories of ease, low odor,  accurate coloring as stated on package, lasting power, no streaking.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and my tan is reddish, not golden.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and tan towel gives me just the right amount of color, so I look a little more &amp;#34;golden&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I have used several self tanners and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>, obviously, I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Maybe the medium-dark towelettes would be a better choice for a more instant tan</li>
            <li>I first tried Tan Towels six years ago for a special event.</li>
            <li>Stick with it, it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>and it appears more natural.</li>
            <li>Would certainly recommend it to other fair skinned &amp;#34;hard to tan&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Make sure u shave prior.  </li>
            <li>I waited the four hours before using more towels for my second application, but in just the first day I&#x27;ve gone through 1 of the 3 boxes.  </li>
            <li>I continue to use them as a safe way to &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; before big events or beach vacations.</li>
            <li>Used them for many years as I am not able to be in the sun as much any more.</li>
            <li>However, with these tan towels, I now have a very natural golden tan on my legs.  </li>
            <li>I have used tanning lotions in the past, and decided to try these out to see if I&#x27;d get better, more natural results.  </li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Very even tan.</li>
            <li>Delivery is very timely.</li>
            <li>Because it is so gradual, your tan will develop and wash really evenly.</li>
            <li>This product is convenient and works very well.  </li>
            <li>A real keeper.</li>
            <li>I originally bought these for a gift and got extra for myself.  </li>
            <li>The product is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t stink, and has minimal chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>Color is gradual, and if you are as fair as I am, it will take 2 to 3 applications to get a nice base.  </li>
            <li>Wish they could make the product a little more cost efficient.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions, and the first application I put on barely showed up on me.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily without mess.  </li>
            <li>orange, always a natural looking glow!  </li>
            <li>The tan looks so natural and no streaking.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and my family says its as natural as can be.</li>
            <li>Were they old, is what I am asking myself?</li>
            <li>Especially when fair skin &amp; need color while unable to be out in sun without burning.</li>
            <li>I like that the color is subtle so that mistakes aren&#x27;t easy to see</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I certainly do appreciate having a single towel that I know will not dry out.</li>

            <li> The tan last longer than other products&#x27; tan.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have any dry spots.</li>
            <li> I hop out of the shower, dry off, use one and then pop my robe on loosely.  </li>
            <li> If you buy the half body pack, you will need two towels to cover your entire body.</li>
            <li> Just be careful on how you apply and follow the instruction.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this tanner for a few years and it gives a subtle glow and much easier than others, to control streaking.</li>
            <li> if you are as lazy as I am, and don&#x27;t want to worry about streaks, this is definitely for you.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this over other tanning products on the market.</li>
            <li> Okay -- I&#x27;ve heard that these are very expensive for self tanning but for me, there is no more convenient option.  </li>
            <li> I apply it at night, wait a few minutes to let it dry and am tan in the morning.</li>
            <li> only negative is the cost.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical and pleasantly surprised at the results and ease of use.</li>
            <li> I find it&#x27;s easiest to use at night, wipe the towels on, wait a few minutes then shower off in the morning.</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is that I wish they were a little less expensive</li>
            <li> In order to cut down on cost, I use Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow to get my \\&quot;base tan\\&quot; and then use the Tan Towels to keep my color.  </li>
            <li> Used 2 tan towels and hardly saw a difference on legs.</li>
            <li> the day applied (applying late in the day takes care of this.)  </li>
            <li> Gives her a subtle year-round tan she loves without the exposure to sunlight.  </li>
            <li> When I use other products, I can always get a whiff of this odor for days and hate that.  </li>
            <li> It covers small broken blood vessels for those who hate that about their legs.</li>
            <li> Where the Jergen&#x27;s tends to have that fake tan smell</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical ~</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Can never go wrong with purchasing this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any unpleasant order with the Tan Towels.</li>
            <li> Did get on hands to badly, I couldn&#x27;t get smell off.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>

            <li> Best self tanner of them all!</li>
            <li> I have used countless self tanners but Tan Towel is the best.  It goes on easily without mess.  The tan last longer than other products&#x27; tan.  It works best to use the towel over your legs and body first and end with knees, elbows and feet last when the towel is dryer.  Be sure to moisturize afterwards.   It has a distinctive odor that I find all of these like-products to have, but the plus with Tan Towel is the odor only last the day applied (applying late in the day takes care of this.)  When I use other products, I can always get a whiff of this odor for days and hate that.  Second to this I like the Aveeno tanner.  It is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I discovered Tan Towels about a year ago before I left on a trip.  I have fair skin that is prone to burning so tanning on summer vacations is not even a possibility. The Tan Towels are easy to use and practically error free.  I suggest using an exfolilator prior to applying the Tan Towels so you don&#x27;t have any dry spots. In order to cut down on cost, I use Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow to get my \\&quot;base tan\\&quot; and then use the Tan Towels to keep my color.  Where the Jergen&#x27;s tends to have that fake tan smell I don&#x27;t notice any unpleasant order with the Tan Towels. I also use them on my face and haven&#x27;t had any problem with breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> Love these.  The tan looks so natural and no streaking.  Very even tan.</li>
            <li> Love them! Used them for many years as I am not able to be in the sun as much any more.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these.  Gives her a subtle year-round tan she loves without the exposure to sunlight.  She has me order them regularly.  Delivery is very timely.</li>
            <li> Make sure u shave prior.  I shaved the day after use &amp;y tub had big clumps of it.  Great product otherwise.  My niece told me about this so I was skeptical ~❤️</li>
            <li> if you are as lazy as I am, and don&#x27;t want to worry about streaks, this is definitely for you. I use two half-body and it covers everything. Any residual smell is your body developing the product. There is no smell to the product at all.  Color is gradual, and if you are as fair as I am, it will take 2 to 3 applications to get a nice base.  Stick with it, it is definitely worth it. Because it is so gradual, your tan will develop and wash really evenly.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and tan towel gives me just the right amount of color, so I look a little more &amp;#34;golden&amp;#34;.  It doesn&#x27;t turn my skin at all orangey, and the color last several days.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years so, obviously, I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and my family says its as natural as can be. Not a bit of that creepy orange outcome so many other products produce. The towel application assures a smooth even outcome. Be sure to wash your hands after or you&#x27;ll be walking around with a nice tan on the palm of your hands!</li>
            <li> Towels did not work or tan that great after one application. I have tried them before and found the opposite to be true.&lt;br /&gt;So I was a bit disappointed.  Maybe the medium-dark towelettes would be a better choice for a more instant tan</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many tanning products/methods and this one is the best in all categories of ease, low odor,  accurate coloring as stated on package, lasting power, no streaking.</li>
            <li> Great product, I have been using it on and off for years since it first was sold on HSN.  Package arrived in great condition and on time.</li>
            <li> Works great!!!! Especially when fair skin &amp; need color while unable to be out in sun without burning. Recommend applying with gloves good color.</li>
            <li> This product is convenient and works very well.  I would recommend this over other tanning products on the market. A real keeper.</li>
            <li> Okay -- I&#x27;ve heard that these are very expensive for self tanning but for me, there is no more convenient option.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of self tanners and none of them have ever given me the results that Tan Towels have.  I&#x27;ve never had streaking or orange color and I don&#x27;t even have to use a glove to cover my hands.  I hop out of the shower, dry off, use one and then pop my robe on loosely.  That&#x27;s it.  And I even use them on my face -- no problem!  Fantastic!  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is that I wish they were a little less expensive so I could afford to use them more often.</li>
            <li> I originally bought these for a gift and got extra for myself.  I was skeptical and pleasantly surprised at the results and ease of use. No streaks or orange color.  Just be careful on how you apply and follow the instruction.  And they also go a longer way than they say.  You can use a sheet on your face, arms, chest etc., vs just on our face.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Tan Towels! They are so easy to apply - never orange, always a natural looking glow!  Can never go wrong with purchasing this product!</li>
            <li> Great product, great buy, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very white.  My skin is so fair, it&#x27;s practically translucent.  I have used tanning lotions in the past, and decided to try these out to see if I&#x27;d get better, more natural results.  I followed the directions, and the first application I put on barely showed up on me.  I waited the four hours before using more towels for my second application, but in just the first day I&#x27;ve gone through 1 of the 3 boxes.  I have a feeling if these start to work at all, it won&#x27;t start to look the way it&#x27;s supposed to until I get through my third box, and then I&#x27;d have to keep paying roughly $50 every week to keep a tan.  That&#x27;s way too expensive.</li>
            <li> I love using these to get just enough color on my legs to look good in shorts. It covers small broken blood vessels for those who hate that about their legs. The product is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t stink, and has minimal chemicals in it. I apply it at night, wait a few minutes to let it dry and am tan in the morning. I have been using  these for years and this is a good price for them. Service with this vendor was great!</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and my tan is reddish, not golden.  My legs never tan!  However, with these tan towels, I now have a very natural golden tan on my legs.  Would certainly recommend it to other fair skinned &amp;#34;hard to tan&amp;#34; people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative is the cost.  Wish they could make the product a little more cost efficient.  Maybe putting ten tanning towels in one reclosable bag as one option?  On the other hand, I certainly do appreciate having a single towel that I know will not dry out.</li>
            <li> I first tried Tan Towels six years ago for a special event. I continue to use them as a safe way to &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; before big events or beach vacations. The towels come in individually wrapped packages. If you buy the half body pack, you will need two towels to cover your entire body. I find it&#x27;s easiest to use at night, wipe the towels on, wait a few minutes then shower off in the morning. I don&#x27;t notice a strong fake tanner odor. I will say it&#x27;s easier if you can get someone else to help you with the application - this avoids any discoloration to your palms and if they wash their hands well after helping you, they won&#x27;t see any discoloration either. I like that the color is subtle so that mistakes aren&#x27;t easy to see and it appears more natural. I recommend building the color over several consecutive days of application.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product. Used 2 tan towels and hardly saw a difference on legs. Used as directed. Did get on hands to badly, I couldn&#x27;t get smell off. Were they old, is what I am asking myself? Several years ago I tried this product through on-line shopping network and they worked great. Guess I&#x27;ll have to purchase from them.</li>
            <li> I have used several self tanners and this is by far the best. I have been using this tanner for a few years and it gives a subtle glow and much easier than others, to control streaking.</li>
            <li> Been using them for over 10 years. I think it is amazing!</li>
            <li> It is the best tanning product ever</li>
