            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and goes on very nice.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still a very nice cream and absorbs well, plus it doesn&#x27;t cost a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Greta</li>
            <li>if forward and encourage everyone else to try this amazing cream!</li>
            <li>I also liked that the vendor sent two emails with information about how to use the cream!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Love this eye cream...feels great, works great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really really good</li>
            <li>I gave it a fair trial--no results, and allergy eyes.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizing cream around the eyes.</li>
            <li>I thank Loressen for making these wonderful products available at&lt;br /&gt;such affordable prices.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair for anyone to say they saw results in a week because that wasn&#x27;t my case or</li>
            <li>but this cream is good for the quality/price ratio.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>This is a truly good product.  </li>
            <li>It feels really good though and wakes your eyes up in the morning.</li>
            <li>Good Product</li>
            <li>It feel good when applying.</li>
            <li>good product for this price.</li>
            <li>, neither of us have had any good results, this just burns the area around your eyes but</li>
            <li>It was perfect before -- truly effective, inexpensive, and easy to wear.  </li>
            <li>The cream may be very good, but I have a strong allergy to something in the product.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased..</li>
            <li>I find it to be a refreshing product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying more!</li>
            <li>, my eyes have never felt better!  </li>
            <li>I love this eye cream!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic and makes a visible difference!!</li>
            <li>Very rich and soothing!</li>
            <li>The attractive cost is a huge factor in my using it.</li>
            <li>I like the way this one feels when I put it on (absorbs without feeling greasy) and it makes my eyes feel nice in the morning</li>
            <li>It feels good going on and has a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>Has a nice tingly feel when applied.</li>
            <li>Seems to tighten the skin up nicely.</li>
            <li>Lots of hype, nice packaging, but doesn&#x27;t offer anything to make me buy it again.</li>
            <li>But still a nice product.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have a perfume type smell to it and it does go on nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking oily.</li>
            <li>, the company sent me a nice email thank me for the purchase and how to use it.</li>
            <li>As directed it&#x27;s just nice and &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>This is a nice cream.</li>
            <li>because it will gradually absorb into my skin on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>was excited to use this product from reading all the great reviews</li>
            <li>The Loressen VitalEyes Eye Cream has given the best results at a far better cost!</li>
            <li>Not work the price and has a very very strong odor</li>
            <li>And, the best part is, it didn&#x27;t sting or hurt my usually sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t hesitate paying hundreds for eye creams, I may have tried just about everything at Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom, this clearly is the best!  </li>
            <li>All in all this is a great eye cream and worth the money.</li>
            <li>I am quite impressed so far.</li>
            <li>Too, the company has followed up with me and additionally offered a lovely discount on my new order.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li>my eyes have faded tremendously and I can honestly say that it works good for me.</li>
            <li>good tingling - not bad tingling).  </li>
            <li>It has a very nice, light, clean scent.</li>
            <li>I have allergies to most of the eye products out there.</li>
            <li>The result is not permanent, but it works during sleep and will work better if you sleep longer.  </li>
            <li>I love to treat my skin, but have been struggling to find an eye cream that fits my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It moisturizers ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I love Loressen and will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m hopeful with more usage</li>
            <li>Every time I apply it on my eye area, it makes me feel good and smile.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been almost 2 weeks, in addition to healthy eating and drinking plenty of water</li>
            <li>my eyes look much better.</li>
            <li>I am still working on sleeping better.</li>
            <li>It was starting to get out of control, adding years to my appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this eye cream</li>
            <li>My puffiness is better and my wrinkles aren&#x27;t as pronounced.  </li>
            <li>and I think you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li>for sure it is better than before use</li>
            <li>I think that it works better on the puffiness then the darkness.</li>
            <li>hoping for more</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m off to another product in hopes I find something that works better.</li>
            <li>This stuff worked miracles...as soon as I am able I am going to get more</li>
            <li>I am so pleased that I ordered the Loressen Vitamin C serum as well and look forward to using it.</li>
            <li>I also use the Triple Vitamin C Serum and love the&lt;br /&gt;product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li>After experimenting with many eye creams -- the puffiness remain - after all at age 80 you don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try this, but I really love their vitamic C serum, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Feels refreshing when applied.</li>
            <li>I am still in search of a better eye cream.</li>
            <li>and I look more rested.</li>
            <li>Also, I love the packaging.  </li>
            <li>I love the spicy scent of this cream as well.</li>
            <li>I would love to say what the others have said</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it worked for the others.</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I do love this cream.  </li>
            <li>I love the texture and it has a very&lt;br /&gt;faint fragrance.  </li>
            <li>very moisterizing and feels great.  </li>
            <li>sure show it.</li>
            <li>but this felt nice and smooth on me.</li>
            <li>You could pay a lot more for creams that don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>My eyes feel better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use this product to see if there are any results, but I have gotten better results from a serum use.</li>
            <li>On top of that, wearing glasses for over 25 years doesn&#x27;t help at all.  </li>
            <li>I love that it does not get in my eyes and sting.</li>
            <li>I will buy this product any try for 6 more months.</li>
            <li>I used it for years as did many friends and relatives.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a nice, moisturizing eye cream in addition to a powerful &amp;#34;bag fighter&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cream before and thought it was great, but the new formulation is even better.  </li>
            <li>a lot, as I customarily do, and it stings pretty good.</li>
            <li>The misses loves these little items and they make great Happy Day presents.</li>
            <li>goes on nicely and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>The eye cream feels nice - light, smooth.</li>
            <li>The container is great you never loose a drop, very thoughtful.</li>
            <li>I am 41 yrs old , and have been getting puffiness under my eyes , but this cream works great</li>
            <li>I will say that when I apply it, it feels good on my skin and there is a gentle cooling/tingling sensation around my eyes (</li>
            <li>It feels good, but did absolutely nothing for the puffiness and circles on my eyes.</li>
            <li>The only thing I found great about the cream is that is very smooth on the skin it does not irritate or cause any dryness.</li>
            <li>I sent customer service a message and without questions asked I got a full refund so thank you!</li>
            <li>Applies easily, covers and blends in well and has soothing effect.</li>
            <li>I do wish it was in a pump bottle, but just have to make sure my hand&#x27;s are clean when using it so bacteria won&#x27;t be spread.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too soon to say if I can see results yet, but so far so good:)</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>updated on 5/18/14 to indicate that product continues to help improve dark circles and customer services is excellent.</li>
            <li>I used to use Hydrolize for the dark circles and it worked wonderfully until they changed their formula.  </li>
            <li>I love how it feels cool when you put it on</li>
            <li>So far loving it!  </li>
            <li>I have used jojoba oil around my eyes for years and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many eye creams in the past, and this product is the one that has worked the best for me.  </li>
            <li>Way more concentrated than any other brands I&#x27;ve tried, AND THAT&#x27;S A GOOD THING!</li>
            <li>It works well for decreasing puffiness and fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE what you do for my eyes, THANK YOU for creating a product that gives me the perfect hydration, helps eliminate my puffy and not so attractive dark circles that hide my green eyes that I love to show off.</li>
            <li>Customer service is very good, they follow up via email within a few days of your purchase, thanking you and inquiring on how well the product is working for you, plus additional tips on how to use the product more effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product not only for women , but me too .</li>
            <li>I still have quite a bit, so hopefully it will become available again.</li>
            <li>The cream feels smooth and silky as it goes on the skin.</li>
            <li>I plan to continue to order this product since I have been getting such great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary</li>
            <li>It keeps my eyelids moist and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This product is fabulous in all aspects except for one.  </li>
            <li>, Works Great See changes next day....</li>
            <li>Excellent product -- may take a few days to notice results.  </li>
            <li>I am 29 years old and still have good skin if this helps anyone.</li>
            <li>So far so good with this cream it absorbs well and is non greasy.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!</li>
            <li>creams - and this one feels so fresh, clean &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that any product really has much of an effect on true undereye circles, but it feels great.</li>
            <li>Puffiness significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>Not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Saw a significant difference around my eyes</li>
            <li>so I use a lot more than is directed, with no ill effects.</li>
            <li>Very gentle, and very rich and luxurious.</li>
            <li>It is light, comfortable and readily absorbed.</li>
            <li>This is the best eye cream I have ever used, it goes on smooth and it really does help with dark circles and puffiness.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special about this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I love its scent which is so fresh.</li>
            <li>but you can find lotion just as good at your local drug store.</li>
            <li>I have noticed the skin around my eyes looks better, and the circles much lighter</li>
            <li>I use it during the day, and use a more intense moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the cream for almost a week, it absorbs into the eye area nicely, it doesn&#x27;t irritate or sting the skin- as my eye area is sensitive.</li>
            <li>This eye cream was a good moisturizer, but that was the only benefit.</li>
            <li>Wonderful sale prices lately too.</li>
            <li>If I want to wear a scent, I want to choose it myself, and be able to control how much and when I want to wear it.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be true to its claims.</li>
            <li>i am an asian guy, and this product works good on me.</li>
            <li>I love how the cream feels going on and it moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>Not my absolute favorite but a backup</li>
            <li>Need more time, but so far so good, think I look a little better around my eye area!</li>
            <li>It also dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t look greasy</li>
            <li>This eye cream is a super value considering the results.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 3 months now, and I have noticed a tremendous difference in the wrinkles under my eyes and the crow&#x27;s feet as well.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and does help with my puffiness.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference fairly quickly and look forward to the continued improvement.</li>
            <li>Pros: Moisturizing, absorbs quickly into the skin, doesn&#x27;t smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t fall asleep very easily, and I have to wake up early for school.</li>
            <li>The packaging is heavier and bigger than the old simplecontainer and the consistency has gone from being a nice cream that would absorb easily into your skin to a gel consistency that sits on top, sticky and shiny.</li>
            <li>I am a 40 year old woman I&#x27;ve had dark circles under eyes since I was a kid, I&#x27;ve tried lots and this cream is the best!</li>
            <li>I used only for 5 days now and it is pretty good, do not expect miracles because creams do not bring miracles to your skin, aging is a physiological process and nothing can stop it, not even plastic surgery</li>
            <li>Feels &amp; smells great and quite is moisturizing, however, I bought it primarily for dark circles and really don&#x27;t see the results in that regard.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to order more products that Loressen offers!</li>
            <li>I would recommend highly!!!</li>
            <li>This jar of creme is much more effective than previous.   </li>
            <li>The results look a little but there isn&#x27;t a great difference</li>
            <li>This cream feels very good going on, no pulling on the delicate skin.</li>
            <li>I did not see a whole lot of improvement on the crows feet and lines around eyes, but it made the skin around eye area feel and look smooth.  </li>
            <li>So far, my eyes are more relaxed after using this cream.  </li>
            <li>At first my skin felt a mild burning sensation but that has stopped now.  </li>
            <li>Price was right on sale but it is not a morale cure for puffiness.</li>
            <li>Loressen VitalEyes Eye Cream was the best one because it actually removed the dark circles and puffiness</li>
            <li>Not only does it keep the eye area moisturized throughout the day, but it really does reduce the appearance of fine lines, puffiness and promotes a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>It took away some of the dark circles however not as good as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>I think that if you are not sensitive to perfumes and chemical odors this would be a nice eye cream</li>
            <li>It works very well to maintain the skin of eye area very smooth and soft and help wrinkle away.</li>
            <li>But I love to use this under the concealer with a little primer, and it goes on really smooth!</li>
            <li>and I felt i looked &amp;#34;younger.&amp;#34; Incredible results, every eye cream i ever used dried up and irritated my sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>but if you are sensitive you might find the odor too strong.</li>
            <li>I do not usually leave detailed reviews.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle and can see result&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I used the first two containers without problems.  </li>
            <li>Just when I thought that I had finally found an eye cream that I wasn&#x27;t allergic to, the product was changed, and not for the better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle of this.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it (without concealer)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other creams, but this one is seriously worth it - even my mom says so!</li>
            <li>Will  be back for more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been interested in cosmetically correcting them</li>
            <li>The first ingredient I&#x27;d water.</li>
            <li>This moisturizes pretty well though.</li>
            <li>I used it exactly as directed.  </li>
            <li>It is very relaxing and you almost feel the change right after first couple days.</li>
            <li>This cream is fabulous im enjoying it everyday</li>
            <li>However, it does not do anything negative either, which is more than I can say for most eye creams I have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not seen meaningful results or have had negative reactions to many of these products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does feel nice under my eyes but it did not help for my dark circles.</li>
            <li>I previously used Obagi eye cream and found this to be as effective, at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with my purchase of this eye cream, if definitely firms, reduces puffiness and the apperance of dark circles.  </li>
            <li>circles.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent &amp; would be fine used only as a moisturizer but do NOT get it in hopes of clearing up dark circles.</li>
            <li>It is now soft and the fine lines appear to have become less prominent.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin healthy and dark circle free( nearly)</li>
            <li>I actually noticed fine lines forming around my eyes while I used this cream.  </li>
            <li>It has definitely reduced a lot of the fine lines around my eye and makes them look healthier.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve noticed a definite improvement in the fine lines and firmness around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I see a huge difference in the dark circles, but that&#x27;s true of every product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I bought this before it was reformulated, but at the time it smelled too perfumey for me and didn&#x27;t help my eyes too much.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much change.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really really good&lt;</li>
            <li>Real this cream.</li>
            <li>i think product is designed for female skin, I used the product every night before going to sleep, and when i purchased the seller gave me a tip of lightly tapping it when applying it on my skin, followed the direction but meh</li>
            <li>Those pumps tend to squeeze out too much.</li>
            <li>I really try to like this cream</li>
            <li>Wanted to use this for awhile before I wrote a review and now that I have and really like it</li>
            <li>Some of the puffiness has diminished also, but not quite as much as I hoped.</li>
            <li>did I see unusual results?</li>
            <li>I really feel like I look 10 years &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>This eye cream really smells now - it is an overpowering floral scent.</li>
            <li>I had just finished the whole jar and did not see a difference.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li>I have used it morning and night for about two weeks now and have not noticed much of a difference yet.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have puffiness, but rather aging skin.  </li>
            <li>I am a light skinned Hispanic who suffered from eye bags since middle school.</li>
            <li>Thanks see Youu</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much results.</li>
            <li>Tried others but this one really works.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>and I feel like it&#x27;s really waking up my eyes.</li>
            <li>Another plus is it soaks in well after a few minutes and sits nicely under makeup without feeling all oily or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My products came so quick that I really don&#x27;t think that I took my fingers off the key boards...  </li>
            <li>It flows on easily and has a faint rose scent.  </li>
            <li>I have allergies and because of that have dark circles most of the time.  </li>
            <li>I would rate five star if it works better for the dark cycle.</li>
            <li>well time to hunt for a new one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be looking for a new product, similar to the original.</li>
            <li>I think they need a new name for this eye cream, it did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>; Even the new jar is nasty--heavy and bulky and TOO MUCH.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy with the cream and would definitely recommend it to people to at least give it</li>
            <li>My main concern has always been under eye puffiness, and now I always look well rested.</li>
            <li>Just being realistic</li>
            <li>This is the type of product that I would give 10 stars to, because it is so efficacious AND such a tremendous value.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent eye moisturizer though.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but I still wish they gave you a little more.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m confident with longer use that it will fade those little spots too.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This eye cream absorbs fast and leaves the skin under the eyes soft.</li>
            <li>I hit the gym early, work long days, enjoy spending evenings with my boyfriend and friends.</li>
            <li>I have not used it long enough to be able to say if it will help with darkness under eyes</li>
            <li>So I was pleased to see after just a few days that I truly do see a difference.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve actually never written a review before on amazon, but this eye cream is truly worth the review.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different products some for far more money that didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>am on my second jar of eye cream and let me say first that it absolutely works just like it said it would.</li>
            <li>I do look a little younger now which is always nice.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this and did not spend the high price I have in the past.</li>
            <li>After only half of my first jar of VitalEyes, i saw such an amazing difference.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new eye cream and came across this whilst shopping on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d like to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>This is now my new go to eye cream.</li>
            <li>The dark circles and fine lines have diminished with every day use.</li>
            <li>It is easing fine lines around my eyes and my dark circles are diminishing.</li>
            <li>Very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>My eyes are very sensitive and even the &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; stuff irritates me.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and rosacea, and this doesn&#x27;t cause any redness or dryness nor does it irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I am very much looking forward to some other products of Loressen which I would definitely love to purchase after using up my other brands.</li>
            <li>I could tell a huge difference in my dark circles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not overly sensitive to fragrance, but this made my eyes water!  </li>
            <li>old lady strength smell!</li>
            <li>Also, makes soft   !</li>
            <li>After going through the whole bottle (used twice daily, as directed) I&#x27;ve seen no noticeable reduction in the dark circles under my eyes, or even in the fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>With my first use, I was assaulted with the overpowering scent of fake rose perfume, which in my opinion, should never be an ingredient in eye cream, nor should any scent, for that matter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now greasy and heavy and has a strong fragrance of &amp;#34;roses&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I only bought this cream on Amazon because of the positive reviews so now I am going ot pay</li>
            <li>This product has worked fairly well on me, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and have noticed a slight difference.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first that a cream could actually do that, but this one, after using it for over a month, I can honestly say really works well for me.  </li>
            <li>This is a large container and it will last awhile.</li>
            <li>For me, that is a clear winner.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My life is busy and I don&#x27;t want my eyes to show it.  </li>
            <li>I know my eyes are sensitive, but others didn&#x27;t seem to have problems.</li>
            <li>My eyes turned red an puffy and they really burned</li>
            <li>It is far to greasy, even after waiting an hour after application</li>
            <li>I like that the ingredients seem to be all natural and that it hasn&#x27;t been tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>Between the eye drops my opthamologist ordered and Vital Eyes Cream</li>
            <li>So far, my eyes have maintained moisture since applying it.</li>
            <li>and this is gentle enough for me to use!</li>
            <li>I used Loressen Vital Eyes the night I received it</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old</li>
            <li>I found Vital Eyes&lt;</li>
            <li>Like I said so far no change</li>
            <li>I do advise people who are very allergic to move cautiously, however, as we are all affected differently by products.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I am always hesitant about trying eye products because mine are so sensitive.</li>
            <li>Both my eyes swelled, turned red and were very itchy.</li>
            <li>I am 26 yr old, just looking to prevent wrinkles and get rid of under eye circles.</li>
            <li>But, the smell is very persistent; it lasted for several hours and gave me a headache.</li>
            <li>My husband used this product and was pleasantly surprised with the results.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money, it does not work...</li>
            <li>Sometimes I just gave up, since they have been with me since I was a young girl.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised after a week of using it morning and night.  </li>
            <li>I am an African American female with light complexion skin.</li>
            <li>old tax accountant.</li>
            <li>I know if I keep using it like this they&#x27;ll be completely gone.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin feel nice and soft around the eyes, as it tends to get dry and a little red after showering.</li>
            <li>Vital Eyes worked as no other product had.  </li>
            <li>I have always purchased more expensive eye creams and to be true, none of them did much for my dark circles.  </li>
            <li>So many eye creams are too light, too heavy, and greasy, draws my eye makeup down under my eyes (come on, I don&#x27;t need help with dark circles), or an exorbitant amount for lackluster product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LORESSEN</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure it helps my case of dark circles, as my skin is super this and pretty much translucent under the eye, I end up having to use a concealer regardless.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: As of 1/18/14, I have been using this product twice a day now for several weeks, and I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about it.  </li>
            <li>34;lightening deal&amp;#34; &amp; had decent reviews and was really hopeful it could help with my dark circles...</li>
            <li>New formula is entirely different.</li>
            <li>I caved and went back to Estée Lauder, it costs more but at least it works.  </li>
            <li>The bags below my eyes are genetic (not due to lack of sleep or salt, etc).</li>
            <li>The other cream that claimed to be made from \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients was nice because it had a thick creamy texture, but the results did not compare.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product and will continue to use it, but at least initially, the first time you apply it, USE AS DIRECTED!</li>
            <li>It takes VERY little to make the skin around my eyes feel moisturized and also my eyes feel so cool after I use it.  </li>
            <li>Have not used it long enough yet to determine how much a difference it is making.  </li>
            <li>This was the third container of Vital Eyes that I have ordered .</li>
            <li>The third container arrived, a reformulated version of Vital Eyes.</li>
            <li>Completely over priced considering the total lack of results.</li>
            <li>Eye Cream that I have tries that really does work.</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old and occasionally will use it too,</li>
            <li>I am only 24 years old</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 2 months now and my eye-lids barely sag over my eyes.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll notice a difference in puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is the quantity in each jar -- there just isn&#x27;t very much in there and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Product works very well removing dark circles and general improvement to hide wrinkles in the eye</li>
            <li>I am an African American woman, 43 years old.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using this cream for a few days, but already I am seeing a tightness in my under eyes that I have not seen on myself since elementary school.</li>
            <li>so I usually let it dry a little in the mornings then go about my normal routine appealing concealer, etc.  </li>
            <li>It really helped the dark circles.  </li>
            <li>It will take away your dark circles and really does make you look and feel refreshed.  </li>
            <li>The dark areas under my eyes have improved so so much and even some of the deeper wrinkles have drastically improved.</li>
            <li>Did not see much improvement for the dark circles after 3 months of using.</li>
            <li>It has really help with the dark circles under the eyes and the puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I generally apply eye cream only once per day</li>
            <li>I have not seen a significant change unfortunately and its very greesy</li>
            <li>My under eye circles are much lighter and the puffiness a lot less.</li>
            <li>It has a delicate smell and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I just rec&#x27;d this product in the last few days and WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li>I mainly wanted to try this to help with the dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li>and it really does help the dark circles!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for reducing puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this eye cream for anyone with under eye dark circles and puffiness...</li>
            <li>I think the new cream is stronger, as it irritated my eyes just a bit after wearing (although that might be from the smell, not the active ingredient--hard to tell).  </li>

            <li> Love this eye cream...feels great, works great.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really really good</li>
            <li> I gave it a fair trial--no results, and allergy eyes.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizing cream around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I thank Loressen for making these wonderful products available at&lt;br /&gt;such affordable prices.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair for anyone to say they saw results in a week because that wasn&#x27;t my case or</li>
            <li> but this cream is good for the quality/price ratio.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> This is a truly good product.  </li>
            <li> It feels really good though and wakes your eyes up in the morning.</li>
            <li> Good Product</li>
            <li> It feel good when applying.</li>
            <li> good product for this price.</li>
            <li> , neither of us have had any good results, this just burns the area around your eyes but</li>
            <li> It was perfect before -- truly effective, inexpensive, and easy to wear.  </li>
            <li> The cream may be very good, but I have a strong allergy to something in the product.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased..</li>
            <li> I find it to be a refreshing product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying more!</li>
            <li> , my eyes have never felt better!  </li>
            <li> I love this eye cream!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fantastic and makes a visible difference!!</li>
            <li> Very rich and soothing!</li>
            <li> The attractive cost is a huge factor in my using it.</li>
            <li> I like the way this one feels when I put it on (absorbs without feeling greasy) and it makes my eyes feel nice in the morning</li>
            <li> It feels good going on and has a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> Has a nice tingly feel when applied.</li>
            <li> Seems to tighten the skin up nicely.</li>
            <li> Lots of hype, nice packaging, but doesn&#x27;t offer anything to make me buy it again.</li>
            <li> But still a nice product.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have a perfume type smell to it and it does go on nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking oily.</li>
            <li> , the company sent me a nice email thank me for the purchase and how to use it.</li>
            <li> As directed it&#x27;s just nice and &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Nice scent.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cream.</li>
            <li> because it will gradually absorb into my skin on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> was excited to use this product from reading all the great reviews</li>
            <li> The Loressen VitalEyes Eye Cream has given the best results at a far better cost!</li>
            <li> Not work the price and has a very very strong odor</li>
            <li> And, the best part is, it didn&#x27;t sting or hurt my usually sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hesitate paying hundreds for eye creams, I may have tried just about everything at Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom, this clearly is the best!  </li>
            <li> All in all this is a great eye cream and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am quite impressed so far.</li>
            <li> Too, the company has followed up with me and additionally offered a lovely discount on my new order.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> my eyes have faded tremendously and I can honestly say that it works good for me.</li>
            <li> good tingling - not bad tingling).  </li>
            <li> It has a very nice, light, clean scent.</li>
            <li> I have allergies to most of the eye products out there.</li>
            <li> The result is not permanent, but it works during sleep and will work better if you sleep longer.  </li>
            <li> I love to treat my skin, but have been struggling to find an eye cream that fits my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It moisturizers ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I love Loressen and will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m hopeful with more usage</li>
            <li> Every time I apply it on my eye area, it makes me feel good and smile.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been almost 2 weeks, in addition to healthy eating and drinking plenty of water</li>
            <li> my eyes look much better.</li>
            <li> I am still working on sleeping better.</li>
            <li> It was starting to get out of control, adding years to my appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this eye cream</li>
            <li> My puffiness is better and my wrinkles aren&#x27;t as pronounced.  </li>
            <li> and I think you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li> for sure it is better than before use</li>
            <li> I think that it works better on the puffiness then the darkness.</li>
            <li> hoping for more</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m off to another product in hopes I find something that works better.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked miracles...as soon as I am able I am going to get more</li>
            <li> I am so pleased that I ordered the Loressen Vitamin C serum as well and look forward to using it.</li>
            <li> I also use the Triple Vitamin C Serum and love the&lt;br /&gt;product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li> After experimenting with many eye creams -- the puffiness remain - after all at age 80 you don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this, but I really love their vitamic C serum, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Feels refreshing when applied.</li>
            <li> I am still in search of a better eye cream.</li>
            <li> and I look more rested.</li>
            <li> Also, I love the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I love the spicy scent of this cream as well.</li>
            <li> I would love to say what the others have said</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it worked for the others.</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> I do love this cream.  </li>
            <li> I love the texture and it has a very&lt;br /&gt;faint fragrance.  </li>
            <li> very moisterizing and feels great.  </li>
            <li> sure show it.</li>
            <li> but this felt nice and smooth on me.</li>
            <li> You could pay a lot more for creams that don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> My eyes feel better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this product to see if there are any results, but I have gotten better results from a serum use.</li>
            <li> On top of that, wearing glasses for over 25 years doesn&#x27;t help at all.  </li>
            <li> I love that it does not get in my eyes and sting.</li>
            <li> I will buy this product any try for 6 more months.</li>
            <li> I used it for years as did many friends and relatives.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a nice, moisturizing eye cream in addition to a powerful &amp;#34;bag fighter&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream before and thought it was great, but the new formulation is even better.  </li>
            <li> a lot, as I customarily do, and it stings pretty good.</li>
            <li> The misses loves these little items and they make great Happy Day presents.</li>
            <li> goes on nicely and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> The eye cream feels nice - light, smooth.</li>
            <li> The container is great you never loose a drop, very thoughtful.</li>
            <li> I am 41 yrs old , and have been getting puffiness under my eyes , but this cream works great</li>
            <li> I will say that when I apply it, it feels good on my skin and there is a gentle cooling/tingling sensation around my eyes (</li>
            <li> It feels good, but did absolutely nothing for the puffiness and circles on my eyes.</li>
            <li> The only thing I found great about the cream is that is very smooth on the skin it does not irritate or cause any dryness.</li>
            <li> I sent customer service a message and without questions asked I got a full refund so thank you!</li>
            <li> Applies easily, covers and blends in well and has soothing effect.</li>
            <li> I do wish it was in a pump bottle, but just have to make sure my hand&#x27;s are clean when using it so bacteria won&#x27;t be spread.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to say if I can see results yet, but so far so good:)</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> updated on 5/18/14 to indicate that product continues to help improve dark circles and customer services is excellent.</li>
            <li> I used to use Hydrolize for the dark circles and it worked wonderfully until they changed their formula.  </li>
            <li> I love how it feels cool when you put it on</li>
            <li> So far loving it!  </li>
            <li> I have used jojoba oil around my eyes for years and it works fine.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams in the past, and this product is the one that has worked the best for me.  </li>
            <li> Way more concentrated than any other brands I&#x27;ve tried, AND THAT&#x27;S A GOOD THING!</li>
            <li> It works well for decreasing puffiness and fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE what you do for my eyes, THANK YOU for creating a product that gives me the perfect hydration, helps eliminate my puffy and not so attractive dark circles that hide my green eyes that I love to show off.</li>
            <li> Customer service is very good, they follow up via email within a few days of your purchase, thanking you and inquiring on how well the product is working for you, plus additional tips on how to use the product more effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great product not only for women , but me too .</li>
            <li> I still have quite a bit, so hopefully it will become available again.</li>
            <li> The cream feels smooth and silky as it goes on the skin.</li>
            <li> I plan to continue to order this product since I have been getting such great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary</li>
            <li> It keeps my eyelids moist and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This product is fabulous in all aspects except for one.  </li>
            <li> , Works Great See changes next day....</li>
            <li> Excellent product -- may take a few days to notice results.  </li>
            <li> I am 29 years old and still have good skin if this helps anyone.</li>
            <li> So far so good with this cream it absorbs well and is non greasy.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!</li>
            <li> creams - and this one feels so fresh, clean &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that any product really has much of an effect on true undereye circles, but it feels great.</li>
            <li> Puffiness significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> Not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Saw a significant difference around my eyes</li>
            <li> so I use a lot more than is directed, with no ill effects.</li>
            <li> Very gentle, and very rich and luxurious.</li>
            <li> It is light, comfortable and readily absorbed.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream I have ever used, it goes on smooth and it really does help with dark circles and puffiness.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special about this eye cream.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I love its scent which is so fresh.</li>
            <li> but you can find lotion just as good at your local drug store.</li>
            <li> I have noticed the skin around my eyes looks better, and the circles much lighter</li>
            <li> I use it during the day, and use a more intense moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cream for almost a week, it absorbs into the eye area nicely, it doesn&#x27;t irritate or sting the skin- as my eye area is sensitive.</li>
            <li> This eye cream was a good moisturizer, but that was the only benefit.</li>
            <li> Wonderful sale prices lately too.</li>
            <li> If I want to wear a scent, I want to choose it myself, and be able to control how much and when I want to wear it.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be true to its claims.</li>
            <li> i am an asian guy, and this product works good on me.</li>
            <li> I love how the cream feels going on and it moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> Not my absolute favorite but a backup</li>
            <li> Need more time, but so far so good, think I look a little better around my eye area!</li>
            <li> It also dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t look greasy</li>
            <li> This eye cream is a super value considering the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 months now, and I have noticed a tremendous difference in the wrinkles under my eyes and the crow&#x27;s feet as well.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and does help with my puffiness.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference fairly quickly and look forward to the continued improvement.</li>
            <li> Pros: Moisturizing, absorbs quickly into the skin, doesn&#x27;t smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t fall asleep very easily, and I have to wake up early for school.</li>
            <li> The packaging is heavier and bigger than the old simplecontainer and the consistency has gone from being a nice cream that would absorb easily into your skin to a gel consistency that sits on top, sticky and shiny.</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old woman I&#x27;ve had dark circles under eyes since I was a kid, I&#x27;ve tried lots and this cream is the best!</li>
            <li> I used only for 5 days now and it is pretty good, do not expect miracles because creams do not bring miracles to your skin, aging is a physiological process and nothing can stop it, not even plastic surgery</li>
            <li> Feels &amp; smells great and quite is moisturizing, however, I bought it primarily for dark circles and really don&#x27;t see the results in that regard.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to order more products that Loressen offers!</li>
            <li> I would recommend highly!!!</li>
            <li> This jar of creme is much more effective than previous.   </li>
            <li> The results look a little but there isn&#x27;t a great difference</li>
            <li> This cream feels very good going on, no pulling on the delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I did not see a whole lot of improvement on the crows feet and lines around eyes, but it made the skin around eye area feel and look smooth.  </li>
            <li> So far, my eyes are more relaxed after using this cream.  </li>
            <li> At first my skin felt a mild burning sensation but that has stopped now.  </li>
            <li> Price was right on sale but it is not a morale cure for puffiness.</li>
            <li> Loressen VitalEyes Eye Cream was the best one because it actually removed the dark circles and puffiness</li>
            <li> Not only does it keep the eye area moisturized throughout the day, but it really does reduce the appearance of fine lines, puffiness and promotes a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> It took away some of the dark circles however not as good as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I think that if you are not sensitive to perfumes and chemical odors this would be a nice eye cream</li>
            <li> It works very well to maintain the skin of eye area very smooth and soft and help wrinkle away.</li>
            <li> But I love to use this under the concealer with a little primer, and it goes on really smooth!</li>
            <li> and I felt i looked &amp;#34;younger.&amp;#34; Incredible results, every eye cream i ever used dried up and irritated my sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> but if you are sensitive you might find the odor too strong.</li>
            <li> I do not usually leave detailed reviews.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle and can see result&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I used the first two containers without problems.  </li>
            <li> Just when I thought that I had finally found an eye cream that I wasn&#x27;t allergic to, the product was changed, and not for the better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle of this.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it (without concealer)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other creams, but this one is seriously worth it - even my mom says so!</li>
            <li> Will  be back for more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been interested in cosmetically correcting them</li>
            <li> The first ingredient I&#x27;d water.</li>
            <li> This moisturizes pretty well though.</li>
            <li> I used it exactly as directed.  </li>
            <li> It is very relaxing and you almost feel the change right after first couple days.</li>
            <li> This cream is fabulous im enjoying it everyday</li>
            <li> However, it does not do anything negative either, which is more than I can say for most eye creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not seen meaningful results or have had negative reactions to many of these products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does feel nice under my eyes but it did not help for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I previously used Obagi eye cream and found this to be as effective, at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with my purchase of this eye cream, if definitely firms, reduces puffiness and the apperance of dark circles.  </li>
            <li> circles.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent &amp; would be fine used only as a moisturizer but do NOT get it in hopes of clearing up dark circles.</li>
            <li> It is now soft and the fine lines appear to have become less prominent.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin healthy and dark circle free( nearly)</li>
            <li> I actually noticed fine lines forming around my eyes while I used this cream.  </li>
            <li> It has definitely reduced a lot of the fine lines around my eye and makes them look healthier.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed a definite improvement in the fine lines and firmness around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I see a huge difference in the dark circles, but that&#x27;s true of every product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I bought this before it was reformulated, but at the time it smelled too perfumey for me and didn&#x27;t help my eyes too much.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much change.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really really good&lt;</li>
            <li> Real this cream.</li>
            <li> i think product is designed for female skin, I used the product every night before going to sleep, and when i purchased the seller gave me a tip of lightly tapping it when applying it on my skin, followed the direction but meh</li>
            <li> Those pumps tend to squeeze out too much.</li>
            <li> I really try to like this cream</li>
            <li> Wanted to use this for awhile before I wrote a review and now that I have and really like it</li>
            <li> Some of the puffiness has diminished also, but not quite as much as I hoped.</li>
            <li> did I see unusual results?</li>
            <li> I really feel like I look 10 years &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> This eye cream really smells now - it is an overpowering floral scent.</li>
            <li> I had just finished the whole jar and did not see a difference.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li> I have used it morning and night for about two weeks now and have not noticed much of a difference yet.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have puffiness, but rather aging skin.  </li>
            <li> I am a light skinned Hispanic who suffered from eye bags since middle school.</li>
            <li> Thanks see Youu</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much results.</li>
            <li> Tried others but this one really works.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.</li>
            <li> and I feel like it&#x27;s really waking up my eyes.</li>
            <li> Another plus is it soaks in well after a few minutes and sits nicely under makeup without feeling all oily or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My products came so quick that I really don&#x27;t think that I took my fingers off the key boards...  </li>
            <li> It flows on easily and has a faint rose scent.  </li>
            <li> I have allergies and because of that have dark circles most of the time.  </li>
            <li> I would rate five star if it works better for the dark cycle.</li>
            <li> well time to hunt for a new one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be looking for a new product, similar to the original.</li>
            <li> I think they need a new name for this eye cream, it did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> ; Even the new jar is nasty--heavy and bulky and TOO MUCH.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m happy with the cream and would definitely recommend it to people to at least give it</li>
            <li> My main concern has always been under eye puffiness, and now I always look well rested.</li>
            <li> Just being realistic</li>
            <li> This is the type of product that I would give 10 stars to, because it is so efficacious AND such a tremendous value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent eye moisturizer though.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but I still wish they gave you a little more.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m confident with longer use that it will fade those little spots too.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This eye cream absorbs fast and leaves the skin under the eyes soft.</li>
            <li> I hit the gym early, work long days, enjoy spending evenings with my boyfriend and friends.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to be able to say if it will help with darkness under eyes</li>
            <li> So I was pleased to see after just a few days that I truly do see a difference.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve actually never written a review before on amazon, but this eye cream is truly worth the review.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different products some for far more money that didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> am on my second jar of eye cream and let me say first that it absolutely works just like it said it would.</li>
            <li> I do look a little younger now which is always nice.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this and did not spend the high price I have in the past.</li>
            <li> After only half of my first jar of VitalEyes, i saw such an amazing difference.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new eye cream and came across this whilst shopping on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d like to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> This is now my new go to eye cream.</li>
            <li> The dark circles and fine lines have diminished with every day use.</li>
            <li> It is easing fine lines around my eyes and my dark circles are diminishing.</li>
            <li> Very soft.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> My eyes are very sensitive and even the &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; stuff irritates me.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and rosacea, and this doesn&#x27;t cause any redness or dryness nor does it irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I am very much looking forward to some other products of Loressen which I would definitely love to purchase after using up my other brands.</li>
            <li> I could tell a huge difference in my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not overly sensitive to fragrance, but this made my eyes water!  </li>
            <li> old lady strength smell!</li>
            <li> Also, makes soft   !</li>
            <li> After going through the whole bottle (used twice daily, as directed) I&#x27;ve seen no noticeable reduction in the dark circles under my eyes, or even in the fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> With my first use, I was assaulted with the overpowering scent of fake rose perfume, which in my opinion, should never be an ingredient in eye cream, nor should any scent, for that matter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now greasy and heavy and has a strong fragrance of &amp;#34;roses&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I only bought this cream on Amazon because of the positive reviews so now I am going ot pay</li>
            <li> This product has worked fairly well on me, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and have noticed a slight difference.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first that a cream could actually do that, but this one, after using it for over a month, I can honestly say really works well for me.  </li>
            <li> This is a large container and it will last awhile.</li>
            <li> For me, that is a clear winner.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My life is busy and I don&#x27;t want my eyes to show it.  </li>
            <li> I know my eyes are sensitive, but others didn&#x27;t seem to have problems.</li>
            <li> My eyes turned red an puffy and they really burned</li>
            <li> It is far to greasy, even after waiting an hour after application</li>
            <li> I like that the ingredients seem to be all natural and that it hasn&#x27;t been tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> Between the eye drops my opthamologist ordered and Vital Eyes Cream</li>
            <li> So far, my eyes have maintained moisture since applying it.</li>
            <li> and this is gentle enough for me to use!</li>
            <li> I used Loressen Vital Eyes the night I received it</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old</li>
            <li> I found Vital Eyes&lt;</li>
            <li> Like I said so far no change</li>
            <li> I do advise people who are very allergic to move cautiously, however, as we are all affected differently by products.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I am always hesitant about trying eye products because mine are so sensitive.</li>
            <li> Both my eyes swelled, turned red and were very itchy.</li>
            <li> I am 26 yr old, just looking to prevent wrinkles and get rid of under eye circles.</li>
            <li> But, the smell is very persistent; it lasted for several hours and gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> My husband used this product and was pleasantly surprised with the results.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money, it does not work...</li>
            <li> Sometimes I just gave up, since they have been with me since I was a young girl.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised after a week of using it morning and night.  </li>
            <li> I am an African American female with light complexion skin.</li>
            <li> old tax accountant.</li>
            <li> I know if I keep using it like this they&#x27;ll be completely gone.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin feel nice and soft around the eyes, as it tends to get dry and a little red after showering.</li>
            <li> Vital Eyes worked as no other product had.  </li>
            <li> I have always purchased more expensive eye creams and to be true, none of them did much for my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> So many eye creams are too light, too heavy, and greasy, draws my eye makeup down under my eyes (come on, I don&#x27;t need help with dark circles), or an exorbitant amount for lackluster product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LORESSEN</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure it helps my case of dark circles, as my skin is super this and pretty much translucent under the eye, I end up having to use a concealer regardless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: As of 1/18/14, I have been using this product twice a day now for several weeks, and I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about it.  </li>
            <li> 34;lightening deal&amp;#34; &amp; had decent reviews and was really hopeful it could help with my dark circles...</li>
            <li> New formula is entirely different.</li>
            <li> I caved and went back to Estée Lauder, it costs more but at least it works.  </li>
            <li> The bags below my eyes are genetic (not due to lack of sleep or salt, etc).</li>
            <li> The other cream that claimed to be made from \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients was nice because it had a thick creamy texture, but the results did not compare.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product and will continue to use it, but at least initially, the first time you apply it, USE AS DIRECTED!</li>
            <li> It takes VERY little to make the skin around my eyes feel moisturized and also my eyes feel so cool after I use it.  </li>
            <li> Have not used it long enough yet to determine how much a difference it is making.  </li>
            <li> This was the third container of Vital Eyes that I have ordered .</li>
            <li> The third container arrived, a reformulated version of Vital Eyes.</li>
            <li> Completely over priced considering the total lack of results.</li>
            <li> Eye Cream that I have tries that really does work.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old and occasionally will use it too,</li>
            <li> I am only 24 years old</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 months now and my eye-lids barely sag over my eyes.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll notice a difference in puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the quantity in each jar -- there just isn&#x27;t very much in there and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Product works very well removing dark circles and general improvement to hide wrinkles in the eye</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman, 43 years old.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this cream for a few days, but already I am seeing a tightness in my under eyes that I have not seen on myself since elementary school.</li>
            <li> so I usually let it dry a little in the mornings then go about my normal routine appealing concealer, etc.  </li>
            <li> It really helped the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> It will take away your dark circles and really does make you look and feel refreshed.  </li>
            <li> The dark areas under my eyes have improved so so much and even some of the deeper wrinkles have drastically improved.</li>
            <li> Did not see much improvement for the dark circles after 3 months of using.</li>
            <li> It has really help with the dark circles under the eyes and the puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I generally apply eye cream only once per day</li>
            <li> I have not seen a significant change unfortunately and its very greesy</li>
            <li> My under eye circles are much lighter and the puffiness a lot less.</li>
            <li> It has a delicate smell and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I just rec&#x27;d this product in the last few days and WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li> I mainly wanted to try this to help with the dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> and it really does help the dark circles!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for reducing puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this eye cream for anyone with under eye dark circles and puffiness...</li>
            <li> I think the new cream is stronger, as it irritated my eyes just a bit after wearing (although that might be from the smell, not the active ingredient--hard to tell).  </li>
            <li> i have used it about a month and see a slight improvement with dark circles, will continue to use for a few more weeks...did not irritate my eye area at all...</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes that really come out when I am super tired and/or worn out.  </li>
            <li> I have severe allergies, which has caused my under eyes to be dark and loose since junior high.</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and have puffiness and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The dark circles I used to have under my eyes have COMPLETELY disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I used the cream for a few days and noticed a difference in the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes within the first 48 hours.</li>
            <li> In short, we will keep buying for &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34;, so Loressen would do well if they kept prices reasonable - because there&#x27;s not really much in one small container.  </li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;ve seen a little improvement in the puffiness.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how little product there was.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and have tried several different eye creams and serums.</li>
            <li> I could not use it long enough to see if it did anything for the puffiness, and nothing short of plastic surgery will do anything to eliminate my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for a few months now (at 50 years old)</li>
            <li> This wide mouth container means you get the last smidgen of cream!</li>
            <li> I have read from some reviewers that it has a strange smell.  </li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product I have far less noticeable dark circles even though I have on going insomnia.  </li>
            <li> I even tested it on my nose when I had a dry patch</li>
            <li> I just got this cream - ordered it because my eye lids and the skin around my eyes were so dry -</li>
            <li> But, this cream immediately helped my dry skin problem.</li>
            <li> I had a really dry patch on my bottom eyelid and after 3 days it disappeared.</li>
            <li> I usually work long hours, dark circles and puffy eyes are my main concern.</li>
            <li> I am a single working mom</li>
            <li> The small container goes a long way if you take a little dabble of the cream to gently rub around the eye area.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and so dark circles and puffiness are very noticeable on me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a big problem with dark circles, so that may not be as noticeable for me.  </li>
            <li> My eyes are already starting to see the Light-ness instead of the dark puffy circles I&#x27;ve been seeing...  </li>
            <li> This cream has definitely helped me get rid of the dark circles beneath my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s helping my dark circles, if so it will be the only product that ever has, even though others have claimed to.</li>
            <li> It has definitely helped with the dark circles.</li>
            <li> Please, bring back the other stuff!</li>
            <li> I am 29 yrs old with a little winkle and dark circle and eye purfe.</li>
            <li> The contours around my eyes are DRAMATICALLY improved; it took less than a week to notice a big difference.</li>
            <li> They doing go underneath my entire eye anymore, just a little in the corner</li>
            <li> This product was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I see no real difference with this product although I do like it as an undereye and eyelid moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The packaging really cheapens the appearance of the overall product and again the thin product can be too messy.</li>
            <li> The darkness is still there, but as I said, it&#x27;s only been a few days.</li>
            <li> I have only used product for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I was little skeptic of any creams for dark circles but this one actually works.</li>
            <li> Not sure abou them but my long term genetic dark circles/puffy eyes are seemingly unaffected.</li>
            <li> I persisted in using it, but gave up after about a month due to lack of results.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount under each eye</li>
            <li> Like every other product in this category, it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, because nothing else had not worked to hide my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> But other than that it does not help minimize the appearance of dark circles.</li>
            <li> It is not useful.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for dark circles.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because i was suffering from dark circles, based on the reviews i thought i should give as shot to this product.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment yet on lightening my dark circles.</li>
            <li> a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember that the outcome will depend on what is causing the dark circles.</li>
            <li> It did not reduce the dark circles under my eyes, and I have been using this product for about two months.</li>
            <li> For a moment I thought I had not washed my face yet, as the dark circles looked as though they still had concealer covering them.</li>
            <li> I do not see changes in wrinkles, or dark circles, or anything like that.</li>
            <li> My dark circles have lightened</li>
            <li> This product works well to reduce under eye puffiness as well as to reduce dark circles.</li>
            <li> in combatting my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I dont have dark circles</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I have dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;d because I have the hereditary dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on my dark circles or bags.</li>
            <li> but boy do i like to party and my perpetual dark circles on my eyes</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t even lighten the lighter dark spots.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference at all with my dark circles..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dark circles</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in dark circles.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles started to fade.  </li>
            <li> : stings my eyes for a minute after applying, no difference in dark circles after 2 weeks, so probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with dark circles</li>
            <li> I used it faithfully both morning &amp; night for almost 3weeks with no improvement in my dark</li>
            <li> My dark circles are still there, but they are less dark.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say they completely dissapeared, and I know they won&#x27;t, but my eyes look less tired.  </li>
            <li> I have always relied on reviews whenever I make a purchase and once again the reviews did not let me down.  </li>
            <li> I previously had dark circles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Initially it seemed like the amount of cream was very small for the cost, but you really only need to use a very small amount of product each time so this does not seem to be the case.</li>
            <li> The jar is small but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Within 24 hours of using it, I noticed less puffiness.</li>
            <li> I have notice a slight changed in the darkness of circles around my eyes but the puffiness is still there.</li>
            <li> Much less so than without,</li>
            <li> I feel a slight tingle around my eyes after I put it on</li>
            <li> My black eye circle gone after one month.</li>
            <li> I noticed no difference in the slight darkness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> NOTICED A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE.</li>
            <li> Heavy use of computers, had dark circles and swelling around my eyes like the bags.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick and feels very strange.</li>
            <li> Typically, I&#x27;ll use a product up just to reduce waste, but this one&#x27;s going in the trash.  </li>
            <li> Just moisterized a little.</li>
            <li> I decided to change it up a little</li>
            <li> The dark circles are fading!</li>
            <li> I wish I had though, because I am struggling to get rid of my dark circles!</li>
            <li> It does seem to help with dark circles!</li>
            <li> I saw a lightning of the dark coloring in under a week of using it!</li>
            <li> A little Bobbi Brown concealer in the corner by the bridge of my nose</li>
            <li> A little dab</li>
            <li> but it does see to lessen the puff a little.</li>
            <li> This cream did not work at all for dark circles!</li>
            <li> Have very dark circles don&#x27;t know if this cream will work.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I tried it, it works to keep the eye area firm.</li>
            <li> waste of $$$</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time or money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a total game changer.  </li>
            <li> Pump bottles also waste cream.  </li>
            <li> Reduced dark circles under my eyes and small line diminished .</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time investment that it would work.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the jar is very small.  </li>
            <li> If you have dark circles ayes !!</li>
            <li> Years of working night shift as a nurse, poor sleep habits, allergies and poor diet has left me with dark circles, swollen and puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> BUT THERE IS VERY LITTLE PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY,</li>
            <li> I usually get.</li>
            <li> i prefer this eye cream than any of the twenty i have bought in past couple years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if it is changing the color or puffy appearance.  </li>
            <li> I was searching for a cream to help with my dark circles (hard to find) and this seemed to do the trick!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know they it contains, but it must be very harsh.</li>
            <li> I put it on before bed the other night, and was annoyed by the scent as I fell asleep.</li>
            <li> I feel this product is not very good at all-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s delicate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving Lorressen two stars because at least they&#x27;re cruelty-free and don&#x27;t test on animals, but this VitalEyes cream didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li> that is less dramatic for me.</li>
            <li> So I started out slow by using this one night</li>
            <li> Tap slowly when you apply the cream to activate&lt;br /&gt;the blood flow</li>
            <li> It does not smell unpleasant, it does not dry your skin out, and it does not hurt or water your eyes.</li>
            <li> Look for lemons on sale they do just as well if not better!</li>
            <li> think the product is slight too thin and the packaging (thin plastic case) should be upgraded.  </li>
            <li> But it does nothing for my dark circles sadly.</li>
            <li> Seriously, why do that?</li>
            <li> It was slightly tingly upon application, nothing uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical, but after reading the reviews felt I should try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that is not good for moisturizing creams.</li>
            <li> No better than any random cream off the grocery store shelf.</li>
            <li> I have dumb inherited puffy eyes</li>
            <li> Very disappointing I have been using this product constantly every day twice a day</li>
            <li> it is very delicate skin under your eyes.</li>
            <li> During the afternoon when eyes get tired again, the effect wears off a bit.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I literally discovered a beauty secret.</li>
            <li> I tried this eye-cream on impulse, when i got tired of seeing my eyes looking so tired and puffy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Loressen is a game changer for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to look tired all the time.</li>
            <li> They started once I had my children and have gradually got worse over the years (I&#x27;m 46 now).  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing concealer under my eyes since the age of 11, and even with it, people would comment that I looked tired.</li>
            <li> My dark circles were bad so it too longer than I was expecting</li>
            <li> The area around my eyes used to be tight and I was afraid of smiling because it felt uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, I can&#x27;t use or recommend.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to say that this cream didn&#x27;t do anything for the puffiness/bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> And you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.</li>
            <li> if I like it or hate it or if they are about to waste their money</li>
            <li> and as I age I have found it difficult to find a product&lt;</li>
            <li> The reformulation takes this product in the wrong direction.</li>
            <li> For my age I have horrible puffiness under eyes and dark circles and after the glowing reviews I decided to give it a go&lt;</li>
            <li> the product smells like the cold cream my mother used fifty years ago.  </li>
            <li> But what stinks is if you don&#x27;t use it one time they return.</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> I did not notice any changes :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed that this has not diminished the puffiness under my eyes.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is not useful. Since I have used it for two months, my problem doesn&#x27;t improve.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for dark circles. Just moisterized a little.</li>
            <li> Not a product for me.  I have sensitive skin.  I would return, it but it&#x27;s a lot of hassle.  I don&#x27;t find the smell pleasing and it burns my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have not seen a significant change unfortunately and its very greesy</li>
            <li> I bought this before it was reformulated, but at the time it smelled too perfumey for me and didn&#x27;t help my eyes too much.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t packaged as shown wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any improvement</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price!</li>
            <li> I started using this product just a week ago so I haven&#x27;t seen drastic differences yet but we&#x27;ll see.  I will say that when I apply it, it feels good on my skin and there is a gentle cooling/tingling sensation around my eyes (good tingling - not bad tingling).  It also dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t look greasy so I usually let it dry a little in the mornings then go about my normal routine appealing concealer, etc.  I find it to be a refreshing product!</li>
            <li> Applies easily, covers and blends in well and has soothing effect. Some brightness under eye&lt;br /&gt;has appeared after two weeks daily use.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any changes :(</li>
            <li> I have allergies to most of the eye products out there. I have been using this for about a week and can see the difference already. My under eye circles are much lighter and the puffiness a lot less. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My wife and I tried it, it works to keep the eye area firm. The result is not permanent, but it works during sleep and will work better if you sleep longer.  During the afternoon when eyes get tired again, the effect wears off a bit.  So, you need to keep on using this.  In short, we will keep buying for &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34;, so Loressen would do well if they kept prices reasonable - because there&#x27;s not really much in one small container.  When they jack it up to $25.95, price was a bit steep.  Keep it at a lower price, and you&#x27;d be seeing us buying 12 - 15 of this per year.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing I have been using this product constantly every day twice a day and I have not seen any results .I was excited to use this product from reading all the great reviews but It did not do anything for me. The only thing I found great about the cream is that is very smooth on the skin it does not irritate or cause any dryness. But other than that it does not help minimize the appearance of dark circles. I would not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I have used jojoba oil around my eyes for years and it works fine.  I decided to change it up a little so I bought this cream.  I used it for a while but went back to jojoba oil.  I didn&#x27;t see much change.  I actually noticed fine lines forming around my eyes while I used this cream.  Jojoba oil does the job for now!</li>
            <li> I hit the gym early, work long days, enjoy spending evenings with my boyfriend and friends. My life is busy and I don&#x27;t want my eyes to show it.  I love to treat my skin, but have been struggling to find an eye cream that fits my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No need to look any further!  So many eye creams are too light, too heavy, and greasy, draws my eye makeup down under my eyes (come on, I don&#x27;t need help with dark circles), or an exorbitant amount for lackluster product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LORESSEN VitalEyes Eye Cream . . . I LOVE what you do for my eyes, THANK YOU for creating a product that gives me the perfect hydration, helps eliminate my puffy and not so attractive dark circles that hide my green eyes that I love to show off. And to the Guys, just an FYI my boyfriend has started using VitalEyes too after watching my results. We are both hooked! Can&#x27;t wait to order more products that Loressen offers!</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and I already feel and see the difference. The area around my eyes used to be tight and I was afraid of smiling because it felt uncomfortable. It is now soft and the fine lines appear to have become less prominent. Customer service is also excellent!</li>
            <li> Omg omg it&#x27;s the best cream ever 100 % recommend this product it&#x27;s really really good&lt;br /&gt;Omg omg it&#x27;s the best cream ever 100 % recommend this product it&#x27;s really really good</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and have tried several different eye creams and serums. The Loressen VitalEyes Eye Cream has given the best results at a far better cost! I highly recommend this product for reducing puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed that this has not diminished the puffiness under my eyes.  I have used it as directed for over a month and see no improvement.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning before putting on makeup and evening before going to bed. It has made my skin feel nice and soft around the eyes, as it tends to get dry and a little red after showering. Another plus is it soaks in well after a few minutes and sits nicely under makeup without feeling all oily or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure it helps my case of dark circles, as my skin is super this and pretty much translucent under the eye, I end up having to use a concealer regardless. But I love to use this under the concealer with a little primer, and it goes on really smooth!</li>
            <li> I was little skeptic of any creams for dark circles but this one actually works. I applied for a month and noticed visible differences. Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I DO LIKE THIS BUT THERE IS VERY LITTLE PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY, SO I DO NOT THINK I WILL BUY IT AGAIN</li>
            <li> It really helped the dark circles.  I used it both morning and night and could see an improvement in just one week.</li>
            <li> goes on nicely and absorbs quickly.  I have not used it long enough to be able to say if it will help with darkness under eyes</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet.  Will continue to use.  Very soft.  Have very dark circles don&#x27;t know if this cream will work.  Hope so.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the great reviews but I haven&#x27;t seen any results. Maybe I will see them soon.</li>
            <li> This is a great product not only for women , but me too . I am 41 yrs old , and have been getting puffiness under my eyes , but this cream works great , I keep it in the icebox , and use it as directed . I will continue to use this product , it doesnt leave that oily greasy feeling either</li>
            <li> This was the third container of Vital Eyes that I have ordered . I used the first two containers without problems.  I am 72 years old and have puffiness and dark circles under my eyes. I don&#x27;t expect a product to perform miracles. I just want a moisturizer to which I am not allergic. The third container arrived, a reformulated version of Vital Eyes. With my first use, I was assaulted with the overpowering scent of fake rose perfume, which in my opinion, should never be an ingredient in eye cream, nor should any scent, for that matter. The consistency is thick and feels very strange. And my eyes started to itch shortly after I applied it. This product was a huge disappointment. Just when I thought that I had finally found an eye cream that I wasn&#x27;t allergic to, the product was changed, and not for the better. I could not use it long enough to see if it did anything for the puffiness, and nothing short of plastic surgery will do anything to eliminate my dark circles.</li>
            <li> It moisturizers ok. Real this cream. It&#x27;s ok but you can find lotion just as good at your local drug store.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and so dark circles and puffiness are very noticeable on me. I searched online for \\&quot;the best\\&quot; eye creams that could help me with my eye area problems.  I found the reviews on two creams via Amazon and bought both.  Loressen VitalEyes Eye Cream was the best one because it actually removed the dark circles and puffiness I woke up with every day.  The other cream that claimed to be made from \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients was nice because it had a thick creamy texture, but the results did not compare.  I love Loressen and will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because i was suffering from dark circles, based on the reviews i thought i should give as shot to this product. it smells great used it but i didnt see results on my skin. i am not upset and i dont want readers to judge this product based on my review all i want to say if you are a male it might not work for you. i think product is designed for female skin, I used the product every night before going to sleep, and when i purchased the seller gave me a tip of lightly tapping it when applying it on my skin, followed the direction but meh no results. oh well time to hunt for a new one!</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t been so eager to order this product based on the reviews. I know my eyes are sensitive, but others didn&#x27;t seem to have problems. I gave it a fair trial--no results, and allergy eyes. Sorry to say, I can&#x27;t use or recommend.</li>
            <li> It feels good, but did absolutely nothing for the puffiness and circles on my eyes. Hope it works for others.</li>
            <li> Believe me, I have tried every eye cream known to woman, and this is awesome.  My husband &amp;#34;accidentally&amp;#34; ordered it out of our wish list and I love it.  I use it with my&lt;br /&gt;Clarisonic Opal and it really does help the dark circles!  I&#x27;m buying more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not overly sensitive to fragrance, but this made my eyes water!  I persisted in using it, but gave up after about a month due to lack of results.  Typically, I&#x27;ll use a product up just to reduce waste, but this one&#x27;s going in the trash.  I even tested it on my nose when I had a dry patch and there was zero softening or hydration of the skin there, too.</li>
            <li> For my age I have horrible puffiness under eyes and dark circles and after the glowing reviews I decided to give it a go&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t for me .. My eyes turned red an puffy and they really burned I assumed I&#x27;m allergic to whatever is I. It. I sent customer service a message and without questions asked I got a full refund so thank you!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother. Completely over priced considering the total lack of results. Doesn&#x27;t even give momentary improvement in your eye area. SKIP THIS ONE.</li>
            <li> After using this product as directed for almost three weeks there is no  noticeable difference.  the product smells like the cold cream my mother used fifty years ago.  I would not recommend spending the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle of this. I can&#x27;t say that I see a huge difference in the dark circles, but that&#x27;s true of every product I&#x27;ve tried. I like the way this one feels when I put it on (absorbs without feeling greasy) and it makes my eyes feel nice in the morning (I use it at night). It has a very nice smell to it. Not the miracle cream I was hoping for, but I like it.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression you could use this cream in the morning before putting on makeup...It is far to greasy, even after waiting an hour after application</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s wishful thinking or my imagination, but I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for a week and I think its helping.</li>
            <li> I just got this cream - ordered it because my eye lids and the skin around my eyes were so dry - so I can&#x27;t comment yet on lightening my dark circles. But, this cream immediately helped my dry skin problem. And, the best part is, it didn&#x27;t sting or hurt my usually sensitive skin. I also liked that the vendor sent two emails with information about how to use the cream!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using VitalEyes Cream for about a week now.  It takes VERY little to make the skin around my eyes feel moisturized and also my eyes feel so cool after I use it.  I like that the ingredients seem to be all natural and that it hasn&#x27;t been tested on animals.  I&#x27;ve shied away from some eye creams do to the content.  So far, my eyes are more relaxed after using this cream.  I have allergies and because of that have dark circles most of the time.  Between the eye drops my opthamologist ordered and Vital Eyes Cream, my eyes have never felt better!  I have noticed the skin around my eyes looks better, and the circles much lighter so I&#x27;m happy with the cream and would definitely recommend it to people to at least give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember that the outcome will depend on what is causing the dark circles.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is very nice and it seems to help.  Have not used it long enough yet to determine how much a difference it is making.  Will continue and hope for great results!</li>
            <li> I like this cream a lot. It feels good going on and has a lovely scent. I use it during the day, and use a more intense moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple weeks now. The dark circles are fading! There is still puffiness around my eyes but I&#x27;m hopeful with more usage my eyes will keep looking better!!</li>
            <li> I wanted  to wait over a couple of weeks to write review. It doesn&#x27;t do anything its listed to do.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product with some of the ingredients that are in the VitalEyes Cream. I&#x27;ve been using the cream for almost a week, it absorbs into the eye area nicely, it doesn&#x27;t irritate or sting the skin- as my eye area is sensitive. I&#x27;ll be using it in my daily skin regimen. It&#x27;s too soon to say if I can see results yet, but so far so good:)</li>
            <li> I used this product diligently and applied it under my eyes every night until the contents were finished - unfortunately, I just didn&#x27;t achieve the same results as most of the reviewers. I wish I had though, because I am struggling to get rid of my dark circles!</li>
            <li> First of all, I love its scent which is so fresh. Every time I apply it on my eye area, it makes me feel good and smile. It works very well to maintain the skin of eye area very smooth and soft and help wrinkle away. I am very much looking forward to some other products of Loressen which I would definitely love to purchase after using up my other brands.</li>
            <li> I like that the eye cream is in a jar instead of a pump. Those pumps tend to squeeze out too much. This eye cream was a good moisturizer, but that was the only benefit. It did not reduce the dark circles under my eyes, and I have been using this product for about two months. Not visible difference. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This cream is fabulous im enjoying it everyday&lt;br /&gt;I can tell the difference since I have start using it&lt;br /&gt;I will have to tell my friends about this product.</li>
            <li> I really try to like this cream but it just did not work with me. It does feel nice under my eyes but it did not help for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hesitate paying hundreds for eye creams, I may have tried just about everything at Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom, this clearly is the best!  My eyes looked brighter , younger immediately. Puffiness significantly reduced. Very impressive product. I feel like I literally discovered a beauty secret.</li>
            <li> I am a 34 y/o African American woman. Years of working night shift as a nurse, poor sleep habits, allergies and poor diet has left me with dark circles, swollen and puffy eyes. Within 24 hours of using it, I noticed less puffiness. It is gentle on my sensitive skin. Customer service is very good, they follow up via email within a few days of your purchase, thanking you and inquiring on how well the product is working for you, plus additional tips on how to use the product more effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been almost 2 weeks, in addition to healthy eating and drinking plenty of water my eyes look much better. I am still working on sleeping better.</li>
            <li> Wanted to use this for awhile before I wrote a review and now that I have and really like it, I see it&#x27;s out of stock!! I still have quite a bit, so hopefully it will become available again. I do wish it was in a pump bottle, but just have to make sure my hand&#x27;s are clean when using it so bacteria won&#x27;t be spread. Very gentle and can see result&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new eye cream and came across this whilst shopping on Amazon. The price drew me in and decided to give it a try. The first time I tried it (without concealer) I could tell a huge difference in my dark circles. I was searching for a cream to help with my dark circles (hard to find) and this seemed to do the trick! It also helped to hydrate my under eye area. I continue to use this with great results! I also have been trying to suggested method of tapping or patting the cream to help circulation and it helps. Thank you for a wonderful product !!!!</li>
            <li> Great service. Great Product. Has a nice tingly feel when applied. Seems to tighten the skin up nicely. Not disappointed.</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t work for my skin, but it worked nicely as an overall moisturizer.  This product did not affect my contact lens nor did it cause any extra eye production or stinging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this eye cream. Best to use morning and night. Wonderful sale prices lately too. I previously used Obagi eye cream and found this to be as effective, at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman, 43 years old.  This product did not work that well for me.  I have notice a slight changed in the darkness of circles around my eyes but the puffiness is still there.</li>
            <li> I am 29 yrs old with a little winkle and dark circle and eye purfe. This doesn&#x27;t work on me...no improvement.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes that really come out when I am super tired and/or worn out.  I started looking for solutions and came across this product.  I have orderd it several times since and I am very happy with it.  It will take away your dark circles and really does make you look and feel refreshed.  My only complaint is that the jar is very small.  You only need a small amount under each eye but I still wish they gave you a little more.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only eye cream I&#x27;ve ever tried that doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes when I get it in them. Very gentle, and very rich and luxurious. I recommend this eye cream.</li>
            <li> This cream feels very good going on, no pulling on the delicate skin. I noticed a difference after only 3 days, it was evening and I had washed off my makeup. Later I happened to look in the mirror - For a moment I thought I had not washed my face yet, as the dark circles looked as though they still had concealer covering them. This effect has increased, the darkness isn&#x27;t gone entirely but it has diminished. Also, if I put the cream on before I go to sleep I don&#x27;t have the under eye puffiness I usually get. It was starting to get out of control, adding years to my appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this eye cream and I plan to keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I tried this eye-cream on impulse, when i got tired of seeing my eyes looking so tired and puffy.  So I was pleased to see after just a few days that I truly do see a difference.  I feel a tingling sensation upon application but it isn&#x27;t uncomfortable.  My puffiness is better and my wrinkles aren&#x27;t as pronounced.  I don&#x27;t have a big problem with dark circles, so that may not be as noticeable for me.  Try it and I think you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is a super value considering the results. I was a little skeptical, but after reading the reviews felt I should try it. If you follow the 2x&#x27;s a day instructions faithfully you will get results. My dark circles were bad so it too longer than I was expecting but it works!! So glad I bought this and did not spend the high price I have in the past.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me -- can&#x27;t see any difference.  No better than any random cream off the grocery store shelf.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time to purchase this item.  I believe it has helped improve the darkness under my eyes....for sure it is better than before use</li>
            <li> The cream feels smooth and silky as it goes on the skin. It&#x27;s delicate. The small container goes a long way if you take a little dabble of the cream to gently rub around the eye area. So far, my eyes have maintained moisture since applying it. After a few weeks, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll notice a difference in puffiness and dark circles. I do look a little younger now which is always nice.</li>
            <li> I do not see changes in wrinkles, or dark circles, or anything like that. However, it does not do anything negative either, which is more than I can say for most eye creams I have tried. It does not smell unpleasant, it does not dry your skin out, and it does not hurt or water your eyes. For me, that is a clear winner.</li>
            <li> This eye cream absorbs fast and leaves the skin under the eyes soft. The dark circles and fine lines have diminished with every day use. Some of the puffiness has diminished also, but not quite as much as I hoped. All in all this is a great eye cream and worth the money. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> O.K.  This is truly an AWESOME product!!!  I just rec&#x27;d this product in the last few days and WOW!!!!  My eyes are already starting to see the Light-ness instead of the dark puffy circles I&#x27;ve been seeing...  This is truly a MOST!!!  My products came so quick that I really don&#x27;t think that I took my fingers off the key boards...  Great product and wonderful customer service!!!</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream! It makes eye skin smoother and moisturising. I have used two bottles of cream and I&#x27;d like to buy a new one. I would rate five star if it works better for the dark cycle.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve actually never written a review before on amazon, but this eye cream is truly worth the review. After only half of my first jar of VitalEyes, i saw such an amazing difference. The dark areas under my eyes have improved so so much and even some of the deeper wrinkles have drastically improved. Even my mom asked me what I was using, and she immediately bought it and has had the same results as me. I&#x27;ve tried many other creams, but this one is seriously worth it - even my mom says so! Buy it! You WILL be happy!</li>
            <li> the reviews made me optimistic...i have used it about a month and see a slight improvement with dark circles, will continue to use for a few more weeks...did not irritate my eye area at all...updated on 5/18/14 to indicate that product continues to help improve dark circles and customer services is excellent.</li>
            <li> Cream doesn&#x27;t do anything for my puffy eyes which is the reason I bought it.  Disappointed.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say that this cream didn&#x27;t do anything for the puffiness/bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Need more time, but so far so good, think I look a little better around my eye area!</li>
            <li> I give 2 star because the item was delivered on time. However my husband used it for just 2 days and he has a severe eye irritation that he had to see a doctor. I don&#x27;t know they it contains, but it must be very harsh.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! It works it&#x27;s been four days and can already see a difference. My dark circles have lightened</li>
            <li> I tried this product. Use it twice a day. I see no difference. Why do if fall for these online hypes?</li>
            <li> Been using this cream according to the directions since it arrived - not making any changes that I have noticed. Perhaps it take months instead of day or weeks. But it has done nothing for the puffiness and the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I like the eye cream but have not used it enough to rate it  5 stars. It does seem to help with dark circles!</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t stand the smell so I don&#x27;t know if this works or not. old lady strength smell! waste of $$$</li>
            <li> This product works well to reduce under eye puffiness as well as to reduce dark circles. I think that it works better on the puffiness then the darkness. Initially it seemed like the amount of cream was very small for the cost, but you really only need to use a very small amount of product each time so this does not seem to be the case. I feel that it is a great value.</li>
            <li> The results look a little but there isn&#x27;t a great difference</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product I have far less noticeable dark circles even though I have on going insomnia.  I would highly recommend this product.  I have tried several different products some for far more money that didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Best Cream I ever used....just like the reviews said....Thank You!  Will  be back for more.</li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;ve seen a little improvement in the puffiness.  hoping for more</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream...feels great, works great. And you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizing cream around the eyes. Did not see much improvement for the dark circles after 3 months of using.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes and this is gentle enough for me to use!</li>
            <li> I think they need a new name for this eye cream, it did absolutely nothing.  I caved and went back to Estée Lauder, it costs more but at least it works.  Honestly, if you&#x27;re going to buy this, save yourself the disappointment and send me your money.</li>
            <li> It took away some of the dark circles however not as good as I thought it would be. So I&#x27;m off to another product in hopes I find something that works better.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work as intended/advertised. After going through the whole bottle (used twice daily, as directed) I&#x27;ve seen no noticeable reduction in the dark circles under my eyes, or even in the fine wrinkles. I&#x27;m giving Lorressen two stars because at least they&#x27;re cruelty-free and don&#x27;t test on animals, but this VitalEyes cream didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams in the past, and this product is the one that has worked the best for me.  I have been using this for about 3 months now, and I have noticed a tremendous difference in the wrinkles under my eyes and the crow&#x27;s feet as well.  The dark circles I used to have under my eyes have COMPLETELY disappeared.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this eye cream.  Lots of hype, nice packaging, but doesn&#x27;t offer anything to make me buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked miracles...as soon as I am able I am going to get more</li>
            <li> I feel this product is not very good at all- I have been using it night &amp; morning &amp; no results- don&#x27;t waste your time or money</li>
            <li> I do not usually leave detailed reviews.  I will let people know if I like it or hate it or if they are about to waste their money but today is different.  I have tried various cremes, lotions and potions over the years to lighten under eye circles but I have finally found a winner. I used Loressen Vital Eyes the night I received it and I swear there was a difference the next morning.  I thought there was no way this is just wishful thinking but I have not used concealer since that day.  I would recommend this and hope it works for you.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how little product there was. Used the entire container - did I see unusual results? Probably not. But still a nice product.</li>
            <li> In my sixth decade of life, eye cream is a non negotiable part of my daily and nightly routine. Over the years, I have tried a plethora of products ranging from the most expensive to inexpensive drugstore brands. I&#x27;ve not seen meaningful results or have had negative reactions to many of these products.&lt;br /&gt;Loressen is a game changer for me. Not only does it keep the eye area moisturized throughout the day, but it really does reduce the appearance of fine lines, puffiness and promotes a healthy glow. I am so pleased that I ordered the Loressen Vitamin C serum as well and look forward to using it. Too, the company has followed up with me and additionally offered a lovely discount on my new order.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream I have ever used, it goes on smooth and it really does help with dark circles and puffiness.  This is now my new go to eye cream. I can&#x27;t believe how well this product works. My main concern has always been under eye puffiness, and now I always look well rested. I have always relied on reviews whenever I make a purchase and once again the reviews did not let me down.  I would highly recommend this eye cream for anyone with under eye dark circles and puffiness...Great Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: As of 1/18/14, I have been using this product twice a day now for several weeks, and I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about it.  People have been asking me if I had cosmetic surgery that&#x27;s how great this product works. The jar is small but a little goes a long way.  I plan to continue to order this product since I have been getting such great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Ann Sperka</li>
            <li> I have been using your eye cream for several months now and find it very&lt;br /&gt;effective in combatting my dark circles. I am 56 years old I was born with&lt;br /&gt;this condition and as I age I have found it difficult to find a product&lt;br /&gt;that was truly helpful. The price point is also perfect. I found Vital Eyes&lt;br /&gt;perfect for my regime. I also use the Triple Vitamin C Serum and love the&lt;br /&gt;product.  I thank Loressen for making these wonderful products available at&lt;br /&gt;such affordable prices. I will continue to use their  products and&lt;br /&gt;encourage an one on the fence to give them a try. I am a repeat customer&lt;br /&gt;because the results promised have been achieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah  from Connecticut</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a week now and have not seen a change. I like that is doesn&#x27;t have a perfume type smell to it and it does go on nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking oily. I mainly wanted to try this to help with the dark circles under my eyes I don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles yet. Like I said so far no change maybe it will just take some time but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair for anyone to say they saw results in a week because that wasn&#x27;t my case or do I think anyone else say results in a week. I am 29 years old and still have good skin if this helps anyone. Just being realistic</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old woman I&#x27;ve had dark circles under eyes since I was a kid, I&#x27;ve tried lots and this cream is the best! I saw a lightning of the dark coloring in under a week of using it! It is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Very rich and soothing! I had a really dry patch on my bottom eyelid and after 3 days it disappeared.</li>
            <li> I use this product together with another eye cream to achieve maximum satisfaction. After experimenting with many eye creams -- the puffiness remain - after all at age 80 you don&#x27;t expect miracles. The attractive cost is a huge factor in my using it.</li>
            <li> Price was right on sale but it is not a morale cure for puffiness.</li>
            <li> This product works so well. Saw a significant difference around my eyes</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream. It has really help with the dark circles under the eyes and the puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended to friends.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the company sent me a nice email thank me for the purchase and how to use it. That was definitely a first.&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
            <li> The cream didnt work for me, but the customer service was out of this world.  They were awesome.  I would still recommend this because it works for lots of people, i just wasnt one of them.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice eye cream for moisturizing.  Feels &amp; smells great and quite is moisturizing, however, I bought it primarily for dark circles and really don&#x27;t see the results in that regard.  I used to use Hydrolize for the dark circles and it worked wonderfully until they changed their formula.  I see no real difference with this product although I do like it as an undereye and eyelid moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used several eye creams.  My eyes are very sensitive and even the &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; stuff irritates me.  I have actually gone to the dr. 2x for treatments because of infections of &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; stuff.  I was hesitant to try this, but I really love their vitamic C serum, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It is great.  It has definitely reduced a lot of the fine lines around my eye and makes them look healthier.  My dark circles are still there, but they are less dark.</li>
            <li> i prefer this eye cream than any of the twenty i have bought in past couple years.  I dont have dark circles so i cannot comment on if it delt with darkness around eye or deapset wrinkles. However, this cream brightens around eye area! Also, makes soft   !Personally would recommend !</li>
            <li> This cream has definitely helped me get rid of the dark circles beneath my eyes.  I was skeptical at first that a cream could actually do that, but this one, after using it for over a month, I can honestly say really works well for me.  Actually I&#x27;ve been known to use it all over my face from time to time, since it smooths the skin so well and softens my facial lines.</li>
            <li> Save your money this stuff does nothing except make me break out</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I can&#x27;t say that any product really has much of an effect on true undereye circles, but it feels great.</li>
            <li> I used only for 5 days now and it is pretty good, do not expect miracles because creams do not bring miracles to your skin, aging is a physiological process and nothing can stop it, not even plastic surgery but this cream is good for the quality/price ratio.</li>
            <li> The bags below my eyes are genetic (not due to lack of sleep or salt, etc). I had read that the only way to improve them was by going to a dermatologist for injections to dissolve the fat deposits or to a Dr. to remove them surgically. Well....whoever wrote that never tried VitalEyes Eye Cream. My gosh. The contours around my eyes are DRAMATICALLY improved; it took less than a week to notice a big difference. I only wish I had before and after photos to show you. This is the type of product that I would give 10 stars to, because it is so efficacious AND such a tremendous value. I have very sensitive skin and rosacea, and this doesn&#x27;t cause any redness or dryness nor does it irritate my eyes.  It&#x27;s actually a nice, moisturizing eye cream in addition to a powerful &amp;#34;bag fighter&amp;#34;!  I think it has reduced some of the darkness by my eyes but that is less dramatic for me. A little Bobbi Brown concealer in the corner by the bridge of my nose and I&#x27;m good to go. I really feel like I look 10 years &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34;.  Thank you to the Amazon reviewers who led me to this product. It&#x27;s a total game changer.  UPDATE:  I can&#x27;t even believe they changed this product. It was perfect before -- truly effective, inexpensive, and easy to wear.  The reformulation takes this product in the wrong direction. This eye cream really smells now - it is an overpowering floral scent. I put it on before bed the other night, and was annoyed by the scent as I fell asleep. My husband calls me &amp;#34;grandma&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m wearing it, as it smells like something your grandma might wear.  Seriously, why do that? If I want to wear a scent, I want to choose it myself, and be able to control how much and when I want to wear it.  I think the new cream is stronger, as it irritated my eyes just a bit after wearing (although that might be from the smell, not the active ingredient--hard to tell).  Please ditch the floral smell. It&#x27;s a deal breaker.  The packaging is heavier and bigger than the old simplecontainer and the consistency has gone from being a nice cream that would absorb easily into your skin to a gel consistency that sits on top, sticky and shiny. And of course they increased the price.</li>
            <li> I generally apply eye cream only once per day so I use a lot more than is directed, with no ill effects. I really like this product and will continue to use it, but at least initially, the first time you apply it, USE AS DIRECTED! I applied.. a lot, as I customarily do, and it stings pretty good. As directed it&#x27;s just nice and &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34;. Way more concentrated than any other brands I&#x27;ve tried, AND THAT&#x27;S A GOOD THING! Does what it says it does too! Very nice product!</li>
            <li> This product has worked fairly well on me, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and have noticed a slight difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for a few months now (at 50 years old) and I love it. Goes on smoothe soaks into pores and never greasy. The container is great you never loose a drop, very thoughtful. A little dab and you have youthful eyes.</li>
            <li> I used the cream for a few days and noticed a difference in the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes within the first 48 hours. Seems to be true to its claims.</li>
            <li> Been using for several weeks with no results. Feels refreshing when applied.I will continue to use and hope for results.</li>
            <li> Not work the price and has a very very strong odor</li>
            <li> This is a very good Eye cream.. I did not see a whole lot of improvement on the crows feet and lines around eyes, but it made the skin around eye area feel and look smooth.  I do like.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm!! I do advise people who are very allergic to move cautiously, however, as we are all affected differently by products.&lt;br /&gt;This eye cream is doing the job for me!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks....</li>
            <li> I had just finished the whole jar and did not see a difference.  It was slightly tingly upon application, nothing uncomfortable. Nice scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the puffiness under my eyes.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles so that was not  a concern.  The eye puffiness never did go away with this product.  I used it morning and night without the results I was hoping for.  I am still in search of a better eye cream.</li>
            <li> I usually work long hours, dark circles and puffy eyes are my main concern. I don&#x27;t want to look tired all the time. This eye cream is awesome and I look more rested. It absorbs quickly and does help with my puffiness. I do notice a difference in the brightness of my eye area instantly after using this product. Love it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all!!! I bought it revive just to see if I would see something... AND NO I DIDNT!!</li>
            <li> I am always hesitant about trying eye products because mine are so sensitive. So I started out slow by using this one night and what I had been using. Now I am using this all the time. I love how it feels cool when you put it on and you don&#x27;t need much at all. I think it&#x27;s helping my dark circles, if so it will be the only product that ever has, even though others have claimed to. It&#x27;s a great bargain also.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a week or so, it is so creamy. I do pat it around my eyes. I am 66 today, and I feel it helps me look younger......</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I have dark circles under my eyes.  They started once I had my children and have gradually got worse over the years (I&#x27;m 46 now).  Nothing I have used worked.  I thought I would give this a try.  At first my skin felt a mild burning sensation but that has stopped now.  I guess my skin just had to get use to it.  It&#x27;s creamy and goes on very nice.  It does have a scent but it&#x27;s pleasant.  I have used it morning and night for about two weeks now and have not noticed much of a difference yet.  However, some mornings when looking in the mirror it seems like the circles are fading a bit, so I&#x27;m thinking once I use it for 8 weeks or so I may see improvement. I do recommend it because even if the circles don&#x27;t fade all the way it&#x27;s still a very nice cream and absorbs well, plus it doesn&#x27;t cost a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Greta</li>
            <li> Have had it for about 2 weeks or so.  So far loving it!  My under eye area looks a bit brighter and my concealer goes on smoother.  At this point, I will definitely buy again!  Thank you Loressen for finally making a product that seems to be making a difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream before and thought it was great, but the new formulation is even better.  It flows on easily and has a faint rose scent.  It keeps my eyelids moist and smooth.  I don&#x27;t really have puffiness, but rather aging skin.  This is a truly good product.  Also, I love the packaging.  I&#x27;ve used tubes and have to cut them off eventually to get the rest of the cream out.  Pump bottles also waste cream.  This wide mouth container means you get the last smidgen of cream!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this vitaleyes eye cream for about 2 weeks now. I have dumb inherited puffy eyes but it does see to lessen the puff a little. It has definitely helped with the dark circles. They doing go underneath my entire eye anymore, just a little in the corner but I&#x27;m confident with longer use that it will fade those little spots too. It has a very nice, light, clean scent. I have recommended it to friends.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous in all aspects except for one.  It works well for decreasing puffiness and fine lines around my eyes.  It has a delicate smell and absorbs quickly.  I&#x27;m in my 60s and I&#x27;ve noticed a visible improvement in the skin around my eyes.  I can honestly say that it&#x27;s the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  The only drawback is the quantity in each jar -- there just isn&#x27;t very much in there and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with my purchase of this eye cream, if definitely firms, reduces puffiness and the apperance of dark circles.  I love the spicy scent of this cream as well.</li>
            <li> Product works very well removing dark circles and general improvement to hide wrinkles in the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the product is slight too thin and the packaging (thin plastic case) should be upgraded.  The packaging really cheapens the appearance of the overall product and again the thin product can be too messy.</li>
            <li> So far so good with this cream it absorbs well and is non greasy.</li>
            <li> I would love to say what the others have said but I&#x27;m not getting any results.  I believe it&#x27;d because I have the hereditary dark circles.  I also used a product over 10 years ago that did wonders and that might of been it for me.  I&#x27;ve always been interested in cosmetically correcting them and that&#x27;s probably the only way now.  I&#x27;m glad it worked for the others.</li>
            <li> Eye Cream that I have tries that really does work. Reduced dark circles under my eyes and small line diminished . HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!</li>
            <li> It stings after it&#x27;s put on but seems to work okay.  I may not buy it again because it stings my eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my uncle and aunt and they swear by it. I am 30 years old and occasionally will use it too, it&#x27;s fantastic and makes a visible difference!! Strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The cream may be very good, but I have a strong allergy to something in the product.  Both my eyes swelled, turned red and were very itchy.</li>
            <li> I cannot see any difference by using this product,  but I can say it smooths in very good.</li>
            <li> I do love this cream.  I love the texture and it has a very&lt;br /&gt;faint fragrance.  I don&#x27;t know if I SEE a difference, but it&lt;br /&gt;is very moisterizing and feels great.  I&#x27;ve tried so so many&lt;br /&gt;eye creams - and this one feels so fresh, clean &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this 2x per day and according to the instructions, for about a month now. Doesn&#x27;t work on my dark circles or bags. No difference. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this eye cream!! I am 26 yr old, just looking to prevent wrinkles and get rid of under eye circles. I&#x27;ve seen improvement with my under eye bags and I like the overall feel of this cream. I would recommend highly!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, because nothing else had not worked to hide my dark circles.  Vital Eyes worked as no other product had.  I noticed a difference fairly quickly and look forward to the continued improvement.</li>
            <li> I am only 24 years old so i dont have dramtic aging and puffyness on my eyes but boy do i like to party and my perpetual dark circles on my eyes sure show it. Within a week i already started to see my eye area getting lighter and firmer and I felt i looked &amp;#34;younger.&amp;#34; Incredible results, every eye cream i ever used dried up and irritated my sensitive eyes but this felt nice and smooth on me. I only bought this cream on Amazon because of the positive reviews so now I am going ot pay if forward and encourage everyone else to try this amazing cream!</li>
            <li> I am a light skinned Hispanic who suffered from eye bags since middle school. I have been using this creme for 3 weeks now and have noticed that my eye bags have reduced and are lighter. I hope it continues to improve to the point you cant tell. It takes 2 weeks or longer to start seeing results. I would definitely recommend this product to those who suffer from eye bags and darkness.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t even lighten the lighter dark spots. Look for lemons on sale they do just as well if not better!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference at all with my dark circles.. It feels really good though and wakes your eyes up in the morning. But it does nothing for my dark circles sadly.</li>
            <li> The eye cream feels nice - light, smooth. But, the smell is very persistent; it lasted for several hours and gave me a headache. Only used this product once and won&#x27;t use again. I think that if you are not sensitive to perfumes and chemical odors this would be a nice eye cream but if you are sensitive you might find the odor too strong.</li>
            <li> Good Product, Works Great See changes next day.... If you have dark circles ayes !!Buy This Product!! Thanks see Youu</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I recommend to everyone. It is very relaxing and you almost feel the change right after first couple days.</li>
            <li> My husband used this product and was pleasantly surprised with the results.  Made his eyes feel soothed and reduced puffiness around the eye area.  Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this cream for a few days, but already I am seeing a tightness in my under eyes that I have not seen on myself since elementary school. I have severe allergies, which has caused my under eyes to be dark and loose since junior high. I have been wearing concealer under my eyes since the age of 11, and even with it, people would comment that I looked tired. Much less so than without, but I never thought I would have youthful looking eyes again. The darkness is still there, but as I said, it&#x27;s only been a few days. I am quite impressed so far. Glad I tried this eye cream!!</li>
            <li> The first ingredient I&#x27;d water. I&#x27;ve heard that is not good for moisturizing creams. Haven&#x27;t seen much results. Will keep using awhile lomgrr</li>
            <li> This jar of creme is much more effective than previous.   I will definitely order again.   Very pleased..</li>
            <li> The misses loves these little items and they make great Happy Day presents.</li>
            <li> I like this product but it hasn&#x27;t worked for me.  I will continue to use it because maybe it will eventually.  I will keep the product and believe it will work for me.</li>
            <li> Tried others but this one really works. Great value and service was excellent. You could pay a lot more for creams that don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I have only used product for a few weeks.  My eyes feel better. I&#x27;m not really sure if it is changing the color or puffy appearance.  I will try this till it&#x27;s used up.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. I feel a slight tingle around my eyes after I put it on and I feel like it&#x27;s really waking up my eyes. I am a single working mom and I was seeing baggy eyes every morning...not anymore! My eyes look younger and brighter because the skin is hydrated and tighter. It does what is advertised. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> not helping me, but will continue to use, maybe one day I&#x27;ll notice a difference....will have to wait and see</li>
            <li> This is a nice cream. It feel good when applying. This is a large container and it will last awhile.</li>
            <li> This cream did not work at all for dark circles! Waste of money and time investment that it would work.</li>
            <li> I do see a difference in my eyes after several weeks use. I see the darkness going away and a softness that was not there before.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on rave reviews. Not sure abou them but my long term genetic dark circles/puffy eyes are seemingly unaffected.It&#x27;s a decent eye moisturizer though.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money, it does not work...</li>
            <li> i am an asian guy, and this product works good on me. good product for this price. My black eye circle gone after one month.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dark circles but I&#x27;ve noticed a definite improvement in the fine lines and firmness around my eyes.  I love how the cream feels going on and it moisturizes very well. I will continue buying this product.</li>
            <li> my sister and i bought a jar at the same time, neither of us have had any good results, this just burns the area around your eyes but not much else as far as we can tell, been using it 6 weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this product to see if there are any results, but I have gotten better results from a serum use. This moisturizes pretty well though.</li>
            <li> I used this product twice a day (morning and night) and applied as directed (by tapping it into the skin). I noticed no difference in the slight darkness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Like every other product in this category, it doesn&#x27;t work.  I used it exactly as directed.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in dark circles.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for the price.  I have always purchased more expensive eye creams and to be true, none of them did much for my dark circles.  Sometimes I just gave up, since they have been with me since I was a young girl. On top of that, wearing glasses for over 25 years doesn&#x27;t help at all.  When I saw this cream, I did not think it would work, but when I saw the price and how the seller was assuring its effectiveness, I decided to give it a try.  I was really surprised after a week of using it morning and night.  My dark circles started to fade.  I can&#x27;t say they completely dissapeared, and I know they won&#x27;t, but my eyes look less tired.  I even started going out without eye corrector, which I never did before.  I highly recommend this product.  I have read from some reviewers that it has a strange smell.  I don&#x27;t think it does.</li>
            <li> I am an African American female with light complexion skin. I previously had dark circles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I am on my second jar of eye cream and let me say first that it absolutely works just like it said it would. The darkness&lt;br /&gt;under my eyes have faded tremendously and I can honestly say that it works good for me. I do not have to rub it in under my&lt;br /&gt;eyes because it will gradually absorb into my skin on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!!!  My eyelids are the type that with age they begin to sag and begin to hang over the eye.  I have used this product for 2 months now and my eye-lids barely sag over my eyes.  My aging-lines around my eyes are greatly diminishing.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product -- may take a few days to notice results.  I love that it does not get in my eyes and sting.</li>
            <li> Pros: Moisturizing, absorbs quickly into the skin, doesn&#x27;t smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: stings my eyes for a minute after applying, no difference in dark circles after 2 weeks, so probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am 58 yrs. old tax accountant. Heavy use of computers, had dark circles and swelling around my eyes like the bags.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product and it reduced the swelling in 2 weeks. It is affordable and great product. Tap slowly when you apply the cream to activate&lt;br /&gt;the blood flow it is very delicate skin under your eyes. I will buy this product any try for 6 more months.</li>
            <li> New formula is entirely different. It&#x27;s now greasy and heavy and has a strong fragrance of &amp;#34;roses&amp;#34;. Please, bring back the other stuff! I used it for years as did many friends and relatives. &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t fix it if it ain&#x27;t broke!&amp;#34; Even the new jar is nasty--heavy and bulky and TOO MUCH. Yuck! I&#x27;ll be looking for a new product, similar to the original.</li>
            <li> Not my absolute favorite but a backup and it&#x27;s OK.  I prefer a oilier eye cream for night.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> NOTICED A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE. NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT.</li>
            <li> This works so well! I don&#x27;t fall asleep very easily, and I have to wake up early for school. I&#x27;ve always had problems with dark circles and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of facials but this worked the best. I use it 2 times a day, every day and it works great. It leaves your skin healthy and dark circle free( nearly) I know if I keep using it like this they&#x27;ll be completely gone. :) But what stinks is if you don&#x27;t use it one time they return. So don&#x27;t forget! Buy this product!</li>
            <li> Got this item because it was a &amp;#34;lightening deal&amp;#34; &amp; had decent reviews and was really hopeful it could help with my dark circles...WRONG! I used it faithfully both morning &amp; night for almost 3weeks with no improvement in my dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent &amp; would be fine used only as a moisturizer but do NOT get it in hopes of clearing up dark circles.</li>
            <li> This cream is a dream! It is light, comfortable and readily absorbed. It is easing fine lines around my eyes and my dark circles are diminishing. Would recommend to anyone needing help with their aging skin.</li>
