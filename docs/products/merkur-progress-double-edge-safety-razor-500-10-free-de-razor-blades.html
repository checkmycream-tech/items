            <li>I am thrilled with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>This is a great razor for beginners because of the versatility of being able to adjust it.igher ones after I&#x27;ve used it more.</li>
            <li>After years of my husband spending a lot of money on the disposable razors, this is by far the best option.  </li>
            <li>But I became more accustomed to it and found the setting I liked.  </li>
            <li>So the soap/cream is very important I learned.  </li>
            <li>much as I love this razor</li>
            <li>Take care with the settings or you may need to buy more \\&quot;nick stop\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would make a perfect gift for anyone (first-timer or veteran shaver) who values practicality and quality.</li>
            <li>It shaves okay, but after changing the blade it is a bear to get the adjuster ring to start at \\&quot;1\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many blades, balms, creams, soaps, razors, and brushes.  </li>
            <li>Believe me, I love my Jagger</li>
            <li>but I kept desiring a closer, more aggressive shave.  </li>
            <li>I wish they made these in more designs, colors, and styles.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that I&#x27;d like shaving this way as I&#x27;ve used Mach3 for 10yrs.  </li>
            <li>Therefore I decided to buy a solid quality adjustable razor to give myself the best fighting chance to be pleased.  </li>
            <li>and my complection is better than ever.  </li>
            <li>I love that combo.</li>
            <li>I love that combo.</li>
            <li>Nice, smooth shave on the husband&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>and you have the most aggressive cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li>TV commercials for the Micro Touch razor sparked my interested in a double-edge razor but reviews for that product weren&#x27;t all good.</li>
            <li>All that being said the razor gives a pretty good shave even on setting number one.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s true!).  </li>
            <li>Changing blades is easy, blade lines up well,</li>
            <li>The weight makes it easy to let the razor do the work.  </li>
            <li>The fit and finish of the razor was awesome just as expected from a Merkur razor.</li>
            <li>and you should be fine.</li>
            <li>Now up until this time I&#x27;ve been primarily using my vintage 1960 Gillette fatboy and on occasion my parker 99r.</li>
            <li>+ and still have a comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>You can dial up/down a comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>It is important to use a quality soap (proraso) and blades (feather).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 6 months, I was unpleased with my shave one day and decided to switch things up.  </li>
            <li>Next razor I get will be a Mergress, but I&#x27;m happy with this for now.</li>
            <li>Next razor I get will be a Mergress, but I&#x27;m happy with this for now.</li>
            <li>It gives a comfortable shave that is close but not BBS.  </li>
            <li>I chose this one, again partly based on the reviews, and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I must admit, at first I wasn&#x27;t sure about shaving this way.  </li>
            <li>The first day after shaving with this thing I couldn&#x27;t help touching my face in admiration of how close it got.</li>
            <li>The first day after shaving with this thing I couldn&#x27;t help touching my face in admiration of how close it got.</li>
            <li>The higher the setting the more aggressive the shave.</li>
            <li>I used a new blade and it was incredible how much different this was than with the safety razor</li>
            <li>It feels great in your hand, and even with the shorter handle, it is slightly longer than the 1904 but a whole lot nicer finished and seemingly better</li>
            <li>The conclusion that i&#x27;ve come to is that shaving on a super agressive setting is like driving 150mph in a sports car -</li>
            <li>The Progress is the clear winner for achieving the closest shave, just not the most comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It was my first!  </li>
            <li>There is TRIANGULAR mark on the bottom section with the handle.&lt;br /&gt;There is DASH or MINUS mark on the top section with the two post where the blade goes.&lt;br /&gt;The top and bottom sections can be put together in two ways.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve just used the lower settings (1-2) but will probably try the higher ones after I&#x27;ve used it more.</li>
            <li>It never clogs like the multi-blade disposables, and the standard double-edged replacement blades are cheap and easy to find.</li>
            <li>Being able to adjust the setting for more or less sensitive areas makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Even if you are sticking with a cartridge type razor, just using the techniques he outlines will definitely give you more success.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor for those who want to go back to the more traditional double edge shaving.</li>
            <li>The difference in regard to shaving is in the degree of agressiveness the higher settings achieve.</li>
            <li>and it was definitely the better setting for my face.  </li>
            <li>Just like I learned through many videos on the internet you must simply use the weight of the razor and not put pressure.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Merkur 1904 as my first DE razor.  </li>
            <li>This was my first safety razor.  </li>
            <li>First impression of this razor itself was the weight of it.</li>
            <li>The adjuster is consistent for me, returning to the plus sign just before the 1 after reassembly.</li>
            <li>The Merkur HD open comb is more aggressive than the Feather going with the grain but not against it (trust me</li>
            <li>I think Merkur could do a lot better job on the Cracker Jack white handle.</li>
            <li>This razor takes some time getting used to if this is the first adjustable razor you have ever used.</li>
            <li>Then you can go to a higher setting.</li>
            <li>After reading the article, I started out with just getting a cheap brush and using shaving soap with my new high tech razors instead of gels/creams and found that that in itself was an improvement.</li>
            <li>I will most likely continue to use the Feather as my main razor and finish up with the Progress whenever I want to go BBS.  </li>
            <li>The adjustments are easy and different than the Gillette.  </li>
            <li>You can easily get a BBS shave with the Progress and without nicks as I have done several times.  </li>
            <li>I am using Personna blades and they work really well with the razor.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise this razor looks and feels very well built.</li>
            <li>It is a real pleasure to shave with the Feather stainless.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the feel of the HD open comb razor</li>
            <li>You must concentrate on blade angle and take short light strokes.  </li>
            <li>The short handle gives you more control/maneuverability (i think) than the long handled razors but if you&#x27;re a butterfinger (or have large hands) you may want to go with the long haandled parker 99r or something similar with lots of knurling/texturing on the handle for a good</li>
            <li>The short handle gives you more control/maneuverability (i think) than the long handled razors but if you&#x27;re a butterfinger (or have large hands) you may want to go with the long haandled parker 99r or something similar with lots of knurling/texturing on the handle for a good grip.</li>
            <li>It needs a significantly longer handle (it&#x27;s really short) and it could use some type of non slip surface on the handle.</li>
            <li>I use the Art of Shaving pre-shave oil, and Col. Conk glycerin shaving soap mostly, sometimes I use the AOS shaving cream and other creams as well.</li>
            <li>On the lowest setting (turning the knob as far as it can go) the shave is a little less aggressive than the Schick injector razor (which for me is nearly perfect).</li>
            <li>Less than great results, and after studying a bunch of other reviews, I just tried a Merkur Progress adjustable.  </li>
            <li>so I figured I&#x27;d start out with a 4.5 on the progress with a decent blade (a derby) but not a ninja blade like the feather until I get my bearings.</li>
            <li>Next razor will be a twist to open (TTO), for sure.</li>
            <li>My main razor was an Edwin Jagger</li>
            <li>Though it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, again mantic59 goes over a lot of stuff with this razor in particular in his videos so watch those</li>
            <li>I enjoy the shave and as other other have stated it is much more aggressive</li>
            <li>Backing up a bit, prior to ordering this razor, I watched pretty much all of the shaving videos on mantic59&#x27;s YouTube which I have to say prepared me really well for the DE razor</li>
            <li>Comparable setting on a fatboy - 11 (if it went that high)</li>
            <li>Although the price was relatively high</li>
            <li>I always got the newest high tech shaving products to see if they would help, but nothing cured my issues.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend checking them out to anyone trying out DE razors.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor to anybody wanting to go with a DE razor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor to anybody wanting to go with a DE razor.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t dialed it beyond a 4 - this razor can be very mild to pretty hard core aggressive.</li>
            <li>No need to worry I only wish I hadn&#x27;t bought the 1904 and just bought the Progress as my first razor.  </li>
            <li>use a three setting for the first couple of passes and the five for the last pass.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s important to note that I have my technique down packed</li>
            <li>Good sharp blades that last and a razor that you can dial up or down depending on how aggressive a shave you want.</li>

            <li>but that wasn&#x27;t my experuience at all - you can have a firm grip and still use light pressure but for some that may be like patting your head and rubbing your belly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>because you can adjust the mildness/agressiveness to suit your face instead of being stuck with a fixed setting that you get with a non-adjustable.</li>

            <li>Only thing is, I don&#x27;t like it as much as the Merkur slant bar.</li>
            <li>I used my old canister foaming shave creame with my safety razor.  </li>
            <li>I then decided to use the old shave cream and my mach3.  </li>
            <li>I decided to add it to my collection consisting of the Feather stainless steel DE razor, and the Merkur HD open comb razor.  </li>
            <li>The Feather gives the smoothest shave of the three by far.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even think it was doing much at first until I actually felt the areas I just finished shaving and found out it was definitely doing the job.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even think it was doing much at first until I actually felt the areas I just finished shaving and found out it was definitely doing the job.</li>
            <li>And your pre-shave preparation (i.e. choosing the proper facial cleanser, possible occasional facial scrub, pre-shave oil) and post-shave routine (alcohol free toner, aftershave balm) make all the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Shaving Gentlemen.</li>
            <li>Progress does a much better job in all the tough spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I would feel it even if it was barely there</li>
            <li>I have no regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Also, I knew that if I purshased an un-adjustable safety razor, that I might be displeased with this new shaving utensile and would be unsure if it was only due to this particular safety razor.  </li>
            <li>One caveat: according to the instructions, when replacing blades it&#x27;s important that the small engraved notch in the upper part is on the same side as the arrow on the lower part -- probably for alignment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used Merkur Blades so far, but they have worked well for me though I will be trying some different ones in an assortment pack.</li>
            <li>I really feel that if you do your due dilligence in learning how to actually shave correctly, you will not have the issues of destroying your face with one of these bad boys, and the results are impressive.</li>

            <li>The first time I had it set at a 5 and got nicked a few times.  </li>

            <li> I have been using a Merkur 1904 as my first DE razor.  </li>
            <li> This was my first safety razor.  </li>
            <li> First impression of this razor itself was the weight of it.</li>
            <li> The adjuster is consistent for me, returning to the plus sign just before the 1 after reassembly.</li>
            <li> The Merkur HD open comb is more aggressive than the Feather going with the grain but not against it (trust me</li>
            <li> I think Merkur could do a lot better job on the Cracker Jack white handle.</li>
            <li> This razor takes some time getting used to if this is the first adjustable razor you have ever used.</li>
            <li> Then you can go to a higher setting.</li>
            <li> After reading the article, I started out with just getting a cheap brush and using shaving soap with my new high tech razors instead of gels/creams and found that that in itself was an improvement.</li>
            <li> I will most likely continue to use the Feather as my main razor and finish up with the Progress whenever I want to go BBS.  </li>
            <li> The adjustments are easy and different than the Gillette.  </li>
            <li> You can easily get a BBS shave with the Progress and without nicks as I have done several times.  </li>
            <li> I am using Personna blades and they work really well with the razor.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise this razor looks and feels very well built.</li>
            <li> It is a real pleasure to shave with the Feather stainless.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the feel of the HD open comb razor</li>
            <li> You must concentrate on blade angle and take short light strokes.  </li>
            <li> The short handle gives you more control/maneuverability (i think) than the long handled razors but if you&#x27;re a butterfinger (or have large hands) you may want to go with the long haandled parker 99r or something similar with lots of knurling/texturing on the handle for a good</li>

            <li> It needs a significantly longer handle (it&#x27;s really short) and it could use some type of non slip surface on the handle.</li>
            <li> I use the Art of Shaving pre-shave oil, and Col. Conk glycerin shaving soap mostly, sometimes I use the AOS shaving cream and other creams as well.</li>
            <li> On the lowest setting (turning the knob as far as it can go) the shave is a little less aggressive than the Schick injector razor (which for me is nearly perfect).</li>
            <li> Less than great results, and after studying a bunch of other reviews, I just tried a Merkur Progress adjustable.  </li>
            <li> so I figured I&#x27;d start out with a 4.5 on the progress with a decent blade (a derby) but not a ninja blade like the feather until I get my bearings.</li>
            <li> Next razor will be a twist to open (TTO), for sure.</li>
            <li> My main razor was an Edwin Jagger</li>
            <li> Though it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, again mantic59 goes over a lot of stuff with this razor in particular in his videos so watch those</li>
            <li> I enjoy the shave and as other other have stated it is much more aggressive</li>
            <li> Backing up a bit, prior to ordering this razor, I watched pretty much all of the shaving videos on mantic59&#x27;s YouTube which I have to say prepared me really well for the DE razor</li>
            <li> Comparable setting on a fatboy - 11 (if it went that high)</li>
            <li> Although the price was relatively high</li>
            <li> I always got the newest high tech shaving products to see if they would help, but nothing cured my issues.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend checking them out to anyone trying out DE razors.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor to anybody wanting to go with a DE razor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor to anybody wanting to go with a DE razor.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t dialed it beyond a 4 - this razor can be very mild to pretty hard core aggressive.</li>
            <li> No need to worry I only wish I hadn&#x27;t bought the 1904 and just bought the Progress as my first razor.  </li>
            <li> use a three setting for the first couple of passes and the five for the last pass.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s important to note that I have my technique down packed</li>
            <li> Good sharp blades that last and a razor that you can dial up or down depending on how aggressive a shave you want.</li>

            <li> but that wasn&#x27;t my experuience at all - you can have a firm grip and still use light pressure but for some that may be like patting your head and rubbing your belly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> because you can adjust the mildness/agressiveness to suit your face instead of being stuck with a fixed setting that you get with a non-adjustable.</li>

            <li> Only thing is, I don&#x27;t like it as much as the Merkur slant bar.</li>
            <li> I used my old canister foaming shave creame with my safety razor.  </li>
            <li> I then decided to use the old shave cream and my mach3.  </li>
            <li> I decided to add it to my collection consisting of the Feather stainless steel DE razor, and the Merkur HD open comb razor.  </li>
            <li> The Feather gives the smoothest shave of the three by far.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even think it was doing much at first until I actually felt the areas I just finished shaving and found out it was definitely doing the job.</li>

            <li> Progress does a much better job in all the tough spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I would feel it even if it was barely there</li>
            <li> I have no regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Also, I knew that if I purshased an un-adjustable safety razor, that I might be displeased with this new shaving utensile and would be unsure if it was only due to this particular safety razor.  </li>
            <li> One caveat: according to the instructions, when replacing blades it&#x27;s important that the small engraved notch in the upper part is on the same side as the arrow on the lower part -- probably for alignment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used Merkur Blades so far, but they have worked well for me though I will be trying some different ones in an assortment pack.</li>
            <li> I really feel that if you do your due dilligence in learning how to actually shave correctly, you will not have the issues of destroying your face with one of these bad boys, and the results are impressive.</li>

            <li> I recently acquired the Merkur Progress, a hefty, heavily plated, double-edged adjustable razor.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Just got my Progress shipped in today and (of course) had to shave with it. Now up until this time I&#x27;ve been primarily using my vintage 1960 Gillette fatboy and on occasion my parker 99r. When I got the Progress I was suprised to see how alike it is to the fatboy in both heft and size. The difference in regard to shaving is in the degree of agressiveness the higher settings achieve. I&#x27;ve been using the fatboy at its flat out maximum adjustment of 9 for some time and the only time i ever nicked myself is when I used a crappy blade - so I figured I&#x27;d start out with a 4.5 on the progress with a decent blade (a derby) but not a ninja blade like the feather until I get my bearings. On the 4.5 setting I got closer than I did using the fatboy with a feather blade on max setting resulting in the closest shave I&#x27;ve had since starting wet shaving, however I did get 3 tiny nicks on this setting 2 tiny to get with a styptic but nicks none the less. The conclusion that i&#x27;ve come to is that shaving on a super agressive setting is like driving 150mph in a sports car - if your technique isnt flawless or very close to it you WILL crash the car and it&#x27;s the same with maximum agression shaving, you will cut your face. So how close was the shave? I can rub with OR against the grain and not feel stubble anywhere on my face and my beard is hard as nails so I would feel it even if it was barely there - yeah it was that close. Comparable setting on a fatboy - 11 (if it went that high) Now I heard people complain about the grip being slippery when wet but that wasn&#x27;t my experuience at all - you can have a firm grip and still use light pressure but for some that may be like patting your head and rubbing your belly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I love this razor I do have some gripes. First the numbers aren&#x27;t painted so they&#x27;re very hard to read esp. if you have poor eyesight. secondly you gotta pay attention which way you put it back together or the blade will get misalligned. And finally there&#x27;s the knob - what a piece of chintzy low quality plastic... crap! Merkur should&#x27;ve gone with a quality metal knob instead of trying to pay hommage to the 1930&#x27;s Apollo Mikron razor - or maybe it was a cost saving measure but hey even the 38c hd has a metal knob so what the heck?? I&#x27;m definately getting the \\&quot;mergress\\&quot; upgrade. You should own this razor 1. because you can adjust the mildness/agressiveness to suit your face instead of being stuck with a fixed setting that you get with a non-adjustable. 2. You wont have to go throwgh the hassle of sanitizing and doing heavy cleaning/polising of a vintage razor if you plan to shave with it *(although I can&#x27;t blame you for going vintage). 3. The short handle gives you more control/maneuverability (i think) than the long handled razors but if you&#x27;re a butterfinger (or have large hands) you may want to go with the long haandled parker 99r or something similar with lots of knurling/texturing on the handle for a good grip.what a piece of chintzy low quality plastic... crap!

            <li> I had never shaved using a DE razor.  It did not come with any instructions on what the settings on the razor meant.  The first time I had it set at a 5 and got nicked a few times.  Set at a 1 and it was definitely the better setting for my face.  Just like I learned through many videos on the internet you must simply use the weight of the razor and not put pressure.</li>
            <li> This is a nice razor, gives great shave. Only thing is, I don&#x27;t like it as much as the Merkur slant bar. Still, if you want a good adjustable safety razor, this should top you list. Changing blades is easy, blade lines up well, no problems with the adjustment mechanism.</li>
            <li> This feels to be twice the weight as my 1957 Gillette Adjustable.  The grip is smoother and needs a little time to get used too.  The quality is at the very top.  I enjoy the shave and as other other have stated it is much more aggressive that the Gillette.  The adjustments are easy and different than the Gillette.  Take care with the settings or you may need to buy more \\&quot;nick stop\\&quot;.  This is now my everyday razor and the old Gillette is now my travel razor.  I have no regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I had been using an injector razor from the seventies which after 40 years of wear and tear was starting to lose its grip on the blades. I thought I&#x27;d never find a good replacement for it. TV commercials for the Micro Touch razor sparked my interested in a double-edge razor but reviews for that product weren&#x27;t all good. Based partly on those reviews and partly on my research of similar products I decided that I needed an adjustable razor. Although the price was relatively high I chose this one, again partly based on the reviews, and was not disappointed. On the lowest setting (turning the knob as far as it can go) the shave is a little less aggressive than the Schick injector razor (which for me is nearly perfect). It never clogs like the multi-blade disposables, and the standard double-edged replacement blades are cheap and easy to find. For the price of one multi-blade replacement you could purchase 10-50 double-edge replacement blades each of which lasts at least twice as long as the multi-blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Workmanship leaves nothing to be desired. Solid metal makes it a little heavy for those used to disposables, but also makes it feel like it will withstand a lot of abuse. Shaving with it feels like using a precision instrument. One caveat: according to the instructions, when replacing blades it&#x27;s important that the small engraved notch in the upper part is on the same side as the arrow on the lower part -- probably for alignment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would make a perfect gift for anyone (first-timer or veteran shaver) who values practicality and quality.</li>
            <li> This is really an excellent razor, I love the adjustability. There are two ways it could be improved. It needs a significantly longer handle (it&#x27;s really short) and it could use some type of non slip surface on the handle.</li>
            <li> It shaves okay, but after changing the blade it is a bear to get the adjuster ring to start at \\&quot;1\\&quot;. It is heavy and one needs to be careful when changing the blade. Next razor will be a twist to open (TTO), for sure.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Merkur 1904 as my first DE razor.  Less than great results, and after studying a bunch of other reviews, I just tried a Merkur Progress adjustable.  There is simply no comparison.  You immediately notice the weight of the Progress and how it is distributed on the head of the razor.  It feels great in your hand, and even with the shorter handle, it is slightly longer than the 1904 but a whole lot nicer finished and seemingly better built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is night and day.  The weight makes it easy to let the razor do the work.  It feels substantial in your hand and no tendency to slip even with cream on your fingers. Being able to adjust the setting for more or less sensitive areas makes a huge difference.  The shave is close without razor burn. I am using Personna blades and they work really well with the razor.  I was worried about using an adjustable without a practiced technique.  No need to worry I only wish I hadn&#x27;t bought the 1904 and just bought the Progress as my first razor.  I also thought the larger head would have made it more difficult to shave under my nose. Again wrong. Progress does a much better job in all the tough spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes the dial doesn&#x27;t start off at number 1 and it is mildly annoying but it is easy to simply compensate for the scale.  Otherwise this razor looks and feels very well built. The numbers are hard to see if you need glasses like I do, but again a minor annoyance.  I am thrilled with the purchase.  If you are going to have one razor, this would be a great choice.</li>
            <li> I have been double edge shaving for around 3 years now, so I&#x27;m no novice.  I&#x27;ve had many blades, balms, creams, soaps, razors, and brushes.  My main razor was an Edwin Jagger DE89L.  Believe me, I love my Jagger but I kept desiring a closer, more aggressive shave.  I think it&#x27;s important to note that I have my technique down packed so I can afford to turn the dial up on this Progress to 5+ and still have a comfortable shave.  The only thing that I hate is that no one makes adjustable razors anymore.  I wish they made these in more designs, colors, and styles.  But if you don&#x27;t care about being fashionable with your razor, this is the utility razor for you.  You can dial up/down a comfortable shave.  Just remember, experiment with sample packs of blades because the blades do make the difference.  And your pre-shave preparation (i.e. choosing the proper facial cleanser, possible occasional facial scrub, pre-shave oil) and post-shave routine (alcohol free toner, aftershave balm) make all the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Shaving Gentlemen.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor for those who want to go back to the more traditional double edge shaving. The only think that I would change would be to make the handle easier to grip. It is a bit slippery when it gets shaving cream and water on it. Otherwise it is an excellent product both cosmetically and functionally.</li>
            <li> After years of my husband spending a lot of money on the disposable razors, this is by far the best option.  There are videos on Youtube that teaches you the correct way to shave.  My husband has not gotten it down 100% but that is becuase we refuses to take the time to learn correctly.</li>
            <li> This was my first safety razor.  I wasn&#x27;t sure that I&#x27;d like shaving this way as I&#x27;ve used Mach3 for 10yrs.  Also, I knew that if I purshased an un-adjustable safety razor, that I might be displeased with this new shaving utensile and would be unsure if it was only due to this particular safety razor.  Therefore I decided to buy a solid quality adjustable razor to give myself the best fighting chance to be pleased.  I must admit, at first I wasn&#x27;t sure about shaving this way.  But I became more accustomed to it and found the setting I liked.  I don&#x27;t get ingrown hairs anymore and my complection is better than ever.  It is important to use a quality soap (proraso) and blades (feather).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 6 months, I was unpleased with my shave one day and decided to switch things up.  I used my old canister foaming shave creame with my safety razor.  This produced and Aweful shave.  So the soap/cream is very important I learned.  I then decided to use the old shave cream and my mach3.  I used a new blade and it was incredible how much different this was than with the safety razor I had become used to.  The mach 3 pulled hard on my hair, I got ingrown hairs and burn on my neck.  Next I tried the mach3 with the proraso soap.  That helped but not enough.  I switched back to my safety razor and proraso soap and haven&#x27;t looked back again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, I do finish spots I missed with my braun electric shaving once my face has dried.</li>
            <li> I started down the path of going \\&quot;Old School\\&quot; on shaving after reading an article about shaving like your grandpa on The Art of Manliness. It intrigued me as I&#x27;ve always had problems with irritation and razorburn, but I had previously just thought that&#x27;s the way it goes. I always got the newest high tech shaving products to see if they would help, but nothing cured my issues. After reading the article, I started out with just getting a cheap brush and using shaving soap with my new high tech razors instead of gels/creams and found that that in itself was an improvement. I finally decided to spend the cash on one of these to see if it would deliver, and boy did it ever. Backing up a bit, prior to ordering this razor, I watched pretty much all of the shaving videos on mantic59&#x27;s YouTube which I have to say prepared me really well for the DE razor and I would highly recommend checking them out to anyone trying out DE razors. Even if you are sticking with a cartridge type razor, just using the techniques he outlines will definitely give you more success. First impression of this razor itself was the weight of it. The thing is deceptively heavy and feels like a real tool in your hand (insert \\&quot;Home Improvement\\&quot; Tim Taylor man grunt). I have had no problems with it slipping or other grip issues which others have said was an problem for them. Also, though the adjustment numbers are small, I didn&#x27;t find reading them to be very difficult. Though it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, again mantic59 goes over a lot of stuff with this razor in particular in his videos so watch those and you should be fine. I&#x27;ve only used Merkur Blades so far, but they have worked well for me though I will be trying some different ones in an assortment pack. I decided to go with this one after a lot of research and decided I wanted an adjustable (it helped that in one of his videos, mantic59 said this was his everyday razor). So far I&#x27;ve just used the lower settings (1-2) but will probably try the higher ones after I&#x27;ve used it more. I really feel that if you do your due dilligence in learning how to actually shave correctly, you will not have the issues of destroying your face with one of these bad boys, and the results are impressive. Go slow, let the razor do the work, and you will not be disappointed. The first day after shaving with this thing I couldn&#x27;t help touching my face in admiration of how close it got. Letting it glide over my skin was life butter, crazy smooth. I didn&#x27;t even think it was doing much at first until I actually felt the areas I just finished shaving and found out it was definitely doing the job. I highly recommend this razor to anybody wanting to go with a DE razor. BTW, sorry if you felt I was just plugging mantic59 in this review, but I found his stuff to be an invaluable resource.&lt;br /&gt;10/6/12 Update: Really great razor. I switched to Feather blades and I think that&#x27;s the way to go. I love that combo. Good sharp blades that last and a razor that you can dial up or down depending on how aggressive a shave you want. Next razor I get will be a Mergress, but I&#x27;m happy with this for now. This is a great razor for beginners because of the versatility of being able to adjust it.igher ones after I&#x27;ve used it more.

            <li> No problems with mine, fit and finish is excellent. The adjuster is consistent for me, returning to the plus sign just before the 1 after reassembly. I haven&#x27;t dialed it beyond a 4 - this razor can be very mild to pretty hard core aggressive. An adjustable razor for the masses.</li>
            <li> I recently acquired the Merkur Progress, a hefty, heavily plated, double-edged adjustable razor.  I decided to add it to my collection consisting of the Feather stainless steel DE razor, and the Merkur HD open comb razor.  You can easily get a BBS shave with the Progress and without nicks as I have done several times.  I have done this with a relatively low setting such as 2.  I can&#x27;t imagine what shaving at setting 5 is like and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be necessary.  As great a razor as the Progress is, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for the following reasons:  (1) The head is bulky.  Not a big deal, but it seems excessively so and takes some getting used to, (2) The way the blade is clamped allows the blade to vibrate causing a scraping sound and potentially some unnecessary razor burn, and (3) The handle is only grooved vertically so it is slippery when wet (as the saying goes).  I have no issue with the plastic knob for adjustments as I like the way it looks and it works well enough. I haven&#x27;t seen a Mergress as they seem impossible to get hold of these days but even if the modification was made available I don&#x27;t know that I would go for it.  Comparing the Progress to my other DE razors this is what I find:  The Feather gives the smoothest shave of the three by far.  It is a real pleasure to shave with the Feather stainless.  It gives a comfortable shave that is close but not BBS.  The Merkur HD open comb is more aggressive than the Feather going with the grain but not against it (trust me it&#x27;s true!).  I enjoy the feel of the HD open comb razor but it also gives a close but not BBS shave.  The Progress is the clear winner for achieving the closest shave, just not the most comfortable.  I will most likely continue to use the Feather as my main razor and finish up with the Progress whenever I want to go BBS.  I use the Art of Shaving pre-shave oil, and Col. Conk glycerin shaving soap mostly, sometimes I use the AOS shaving cream and other creams as well.</li>
            <li> Nice, smooth shave on the husband&#x27;s face. The razors last longer than he thought they would. We bought the stand as well and it looks great on the counter.</li>
            <li> There is TRIANGULAR mark on the bottom section with the handle.&lt;br /&gt;There is DASH or MINUS mark on the top section with the two post where the blade goes.&lt;br /&gt;The top and bottom sections can be put together in two ways.&lt;br /&gt;1. With the triangle and dash marks aligned.&lt;br /&gt;OR&lt;br /&gt;2. With the marks on opposite sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This determines how the male threaded bolt fits into the female threaded handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;With the two marks together on the same side,&lt;br /&gt;The adjustment index will indicate from least aggressive to max aggressive as 1,2,3,4,5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the two marks NOT on the SAME side,&lt;br /&gt;The adjustment index will indicate from least aggressive to max aggressive as 3,4,5,1,2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;With the screw and the white cap turned fully clockwise (head is lowered to bottom or tight), you have the least aggressive cut.&lt;br /&gt;With the screw turned several turns counter-clockwise from the bottom or tight position (head is raised) and you have the most aggressive cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the read-out to be 1,2,3,4,5, then have the two marks matched up triangle and dash.&lt;br /&gt;Three will be the MIDDLE setting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the marks are NOT matched up, the razor will still cut and fully clockwise with the head lowered will still be the least aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just that the INDEX numbers will shown as 3,4,5,1,2&lt;br /&gt;Five will be the MIDDLE setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;JUST ALIGN THE TWO MARKS UP EVERYTIME and be done with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the Progress, the Slant, the Open Comb and if I only had ONE RAZOR, It would be the Adjustable Progress&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a three setting for the first couple of passes and the five for the last pass.</li>
            <li> Shaves great. I think Merkur could do a lot better job on the Cracker Jack white handle.</li>
            <li> Very nice  item. It does we&lt;br /&gt;Hat it is supposed to do. The only thing is that I wish I bought he long one. It is a quality item</li>
            <li> This razor takes some time getting used to if this is the first adjustable razor you have ever used. It was my first!  I have only shave with this razor 3 times as I have just received it. Please start on setting number one and then the cuts and nicks will be minimal.  Then you can go to a higher setting. The higher the setting the more aggressive the shave. You must concentrate on blade angle and take short light strokes.  Be careful! All that being said the razor gives a pretty good shave even on setting number one. I purchased this adjustable razor because I was intrigued by the possibility of the aggressive and less aggressive aspects of the shave in one razor. The fit and finish of the razor was awesome just as expected from a Merkur razor.</li>
