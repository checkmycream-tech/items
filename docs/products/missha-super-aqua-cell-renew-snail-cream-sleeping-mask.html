            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I had waited a good three weeks for this, so I was very excited and nervous.</li>
            <li>But the cream has Very strong smell, it gives me a headache.</li>
            <li>My skin tone was more even, brighter and appeared more youthful.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use it more than once.</li>
            <li>cost me more than $5.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>For more on this and others visit my blog at foodandink.wordpress.com</li>
            <li>So i stopped using it and it seemed to get better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it gets even better.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to report that it has made a noticable difference.</li>
            <li>I found this line just ok.</li>
            <li>Nice fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li>It ok nothing  extraordinary</li>
            <li>and it leaves the skin feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I use it at night and wake up with a well moisturized and smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>The smell is light and airy and my face feels refreshed after application.  </li>
            <li>so the first day this product was great, but then the more I used i thought i was breaking out from it when actually it was just too strong.</li>
            <li>I used it and noticed the very next day that it wasn&#x27;t good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad cream but pricey for just a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I like the smell and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully it wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>It feels light weight and very relax whenever you apply on your face.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend said it smells like fresh</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this would be fine if you live in a humid climate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is very floral, it smells clean and crisp, If it wasn&#x27;t packaged as saying &#x27;snail cream&#x27;</li>
            <li>I tried and loved the Biopelle serum and was looking for a less spendy alternative, so with some trepidation I ordered this.</li>
            <li>Clean, light cucumber scent, lovely texture, and it leaves my skin feeling light, smooth, and youthful, wthout the usual heavy, greasy feel that so many intensive moisturizers have.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get cystic acne any more, I will occasionally get a zit around my period but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward for the result in the future :-)</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The creams seem to do exactly what it is supposed to do: moisturize for the day and nourish by night.</li>
            <li>the next morning my husband said your skin looks amazing - my skin was amazingly soft, dewy and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Got this product earlier that I expected, Been using the product for a week now noticed that my skin looks more radiant and healthier, Diminished my acne scars love this product...</li>
            <li>It dries and you can&#x27;t really smell it anymore.</li>
            <li>My skin is much brighter, lighter, and it looks dewy.</li>
            <li>very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>difference in how much my skin got</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything....</li>
            <li>and this really did diminished their appearance.</li>
            <li>But they do have quite a lot of chemicals in the ingredients list, and the smell is just too much for me.</li>
            <li>On a different note, my mom really liked the mast from the same series, I did not.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I wouldn&#x27;t pay 10 bucks more just for the mask because it&#x27;s not worth it, just get the cream.</li>
            <li>facial wipes for when I don&#x27;t feel super greasy</li>
            <li>The redness on my nose is mainly because of sun/wind/cold damage and not rosacea.</li>
            <li>Both products are now a main stay in my regime.</li>
            <li>I think the sleeping mask is a little better in lightening &amp; dismissing wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I never really got it in my teens, and all of a sudden it was everywhere, mostly the sides of my face and my chin.</li>
            <li>texture is a lot like the laneige water sleeping mask, except it&#x27;s completely clear</li>
            <li>cream keeps my face hydrated and you can drastically see the my skin clear up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the money I DO NOT recommend it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Being 48 years old that was ALOT of sun damage.</li>
            <li>I was a little disconcerted at first about the whole snail thing, but then thought, &amp;#34; well I&#x27;ve eaten escargot&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely (very liquid like), but I still wake up feeling dry and some tightness in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I still can see where the procedure was done; however, now it is barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>If you live in a very dry climate then I would not recommend this.  </li>
            <li>first week of using everyday I noticed results, my red spots were fading.</li>
            <li>It contain less of the active ingredient than the cream which is odd because the mask is suppose to have a more concentrated ingredients as a facial treatment rather than upkeep.</li>
            <li>opened it up the box and it came with a little spatula (I use my fingers so I don&#x27;t really need</li>
    </ol>

            <li> only products I use with this are cetaphil daily cleanser and this weird brand (a knock off of ponds)</li>
            <li> Havent tried mask yet but cream is very soothing and feels cold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried retinol and face peels, but they were really harsh on my skin and dried it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to tell if it&#x27;s going to improve my skin, but I&#x27;m infatuated with this product!</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about the night mask that came with it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This cream is gold in a jar.  After two weeks of use, I can&#x27;t count all the compliments I received from friends.  My skin tone was more even, brighter and appeared more youthful.  This cream will seriously take 5 years off your age.</li>
            <li> I tried and loved the Biopelle serum and was looking for a less spendy alternative, so with some trepidation I ordered this. It&#x27;s too soon to tell if it&#x27;s going to improve my skin, but I&#x27;m infatuated with this product! Clean, light cucumber scent, lovely texture, and it leaves my skin feeling light, smooth, and youthful, wthout the usual heavy, greasy feel that so many intensive moisturizers have.</li>
            <li> The smell is overpowering.  It&#x27;s like perfume times 100.  I couldn&#x27;t use it more than once.</li>
            <li> This really is a very nice face crème. It does not break out my acne prone skin and it leaves the skin feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> so the first day this product was great, but then the more I used i thought i was breaking out from it when actually it was just too strong. For the money I DO NOT recommend it for sensitive skin. It seemed like a great product but just not for me.</li>
            <li> I have almost used up the jar so I think it&#x27;s long enough for me to see all the benefits the cream could provide.  I like the smell and it absorbs quickly.  I use it at night and wake up with a well moisturized and smooth skin.  But that&#x27;s it.  No lightening or erasing the wrinkles.  I think the sleeping mask is a little better in lightening &amp; dismissing wrinkles.  It&#x27;s not a bad cream but pricey for just a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; moisturizer.  Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> will be reordering again!!!! a great product, my dear friend brought me this as a thank you gift from Asia. Thank you Annie &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I am 23 and I was going through really bad cystic acne. I never really got it in my teens, and all of a sudden it was everywhere, mostly the sides of my face and my chin. It was to the point where I was about to spend book a appointment to a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what made me want to buy this, perhaps it was the &#x27;skin regenerating&#x27; properties that pulled me in, either way, i&#x27;m happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day it arrived I was watching this weird Billy Zane movie called the phantom, I hear the doorbell ring and hurrah! It is my package. I had waited a good three weeks for this, so I was very excited and nervous. What is a snail cream gonna smell like? What&#x27;s it gonna feel like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened it up the box and it came with a little spatula (I use my fingers so I don&#x27;t really need it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very floral, it smells clean and crisp, If it wasn&#x27;t packaged as saying &#x27;snail cream&#x27; you wouldn&#x27;t know that it had anything to do with snails. It dries and you can&#x27;t really smell it anymore. My boyfriend said it smells like fresh soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is a lot like the laneige water sleeping mask, except it&#x27;s completely clear tinted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first week of using everyday I noticed results, my red spots were fading. A couple weeks later when it was healing and the dark spots that were red spots were getting smaller and smaller like freckles until they weren&#x27;t even there. I don&#x27;t get cystic acne any more, I will occasionally get a zit around my period but that&#x27;s it. My skin is much brighter, lighter, and it looks dewy. The only downsides is that it&#x27;s not really a anti-wrinkle cream, but if you want that perk you can always layer something else on it and also the night lotion runs out very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only products I use with this are cetaphil daily cleanser and this weird brand (a knock off of ponds) facial wipes for when I don&#x27;t feel super greasy but i want to feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post before after photos when I find good before ones, but I ordered this in august and it&#x27;s december, and i&#x27;m running low. I&#x27;ll reorder sometime in february.</li>
            <li> missing sleeping mask, and the cream is in blue bottle not as shown in the picture which is in yellow. cost me more than $5. to return it back for shipping on my side. which is not right</li>
            <li> I love the creme!!! its very good, my skin get more smooth. I am looking forward for the result in the future :-)</li>
            <li> I used this cream twice and had the worse rash in my face (itchy and swollen skin)...I have seasonal allergies and I think I am having a allergic reaction to this product. It is been a couple of weeks and rash would not go away.</li>
            <li> Addicted to MISSHA&#x27;s Snail Cream.&lt;br /&gt;Huge difference in how much my skin got better.&lt;br /&gt;This cream keeps my face hydrated and you can drastically see the my skin clear up.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It feels light weight and very relax whenever you apply on your face. I love this cream.</li>
            <li> While it might weird some people out in the US, I&#x27;ve learned snail cream actually helps regeneration of the skin, healing acne scarring. It also is an excellent moisturizer &amp; brightens skin. This product is amazing. If you want and &#x27;express care&#x27;, use it morning and night over acne scars and you will see differences in just days. Even some larger pitted scars have vanished from my face. Excellent product! For more on this and others visit my blog at foodandink.wordpress.com</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started getting wrinkles on my neck and forehead and this really did diminished their appearance. I&#x27;ve tried retinol and face peels, but they were really harsh on my skin and dried it out. I was about to just give up, so this was a life saver for a really low price. It even brightened the tone on my face and scars. I started seeing results just after a week of use. So it&#x27;s definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about the night mask that came with it. It contain less of the active ingredient than the cream which is odd because the mask is suppose to have a more concentrated ingredients as a facial treatment rather than upkeep. Anyway, I wouldn&#x27;t pay 10 bucks more just for the mask because it&#x27;s not worth it, just get the cream.</li>
            <li> i was soo looking forward to using this product due to the great reviews, but was a bit disappointed. I used it and noticed the very next day that it wasn&#x27;t good&lt;br /&gt;for my sensitive skin. I broke out on places that i&#x27;ve never had before like my cheek and forehead. So i stopped using it and it seemed to get better. I&#x27;m not going to give up though maybe i&#x27;ll try it again later.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I had a tiny piece of bone growing on my face (under the skin).  When the doctors removed it, they left a scar on my face.  Although it is small, I&#x27;ve tried numerous products to erase this scar; nothing worked until I tried this product.  I still can see where the procedure was done; however, now it is barely noticeable.  I can even hide it under make-up, something I was not able to do before.  I&#x27;m hoping it gets even better.</li>
            <li> just like the missha toner i noticed no difference after emptying the thing, if anybody can reccomand me a good snail cream i would appreciate it</li>
            <li> I purchased this snail cream on 1/25/14 and have been using it religiously morning &amp; night specifically on my nose to reduce redness. I am pleased to report that it has made a noticable difference. But I must say that this improvement occured after 2months of constant usage. The redness on my nose is mainly because of sun/wind/cold damage and not rosacea. Being 48 years old that was ALOT of sun damage. I would recommend this product along with a recommendation of alot of patience.. It does work, but Not overnite. Nice fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li> It ok nothing  extraordinary</li>
            <li> Got this product earlier that I expected, Been using the product for a week now noticed that my skin looks more radiant and healthier, Diminished my acne scars love this product... Cant wait to try more korean products!</li>
            <li> If you live in a very dry climate then I would not recommend this.  It goes on nicely (very liquid like), but I still wake up feeling dry and some tightness in my skin.  I have been add other products to help.  I think this would be fine if you live in a humid climate.</li>
            <li> I love the product!  I was a little disconcerted at first about the whole snail thing, but then thought, &amp;#34; well I&#x27;ve eaten escargot&amp;#34; so what&#x27;s the problem if it&#x27;s in my tummy or on my face??  Right?/?  The smell is light and airy and my face feels refreshed after application.  The Sleeping Mask is wonderful!  Seriously I applied one night and the next morning my husband said your skin looks amazing - my skin was amazingly soft, dewy and refreshed.  Both products are now a main stay in my regime.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Good seller. But the cream has Very strong smell, it gives me a headache. I will not use it.</li>
            <li> My aunt raved about Missha cosmetics, so I decided to give it a try. I found this line just ok. The perfume smell is WAY too overpowering for my liking. Thankfully it wears off quickly. The creams seem to do exactly what it is supposed to do: moisturize for the day and nourish by night. But they do have quite a lot of chemicals in the ingredients list, and the smell is just too much for me. I&#x27;ll use what I have, but won&#x27;t order again. On a different note, my mom really liked the mast from the same series, I did not.</li>
            <li> Havent tried mask yet but cream is very soothing and feels cold. Will reorder. I think it will be really good for summer.</li>
