            <li>When the bottle arrived, I immediately opened to smell because I am very sensitive to certain aromas, and was very pleased because it did not have a scent that I could detect.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to blow dry my hair straight in about 5 minutes completely, which was incredible.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a superior, all natural hair serum.</li>
            <li>I’ll add my leave-in conditioner, apply this on top, and then add my favorite styler before twisting or braiding my hair up to dry.</li>

            <li>I love the fact that this hair serum treatment is all natural.</li>
            <li>I use it a couple times a week and have been pleased with the product so far.</li>
            <li>So, I had been researching and shopping around for different all-natural products that I could use to repair my frazzled mane, and then I found Cashmere Falls and their Moroccan Hair Oil Treatment, which I received at no cost, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and healthy and feels luxurious after using it.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed, and really love about this oil treatment is the fact that it&#x27;s incredibly &#x27;light&#x27; and doesn&#x27;t make my hair appear or feel &#x27;greasy&#x27; or &#x27;oily&#x27; looking, like many other brands do, which I absolutely can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li>My hair is damaged from highlights and hot tools, but when I use the Cashmere Falls Organic Premium Grade Moroccan Argan Hair Oil it feels soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Product is amazing and by far the best treatment for dry or dead hair !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value and it will definitely improve the overall health of your hair.</li>
            <li>Most hair products with or without oils have a very strong odor (and not very pleasant, either).</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair smooth and soft and tames frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>For me a pump on wet hair works nicely.</li>
            <li>It helps me so much with my daughters hair in the morning!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it is, in part, from the coloring I&#x27;ve done over the years and all of the different hair products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>You really should try it!</li>
            <li>This is actually my first day using it</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve purchased this product and I instantly felt in love with it.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li>and I love big hair, so</li>
            <li>It feels so good to toss my hair around and not feel any damage or feel like it&#x27;s sticking to my head and heavy.</li>
            <li>After just one use my long curly hair went from dry and brittle to soft with no frizz, I&#x27;m so happy!!</li>
            <li>It definitely makes my hair silky smooth without frizz, but you have to practice getting the right amount for your hair</li>
            <li>this serum definitely makes my hair feel so smooth and soft and actually makes it look and feel healthy!</li>
            <li>Cool product.... really soft and seems to work well</li>
            <li>It has a white creamy consistency and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;ll blow dry it mostly for when I want to straighten my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really helped dry my hair smooth, and didn&#x27;t get as frizzy when going out in the heat and humidity!  </li>
            <li>Great on my very long, blonde 59 year old lady hair.</li>
            <li>I did notice some added shine, but it really didn&#x27;t address frizz</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair really shiny too.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>, the breakage doesn&#x27;t show as much, it&#x27;s softer and silkier too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Five Star product!</li>
            <li>I have very course</li>
            <li>I thought it worked very well.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted to see how this product would do.</li>
            <li>Whole family uses it</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to everyone who wants silky shinny</li>
            <li>It really does make a difference..</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t really do anything at all.</li>
            <li>My hair is very thick,curly,and color treated and</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need a lot literally</li>
            <li>and this really helps.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>A bonus is, my hands are soft as silk from using it!!!</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way and gives your hair great shine.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it takes only a small amount to make hair softer and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend  it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After taking out my twists or braids to style my hair, I apply this on top to keep frizz under control and add a little shine to my waves.</li>
            <li>It also helps calm the course hairs that occur as your hair gets older (gray or white) and makes my hairstyle smoother.  </li>
            <li>My hair was so straight, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I normally use Moroccan oil in my hair and thought I would try this.</li>
            <li>I followed my normal regimen of shampoo, conditioner</li>
            <li>This conditioning is for all hair types from the damaged and brittle to the normal and color treated.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is that my hair was much less static and actually looked shinier.</li>
            <li>It is much less effective than regular moroccan oil.</li>
            <li>I apply this to my hair after it&#x27;s dried, I love how smooth and shiny my hair looks without being weighed down or seeming oily.</li>
            <li>I am glad I only spent a dollar getting this product</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and shiny, not heavy or greasy!!</li>
            <li>Makes you hair so soft!</li>
            <li>This made my hair and ends feel so soft!</li>
            <li>had I spent the full price</li>
            <li>No over powering smell like I have experienced with other Moroccan oils and you only need a little bit to do the trick so it lasts.</li>
            <li>With a small amount of this oil, I am able to have soft, flowing, shining and radiant hair.  </li>
            <li>I did and I am a true believer that this will definitely leave you with healthier and smoother hair within only a couple applications.</li>
            <li>I decided to maximize my potential for positive results and have been using it twice per day, this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to apply to wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li>No mess and No Drip!</li>
            <li>Through the weeks, I noticed that with each passing day, my hair was slowly growing back to health, and I&#x27;ve developed a lovely sheen to my hair!</li>
            <li>I have not had these results this quick with any other product.</li>
            <li>I have tried different leave-in hair oils and products, but considering I have fine hair and oily skin to start with, most usually wind up weighing my hair down and making my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>A few drops make my hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised that the consistency of the product is liquid.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li>I also frequently bleach and dye it.</li>
            <li>naturally curly here</li>
            <li>Definitely softens hair and fights frizz, very unfamiliar consistency for a serum</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>Iam blk and going all natural</li>
            <li>I can’t find anything negative about it and will purchase more once I run</li>
            <li>I really like this product and have seen a big improvement in the health of my hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I need to have soft and radiant hair</li>
            <li>so far I havent seen them increase to longer split ends.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair feel heavenly with how soft and radiant it looks and feels.</li>
            <li>It makes hair feel soft but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my curls.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After just one week of using this product I noticed how soft my hair had become, and after blow drying it, my hair was starting to feel less coarse and &#x27;desert-like&#x27;, and was becoming hydrated!</li>
            <li>Her hair was showing damage due to the chlorine but is starting to look much better after only a couple applications.</li>
            <li>otherwise it looks really oily and flat.</li>
            <li>but it does the job no less.</li>
            <li>need to use more but not sure I don&#x27;t want to use too much that my hair is weighed down.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and thin</li>
            <li>The next day, my hair is very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a variety of different argan oil products and this is by far one of my favorites!</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li>Not good for naturally curly girls that are silicone and sulfate free.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel more comfortable using this product knowing that it doesn&#x27;t have alot of crap in it</li>
            <li>As I have aged I have noticed that my hair is losing that pretty shine it had for such a long time.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight, and has your hair feeling very moist and not weighed down.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so soft or shined so much in a long time!  </li>
            <li>I started getting grey hair recently and the texture of my hair has completely changed.  </li>
            <li>Made in the U.S.A. Offers long lasting health.</li>
            <li>After using the product all over my hair, I usually rub the left over product all over my hands because the organic virgin and cold pressed moroccan oil and the other ingredients used for this product is great for the skin as well!</li>

            <li> When the bottle arrived, I immediately opened to smell because I am very sensitive to certain aromas, and was very pleased because it did not have a scent that I could detect.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to blow dry my hair straight in about 5 minutes completely, which was incredible.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a superior, all natural hair serum.</li>
            <li> I’ll add my leave-in conditioner, apply this on top, and then add my favorite styler before twisting or braiding my hair up to dry.</li>
            <li> On most days, it gets very dry and frizzy at the bottom and greasy on top.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this hair serum treatment is all natural.</li>
            <li> I use it a couple times a week and have been pleased with the product so far.</li>
            <li> So, I had been researching and shopping around for different all-natural products that I could use to repair my frazzled mane, and then I found Cashmere Falls and their Moroccan Hair Oil Treatment, which I received at no cost, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and healthy and feels luxurious after using it.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed, and really love about this oil treatment is the fact that it&#x27;s incredibly &#x27;light&#x27; and doesn&#x27;t make my hair appear or feel &#x27;greasy&#x27; or &#x27;oily&#x27; looking, like many other brands do, which I absolutely can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged from highlights and hot tools, but when I use the Cashmere Falls Organic Premium Grade Moroccan Argan Hair Oil it feels soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Product is amazing and by far the best treatment for dry or dead hair !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value and it will definitely improve the overall health of your hair.</li>
            <li> Most hair products with or without oils have a very strong odor (and not very pleasant, either).</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair smooth and soft and tames frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> For me a pump on wet hair works nicely.</li>
            <li> It helps me so much with my daughters hair in the morning!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it is, in part, from the coloring I&#x27;ve done over the years and all of the different hair products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> You really should try it!</li>
            <li> This is actually my first day using it</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve purchased this product and I instantly felt in love with it.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li> and I love big hair, so</li>
            <li> It feels so good to toss my hair around and not feel any damage or feel like it&#x27;s sticking to my head and heavy.</li>
            <li> After just one use my long curly hair went from dry and brittle to soft with no frizz, I&#x27;m so happy!!</li>
            <li> It definitely makes my hair silky smooth without frizz, but you have to practice getting the right amount for your hair</li>
            <li> this serum definitely makes my hair feel so smooth and soft and actually makes it look and feel healthy!</li>
            <li> Cool product.... really soft and seems to work well</li>
            <li> It has a white creamy consistency and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;ll blow dry it mostly for when I want to straighten my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really helped dry my hair smooth, and didn&#x27;t get as frizzy when going out in the heat and humidity!  </li>
            <li> Great on my very long, blonde 59 year old lady hair.</li>
            <li> I did notice some added shine, but it really didn&#x27;t address frizz</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair really shiny too.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> , the breakage doesn&#x27;t show as much, it&#x27;s softer and silkier too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Five Star product!</li>
            <li> I have very course</li>
            <li> I thought it worked very well.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted to see how this product would do.</li>
            <li> Whole family uses it</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone who wants silky shinny</li>
            <li> It really does make a difference..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really do anything at all.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick,curly,and color treated and</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need a lot literally</li>
            <li> and this really helps.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> A bonus is, my hands are soft as silk from using it!!!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and gives your hair great shine.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it takes only a small amount to make hair softer and more manageable.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend  it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After taking out my twists or braids to style my hair, I apply this on top to keep frizz under control and add a little shine to my waves.</li>
            <li> It also helps calm the course hairs that occur as your hair gets older (gray or white) and makes my hairstyle smoother.  </li>
            <li> My hair was so straight, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I normally use Moroccan oil in my hair and thought I would try this.</li>
            <li> I followed my normal regimen of shampoo, conditioner</li>
            <li> This conditioning is for all hair types from the damaged and brittle to the normal and color treated.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is that my hair was much less static and actually looked shinier.</li>
            <li> It is much less effective than regular moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> I apply this to my hair after it&#x27;s dried, I love how smooth and shiny my hair looks without being weighed down or seeming oily.</li>
            <li> I am glad I only spent a dollar getting this product</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and shiny, not heavy or greasy!!</li>
            <li> Makes you hair so soft!</li>
            <li> This made my hair and ends feel so soft!</li>
            <li> had I spent the full price</li>
            <li> No over powering smell like I have experienced with other Moroccan oils and you only need a little bit to do the trick so it lasts.</li>
            <li> With a small amount of this oil, I am able to have soft, flowing, shining and radiant hair.  </li>
            <li> I did and I am a true believer that this will definitely leave you with healthier and smoother hair within only a couple applications.</li>
            <li> I decided to maximize my potential for positive results and have been using it twice per day, this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to apply to wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> No mess and No Drip!</li>
            <li> Through the weeks, I noticed that with each passing day, my hair was slowly growing back to health, and I&#x27;ve developed a lovely sheen to my hair!</li>
            <li> I have not had these results this quick with any other product.</li>
            <li> I have tried different leave-in hair oils and products, but considering I have fine hair and oily skin to start with, most usually wind up weighing my hair down and making my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> A few drops make my hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised that the consistency of the product is liquid.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li> I also frequently bleach and dye it.</li>
            <li> naturally curly here</li>
            <li> Definitely softens hair and fights frizz, very unfamiliar consistency for a serum</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> Iam blk and going all natural</li>
            <li> I can’t find anything negative about it and will purchase more once I run</li>
            <li> I really like this product and have seen a big improvement in the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I need to have soft and radiant hair</li>
            <li> so far I havent seen them increase to longer split ends.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel heavenly with how soft and radiant it looks and feels.</li>
            <li> It makes hair feel soft but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my curls.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just one week of using this product I noticed how soft my hair had become, and after blow drying it, my hair was starting to feel less coarse and &#x27;desert-like&#x27;, and was becoming hydrated!</li>
            <li> Her hair was showing damage due to the chlorine but is starting to look much better after only a couple applications.</li>
            <li> otherwise it looks really oily and flat.</li>
            <li> but it does the job no less.</li>
            <li> need to use more but not sure I don&#x27;t want to use too much that my hair is weighed down.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and thin</li>
            <li> The next day, my hair is very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of different argan oil products and this is by far one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> Not good for naturally curly girls that are silicone and sulfate free.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel more comfortable using this product knowing that it doesn&#x27;t have alot of crap in it</li>
            <li> As I have aged I have noticed that my hair is losing that pretty shine it had for such a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight, and has your hair feeling very moist and not weighed down.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so soft or shined so much in a long time!  </li>
            <li> I started getting grey hair recently and the texture of my hair has completely changed.  </li>
            <li> Made in the U.S.A. Offers long lasting health.</li>
            <li> After using the product all over my hair, I usually rub the left over product all over my hands because the organic virgin and cold pressed moroccan oil and the other ingredients used for this product is great for the skin as well!</li>
            <li> I have a child that is biracial and have a hard time finding the right products.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon for around $25 is a bit high but should last quite awhile if left in the shower and used a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly fine hair and it seems to moisturize it with no weighing down or oily feel.</li>
            <li> I even use a few drops before styling for added shine, this product works wonders and i highly recommended it for anyone with similar hair types.</li>
            <li> The only difference that I have noticed is that the color is white while the ones I&#x27;ve previously used are clear.</li>
            <li> It left my curls feeling, soft and bouncy... not greasy and weighted down.</li>
            <li> In addition to using before I dry my hair, I use this as a deep treatment, leave in conditioner overnight since it is not oily.</li>
            <li> I’m always looking for something to help my dry, coarse hair retain moisture and keep the frizz at bay.</li>
            <li> I think my favorite feature is that it is an emulsion, so it&#x27;s not drippy like other oils I have tried, and it&#x27;s difficult to overdo it.</li>
            <li> but, I have not found any substantial difference in this particular product from the ones that I have purchased in the past</li>
            <li> I had over processed hair from coloring and using the flat iron but with just one use my hair has gone from feeling dry and being frizzy to feeling like silk and</li>
            <li> it does not weigh down my fine thin hair, or give it a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> It works wonders for my daughters long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair now feels very soft and manageable with very little to no hair breakage.</li>
            <li> but my hair seemed dry and not soft.</li>
            <li> Goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> We both have dry hair and split ends.</li>
            <li> My hair color treated and I blow dry it every day but after using  Cashmere Falls</li>
            <li> SHE HAS PROBLEMS WITH DRY BRITTLE HAIR.  </li>
            <li> but it is so frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> After it was dry</li>
            <li> I apply it when my hair is damp and either just leave it how it is and let it air dry</li>
            <li> What smell is there goes away once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using the oil treatment on my hair each morning, after I blow dry my hair, and then once at night, before bed.</li>
            <li> way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Moroccan Hair Oil Treatment works to strengthen and repair all hair types, including those that are dry, bleached, color-treated and damaged, which minus the bleaching, my hair has been through it all.</li>
            <li> but I do have very dry hair.</li>
            <li> so the ends of my hair are always dry from the blonde and also my everyday straightening.</li>
            <li> I applied it to my hair wet and dry and the difference is inmediate!</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> Only need a little.  </li>
            <li> I color my hair frequently which makes it dull and brittle.  </li>
            <li> I love how it makes my long and usually crazy hair look like!</li>
            <li> The product is thinner than I expected and wish it was a thicker consistency.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a few times, and already I can see the repair in my split ends.</li>
            <li> You only use a few drops, rub into the palm of your hand and rub it into your hair.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this product goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of product does go a long way</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to try on my daughters hair,  they both have coarse curly bi-racial hair that can be dry and hard to manage.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what has happened to my hair in the last year</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit of the product as a little goes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily like other argan products.</li>
            <li> All it took was two drops to coat my hair while it was wet!  </li>
            <li> but so does a couple of other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of other products to achieve that.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other Argan oils and they have to be rinse out of your hair and your hair is oily afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I applied just a few drops of the Moroccan oil to their hair after washing and conditioning and let it air dry</li>
            <li> If you are not completely satisfied this company offers a satisfaction guarantee and that I feel usually speaks for itself.</li>
            <li> It does not leave am odor no oily mess like other hair products.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not weighting it down</li>
            <li> I have cut down on my styling cream as well becuase the argan oil basically dose the job.</li>
            <li> I was worried that this product would weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have less fly-aways</li>
            <li> The Morocan Argan Oil Hair Treatment does not create a mess or drip.  </li>
            <li> so I was not excited about using it.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with dry, brittle hair for as long as I can remember, and was unable to find a product that took that dull, dry look away.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with dry, brittle hair for as long as I can remember, and was unable to find a product that took that dull, dry look away.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few days</li>
            <li> It will build up on your hair if you do not use harsh sulfate shampoo to remove it.  </li>
            <li> After washing and conditioning I just added a few drops to my damp hair and worked it in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cashmere Falls Argan Oil for a few weeks now, pumping about three pumps into my hands and massaging through the ends of my damp hair after I&#x27;ve showered.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> dead hair poodle look if I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of transitioning my hair and this product was recommended by someone that had gone through the process a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> Before I started using this product I would wear my hair up in a bun or ponytail, nearly everyday, because the frizziness of my hair was just so unmanageable, and I had lost a piece of my confidence.</li>
            <li> I just use a few pumps and rub my hands together and run my fingers through my damp hair.</li>
            <li> Will be using this everyday.</li>
            <li> I had a few I used it in those split ends</li>
            <li> I put a little in my hand, rubbed it through my hair and WALA no more witch hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair</li>
            <li> so iam anxious to see how it feels in my hair</li>
            <li> So, I usually apply it after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> It usually stays moisturized</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure how my hair is suppose to react.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the negative side effects of hair dye on mine.</li>
            <li> This is a cream base and does not seem to absorb into my hair very well</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and live in Missouri, humidity in the summer is AWFUL!  </li>
            <li> I had tried the Moroccan Oil brand but found it to be a bit heavy and expensive.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not good for my hair.</li>
            <li> Totally got my crazy hair under control!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair that when I run a brush through it turns to FRIZZ.</li>
            <li> NO MORE FRIZZ!!</li>
            <li> Using hair products to address these issues has always been a frustrating ordeal for me.</li>
            <li> The product worked well on my hair for shine and flexibility but the yellowish color on my white/gray was not attractive.</li>
            <li> Even though this product contains oil, the consistency is thin and watery - nothing like an oil.</li>
            <li> This is serious hydration!</li>
            <li> Ill keep a look out on the progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And you can&#x27;t beat organic with all the crazy stuff that is in products these days.</li>
            <li> Really disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have VERY difficult hair.</li>
            <li> I would be very very unhappy.</li>
            <li> I hate getting split ends on my hair but Cashmere Falls says it has been proven to heal split ends.</li>
            <li> No idea how it works because the smell is just horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I have VERY difficult hair. On most days, it gets very dry and frizzy at the bottom and greasy on top. Using hair products to address these issues has always been a frustrating ordeal for me. I had no expectations when I got this product in the mail. I had high hopes because I read a lot of good things about Cashmere Falls but I don&#x27;t know how my hair would react to it. I was very pleasantly surprised that the consistency of the product is liquid. This made me feel very hopeful about the product because if it&#x27;s not in oil form...then it won&#x27;t make the top of my head look greasy even if I accidentally slather it all over my head (that kinda happens when I&#x27;m in a hurry)! After using it for almost a week, I can honestly say that I am VERY happy about this product! It hydrates my hair without making the top greasy. It makes my hair look more &amp;#34;alive&amp;#34; - for lack of a better term or way to describe it. I love how it makes my long and usually crazy hair look like! After using the product all over my hair, I usually rub the left over product all over my hands because the organic virgin and cold pressed moroccan oil and the other ingredients used for this product is great for the skin as well! It&#x27;s a truly great product for a great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Okay, so first of all this isn&#x27;t an oil. It has a white creamy consistency and is easy to apply. I have very long hair and I need a lot of this. I did notice some added shine, but it really didn&#x27;t address frizz like I wanted it to. I like that it says it strengthens, but don&#x27;t find myself reaching for this often for myself, but do have luck using it on my kids&#x27; shorter and wavier hair styles. I think I probably would really need a lot for my hair, more then I have been applying. Maybe I can carry a dehumidifer around with me!&lt;br /&gt;  Disclosure; I received a product sample to facilitate my review however the opinions here are my own.</li>
            <li> Loved this stuff! Great product! I am a stylist and have been using on my clients...they love it too!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few days and it&#x27;s amazing, I really love it. My hair feels really great. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Received product at discount for review what a great hair product, my hair feels smooth and soft and not frizzy. Makes my hair really shiny too.  Ty</li>
            <li> This product works great, lasts long and smells good!</li>
            <li> A little bit of this product goes a long way.  It makes your hair smooth and soft and tames frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This is a nice smelling light hair serum. I like that it does not weigh down my fine thin hair, or give it a greasy feel. For me a pump on wet hair works nicely. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love oils and this is on point!!!  Non greasy, ease to apply, well absorbed into my hair and skin!!  Fast shipping at that!!!!  This would be a great addition to any naturals oil stash!!!</li>
            <li> Got for unreal price.......LOVE it.....my hair loves it. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bringing my hair back to life used with hair steamer then before drying I have very thick long hair and it&#x27;s not weighting it down and it makes my hair feel wonderful</li>
            <li> I normally use Moroccan oil in my hair and thought I would try this. The company sent a very impressive email to me after I ordered singing the praises of their product, but I prefer my Moroccan oil. This is a cream base and does not seem to absorb into my hair very well but I do have very dry hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky and shiny</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Cashmere Falls Heavenly Hydration treatment serum. I have naturally wavy/curly hair and I do a lot of straightening and styling with my hair. I also frequently bleach and dye it. Not to mention the product use.... My hair takes a beating. I noticed since I began using this oil I have less fly-aways, the breakage doesn&#x27;t show as much, it&#x27;s softer and silkier too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Didn&#x27;t leave a film in my hair&lt;br /&gt;- Had no odor&lt;br /&gt;- Didn&#x27;t leave a residue on my hands&lt;br /&gt;- Works almost instantly&lt;br /&gt;- A little bit of product does go a long way&lt;br /&gt;- If I used more than needed, it didn&#x27;t make my hair greasy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- I wish the bottle was a little bigger. I have thick hair so I do use a lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product discounted in exchange for an ethical and honest review of my own. The seller, nor price of the product had any influence in my opinion of the product. I take great care reviewing all my products ethically, effectively and truthfully. I take pride in helping others make informed , educated purchases.</li>
            <li> Cashmere Falls is a terrific, lightweight yet truly moisturizing oil. It left my curls feeling, soft and bouncy... not greasy and weighted down. I am French Creole from Louisiana and have a varied racial background that includes French, Spanish, African, and Jewish. As a result, I have some of every type of hair on my one head. I had tried the Moroccan Oil brand but found it to be a bit heavy and expensive. Cashmere Falls is an excellent alternative that would be suitable for ALL hair types! Also, their customer service and communication is superb. I shop Amazon weekly, and they are definitely amongst the finest Marketplace Sellers that I have encountered. I highly recommend this Five Star product!</li>
            <li> Awesome product just a few drops makes my frizzy hair smoothe and controlled :) love this will definitely order more !!!</li>
            <li> Very Good. Makes you hair so soft!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it has no smell.  I have thick curly fine hair and it seems to moisturize it with no weighing down or oily feel.</li>
            <li> Great product! Totally got my crazy hair under control!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product! As soon as I got it in decided to put it to work! I have a child that is biracial and have a hard time finding the right products. This product made her hair feel absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> My hair feels so smooth after using this product. In addition to using before I dry my hair, I use this as a deep treatment, leave in conditioner overnight since it is not oily.This is more cream like in texture than a serum.</li>
            <li> This is a good hair oil. It does not give oily effect on your hair.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t notice the difference with this product. I have very course naturally curly here so I welcome a product with oil in it and this one left me unimpressed. For a product that says it is drip free, I was even more unimpressed as I could squirt in my hand and it instantly started running out before I made it to my hair. It also felt a lot like water. As a matter of fact I pump some into my hands and rub in it completely rubbed in with absolutely no oil. It literally evaporated into my hands as if I had washed them with water. I am glad I only spent a dollar getting this product had I spent the full price I would be very very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes my hair shiny and easy to style. Love it</li>
            <li> I thought it worked very well. It definitely makes my hair silky smooth without frizz, but you have to practice getting the right amount for your hair otherwise it looks really oily and flat.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to try on my daughters hair,  they both have coarse curly bi-racial hair that can be dry and hard to manage. I applied just a few drops of the Moroccan oil to their hair after washing and conditioning and let it air dry and it was shiny, healthy looking and manageable. I even use a few drops before styling for added shine, this product works wonders and i highly recommended it for anyone with similar hair types.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful! It helps me so much with my daughters hair in the morning! It smooths it perfectly.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair healthy.  Only need a little.  Lasts a long time.  I&#x27;m able to apply to wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> Cashmere Falls Heavenly Hydration  Moroccan Argan Oil Hair Serum is really a great product. My hair is very fine and thin and I know how great Argan Oil is. When I got the product I used it immediately because I don&#x27;t like to have greasy hair and I really wanted to see how this product would do. I followed my normal regimen of shampoo, conditioner and then I added the Cashmere Falls Heavenly Hydration  Moroccan Argan Oil Hair Serum. I followed by blow drying and I was able to blow dry my hair straight in about 5 minutes completely, which was incredible. My hair was so straight, soft and manageable. I will definitely be using Cashmere Falls Heavenly Hydration  Moroccan Argan Oil Hair Serum on a continuous basis to see how my hair does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received Cashmere Falls Heavenly Hydration  Moroccan Argan Oil Hair Serum for free to review.*</li>
            <li> Excellent product, excellent service!</li>
            <li> Love this product makes my hair feel soft and strong with no oily residue on my hair or hands.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and live in Missouri, humidity in the summer is AWFUL!  This really helped dry my hair smooth, and didn&#x27;t get as frizzy when going out in the heat and humidity!  I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an organic argan oil for both me and my toddler. We both have dry hair and split ends. Cashmere Falls is truly a wonderful product.  No smell, no mess and my hair looks great!  I also feel safe using it on my toddler as well.  I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a superior, all natural hair serum.</li>
            <li> contains Cyclomethicone.  which is a non water soluble silicone that must be removed with a sulfate shampoo.  It will build up on your hair if you do not use harsh sulfate shampoo to remove it.  Not good for naturally curly girls that are silicone and sulfate free.</li>
            <li> Definitely softens hair and fights frizz, very unfamiliar consistency for a serum but it does the job no less. And it&#x27;s organic!</li>
            <li> No idea how it works because the smell is just horrible! The serum smells like rubber. My kids agreed. Shipping back for refund!</li>
            <li> Works great Thanks for the coupon. Whole family uses it</li>
            <li> Yes, I would recommend it. Great on my very long, blonde 59 year old lady hair. Goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Love it my hair is SUPER SOFT and SHINY , I will purchase again Being honest gets discounts</li>
            <li> As I have aged I have noticed that my hair is losing that pretty shine it had for such a long time.  I&#x27;m sure it is, in part, from the coloring I&#x27;ve done over the years and all of the different hair products I&#x27;ve tried.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this hair serum and have been very pleased so far.  After washing and conditioning I just added a few drops to my damp hair and worked it in.  The first thing I noticed is that my hair was much less static and actually looked shinier. I&#x27;m sure this will quickly become an important part of my hair care routine.</li>
            <li> The serum works well so far,I can see the difference .</li>
            <li> I have tried different leave-in hair oils and products, but considering I have fine hair and oily skin to start with, most usually wind up weighing my hair down and making my hair look greasy. Not this product. I&#x27;ve been using Cashmere Falls Argan Oil for a few weeks now, pumping about three pumps into my hands and massaging through the ends of my damp hair after I&#x27;ve showered. The result: soft, healthy hair that is brilliant in shine – sans greasy residue. It feels so good to toss my hair around and not feel any damage or feel like it&#x27;s sticking to my head and heavy. I highly recommend giving it a try. It&#x27;s a great value and it will definitely improve the overall health of your hair.</li>
            <li> This product is too good to be true! I must be dreaming!! My hair feel like silk and the radiance has come back. I had over processed hair from coloring and using the flat iron but with just one use my hair has gone from feeling dry and being frizzy to feeling like silk and NO MORE FRIZZ!! I have tried all sorts of products - ranging in price but this &amp;#34;CASHMERE FALLS ARAGON OIL&amp;#34; beats them all. I would recommend this product to everyone who wants silky shinny hair.&lt;br /&gt;You can also use it as a deep conditioner. Just put it on at night and then wash your hair the next day and POOF you have beautiful shinny, healthy and silky hair. This is a miracle in a bottle for all of us who want healthy looking hair!</li>
            <li> Great, quality, excellent ship time</li>
            <li> Love this product! A few drops make my hair so soft and smooth. As for the scent, I love the Moriccan oil scent so the fact that this has no scent isn&#x27;t a plus for me.  I may continue to buy M Moroccan oil as I love that scent. But nevertheless this is a great hair oil.</li>
            <li> I have tried it for 2 days and I see a difference. I use coconut oil but if this keeps up..I am switching.My hair looks amazing not oily and no smell</li>
            <li> Great for your hair and skin.  Not greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with dry, brittle hair for as long as I can remember, and was unable to find a product that took that dull, dry look away. I have been using this product. It really does make a difference.. It makes my hair soft and shiny. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is very light and doesn&#x27;t weight down your hair (which is great). A little bit goes a long way and gives your hair great shine. I love the fact that this hair serum treatment is all natural. It makes me feel more comfortable using this product knowing that it doesn&#x27;t have alot of crap in it that&#x27;s not good for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used Moroccan oil in some shape or form for a couple of years and Cashmere Falls ranks right up there with the best out there. My hair color treated and I blow dry it every day but after using  Cashmere Falls my hair is silky and shiny. You really should try it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  My hair is damaged from highlights and hot tools, but when I use the Cashmere Falls Organic Premium Grade Moroccan Argan Hair Oil it feels soft and healthy.  I think my favorite feature is that it is an emulsion, so it&#x27;s not drippy like other oils I have tried, and it&#x27;s difficult to overdo it.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair. I don&#x27;t know if my type of hair didn&#x27;t like this product, but it didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair. It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is actually my first day using it I got it today so iam anxious to see how it feels in my hair Iam blk and going all natural so I wanna see how this works for my type of hair. I will do an update within two weeks</li>
            <li> can tell a big difference in my hair</li>
            <li> love this. i will def be ordering again</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve purchased this product and I instantly felt in love with it. My hair now feels very soft and manageable with very little to no hair breakage. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Very nice consistency, almost creamy. Leaves hair with a nice shine and soft to the touch.  I am using this on my teenage granddaughter&#x27;s hair after swimming.  Her hair was showing damage due to the chlorine but is starting to look much better after only a couple applications. Great product!</li>
            <li> This product is lovely. It works wonders for my daughters long curly hair.  I use it on my skin now too and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have bleached hair and I love this stuff! It brings my hair back to life. I get thay dead hair poodle look if I don&#x27;t. I have cut down on my styling cream as well becuase the argan oil basically dose the job. Reccommended!</li>
            <li> I GOT THIS FOR MY BEST FRIEND AND SHE LOVES IT.  SHE HAS PROBLEMS WITH DRY BRITTLE HAIR.  HER HAIR IS NOTICEABLY SOFTER.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li> No over powering smell like I have experienced with other Moroccan oils and you only need a little bit to do the trick so it lasts. Doesn&#x27;t drip everywhere like most so my shirts and neck are thankful. Would recommend to any of my friends with all different types of hair. And you can&#x27;t beat organic with all the crazy stuff that is in products these days. I WILL be buying more as soon as I am close to running out.</li>
            <li> I color my hair frequently which makes it dull and brittle.  Best Moroccan Argan oil helps the overall look and feel of my hair.  I love the fact that it takes only a small amount to make hair softer and more manageable.  Thanks for offering a great product!</li>
            <li> Nice smell! Love the pump! Easy to use and great for hair!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my hair. I will admit I only used once. It looked like a salad dressing so I was not excited about using it. May be good for others though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like liquid silk. It is awesome. I have used it on my hair and scalp. It is not greasy at all. A bonus is, my hands are soft as silk from using it!!!</li>
            <li> The product worked well on my hair for shine and flexibility but the yellowish color on my white/gray was not attractive.</li>
            <li> I applied it to my hair wet and dry and the difference is inmediate! So shinny and beautiful. The only thing I did not like was the smell.</li>
            <li> My hair does feel fuller and softer. I use it a couple times a week and have been pleased with the product so far.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products to try and get my hair healthy again. I am not sure what has happened to my hair in the last year but it is so frizzy and dry. I was reading reviews on another product when I saw someone mention how much they liked Cashmere Falls so I started reading these reviews and felt I should try this in hopes it would be my answer. I have been using the product for a week now and I have to say my hair is getting softer and softer the more I use it. I have not had these results this quick with any other product. I really like that it is good for my skin also. Its just an overall really good product at a really good price.</li>
            <li> I’m always looking for something to help my dry, coarse hair retain moisture and keep the frizz at bay. Luckily, this product does that and more! Even though this product contains oil, the consistency is thin and watery - nothing like an oil. It absorbs easily into the hair. You only need a little bit of the product as a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice that it works best on damp hair. So, I usually apply it after washing my hair. I’ll add my leave-in conditioner, apply this on top, and then add my favorite styler before twisting or braiding my hair up to dry. The next day, my hair is very soft and moisturized. It usually stays moisturized a good 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great use I’ve found for this is as a shine enhancing serum after a twist out or braid out. After taking out my twists or braids to style my hair, I apply this on top to keep frizz under control and add a little shine to my waves. I can’t find anything negative about it and will purchase more once I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are 100% mine.</li>
            <li> feels absolutely wonderful, hair shines and is so shiny, try it on your nails too, i just covered them and let them set for a bit, godd stuff, good company try it</li>
            <li> I really like this product and have seen a big improvement in the health of my hair. The product is thinner than I expected and wish it was a thicker consistency. It&#x27;s not oily like other argan products. It hasn&#x27;t made me hair oily like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> It is much less effective than regular moroccan oil. This doesn&#x27;t really do anything at all. It&#x27;s possible my hair was a tiny tiny bit shinier, but not noticeably. Really disappointing.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL product.  My hair feels so smooth and silky after use!</li>
            <li> I bought this item to protect my hair after every time i shampoo. It keep my hair shiny and moist all the time so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the negative side effects of hair dye on mine. I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I started getting grey hair recently and the texture of my hair has completely changed.  After receiving the oil I used it immediately.  It is so great!  I let my hair air dry and there was no frizz at all.  I can&#x27;t wait to use the blow dryer and see the results.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  I have been struggling with dry, brittle hair for as long as I can remember, and was unable to find a product that took that dull, dry look away.  I love that you do not need to use a lot of it to create the desired effect.  With a small amount of this oil, I am able to have soft, flowing, shining and radiant hair.  The Morocan Argan Oil Hair Treatment does not create a mess or drip.  I have only used this product a few times, and already I can see the repair in my split ends. My hair has never looked, nor felt this healthy, vibrant and radiant!This is my miracle in a bottle!  I will never be without it.  Thank you for creating such a blessing.</li>
            <li> Very good product , you can see the results in that first  application , I very happy :)</li>
            <li> I got this for summer time to help with the sun and pool damage .</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so soft or shined so much in a long time!  All it took was two drops to coat my hair while it was wet!  After it was dry I received more compliments then I ever have!  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair gooey or sticky or greasy either!  I highly recommend this product and I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! Will be ordering again. If anybody is on the fence about this product don&#x27;t be,try it!!! You will love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this hair serum! My hair is very thick,curly,and color treated and this serum definitely makes my hair feel so smooth and soft and actually makes it look and feel healthy! You really don&#x27;t need a lot literally a pump or two will do the work. I apply it when my hair is damp and either just leave it how it is and let it air dry or I&#x27;ll blow dry it mostly for when I want to straighten my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have any funky smell to it either which is great since no one wants their hair to smell funny. What smell is there goes away once it&#x27;s dry.I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair that when I run a brush through it turns to FRIZZ. I received this product yesterday, this morning after brushing the tangles out I was left with what my grandchildren call the witch hair. I put a little in my hand, rubbed it through my hair and WALA no more witch hair. I absolutely love it. The is no more frizz, and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Cool product.... really soft and seems to work well... my girlfriend likes it as well we both use it!! good deal</li>
            <li> I am in the process of transitioning my hair and this product was recommended by someone that had gone through the process a few years ago.  When the bottle arrived, I immediately opened to smell because I am very sensitive to certain aromas, and was very pleased because it did not have a scent that I could detect.  So far, after using it for three days, I am very happy with how it makes my hair feel.  I put it on in the morning and in the evening my hair still feel moisturized not oily.  I will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because I&#x27;ve only used it 2 times and I&#x27;m not sure how my hair is suppose to react. The1st time I used it, I used like a dime size amount but my hair seemed dry and not soft. The second time I mixed with and smoothing oil my hair did much better&lt;br /&gt;I need to use more but not sure I don&#x27;t want to use too much that my hair is weighed down.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Moroccan Hair Oil Treatment for just over one month now, and I am truly amazed at how fantastic my hair has been looking! Unfortunately, after color treating my hair for so many years, as well as using multiple heating tools on it, my hair had turned into &#x27;NOT-so-lovely-locks&#x27;. So, I had been researching and shopping around for different all-natural products that I could use to repair my frazzled mane, and then I found Cashmere Falls and their Moroccan Hair Oil Treatment, which I received at no cost, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. I have been using the oil treatment on my hair each morning, after I blow dry my hair, and then once at night, before bed. I decided to maximize my potential for positive results and have been using it twice per day, this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Moroccan Hair Oil Treatment works to strengthen and repair all hair types, including those that are dry, bleached, color-treated and damaged, which minus the bleaching, my hair has been through it all. The first thing I noticed, and really love about this oil treatment is the fact that it&#x27;s incredibly &#x27;light&#x27; and doesn&#x27;t make my hair appear or feel &#x27;greasy&#x27; or &#x27;oily&#x27; looking, like many other brands do, which I absolutely can&#x27;t stand. I also really enjoy the odorless scent, and the design of the bottle with it&#x27;s pump-top dispenser, as it measures each pump of serum to the perfect amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just one week of using this product I noticed how soft my hair had become, and after blow drying it, my hair was starting to feel less coarse and &#x27;desert-like&#x27;, and was becoming hydrated! Through the weeks, I noticed that with each passing day, my hair was slowly growing back to health, and I&#x27;ve developed a lovely sheen to my hair! Before I started using this product I would wear my hair up in a bun or ponytail, nearly everyday, because the frizziness of my hair was just so unmanageable, and I had lost a piece of my confidence. However, this Moroccan Hair Oil Treatment has literally given my hair it&#x27;s &#x27;life&#x27; back, and I&#x27;ve been proud  to start styling it again, as it looks absolutely fantastic!en my hair it&#x27;s &#x27;life&#x27; back, and I&#x27;ve been proud  to start styling it again, as it looks absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> Good stuff I love the way it makes my hair feel not too oily snd definitely adds shine.</li>
            <li> Very light. Nice for fine hair</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve tried a variety of different argan oil products and this is by far one of my favorites! It leaves my hair feeling so soft and silky. I will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> This is serious hydration! After just one use my long curly hair went from dry and brittle to soft with no frizz, I&#x27;m so happy!! Not to mention this serum is organic, so that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
            <li> This product does a good job of making my and my daughter&#x27;s hair shiny but so does a couple of other products I&#x27;ve tried. The only difference that I have noticed is that the color is white while the ones I&#x27;ve previously used are clear. It does however smell great but, I have not found any substantial difference in this particular product from the ones that I have purchased in the past or I currently have.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I just use a few pumps and rub my hands together and run my fingers through my damp hair. Works wonderful!! Will be using this everyday.</li>
            <li> Great product, leaves hair super shiny but not greasy. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like it...its not too oily, smells fine.  I think its fabulous. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I loved that this wasn&#x27;t oily.  Many times hair serums are oily, but this wasnt at all!  Its a rainy and humid morning and my hair is not frizzy!!  This morning is the true test and I say it passed!</li>
            <li> Love this.  I used this because I want my hair softer.  My hair has recently been falling out so I need something that will soften it while I comb it and this really helps. You don&#x27;t need a lot so I am happy that I bought this.</li>

            <li> wow i don&#x27;t get the great reviews for this.  i&#x27;d never buy it again.  makes my hair feel no different.</li>
            <li> I was worried that this product would weigh down my hair.  It is very fine and I love big hair, so I use a lot of other products to achieve that.  This stuff makes my hair so soft and silky, I love it!!  It also helps calm the course hairs that occur as your hair gets older (gray or white) and makes my hairstyle smoother.  I will definitely buy this again!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Leaves hair soft and shiny, not heavy or greasy!!</li>
            <li> I got to try this heavenly hair care recently. It does not leave am odor no oily mess like other hair products. I need to have soft and radiant hair I am extremly picky with my hair. I have used Cashmere Falls for about four days now. My hair is soft and healthy and feels luxurious after using it.  I hate getting split ends on my hair but Cashmere Falls says it has been proven to heal split ends. So I know with the length of my hair I had a few I used it in those split ends so far I havent seen them increase to longer split ends. Ill keep a look out on the progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does Cashmere Falls work on your hair it has been designed with anti aging, wrinkle fighting antioxidants to deliver the most gorgeous skin. I did notice my hands have been looking pretty great after I spray a bit on my hands to rub it in my hair. I havent tried it on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is certified organic. Made in the U.S.A. Offers long lasting health. Makes your hair feel heavenly with how soft and radiant it looks and feels. Heals split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They offer a 100% Money Back No Questions Asked. There is no risk so give them a try. Start having your hair feel heavenly with Cashmere Falls. I am truely a big fan of them</li>
            <li> While I like the product, for the type of hair I have, it&#x27;s not the best solution. It makes hair feel soft but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my curls.&lt;br /&gt;However, the bottle is drip-free and I love the product doesn&#x27;t have an odor to compete with fragrance (when I wear it). Most hair products with or without oils have a very strong odor (and not very pleasant, either).</li>
            <li> Product is amazing and by far the best treatment for dry or dead hair !</li>
            <li> This Argan oil is one of the best I have used.  It is lightweight, and has your hair feeling very moist and not weighed down.  I wish it came in a huge jar.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference using this product.</li>
            <li> Love it will buy again</li>
            <li> I apply this to my hair after it&#x27;s dried, I love how smooth and shiny my hair looks without being weighed down or seeming oily.</li>
            <li> Very nice feel in my hair, very light. No need to wash hands after using. Not a sticky product. I have not heat styled with this product yet. Hair still feels as though I have used an iron on it. Sleek, smooth.</li>
            <li> All went smoothly. I like the product enough to have re-ordered.</li>
            <li> This product is seriously amazing! I felt the difference immediately. I have balayage blonde highlights/ombre hair so the ends of my hair are always dry from the blonde and also my everyday straightening. This made my hair and ends feel so soft! Totally exceeded my expectations. I have tried about every hair oil you can try, bedhead, josie maran, morrocan oil, this is the best! Hoping this will help my hair grow faster and healthier.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair instead of conditioner  and  my hair feels so much better. You only use a few drops, rub into the palm of your hand and rub it into your hair. I leave mine in and it isn&#x27;t oily or greasy. I have tried other Argan oils and they have to be rinse out of your hair and your hair is oily afterwards.  Moroccan oil treatment helps soften and makes my hair feel great. I highly recommend  it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have receive this product for free and my opinion is my own.</li>
