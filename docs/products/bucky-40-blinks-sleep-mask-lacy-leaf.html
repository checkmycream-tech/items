            <li>very impressed with it!</li>
            <li>Best.  </li>
            <li>I guess the best way of describing it would be like a bra shape...  </li>
            <li>I sleep with a mask all the time and think this one is one of the best.</li>
            <li>This sleep mask is great, I like the fact that the eye area is lifted to keep your eyes from feeling constricted</li>
            <li>The cupping around the eyes is great because it gives my eyes the ability to breath.  </li>
            <li>This is a great eye mask because it doesn&#x27;t press on your eyes.  </li>
            <li>etc.. this is a great mask.</li>
            <li>Perfect for travel - very light weight.</li>
            <li>love pattern options on best mask out there!</li>
            <li>Even with the bright summer sun it felt like night.  </li>
            <li>molded shape fits my face so perfectly, practically zero light can get through at the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li>I bought this mask and I really loved it.</li>
            <li>I love this mask!</li>
            <li>Love this mask!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing sleep mask.</li>
            <li>Nothing amazing.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable and the cupped eye area is perfect for people who don&#x27;t like any pressure on their eyes but need to block out light.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m a very light sleeper.</li>
            <li>nice and light keeps out the light as well!</li>
            <li>Really love this mask.  </li>
            <li>I love this mask.  </li>
            <li>Both my husband and I wear them and are sleeping much better.</li>
            <li>I love this sleep mask.  </li>
            <li>As you can imagine, this presents many challenges.  </li>
            <li>But what I like most about it is its bra-like shape.  </li>
            <li>It works so well that I plan to buy a bunch and give them out as holiday gifts to my more sleepless friends and relatives.</li>
            <li>love these.</li>
            <li>I love this eye mask.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many sleep masks throughout the years.</li>
            <li>and I love that it doesn&#x27;t put pressure on the eyes.</li>
            <li>I really do love this mask with one exception.</li>
            <li>but the fact that they are so &amp;#34;formed&amp;#34; makes them more noticeable on your face.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that the mask is cupped and doesn&#x27;t smoosh my eyelashes which would probably drive me nuts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many from air ports and brookstone and this one beats all the rest.</li>
            <li>Love these lightweight masks.</li>
            <li>Simply the best, most comfortable eye mask I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>(especially nice for long flights!)</li>
            <li>I can nap during the day with it and am satisfied with the light blocking.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and light without any light leaking through to keep me awake.</li>
            <li>Blocks the light and my eyelashes don&#x27;t rub.</li>
            <li>It blocked out the light.  </li>
            <li>I understand where some people say that some light comes in at the bottom of the mask.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that this mask is comfortable and keeps out the light.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any problem keeping the light out from the tv my husband HAS to watch every night,.</li>
            <li>block out all light.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s light and airy feeling when worn.</li>
            <li>Too much light leaked in around the edges.  </li>
            <li>Keeps the light out and doesn&#x27;t put any pressure on your eyes.</li>
            <li>This eye mask does a great job of blocking out light due to the contours around the nose.</li>
            <li>I wish these were cheaper, but they are fabulous and thus worth it.</li>
            <li>As a person who has challenges with insomnia I can say that I do sleep better and more deeply with the mask.</li>
            <li>I really like the Velcro straps because it makes them easy to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyway, this is great at blocking out most of the excess light and weird glowing things in my hotel rooms</li>
            <li>These really work at night to keep the light out of my eyes.</li>
            <li>Finally a sleep mask that is comfortable and blocks out all of the light!  </li>
            <li>This one is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>very soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Just retired the first mask after 3 years.  </li>
            <li>first sleep mask I could wear because it doesn&#x27;t smash my eyes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Bucky for almost 10 years now, and they have never failed me.</li>
            <li>Will stick to pretty much anything.</li>
            <li>They are soft, really do block out the light, let your face breathe, they do not crush your eyelashes and are still comfortable to open your eyes while wearing.</li>
            <li>The elastic band is strong enough to stay together as I sleep.</li>
            <li>The inside is black, but the outside has an attractive design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even with gaps around my nose, it does really well.</li>
            <li>Also, I really like that the mask does not rest on my eyes.</li>
            <li>Bands add too much pressure on my ears or slide around if I move them away from my ears.</li>
            <li>I get total light blocking without the mask hitting my eyes.</li>
            <li>and they are very dar.</li>
            <li>There is a gap around the upper part of my nose that lets light in....</li>
            <li>Also not made very well for the amount you pay.</li>
            <li>particular one was bought as a requested Christmas gift, and she&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li>The mask doesn&#x27;t irritate the lashes and completely blocks the light as long as it&#x27;s positioned correctly.</li>
            <li>Overall, a quality product with a fun design.</li>
            <li>They block out light well and don&#x27;t irritate my eyes due to the fact they don&#x27;t touch the lid.</li>
            <li>It does block out the light and does not press on my eyes like some other masks do.</li>
            <li>I got a new print.</li>
            <li>Useful on the days when your natural inclination is to lie with your eyes open until you fall asleep.  </li>
            <li>I work nights at the hospital and use it pretty much daily.  </li>
            <li>The foam has a rough surface, and so it was necessary to replace the mask in order to keep comfortable during use.  </li>
            <li>The mask has completely fallen apart, the eye piece has separated into piers, and the rest of the material is detaching.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t completely stay in place when sleeping on side.</li>
            <li>I love not having my eyes forced shut by fabric.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually bought a second pair of these because if I misplace it, I get pretty cranky.  </li>
            <li>(My husband and I live in an apartment and there is an outside light right by our window that randomly blinks on then off throughout the night.)</li>
            <li>What finally did my old one in was the silky covering on the internal portion of the mask separated from the cusion foam insert.  </li>
            <li>Love the eye-pocket type design so that you can open your eyes behind the mask.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and doesn&#x27;t lie tight against the eyes or nose, which has bothered me with other masks.</li>
            <li>Seriously, the &amp;#34;cups&amp;#34; let you open your eye without letting in light.  </li>

            <li> The elastic band in the back is just the right thickness to hold it on, but not so thick you feel it when lying on your back.</li>
            <li> I can actually fully open my eyes with the mask on, and I have relatively long eye lashes.  </li>
            <li> Long trip to Singapore was a breeze.</li>
            <li> There is a Velcro closure and for me, tightening it enough for the mask to lay completely flat on my face with no gaps was so tight it gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> now I can game late at night without worry of the light waking her</li>
            <li> I was using another sleep mask that crushed my eyelashes and caused irritation.</li>
            <li> My whole family is addicted to these.</li>
            <li> regrets....</li>
            <li> I just bought it, but I had to use it on the way home due to an eye irritation.  </li>
            <li> It does not irritate my eyes like other masks do.</li>
            <li> I also share an apartment with an open floor plan with my partner who likes to stay up late.  </li>
            <li> your eyelashes aren&#x27;t plastered down.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too tight on my head.  </li>
            <li> I adjust the mask a little</li>
            <li> I would throw it in the wash once every few months or so.  </li>
            <li> Too stiff if you try to sleep on your side.</li>
            <li> The elastic band eventually begins to lose its elasticity, so you need to slowly tighten the velcro strap over time.  </li>
            <li> It does gap a little long the bottom where my eye and nose areas meet, but it isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> I am a stomach/side sleeper and the mask is a little too structured so it slips up and can be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable, stiff, and the velcro pulls out ridiculous amounts of hair.</li>
            <li> The Velcro strap is a bit annoying at times, but usually isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> It would be impossible to use anything else after using this one.</li>
            <li> Absolutely hate this.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> This sleep mask is great, I like the fact that the eye area is lifted to keep your eyes from feeling constricted</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fully cover my eyes.</li>
            <li> nice and light keeps out the light as well!</li>
            <li> Great! Blocks the light and my eyelashes don&#x27;t rub.</li>
            <li> This is my second Bucky eye mask.  I work nights at the hospital and use it pretty much daily.  Just retired the first mask after 3 years.  The elastic band eventually begins to lose its elasticity, so you need to slowly tighten the velcro strap over time.  What finally did my old one in was the silky covering on the internal portion of the mask separated from the cusion foam insert.  The foam has a rough surface, and so it was necessary to replace the mask in order to keep comfortable during use.  I would throw it in the wash once every few months or so.  Love the eye-pocket type design so that you can open your eyes behind the mask.  Useful on the days when your natural inclination is to lie with your eyes open until you fall asleep.  Really love this mask.  A must for night shift workers.</li>
            <li> I love this mask.  I just bought it, but I had to use it on the way home due to an eye irritation.  I put this on to help with the glare of the sun.  Even with the bright summer sun it felt like night.  It blocked out the light.  The cupping around the eyes is great because it gives my eyes the ability to breath.  I really like the Velcro straps because it makes them easy to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been using this to sleep with the last couple of days and I am still very happy.  I understand where some people say that some light comes in at the bottom of the mask.  I adjust the mask a little and it&#x27;s perfect.  I am no longer kept up by the linking going on and off outside my bedroom window.  (My husband and I live in an apartment and there is an outside light right by our window that randomly blinks on then off throughout the night.)</li>
            <li> I like the rounded eye area which allows the eyes to blink. The strap  I could be slimmer. All in all I like this type of mask.</li>
            <li> Long trip to Singapore was a breeze. The mask doesn&#x27;t irritate the lashes and completely blocks the light as long as it&#x27;s positioned correctly.</li>
            <li> The mask has completely fallen apart, the eye piece has separated into piers, and the rest of the material is detaching. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> first sleep mask I could wear because it doesn&#x27;t smash my eyes and it&#x27;s not too tight on my head.  very soft and comfortable.  Both my husband and I wear them and are sleeping much better.</li>
            <li> I love this sleep mask.  I am a big time insomniac.  I also share an apartment with an open floor plan with my partner who likes to stay up late.  As you can imagine, this presents many challenges.  I&#x27;ve found that this mask is comfortable and keeps out the light.  But what I like most about it is its bra-like shape.  Seriously, the &amp;#34;cups&amp;#34; let you open your eye without letting in light.  I love not having my eyes forced shut by fabric. I&#x27;ve actually bought a second pair of these because if I misplace it, I get pretty cranky.  So now I have a second pair on backup.</li>
            <li> Finally a sleep mask that is comfortable and blocks out all of the light!  Bravo!  As a person who has challenges with insomnia I can say that I do sleep better and more deeply with the mask. It works so well that I plan to buy a bunch and give them out as holiday gifts to my more sleepless friends and relatives.</li>
            <li> I was using another sleep mask that crushed my eyelashes and caused irritation. The Bucky Blinks sleep mask has sculpted eyes so I have never had that problem with this. There is a Velcro closure and for me, tightening it enough for the mask to lay completely flat on my face with no gaps was so tight it gave me a headache. Even with gaps around my nose, it does really well. I can nap during the day with it and am satisfied with the light blocking. I accidentally put this in the washer and it came apart (it makes no claims to survive a washing machine). I replaced it with this same mask in a different pattern. I like all the color and pattern options as well.</li>
            <li> I love this mask! It&#x27;s comfortable and doesn&#x27;t lie tight against the eyes or nose, which has bothered me with other masks. I don&#x27;t have any problem keeping the light out from the tv my husband HAS to watch every night,. (lol!) Can&#x27;t think of any way it can be improved on.</li>
            <li> girlfriend loves these things and I do not mind them either. now I can game late at night without worry of the light waking her</li>
            <li> love these. the bug eyes let you blink and open your eyes. block out all light.</li>
            <li> This eye mask does a great job of blocking out light due to the contours around the nose. Also, I really like that the mask does not rest on my eyes. It does not irritate my eyes like other masks do. The elastic band is strong enough to stay together as I sleep. Overall, a quality product with a fun design.</li>
            <li> Too stiff if you try to sleep on your side.</li>
            <li> My wife loves hers because they don&#x27;t press against her eyelids.</li>
            <li> I love this eye mask.  This is my second one, as I finaly retired the one I purchased about 8 years ago.  I have a baby, so the baby monitor is on my nightstand.  The lights from the monitor and my charging cell phone can keep me up at night, so I use this mask almost every night.  This is a great eye mask because it doesn&#x27;t press on your eyes.  I can actually fully open my eyes with the mask on, and I have relatively long eye lashes.  You definitely won&#x27;t wake up with that blurry eyed feeling that some eye masks give you from pressing on your eyes all night.</li>
            <li> Ok. So I&#x27;m a very light sleeper. I&#x27;ve tried so many sleep masks throughout the years. This one is my favorite by far. Why? Because it&#x27;s light and airy feeling when worn. The elastic band in the back is just the right thickness to hold it on, but not so thick you feel it when lying on your back. Here&#x27;s the best part: it&#x27;s molded you your eyelashes aren&#x27;t plastered down. That&#x27;s right, you can even blink with it on if you have the desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The molded shape fits my face so perfectly, practically zero light can get through at the bridge of my nose. The inside is black, but the outside has an attractive design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for my mom and she loves hers, too!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t completely stay in place when sleeping on side. Bands add too much pressure on my ears or slide around if I move them away from my ears.</li>
            <li> I bought this mask and I really loved it. It is instant darkness and I love that it doesn&#x27;t put pressure on the eyes. I really do love this mask with one exception. I am a stomach/side sleeper and the mask is a little too structured so it slips up and can be uncomfortable. There just isn&#x27;t enough give for how I sleep. For a back sleeper or for airplane trips etc.. this is a great mask.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable, stiff, and the velcro pulls out ridiculous amounts of hair. Absolutely hate this.</li>
            <li> best sleep mask EVER!! My whole family is addicted to these. They are soft, really do block out the light, let your face breathe, they do not crush your eyelashes and are still comfortable to open your eyes while wearing.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing sleep mask. I get total light blocking without the mask hitting my eyes. Comfortable and light without any light leaking through to keep me awake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bucky for almost 10 years now, and they have never failed me. They are comfortable and the cupped eye area is perfect for people who don&#x27;t like any pressure on their eyes but need to block out light.</li>
            <li> These are the best sleep masks i have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;This particular one was bought as a requested Christmas gift, and she&lt;br /&gt;was very impressed with it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a sleep mask. Nothing amazing. The velcro gets stuck in my hair and my pillow. Will stick to pretty much anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using 40 Blinks sleep masks since 2008. They block out light well and don&#x27;t irritate my eyes due to the fact they don&#x27;t touch the lid.</li>
            <li> Too much light leaked in around the edges.  Plus, it looked like a mini-bra on my  eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years.  Best.  Sleep Mask.  EVER!  (especially nice for long flights!)</li>
            <li> I have been buying these for years...I have one by the bed and one for travel...they cut the light(s) while allowing your eyes to do what they do when you sleep...move about!</li>
            <li> love pattern options on best mask out there!</li>
            <li> I buy these masks over and over and over again.  This time i had to re-buy because i left mine at my mother&#x27;s house during my last stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No regrets....I got a new print.</li>
            <li> i like the bra-for-your-eyes look. and they are very dar. but the fact that they are so &amp;#34;formed&amp;#34; makes them more noticeable on your face. I think I&#x27;ll stick with softer material sleep masks in the future.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and though I&#x27;ve never had a problem at home, I feel like I need a sensory deprivation chamber to sleep at some of the hotels I&#x27;m put at. Ugh. Anyway, this is great at blocking out most of the excess light and weird glowing things in my hotel rooms (Why is there always a glowing thing on the ceiling??). It does gap a little long the bottom where my eye and nose areas meet, but it isn&#x27;t too bad. Love the fact that the mask is cupped and doesn&#x27;t smoosh my eyelashes which would probably drive me nuts.I guess the best way of describing it would be like a bra shape...  The Velcro strap is a bit annoying at times, but usually isn&#x27;t too bad. Bottom line, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> All I can say is ...comfy. It does block out the light and does not press on my eyes like some other masks do.</li>
            <li> There is a gap around the upper part of my nose that lets light in....so it defeats the purpose. Also not made very well for the amount you pay.</li>
            <li> Love this mask! I sleep with a mask all the time and think this one is one of the best. I&#x27;ve bought many from air ports and brookstone and this one beats all the rest.</li>
            <li> I wish these were cheaper, but they are fabulous and thus worth it.</li>
            <li> These really work at night to keep the light out of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Love these lightweight masks. Can&#x27;t sleep without them</li>
            <li> Keeps the light out and doesn&#x27;t put any pressure on your eyes. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Simply the best, most comfortable eye mask I have ever owned. Perfect for travel - very light weight. It would be impossible to use anything else after using this one.</li>
