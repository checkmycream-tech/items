            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy MORE.</li>
            <li>Looks like PERFECT human hair.</li>
            <li>The best cheap hair extensions you can get only thing is I recommend u get two if u have thicker hair</li>
            <li>These clip-ins were very full.</li>
            <li>They tangle easily but again I don&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li>but I assume it could take light</li>
            <li>Hair is good quality and looks natural.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these extensions and the seller!!!!</li>
            <li>First of all I&#x27;d like to say is that my order came in 3 days after it was placed.. 7 days before the estimated delivery date!!</li>
            <li>Excited to use for my wedding reception.</li>
            <li>for that special event to wear.</li>
            <li>This is not bad for the price.  </li>
            <li>, it has highlights, it&#x27;s super full....</li>
            <li>The hair is so real, they clip in nicely and blend very well.</li>
            <li>They came very quick (in 2 days) and the packaging was very neat and prof, looking.</li>
            <li>The item came very quickly, which was a plus, however, the hair is very course.</li>
            <li>so pretty you can tell this isn&#x27;t my hair!</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing hair extensions and after reading the reviews and of course seeing the price I couldn&#x27;t resist!</li>
            <li>full set of hair but the clips fell apart the first time i wore the hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all the price; even if these extensions sucked they would be worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the hair doesn&#x27;t curl nicely, it just gets very frizzy, and it does not match nor blend with my natural hair.</li>
            <li>i liked the fact that its texture and feel is like human hair but</li>
            <li>not the right color</li>
            <li>I have dark hair not black but very close, I decided to go with the darkest brown and it works perfect.</li>
            <li>I really like the color and its full</li>
            <li>It worked out perfect, I order dark brown but looked light black, I made it work but</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle, and even if it does end up tangles, it brushes out very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Not a lot of fly aways, which are usually a dead giveaway for synthetics.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, it shipped super fast.</li>
            <li>I would buy more than just one just because I have thick abundant hair.</li>
            <li>But other wise it&#x27;s great pretty thick for the price.</li>
            <li>it looke very real.</li>
            <li>Start from tip and work your way up when brushing/combing, never start from the top or middle.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It is pretty</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ll list it first because I know that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re looking for) is</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Onedor!</li>
            <li>I opened the package &amp; sure enough the hair was darkest</li>
            <li>My actual hair is medium length and super fine.</li>
            <li>This is the first extensions I have ever gotten</li>
            <li>I wanted a quick alternative option for a fuller look once in a while, I tend to lose volume real quick if my hair is down.</li>
            <li>The dark brown is practically black unless you are in a super duper bright light.</li>
            <li>and I love the loose curls.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter liked it for a little while.  </li>
            <li>have a huge head and it was still enough to go from one ear to the other.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Look and feel real.</li>
            <li>I cant blend this real well in my hair caus itts</li>
            <li>however, really wanted to go a shade darker</li>
            <li>stuff:&lt;br /&gt;it feels real.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought so much synthetic hair</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The shipping was much faster than I thought it would be also.</li>
            <li>How much hair does a person need?</li>
            <li>I bought 2 of these hair pieces on 3/12/2015 &amp; it received them on 3/16/2015 which was fast delivery</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like my purchase at all.</li>
            <li>so, goal accomplished haha).</li>
            <li>but very is reliable</li>
            <li>Thick and good quality.</li>
            <li>Great for the price, seriously!</li>
            <li>but you need to know that the long curly thing gets tangled easy if you move a lot.</li>
            <li>The only negatives and why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars would be that it is on the shiny side, one of the clips came loose (but could easily be sewn back) and the extension gets tangled VERY easily.</li>
            <li>but if you use too much and too high heat on them it will burn them and they will get ratty looking.</li>
            <li>So glad that I made this purchase, it goes so well with my hair color (dark brown)</li>
            <li>Very soft, very.</li>
            <li>Overall these kinds of extensions are awesome for people like me and my friend who cannot justify spending $300 on human hair extensions only to have to repurchase in a few months or so.</li>
            <li>ah this is pretty but its not enough to go the whole way around the hair</li>
            <li>I thought I would need two but one was enough, it looks super natural...</li>
            <li>Slightly darker and tangles easily</li>
            <li>If you cannot afford human hair or want to try out extensions without the crazy prices and have hair that is a bob or longer, these would be awesome!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s synthetic, but overall better than expected for the price</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>you are going for something fun and different this is a good way to try before you buy expensive.</li>
            <li>Even coarse hair can&#x27;t be much thicker than this or it would be a horse&#x27;s tail!</li>
            <li>Clips break off so easy and they&#x27;re way too heavy for your head.</li>
            <li>my hair is an extremely short pixie (2 inches long at most) and it would need seperate pieces to blend properly</li>
            <li>but I wish it were longer around for us who have a lot of hair and not a REAL small head!</li>
            <li>As far as synthetic hair goes, I think I found my favorite!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this is the only one that has ever felt real to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel real and it&#x27;s not soft.</li>
            <li>I do already own and use Real Remy Hair extensions that cost crazy  💲💰💲 ...</li>
            <li>I bought two of them because I didn&#x27;t know if the dark brown or the black would be appropriate.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the curls &amp;#34;gravitate&amp;#34; back into a few huge tumblers instead of staying &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I kept them and used them anyway, but it was noticeably different than my natural hair.</li>
            <li>Love it, came in less than a week!!!!</li>
            <li>super thick hair and one was enough for me</li>

            <li> so, goal accomplished haha).</li>
            <li> but very is reliable</li>
            <li> Thick and good quality.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, seriously!</li>
            <li> but you need to know that the long curly thing gets tangled easy if you move a lot.</li>
            <li> The only negatives and why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars would be that it is on the shiny side, one of the clips came loose (but could easily be sewn back) and the extension gets tangled VERY easily.</li>
            <li> but if you use too much and too high heat on them it will burn them and they will get ratty looking.</li>
            <li> So glad that I made this purchase, it goes so well with my hair color (dark brown)</li>
            <li> Very soft, very.</li>
            <li> Overall these kinds of extensions are awesome for people like me and my friend who cannot justify spending $300 on human hair extensions only to have to repurchase in a few months or so.</li>
            <li> ah this is pretty but its not enough to go the whole way around the hair</li>
            <li> I thought I would need two but one was enough, it looks super natural...</li>
            <li> Slightly darker and tangles easily</li>
            <li> If you cannot afford human hair or want to try out extensions without the crazy prices and have hair that is a bob or longer, these would be awesome!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s synthetic, but overall better than expected for the price</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> you are going for something fun and different this is a good way to try before you buy expensive.</li>
            <li> Even coarse hair can&#x27;t be much thicker than this or it would be a horse&#x27;s tail!</li>
            <li> Clips break off so easy and they&#x27;re way too heavy for your head.</li>
            <li> my hair is an extremely short pixie (2 inches long at most) and it would need seperate pieces to blend properly</li>
            <li> but I wish it were longer around for us who have a lot of hair and not a REAL small head!</li>
            <li> As far as synthetic hair goes, I think I found my favorite!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this is the only one that has ever felt real to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel real and it&#x27;s not soft.</li>
            <li> I do already own and use Real Remy Hair extensions that cost crazy  💲💰💲 ...</li>
            <li> I bought two of them because I didn&#x27;t know if the dark brown or the black would be appropriate.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the curls &amp;#34;gravitate&amp;#34; back into a few huge tumblers instead of staying &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I kept them and used them anyway, but it was noticeably different than my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Love it, came in less than a week!!!!</li>
            <li> super thick hair and one was enough for me</li>
            <li> They are shiny but that&#x27;s not a major problem for me.</li>
            <li> These kinds are heavier than seperate piece extensions so they can give you a headache if you were to wear them for a long time or to bed, so I would carry one of those big clips in your purse or in your car to avoid mid-day migranes if you have a long day ahead.</li>
            <li> will definitely continue to wear these for costuming/cosplay purposes, but I would never recommend them if you want natural, discrete everyday extensions.</li>
            <li> I do recommend buying two packs unless ur hair is super thin.</li>
            <li> If I wanted it to be totally discrete, I&#x27;d have to dye my hair to match one of the limited color options</li>
            <li> I got the 20&#x27;&#x27; inches long, the ends do get tangle</li>
            <li> , this is a quick and simple way to get the effect of longer hair, and I wouldn&#x27;t steer you wrong on this one</li>
            <li> This is VERY long.</li>
            <li> Wait till they dry to detangle them.</li>
            <li> #20 which is essentially a brown black, black brown, or darkest brown -- sometimes called soft black.</li>
            <li> NEVER brush them wet...</li>
            <li> It was a little long for my overall physique, so I just clipped it a little bit.</li>
            <li> my fiend is wanting some now due to how goof they look</li>
            <li> Yes, it is synthetic but compared te the other options out there</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m throwing all my other wigs out tomorrow.</li>
            <li> One piece is the usual thickness of human hair.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s usually an issue of monitor settings) but the actual product that arrived was supposed to be, and is labeled as, #2 dark brown.</li>
            <li> This looks so much like human hair that it&#x27;s scary!</li>
            <li> only complaint</li>
            <li> I just wish I had bought 2 because it is not really enough hair to look thick.</li>
            <li> but I have a big head and a lot of thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and this extention was black.</li>
            <li> the color is slightly darker than what it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Like, really really black.</li>
            <li> I was not very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> did notice the curls tangle a little and when you try to brush them out, a few hairs fall out with</li>
            <li> I hope these tips and this review helps anyone experiencing any trouble with synthetic extensions.</li>
            <li> If you watch a few youtube tutorials you can get rid of that synthetic shine.</li>
            <li> What I least expected.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the colors they offer are limited.</li>
            <li> Hard to style.</li>
            <li> its so thick and not shiny at all</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the shine will slowly go away with time and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No one wants to be the chick with a bad weave!</li>
            <li> Im going to  pull my hair uptop and just use this without the blending of my hair and maybe if your hair is really thick get 2 as this says 3 fourths of a set!</li>
            <li> sadly one of the clips was broken &#x27;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to grow it out past my shoulders without getting split ends.</li>
            <li> Sorry Onedor!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s insane.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Hair is good quality and looks natural. I should have actually measured where the 20&amp;#34; would fall though! This is VERY long.</li>
            <li> I bought this not knowing what to expect and I absolutely loved it. super thick hair and one was enough for me but I did buy two now I have a back up which is awesome!</li>
            <li> This is not bad for the price.  I just wish I had bought 2 because it is not really enough hair to look thick.</li>
            <li> Simply beautiful for synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Clips break off so easy and they&#x27;re way too heavy for your head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering my second pair! They are gorgeous. Look and feel real. It looks great with one weft but I&#x27;m ordering another one jut because I wang more volume. They are really great</li>
            <li> Amazing piece! Excited to use for my wedding reception. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Came way faster then projected and great product!</li>
            <li> I accidently ordered this product, I meant to order the 7pc set from this seller b/c my hair is an extremely short pixie (2 inches long at most) and it would need seperate pieces to blend properly so I ordered those as well and will be reviewing those too. They came very quick (in 2 days) and the packaging was very neat and prof, looking. The hair is synthetic, so please keep in mind that you CANNOT dye or perm these. They do curl and straighten but if you use too much and too high heat on them it will burn them and they will get ratty looking. If you cannot afford human hair or want to try out extensions without the crazy prices and have hair that is a bob or longer, these would be awesome! If you have a pixie, I would advise ordering this company&#x27;s 7pc set instead. If they start getting ratty, go on youtube and search &amp;#34;revive synthetic weave&amp;#34; or try curling them to revive them. NEVER brush them wet... EVER. Wait till they dry to detangle them. Start from tip and work your way up when brushing/combing, never start from the top or middle. I would advise buying an extension hanger or storing them in a silk/silky feeling shirt or pillow case to keep from tangling. These kinds are heavier than seperate piece extensions so they can give you a headache if you were to wear them for a long time or to bed, so I would carry one of those big clips in your purse or in your car to avoid mid-day migranes if you have a long day ahead. I ended up giving these to a friend since I couldn&#x27;t wear them and since she has headed my advice she hasn&#x27;t had any problem. I would also advise carrying a brush with you for tangles. Overall these kinds of extensions are awesome for people like me and my friend who cannot justify spending $300 on human hair extensions only to have to repurchase in a few months or so. I hope these tips and this review helps anyone experiencing any trouble with synthetic extensions.</li>
            <li> So glad that I made this purchase, it goes so well with my hair color (dark brown) and it blends in well you would never know that they were synthetic extenions... my fiend is wanting some now due to how goof they look</li>
            <li> This hair feels great</li>
            <li> did not like the hair</li>
            <li> Absolutely satisfied with this product!!! I wanted a quick alternative option for a fuller look once in a while, I tend to lose volume real quick if my hair is down. It was a little long for my overall physique, so I just clipped it a little bit. I bought two of them because I didn&#x27;t know if the dark brown or the black would be appropriate. The dark brown is practically black unless you are in a super duper bright light. Either one works for my hair. Yes, it is synthetic but compared te the other options out there, this is a quick and simple way to get the effect of longer hair, and I wouldn&#x27;t steer you wrong on this one ;) No one wants to be the chick with a bad weave!</li>
            <li> ah this is pretty but its not enough to go the whole way around the hair so I should order another! It is pretty but you need to know that the long curly thing gets tangled easy if you move a lot. I noticed it started to do that after I wore it a day but hey they are do that I think. I really like the color and its full but I have a big head and a lot of thick wavy hair sooooooooo I cant blend this real well in my hair caus itts so pretty you can tell this isn&#x27;t my hair! Im going to  pull my hair uptop and just use this without the blending of my hair and maybe if your hair is really thick get 2 as this says 3 fourths of a set! Its shiny and I would re order but I wish it were longer around for us who have a lot of hair and not a REAL small head!</li>
            <li> Thick and good quality. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> full set of hair but the clips fell apart the first time i wore the hair</li>
            <li> Matches my hair color perfectly and it is comfortable to wear. Blends with my own hair nicely.</li>
            <li> I love this hair its so thick and not shiny at all it looke very real. Will be buying from again</li>
            <li> Wow! As far as synthetic hair goes, I think I found my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;First of all the price; even if these extensions sucked they would be worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have (I&#x27;ll list it first because I know that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re looking for) is the color is slightly darker than what it&#x27;s supposed to be. I&#x27;m not saying the picture isn&#x27;t correct (that&#x27;s usually an issue of monitor settings) but the actual product that arrived was supposed to be, and is labeled as, #2 dark brown. However it is very obviously a 1b. In the brightest sunlight you might see a bit of brown, but do not buy this if  you&#x27;re looking for #2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I however, really wanted to go a shade darker so I am happy with my product, and dyed my hair to match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff:&lt;br /&gt;it feels real. I&#x27;ve bought so much synthetic hair and this is the only one that has ever felt real to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t too shiny, it looks like healthy hair but it isn&#x27;t shiny.&lt;br /&gt;The weft and clips are very secure and well made.&lt;br /&gt;I have a huge head and it was still enough to go from one ear to the other.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle, and even if it does end up tangles, it brushes out very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Not a lot of fly aways, which are usually a dead giveaway for synthetics.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used heat on it and I don&#x27;t plan to, but I assume it could take light heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely saving this seller!&lt;br /&gt;Also, it shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> great for the price. Fast shipping. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good to play with. My granddaughter liked it for a little while.  Hard to style.</li>
            <li> It worked out perfect, I order dark brown but looked light black, I made it work but&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> The item came very quickly, which was a plus, however, the hair is very course. It doesn&#x27;t feel real and it&#x27;s not soft. That being said, the clips were very nice and secure and the piece went on well and blended nice, the color was nice also...&lt;br /&gt;I did notice the curls tangle a little and when you try to brush them out, a few hairs fall out with it.&lt;br /&gt;If you are going for something fun and different this is a good way to try before you buy expensive.</li>
            <li> I was not very pleased with this. I have dark brown hair and this extention was black. Like, really really black. Also, the hair doesn&#x27;t curl nicely, it just gets very frizzy, and it does not match nor blend with my natural hair.</li>
            <li> AMAZING, AMAZING ,AMAZING...... I swear I got it within two days....the moment I took it out of the beautiful plastic bag, was just a great surprise...I got the darkest Brown, for me was the perfect match, it has highlights, it&#x27;s super full....I thought I would need two but one was enough, it looks super natural...I got the 20&#x27;&#x27; inches long, the ends do get tangle so I trimmed it a bit &amp;#34;problem solved&amp;#34; sadly one of the clips was broken &#x27;They took care of it immediately, i would give it 100 stars if I could, and should anything happen to it &amp;#34;I plan to wear it A LOT&amp;#34;,  I would buy it again and again...i am  more than satisfy...not to mention the price, it&#x27;s just perfect....I LOOOOOOOOVE IT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> For some reason I didn&#x27;t get the  package on the delivered promised time, but the seller was great and took care of it. I would buy more than just one just because I have thick abundant hair. I liked the product, the price and the way the seller handled things so I&#x27;ll be buying again. I&#x27;ll be buying the separate clip extensions next.</li>
            <li> Much better than anticipated.</li>
            <li> Looks dorky and once the curls r touched. They just end up nappy and unmanageable</li>
            <li> The best cheap hair extensions you can get only thing is I recommend u get two if u have thicker hair doesn&#x27;t quite go all the way around. But other wise it&#x27;s great pretty thick for the price. Definitely recommend  this product.</li>
            <li> It says 5 clips but they are all connected. It&#x27;s harder to use and make it look natural.</li>
            <li> Seriously love these! They are worth your money for sure!!! The best extensions I&#x27;ve ever had and I have Virgin Remy! These are way better!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these extensions in blonde. For $10.99 you can&#x27;t beat it! The hair is so real, they clip in nicely and blend very well. I have got so many compliments on them it&#x27;s insane. The shipping was much faster than I thought it would be also. I highly recommend these extensions and the seller!!!!</li>
            <li> This is seriously better than my &amp;#34;virgin Remy hair&amp;#34;.  The only thing is that the curls &amp;#34;gravitate&amp;#34; back into a few huge tumblers instead of staying &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34;.  I have even pulled my hair up into a pony tail and you couldn&#x27;t see the clips!  Fast shipping too!  Great for the price, seriously!</li>
            <li> i liked the fact that its texture and feel is like human hair but only synthetic&lt;br /&gt;still its a good deal. cant beat the price. i would suggest two packs for fuller hair.&lt;br /&gt;good for that special event to wear. great job !</li>
            <li> First of all I&#x27;d like to say is that my order came in 3 days after it was placed.. 7 days before the estimated delivery date!! That was awesome! and second... I LOVE my extensions!!! This was my first time purchasing hair extensions and after reading the reviews and of course seeing the price I couldn&#x27;t resist! So i thought what the heck.. These extensions are AMAZING! They look and feel like the real thing,soft and gorgeous! I even recommended them to my sister who&#x27;s always purchasing her extensions for $60 and up! She is now looking in to purchasing the same ones! I will be purchasing again soon!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied!! I almost don&#x27;t want to share because I don&#x27;t want this to run out. I have dark hair not black but very close, I decided to go with the darkest brown and it works perfect. I do already own and use Real Remy Hair extensions that cost crazy  💲💰💲 ... These do work very similar. They are shiny but that&#x27;s not a major problem for me. They tangle easily but again I don&#x27;t care.  I do recommend buying two packs unless ur hair is super thin. I will be reordering!!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST WIG I HAVE EVER SEEN/TOUCHED/HANDLED. EVER. This looks so much like human hair that it&#x27;s scary! I love it. I&#x27;m going to buy MORE. I have a seven piece set on the way from Onedor and now I&#x27;m NEVER going to order from another company again! In fact, I&#x27;m throwing all my other wigs out tomorrow. This is THAT NICE. Matches my hair dyed Revlon Colorsilk #20 which is essentially a brown black, black brown, or darkest brown -- sometimes called soft black. IT&#x27;S THAT PERFECT. Some reviews say that one is not enough. How much hair does a person need? One piece is the usual thickness of human hair. Even coarse hair can&#x27;t be much thicker than this or it would be a horse&#x27;s tail! Very soft, very. Looks like PERFECT human hair. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for about an hour, running around the house to feel the weight out, and it&#x27;s not even tangling! I&#x27;m never purchasing another wig from another company ever again. My hair is growing out from a platinum faux hawk. This is great! Thanks, Onedor!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these hair pieces on 3/12/2015 &amp; it received them on 3/16/2015 which was fast delivery &amp; i&#x27;m grateful for that. I opened the package &amp; sure enough the hair was darkest brown #2, but the hair is the cheapest synthetic hair there is, just like baby doll hair when u comb the curls out it gets nappy. I really didn&#x27;t like my purchase at all. Sorry Onedor!</li>
            <li> These clip-ins were very full. I loved the fullness. I loved the length and the amount of hair they give you. Unfortunately, the colors they offer are limited. I ordered a brown I normally wear, it was too dark, and I exchanged them (with ease by the way. great service!) I got a lighter brown but it still wasn&#x27;t the correct brown. I kept them and used them anyway, but it was noticeably different than my natural hair. I had to do some really good blending. If I wanted it to be totally discrete, I&#x27;d have to dye my hair to match one of the limited color options they offer.&lt;br /&gt;The shine of the extensions is quite synthetic looking. It&#x27;s clearly not human hair. If you watch a few youtube tutorials you can get rid of that synthetic shine. Otherwise, the shine will slowly go away with time and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to wear these for costuming/cosplay purposes, but I would never recommend them if you want natural, discrete everyday extensions.</li>
            <li> What I least expected.</li>
            <li> Love it, came in less than a week!!!! About to buy another pack doesn&#x27;t even feel like synthetic hair</li>
            <li> Got this for my Las Vegas trip. My actual hair is medium length and super fine. It&#x27;s impossible to grow it out past my shoulders without getting split ends. This is the first extensions I have ever gotten and I love how it looks! It adds volume where you put it and I love the loose curls. The only negatives and why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars would be that it is on the shiny side, one of the clips came loose (but could easily be sewn back) and the extension gets tangled VERY easily. Overall though I did get A LOT of compliments (especially from the guys so, goal accomplished haha). Plus for how cheap this thing is, I am impressed!</li>
            <li> not the right color but very is reliable</li>
            <li> Slightly darker and tangles easily - probably bc it&#x27;s synthetic, but overall better than expected for the price</li>
    </ol>
