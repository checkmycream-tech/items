            <li>It was like magic.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>That balance works better on my frizz prone curly hair, in a humid climate.</li>
            <li>I used this in the shower right after I used the L&#x27;oreal Oleo Therapy shampoo (which I also love!)</li>
            <li>The fragrance smells pretty nice to me, but I&#x27;m not picky when it comes to scents like most people.</li>
            <li>Truly, this is a fantastic product which reduces the need for more products on your hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product after the first use and love it more after the second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for an cheap alternative for daily use.</li>
            <li>My very-dry, damaged, wiry hair came out silky, smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>my hair felt SOOOO soft and smooth and healthy after just one use!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for dry hair.</li>
            <li>I will keep using this product once or twice a week to get full results.</li>
            <li>Double good.</li>
            <li>I have SUPER dry/dyed hair.</li>
            <li>Soft silky smooth!  </li>
            <li>My hair got pretty dry, and to top that off, I had my swimming class today!</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait awhile after using this product before I wrote a review since first impressions aren&#x27;t always correct.</li>
            <li>One treatment – ONE – and my hair instantly felt and looked better.</li>
            <li>this deep conditioner literally straightened some of the most nappiest areas of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure to only do the length of your hair and not the scalp to avoid oiliness.</li>
            <li>leaves the hair soft and smooth, works well.</li>
            <li>and she kept commenting on how healthy my hair looked - especially after being dyed so much.</li>
            <li>Made my fine blonde hair more dry!</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair especially soft.</li>
            <li>So of course the bleach was very damaging.</li>
            <li>If you use other protein, simply rinse it out and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>I had color treated my hair just two months after my last color treatment (because I’m trying to lighten my dark hair in stages) and was worried because my ends seemed drier and more straw-like despite my overnight serum treatment, my special sulfate-free shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>You can also mix it with a protein treatment for highly damaged hair, however protein shouldn&#x27;t be used too often or it will cause breakage.</li>
            <li>I put it on towel dried hair (which is more porous</li>
            <li>I always have to be careful because my hair gets greasy very easily, but I&#x27;ve found that (as long as I don&#x27;t use it on my bangs and scalp)</li>
            <li>This is my new Holy-Grail find.</li>
            <li>I bleached and dyed my own hair - ombré style from very dark brown hair to a medium-light ash blonde.</li>
            <li>The Evercreme and Total Repair Extreme lines both work and smell much better.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like it</li>
            <li>this along with the shampoo completely made a difference in the look and feel of my hair.  </li>
            <li>so it sucks in more moisture.)</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the Kerastase Oleo product (made my L&#x27;Oreal Paris Professional line).</li>
            <li>Nice thick creamy deep conditioner that I use each time I shampoo.</li>
            <li>Great alternative to the insanely expensive Kerastase!</li>
            <li>I actually prefer the tube version, which isn&#x27;t considered &#x27;deep&#x27; conditioning, has less glycerin &amp; more oil.</li>
            <li>This conditioner moisturizes my hair like no other ever has!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always trying new hair products because my hair is always a hot mess, but I think I&#x27;ll be sticking with this one for awhile.</li>
            <li>and I like to mix it with a couple other things, so for those of you that are interested</li>
            <li>It does condition pretty well, but not as well as some other L&#x27;Oreal masques.</li>
            <li>I thought it seemed kind of expensive at $8 for such a small amount, but you don&#x27;t really need that much to fully coat your hair, so</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel as if it is doing some major work that regular conditioner can&#x27;t do with the same time and consistency.</li>
            <li>I have extra thirsty dry hair and this make it soft.</li>

            <li> literally had the worst dry hair due to bleaching from a recent balayage, traveling in a plane 12+ hours a week, having to wash my hair in hard Canadian water and because of the crazy east coast winter.  </li>
            <li> It smells like something dirty or mouldy, and if you get your hair wet again</li>

            <li> Just to start off, I have long hair to around the middle of my back. It&#x27;s medium thickness and colored about every 2 months. You can imagine that sometimes my hair feels dry from all the dying, but I&#x27;m always using conditioner to combat that. Still, it never feels like I&#x27;m doing any lasting repair with regular conditioner.    I wanted to wait awhile after using this product before I wrote a review since first impressions aren&#x27;t always correct. It&#x27;s been about two weeks since I started using it and I have definitely noticed a difference. My hair looks glossy and has a nice shine, which it has NEVER had before. I always have to be careful because my hair gets greasy very easily, but I&#x27;ve found that (as long as I don&#x27;t use it on my bangs and scalp) this mask never makes my hair feel greasy, which is awesome because well... we all know how terrible greasy hair is, lol.    I fully wash my hair every other day (just bangs on off days) and I have replaced using regular conditioner with this. I thought it seemed kind of expensive at $8 for such a small amount, but you don&#x27;t really need that much to fully coat your hair, so my guess would be that this is going to last me about 6 months. Possibly longer.    Overall I really like it and it smells good too. I&#x27;m guessing the person that said it smelled like mold got one that was defective or tampered with, because mine is not like that at all. I&#x27;m always trying new hair products because my hair is always a hot mess, but I think I&#x27;ll be sticking with this one for awhile. My hair looks and feels significantly less dry and much healthier than before I started using this.</li>
            <li> Bought this at Target yesterday because over the weekend I bleached my hair. My hair got pretty dry, and to top that off, I had my swimming class today! I wear a cap, but the chlorine water still gets into your hair. This product is thick and creamy with a slight orange color. The fragrance smells pretty nice to me, but I&#x27;m not picky when it comes to scents like most people. I used this in the shower right after I used the L&#x27;oreal Oleo Therapy shampoo (which I also love!) and oh my goodness it instantly made my hair feel like silk! Soft silky smooth!  I will keep using this product once or twice a week to get full results.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, works well. Leaves my hair especially soft.</li>
            <li> I had color treated my hair just two months after my last color treatment (because I’m trying to lighten my dark hair in stages) and was worried because my ends seemed drier and more straw-like despite my overnight serum treatment, my special sulfate-free shampoo &amp; conditioner. I’m so glad I found this product. One treatment – ONE – and my hair instantly felt and looked better. It brought back the silkiness, the shine, and the moisture. I am now using this every day. Also, I usually put on some sort of oil on my damp hair and let it airdry that way to keep away the frizzies. I do not need to do that when I use this conditioner. Truly, this is a fantastic product which reduces the need for more products on your hair. Love the smell, love the ultra emollient texture, and especially love the results!</li>
            <li> This is nice but I&#x27;m not blown away by it. It&#x27;s basically a deep conditioner that isn&#x27;t deep enough. I don&#x27;t feel as if it is doing some major work that regular conditioner can&#x27;t do with the same time and consistency.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness.  I love this product after the first use and love it more after the second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally had the worst dry hair due to bleaching from a recent balayage, traveling in a plane 12+ hours a week, having to wash my hair in hard Canadian water and because of the crazy east coast winter.  this along with the shampoo completely made a difference in the look and feel of my hair.  you can&#x27;t tell that its even damaged and I am my own worst critique.  this deep conditioner literally straightened some of the most nappiest areas of my hair.  i love love love love this product!</li>
            <li> I recently color stripped my hair and it was FRIED! I use this as a deep conditioner and I like to mix it with a couple other things, so for those of you that are interested, here&#x27;s the jist of it. I put it on towel dried hair (which is more porous so it sucks in more moisture.) I mix it with olive oil or coconut oil. You can also mix it with a protein treatment for highly damaged hair, however protein shouldn&#x27;t be used too often or it will cause breakage. You can mix it with eggs, protein filler, keratin, etc. I like to leave it on overnight wrapped in a plastic cap or bag. (Obviously if you use eggs don&#x27;t leave it on all night and be sure to rinse with cold water. Also shampoo after.) If you use other protein, simply rinse it out and you&#x27;re good to go. Just make sure to only do the length of your hair and not the scalp to avoid oiliness. You can also use it on the scalp if you plan on washing your hair after. This stuff is great for dry hair.</li>
            <li> Good. Good. Double good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this. Hair is not smooth enough than other conditioners.</li>
            <li> I bleached and dyed my own hair - ombré style from very dark brown hair to a medium-light ash blonde. So of course the bleach was very damaging. I was rinsing out the dye and felt how tangled up it was from being dry. Then I moved onto this hair mask and IMMEDIATELY I could run my fingers through my hair. It was like magic. I left it on for about 3 minutes then rinsed it and it felt amaaaazing. The next day I went to my hair colorist to get some extra highlights and she kept commenting on how healthy my hair looked - especially after being dyed so much. Needless to say, this mask is probably going to save my hair from my obsessive coloring phase that I&#x27;m going through :)</li>
            <li> Smells delicious! Nice thick creamy deep conditioner that I use each time I shampoo. I have extra thirsty dry hair and this make it soft. Great for an cheap alternative for daily use. It says deep conditioner, but again my hair is extra dry.</li>
            <li> i have extremely dry damaged hair and have tried just about everything. nothing worked for me then i tried this and will be using it from here on out. my hair felt SOOOO soft and smooth and healthy after just one use!</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected. Love it. Works great.</li>
            <li> Made my fine blonde hair more dry! Threw it out.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer the tube version, which isn&#x27;t considered &#x27;deep&#x27; conditioning, has less glycerin &amp; more oil. That balance works better on my frizz prone curly hair, in a humid climate.</li>
            <li> leaves the hair soft and smooth, works well.</li>
            <li> This is my new Holy-Grail find. It reminds me of the Kerastase Oleo product (made my L&#x27;Oreal Paris Professional line). My very-dry, damaged, wiry hair came out silky, smooth and shiny. Great price. I will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> This masque smells gross and the scent is lingering and does not go away throughout the day. It smells like something dirty or mouldy, and if you get your hair wet again or it is humid, it only gets stronger. It does condition pretty well, but not as well as some other L&#x27;Oreal masques. The Evercreme and Total Repair Extreme lines both work and smell much better.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to the insanely expensive Kerastase!</li>
            <li> This stuff is gold to my hair! I have SUPER dry/dyed hair. This conditioner moisturizes my hair like no other ever has! Makes it shiny too. It&#x27;s truly a miracle in a jar for dry, overprocessed hair. You need moisture, this will do it!</li>
