            <li>: I changed my rating to two stars, because while the color was perfect at first, It continued to leak out every day for months, ruining clothes, towels, and pillow cases.</li>
            <li>who knows, you might fall in love with their products like I did and get hooked!</li>
            <li>Initially I loved the color, a very bright beautiful red.  </li>
            <li>the color looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I follwed the instructions on the pouch (added warm water and let set for an hour)</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, excellent product.</li>
            <li>This a wonderful, fine powder that mixes well with hot water.  </li>
            <li>Many people experienced the bleeding and said it stopped pretty quick on its own or could be stopped with a good shampoo&#x27;ing, either way without affecting the color.</li>
            <li>It is true to the color charts and just gorgeous.</li>
            <li>As of today, I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a better product (not that I am looking to replace it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still in love with this brand and will continue purchasing it.product (not that I am looking to replace it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/23/12:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still in love with this brand and will continue purchasing it.</li>
            <li>and now I get to spend even more money stripping and fixing my hair.</li>
            <li>I Have tried a LOT of Henna and this is my favorite for beard reddening.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>, I am sure it was a mistake but do not use it if the packet is not stamped with a color, mine was not.</li>
            <li>We love the idea of playing in the mud</li>
            <li>This henna does work as claimed and it has a much more tolerable odor to me than Ancient Sunrise.</li>
            <li>My hair look so shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dye.</li>
            <li>Nothing about my strand test could have prepared me for my beautiful new hair color.</li>
            <li>It still is a bright, bright red shade when I apply it.</li>
            <li>I used Henna Hut &amp;#34;Red&amp;#34; for the first time one week ago, and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results!</li>
            <li>I loved the natural, more orangey henna sold by Harvest Moon</li>
            <li>This come out a beautiful shade of red on my daughters</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really bizarre.</li>
            <li>You have to remember to shampoo your hair twice with a sulfate free shampoo before using henna, and again 24 hours after application.</li>
            <li>Light brown chemically dyed hair, about 18 inches in length.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the color when it first came out the first time I did it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a deep beautiful, bright red.  </li>
            <li>I strand tested first (very, very important) and then went ahead with it.</li>
            <li>am still using this product and I am still as in love with it as the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Note: This is my original review written about 2 days after I henna&#x27;ed.</li>
            <li>I really love this product since the first time I used.</li>
            <li>They was very good at my returning a few.</li>
            <li>After I waited and rinsed my hair, I discovered that it wasn&#x27;t bright red</li>
            <li>I like keeping a bright red hue to my hair.</li>
            <li>but I just made sure to condition it with apple cider vinegar along with my normal chemical free shampoo bar.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have always loved red hair.</li>
            <li>I did some research and found a couple internet forums full of people who had used this product.</li>
            <li>Really, I couldn&#x27;t be more upset.</li>
            <li>Really, I couldn&#x27;t be more upset.</li>
            <li>It was almost TOO red, but I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many red henna hair dyes and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Luckily today, I do not smell like a pack of gum.</li>
            <li>it still bleeds tremendously, plus the color has faded a lot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the past I had used pure henna which is great but requires more preparation and longer time in hair.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, this is the first henna product I choose, because it has me hooked!  </li>
            <li>My hair was light brown, and turned into a red maroon that shines bright red in the light.</li>
            <li>I loved my red hair so much that I cried, literately.</li>
            <li>It turned out a beautiful dark red and shines a bright red when light hits it.</li>
            <li>When my roots start to grow out, the fading effect it has looks so much more natural than chemical dyes.</li>
            <li>I rated it at 5 out of 5, because I didn&#x27;t expect a natural hair dye to be as good as other kinds, and it was even better because it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a long time user of hair dye products, always looking for that perfect red which would both look fantastic, not destroy my mid-back length hair, and minimize in the fading department.</li>
            <li>It gives you a very bright red and covers grey well.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, unless the henna is very very pure henna, it can react with any chemical dye that you put in your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair and scalp do feel better and my hair is a nice red tone in the sun that gets me complements when I&#x27;m outside.</li>
            <li>The color is gorgeous, but the mess just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>The color is nice and even all over, and you would never know how long my roots were before using the henna.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this brand which although isn&#x27;t pure, does have good reviews in other sites.  </li>
            <li>i have dyed my hair many different colors throughout my life, but this henna looks by far the best (i am very pale so the intense red is striking) and doesn&#x27;t ruin my hair in the process.</li>
            <li>I have naturally red hair, but it&#x27;s more orange, so I like to deepen it a bit.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using henna, and I have to say,</li>
            <li>I love the concept of henna hair dye, but I would recommend trying a different brand.</li>
            <li>My hair goes from red to a burhundy brown for a week; which is also cute.</li>
            <li>so if there was any residue left on either i wasn&#x27;t able to notice.</li>
            <li>Let me first begin by saying that the colour that your hair comes out depends on the colour of your hair before you put henna in it.</li>
            <li>I however you decide to do this, PLEASE DO A STRAND TEST FIRST.</li>
            <li>Nope, the first time I did it the color didn&#x27;t take.</li>
            <li>(what it looks like when it&#x27;s ready for application)!</li>
            <li>the overall experience much better.</li>
            <li>My hair turned a deep, deep, rich beautiful wine red color.</li>
            <li>My hair turned a deep, deep, rich beautiful wine red color.</li>
            <li>I was kinda surprised because I hoped my hair would be soft and healthy as they had stated, but it only had more shine.  </li>
            <li>, my hair looks normal black indoors but in the sunlight I get a beautiful auburn shine with coppery red highlights where the gray used to be, it is very pretty and exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a vibrant, gorgeous red that barely faded.  </li>
            <li>It really looks like a faded out chemical dye job, which was exactly what I was trying to avoid.</li>
            <li>It really looks like a faded out chemical dye job, which was exactly what I was trying to avoid.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m completely satisfied with henna huts&#x27; product and plan on using it for a very long time.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to finally get bright red hair without having to bleach my head and constantly redye it from all of the fading.</li>
            <li>i went on the Harvest Moon website and it appears that this henna is pure</li>
            <li>however often you want since it&#x27;s natural, and it&#x27;s easy to get over the smell, knowing it&#x27;s better than putting harsh hair dye chemicals on your hair/</li>
            <li>i also added bulgarian rose oil which, since it&#x27;s a little bit of a musky smell, worked well with what the henna already smelled like.</li>
            <li>I was very excited about this product, and the color came out as a vivid red.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it doesn&#x27;t really stain, but I went swimming last weekend and the white polkadots near the top of my swimsuit kept turning orange.</li>
            <li>&amp;lt;3 Thank you so much Henna Hut.</li>
            <li>does my whole head.</li>
            <li>so when I put the henna it did not change much.</li>
            <li>I would say that the photo used to advertise the shade of this product is VERY misleading.</li>
            <li>It bled so much in about 4 days</li>
            <li>Thinking about just saving this because I know someone else who wants to try it.</li>
            <li>My hair looks absolutely NOTHING like the example picture.</li>
            <li>I have chin length hair (when wet) and was able to get 2 applications from a 100g bag of this dye.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wasn&#x27;t used to it rinsing out so much.  </li>
            <li>yet the water STILL does not run clear from my hair!!!</li>
            <li>When you see it against the sun, it is a rich burgundy red.</li>
            <li>Much better than other henna I have used.  </li>
            <li>I get more for less.  </li>
            <li>From my research, the results will only keep getting better, as henna actually improves both the color and health of hair with use.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off using normal hair dye or finding a different brand of henna since this one is a total rip off.</li>
            <li>Even though I used gloves, my hands and nails are still stained orange from the cleanup, so keep in mind that it&#x27;s extremely high staining.</li>
            <li>but I am writing one for this product as I am sitting here with high sulfate shampoo on my head trying to get the stuff out.</li>
            <li>Like I said, I&#x27;ve used natural henna before, but whatever they put in this stuff besides henna makes it run more and stain stuff other than your hair.</li>
            <li>So for a few days I used nothing but water on my hair, wanting to make sure the color wasn&#x27;t affected, all the while hoping the bleeding would end soon.</li>
            <li>I mixed the product with apple cider vinegar, fresh squeezed lemons, and water.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this product, it doesn&#x27;t live up to its expectations.</li>
            <li>I am very sad that the beautiful red is gone so quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try a reapplication in hopes of getting my pretty color back</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try a reapplication in hopes of getting my pretty color back</li>
            <li>24 hours after dying i did a cider vinegar rinse which helps the color last longer and also minimalized the color from bleeding from my hair when wet.(after the rinse hair bled for the first two shampoos and didn&#x27;t stain my fingers)</li>
            <li>So I was originally really excited for this, I got the deep red and was looking forward to getting it.</li>
            <li>It turned my dark brown hair a lovely deep burgundy color.</li>
            <li>but I left mine in for an hour and a half just to be safe.</li>
            <li>My hair would require 200g of pure henna while 100g of Harvest Moon is enough.  </li>
            <li>have scrubbed over and over with clarifying shampoo but the water never runs clear.</li>
            <li>After I rinsed and dried my hair, the red was amazing, even on the darkest parts of my hair that almost never show up red.  </li>
            <li>I have short hair, but I decided to use the whole thing with one use.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
            <li>I did a strand test the night before, and found that it didn&#x27;t change a whole lot, so I boosted my mixture with some lime juice and coffee, wrapped my hair in plastic wrap, put a shower cap over that, and left it in for 3 hours.</li>
            <li>I have been relaxing my hair since I was about 10 years old.</li>
            <li>I started searching for a natural hair dye and found Henna Hut.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>WOW WOW.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so much healthier than when I used regular hair dye.  </li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t noticed a deterioration in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had no trouble with application or rinsing, the water was clear and no unsightly stains on my towels or pillows.</li>
            <li>for the color, all I have to say is WOW.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, it almost completely rinses out after about five washes.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and shiny every time, too.</li>
            <li>I did follow the directions to where I only added warm tap water and a few drops of essential oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit messy using it, but you adjust and I am pleased with the final outcome!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with henna dye in the past, specifically the kind from Lush was extremely weak and only worked after many applications.</li>
            <li>After using primarily &amp;#34;special effect&amp;#34; hair dye to achieve that extreme vibrant red (only to have it fade within a week), I stumbled across the concept of henna.  </li>
            <li>I had my hair permanently colored last year using Dark and Lovely only to have the color fall out when it came time to wash out the relaxer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had to bleach my hair to put a new color in, the color always completely fades after a month, also I am a natural blonde</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this henna because regular BAQ (body art quality) henna would turn Cheeto orange on my naturally dark blonde/ light brown hair.</li>
            <li>my hair has gone from a lovely near ruby red to a dull orangey brown.</li>
            <li>my hair has gone from a lovely near ruby red to a dull orangey brown.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used a few different colors from them (darker than my own hair), and I&#x27;ve been satisfied with them for the past few years.</li>
            <li>:) My only complaint is that today,about a day after I henna&#x27;ed</li>
            <li>Personally as someone that&#x27;s dyed my hair almost every color and used tons of dyes and products, the pros definitely out weigh the cons on this product and I highly recommend it, as long as you are willing to be patient with it and understand it&#x27;s not the same as chemical dye.</li>
            <li>I have dyed my hair various colors, like blue, red, pink, and purple (except I always use a brand called &#x27;Special Effects&#x27;).</li>
            <li>This did not happen with the Henna Hut Natural Red henna.</li>
            <li>I had about 2&amp;#34; of roots with faded chemically dyed red about 4 months old.</li>
            <li>BUT, the color faded completely into an orange/copper color after only 2 washes.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally a dark brunette with some golden and red throughout.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Henna is always a super icky mess to mix up and apply to your hair, so be prepared and wear gloves and old clothes and wipe it off right away if it gets on anything you don&#x27;t want stained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I try to wash my hair as little as possible and in the last four weeks it almost looks like my original hair color.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s usually really dry and curly naturally), it doesn&#x27;t fix my hair completely</li>
            <li>But other than that I&#x27;m very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the first was pink that turned brassy on me within a week and the second was blonde that not only didn&#x27;t work, but made my head itch.</li>
            <li>follow the directions exactly and wash hair twice with shampoo then apply to towel dried hair.</li>
            <li>If you are going from light to dark, you might miss a few patches of hair since it&#x27;s basically like dying your hair with mud, not like chemical dye which can be combed through.</li>

            <li> I have yet to find a better product (not that I am looking to replace it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still in love with this brand and will continue purchasing it.product (not that I am looking to replace it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/23/12:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still in love with this brand and will continue purchasing it.</li>
            <li> and now I get to spend even more money stripping and fixing my hair.</li>
            <li> I Have tried a LOT of Henna and this is my favorite for beard reddening.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the product</li>
            <li> , I am sure it was a mistake but do not use it if the packet is not stamped with a color, mine was not.</li>
            <li> We love the idea of playing in the mud</li>
            <li> This henna does work as claimed and it has a much more tolerable odor to me than Ancient Sunrise.</li>
            <li> My hair look so shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dye.</li>
            <li> Nothing about my strand test could have prepared me for my beautiful new hair color.</li>
            <li> It still is a bright, bright red shade when I apply it.</li>
            <li> I used Henna Hut &amp;#34;Red&amp;#34; for the first time one week ago, and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> I loved the natural, more orangey henna sold by Harvest Moon</li>
            <li> This come out a beautiful shade of red on my daughters</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really bizarre.</li>
            <li> You have to remember to shampoo your hair twice with a sulfate free shampoo before using henna, and again 24 hours after application.</li>
            <li> Light brown chemically dyed hair, about 18 inches in length.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved the color when it first came out the first time I did it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a deep beautiful, bright red.  </li>
            <li> I strand tested first (very, very important) and then went ahead with it.</li>
            <li> am still using this product and I am still as in love with it as the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Note: This is my original review written about 2 days after I henna&#x27;ed.</li>
            <li> I really love this product since the first time I used.</li>
            <li> They was very good at my returning a few.</li>
            <li> After I waited and rinsed my hair, I discovered that it wasn&#x27;t bright red</li>
            <li> I like keeping a bright red hue to my hair.</li>
            <li> but I just made sure to condition it with apple cider vinegar along with my normal chemical free shampoo bar.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have always loved red hair.</li>
            <li> I did some research and found a couple internet forums full of people who had used this product.</li>
            <li> Really, I couldn&#x27;t be more upset.</li>
            <li> Really, I couldn&#x27;t be more upset.</li>
            <li> It was almost TOO red, but I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many red henna hair dyes and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Luckily today, I do not smell like a pack of gum.</li>
            <li> it still bleeds tremendously, plus the color has faded a lot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the past I had used pure henna which is great but requires more preparation and longer time in hair.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, this is the first henna product I choose, because it has me hooked!  </li>
            <li> My hair was light brown, and turned into a red maroon that shines bright red in the light.</li>
            <li> I loved my red hair so much that I cried, literately.</li>
            <li> It turned out a beautiful dark red and shines a bright red when light hits it.</li>
            <li> When my roots start to grow out, the fading effect it has looks so much more natural than chemical dyes.</li>
            <li> I rated it at 5 out of 5, because I didn&#x27;t expect a natural hair dye to be as good as other kinds, and it was even better because it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of hair dye products, always looking for that perfect red which would both look fantastic, not destroy my mid-back length hair, and minimize in the fading department.</li>
            <li> It gives you a very bright red and covers grey well.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, unless the henna is very very pure henna, it can react with any chemical dye that you put in your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair and scalp do feel better and my hair is a nice red tone in the sun that gets me complements when I&#x27;m outside.</li>
            <li> The color is gorgeous, but the mess just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> The color is nice and even all over, and you would never know how long my roots were before using the henna.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this brand which although isn&#x27;t pure, does have good reviews in other sites.  </li>
            <li> i have dyed my hair many different colors throughout my life, but this henna looks by far the best (i am very pale so the intense red is striking) and doesn&#x27;t ruin my hair in the process.</li>
            <li> I have naturally red hair, but it&#x27;s more orange, so I like to deepen it a bit.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using henna, and I have to say,</li>
            <li> I love the concept of henna hair dye, but I would recommend trying a different brand.</li>
            <li> My hair goes from red to a burhundy brown for a week; which is also cute.</li>
            <li> so if there was any residue left on either i wasn&#x27;t able to notice.</li>
            <li> Let me first begin by saying that the colour that your hair comes out depends on the colour of your hair before you put henna in it.</li>
            <li> I however you decide to do this, PLEASE DO A STRAND TEST FIRST.</li>
            <li> Nope, the first time I did it the color didn&#x27;t take.</li>
            <li> (what it looks like when it&#x27;s ready for application)!</li>
            <li> the overall experience much better.</li>
            <li> My hair turned a deep, deep, rich beautiful wine red color.</li>
            <li> My hair turned a deep, deep, rich beautiful wine red color.</li>
            <li> I was kinda surprised because I hoped my hair would be soft and healthy as they had stated, but it only had more shine.  </li>
            <li> , my hair looks normal black indoors but in the sunlight I get a beautiful auburn shine with coppery red highlights where the gray used to be, it is very pretty and exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a vibrant, gorgeous red that barely faded.  </li>
            <li> It really looks like a faded out chemical dye job, which was exactly what I was trying to avoid.</li>
            <li> It really looks like a faded out chemical dye job, which was exactly what I was trying to avoid.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m completely satisfied with henna huts&#x27; product and plan on using it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to finally get bright red hair without having to bleach my head and constantly redye it from all of the fading.</li>
            <li> i went on the Harvest Moon website and it appears that this henna is pure</li>
            <li> however often you want since it&#x27;s natural, and it&#x27;s easy to get over the smell, knowing it&#x27;s better than putting harsh hair dye chemicals on your hair/</li>
            <li> i also added bulgarian rose oil which, since it&#x27;s a little bit of a musky smell, worked well with what the henna already smelled like.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this product, and the color came out as a vivid red.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it doesn&#x27;t really stain, but I went swimming last weekend and the white polkadots near the top of my swimsuit kept turning orange.</li>
            <li> &amp;lt;3 Thank you so much Henna Hut.</li>
            <li> does my whole head.</li>
            <li> so when I put the henna it did not change much.</li>
            <li> I would say that the photo used to advertise the shade of this product is VERY misleading.</li>
            <li> It bled so much in about 4 days</li>
            <li> Thinking about just saving this because I know someone else who wants to try it.</li>
            <li> My hair looks absolutely NOTHING like the example picture.</li>
            <li> I have chin length hair (when wet) and was able to get 2 applications from a 100g bag of this dye.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t used to it rinsing out so much.  </li>
            <li> yet the water STILL does not run clear from my hair!!!</li>
            <li> When you see it against the sun, it is a rich burgundy red.</li>
            <li> Much better than other henna I have used.  </li>
            <li> I get more for less.  </li>
            <li> From my research, the results will only keep getting better, as henna actually improves both the color and health of hair with use.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off using normal hair dye or finding a different brand of henna since this one is a total rip off.</li>
            <li> Even though I used gloves, my hands and nails are still stained orange from the cleanup, so keep in mind that it&#x27;s extremely high staining.</li>
            <li> but I am writing one for this product as I am sitting here with high sulfate shampoo on my head trying to get the stuff out.</li>
            <li> Like I said, I&#x27;ve used natural henna before, but whatever they put in this stuff besides henna makes it run more and stain stuff other than your hair.</li>
            <li> So for a few days I used nothing but water on my hair, wanting to make sure the color wasn&#x27;t affected, all the while hoping the bleeding would end soon.</li>
            <li> I mixed the product with apple cider vinegar, fresh squeezed lemons, and water.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product, it doesn&#x27;t live up to its expectations.</li>
            <li> I am very sad that the beautiful red is gone so quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try a reapplication in hopes of getting my pretty color back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try a reapplication in hopes of getting my pretty color back</li>
            <li> 24 hours after dying i did a cider vinegar rinse which helps the color last longer and also minimalized the color from bleeding from my hair when wet.(after the rinse hair bled for the first two shampoos and didn&#x27;t stain my fingers)</li>
            <li> So I was originally really excited for this, I got the deep red and was looking forward to getting it.</li>
            <li> It turned my dark brown hair a lovely deep burgundy color.</li>
            <li> but I left mine in for an hour and a half just to be safe.</li>
            <li> My hair would require 200g of pure henna while 100g of Harvest Moon is enough.  </li>
            <li> have scrubbed over and over with clarifying shampoo but the water never runs clear.</li>
            <li> After I rinsed and dried my hair, the red was amazing, even on the darkest parts of my hair that almost never show up red.  </li>
            <li> I have short hair, but I decided to use the whole thing with one use.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
            <li> I did a strand test the night before, and found that it didn&#x27;t change a whole lot, so I boosted my mixture with some lime juice and coffee, wrapped my hair in plastic wrap, put a shower cap over that, and left it in for 3 hours.</li>
            <li> I have been relaxing my hair since I was about 10 years old.</li>
            <li> I started searching for a natural hair dye and found Henna Hut.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> WOW WOW.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so much healthier than when I used regular hair dye.  </li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t noticed a deterioration in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had no trouble with application or rinsing, the water was clear and no unsightly stains on my towels or pillows.</li>
            <li> for the color, all I have to say is WOW.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, it almost completely rinses out after about five washes.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny every time, too.</li>
            <li> I did follow the directions to where I only added warm tap water and a few drops of essential oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit messy using it, but you adjust and I am pleased with the final outcome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with henna dye in the past, specifically the kind from Lush was extremely weak and only worked after many applications.</li>
            <li> After using primarily &amp;#34;special effect&amp;#34; hair dye to achieve that extreme vibrant red (only to have it fade within a week), I stumbled across the concept of henna.  </li>
            <li> I had my hair permanently colored last year using Dark and Lovely only to have the color fall out when it came time to wash out the relaxer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had to bleach my hair to put a new color in, the color always completely fades after a month, also I am a natural blonde</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this henna because regular BAQ (body art quality) henna would turn Cheeto orange on my naturally dark blonde/ light brown hair.</li>
            <li> my hair has gone from a lovely near ruby red to a dull orangey brown.</li>
            <li> my hair has gone from a lovely near ruby red to a dull orangey brown.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a few different colors from them (darker than my own hair), and I&#x27;ve been satisfied with them for the past few years.</li>
            <li> :) My only complaint is that today,about a day after I henna&#x27;ed</li>
            <li> Personally as someone that&#x27;s dyed my hair almost every color and used tons of dyes and products, the pros definitely out weigh the cons on this product and I highly recommend it, as long as you are willing to be patient with it and understand it&#x27;s not the same as chemical dye.</li>
            <li> I have dyed my hair various colors, like blue, red, pink, and purple (except I always use a brand called &#x27;Special Effects&#x27;).</li>
            <li> This did not happen with the Henna Hut Natural Red henna.</li>
            <li> I had about 2&amp;#34; of roots with faded chemically dyed red about 4 months old.</li>
            <li> BUT, the color faded completely into an orange/copper color after only 2 washes.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally a dark brunette with some golden and red throughout.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Henna is always a super icky mess to mix up and apply to your hair, so be prepared and wear gloves and old clothes and wipe it off right away if it gets on anything you don&#x27;t want stained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I try to wash my hair as little as possible and in the last four weeks it almost looks like my original hair color.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s usually really dry and curly naturally), it doesn&#x27;t fix my hair completely</li>
            <li> But other than that I&#x27;m very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the first was pink that turned brassy on me within a week and the second was blonde that not only didn&#x27;t work, but made my head itch.</li>
            <li> follow the directions exactly and wash hair twice with shampoo then apply to towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> If you are going from light to dark, you might miss a few patches of hair since it&#x27;s basically like dying your hair with mud, not like chemical dye which can be combed through.</li>
            <li> It made my hair a little dry for the first couple of days</li>
            <li> This is pretty annoying as I have very long hair that takes a long time to dry, and I can&#x27;t really wear anything light colored at all because if my damp hair touches it, it leaves an orange mark.</li>
            <li> product boasts that you only have to leave it on for an hour or less, but since henna is a natural plant dye, I always leave my henna on as long as possible (2 hours or more).&lt;br</li>
            <li> you long for red hair that doesn&#x27;t fade after a week?</li>
            <li> It has been long enough that my roots are about 1/2&amp;#34; (about a month)</li>
            <li> It was a dark burgundy/brownish color with barely any red tint.</li>
            <li> Worked really well, I mean really well, but it was very chunky when I put it on, and very hard to get out!</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and its gunna take a awhile before all that orange-ish color hair has been grown out and cut away.</li>
            <li> I dyed it the second time with the other half portion of the powder that was left and only got a darker result of orange.</li>
            <li> The package got here on the due date, which was a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> hair was not a pretty red, at all.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I like having to only leave it on for 1 hour instead of 4 hours with the other henna.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry now anyway.</li>
            <li> keeps it from being dry and helps to avoid split ends.</li>
            <li> so I waited 48 hours with hair that felt dry because I didn&#x27;t want to jeopardize the color.  </li>
            <li> But if I happen to run my hand through my hair now that it is dry, my hand and nails will have an orange tint to them.</li>
            <li> Plus, if you towel dry your hair, it will stain your towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but now I have dark brown hair, not the red</li>
            <li> only down side to this product is that it&#x27;s been a week</li>
            <li> I only dye the bottom half of my hair, so I used half the package, I followed all the instructions AND waited an hour before washing it out WITHOUT soap/shampoo and in result I had orange hair instead of the red hair like in the example picture.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s messy and a little difficult to work with, BUT the results are phenomenal.</li>
            <li> Even when I washed my face in the morning, there was no stain on the towel from my wet hairline.</li>
            <li> After my shampoo with a Color Treated shampoo (for one cannot be too careful)</li>
            <li> After my shampoo with a Color Treated shampoo (for one cannot be too careful)</li>
            <li> This was such a waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> It turned my grays green, and as soon as I washed my hair 3 days the grays were back!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me that chemical dyes were not good for someone like me who has very very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> henna can dry some peoples hair a little but a leave in conditioner applied to the ends when hair is wet</li>
            <li> I cant use any other dyer because I develop allergies.</li>
            <li> I have black hair with some gray so the results were as expected</li>
            <li> , if you mess with your hair when it&#x27;s wet after using this product, you will stain your fingernails.  </li>
            <li> If you wash your hair every other day or less often, you can prolong the color, but every time your rinse your hair, be prepared for the water to rinse out an orange</li>
            <li> It does smell horrible (all of them do if natural) and definitely bleeds the first few washes, but it will last longer if you&#x27;re not washing your hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I have medium to dark brown hair</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown</li>
            <li> I am biracial with curly, dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used henna tons of times on my hair to get it a dark auburn/red.  </li>
            <li> Scroll down for an updated review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hands down</li>
            <li> color lasts about 3 weeks, i have shoulder length hair and half a pack</li>
            <li> I previously used 100% henna from Ancient Sunrise.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit worried because I couldn&#x27;t find any pictures of people with dark brown hair (basically black) that used this product</li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> The biggest disappointment is that after my first wash it faded drastically.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy</li>
            <li> NOW every time I put a new color in, the color never fades and leaves a weird orange tint to any of the colors I put in my hair.</li>
            <li> After I died it and rinsed it out, my towel was a mess, but once I dried my hair, no issues.</li>
            <li> was a little apprehensive, however, about using the henna hair color, but I did it anyways.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color faded a little bit</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been 5 days and my hair still bleeds a little dye in the shower, I hope this will stop soon.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t, so a few hours ago I decided to shampoo it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t, so a few hours ago I decided to shampoo it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna hair dye for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money, honestly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite obvious that their product quality has decreased loads.</li>

            <li> I have naturally red hair, but it&#x27;s more orange, so I like to deepen it a bit. I&#x27;ve tried many red henna hair dyes and this is my favorite. It does smell horrible (all of them do if natural) and definitely bleeds the first few washes, but it will last longer if you&#x27;re not washing your hair everyday. DO NOT WASH WITH SHAMPOO AFTER APPLICATION. follow the directions exactly and wash hair twice with shampoo then apply to towel dried hair. After using it I just rinse it for 10 minutes then use a conditioner and don&#x27;t wash for 2 days. The good thing is you can apply it however often you want since it&#x27;s natural, and it&#x27;s easy to get over the smell, knowing it&#x27;s better than putting harsh hair dye chemicals on your hair/scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a few different colors from them (darker than my own hair), and I&#x27;ve been satisfied with them for the past few years. It makes my hair softer and feel healthier (it&#x27;s usually really dry and curly naturally), it doesn&#x27;t fix my hair completely but I feel the difference. If you are going from light to dark, you might miss a few patches of hair since it&#x27;s basically like dying your hair with mud, not like chemical dye which can be combed through. Personally as someone that&#x27;s dyed my hair almost every color and used tons of dyes and products, the pros definitely out weigh the cons on this product and I highly recommend it, as long as you are willing to be patient with it and understand it&#x27;s not the same as chemical dye.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using henna, and I have to say, it&#x27;s messy and a little difficult to work with, BUT the results are phenomenal. I have medium to dark brown hair and I have always loved red hair. Since I wasn&#x27;t blessed with it, mine comes in a box. I have short hair, but I decided to use the whole thing with one use. Because it is so thick and messy, I didn&#x27;t want to miss any spots. I just used the henna last night. The box says it takes 2-3 days for the color to fully develop. As of today, I LOVE IT. It&#x27;s a deep beautiful, bright red.  I can&#x27;t wait for the next couple of days to see how it develops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others mentioned, I did not have any issues with bleeding on my clothes or pillow. After I died it and rinsed it out, my towel was a mess, but once I dried my hair, no issues. Even when I washed my face in the morning, there was no stain on the towel from my wet hairline. I did follow the directions to where I only added warm tap water and a few drops of essential oil. I only had peppermint oil and it worked great. Luckily today, I do not smell like a pack of gum. I did not add any acid, like lemon juice, even though I know henna requires that sometimes. Maybe I&#x27;ll try the acid next time and update this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using henna, like the box says, do not wash for 24-48 hrs. I will go with 48 hrs. My hair is dry now anyway. But, I will rinse with a solution of apple cider vinegar and water. It will bring out the shine and help preserve the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - Nov 2nd, 2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using this product and I am still as in love with it as the first time I used it. My hair now is no longer brown at all, even when the color \\&quot;fades.\\&quot; I am a redhead and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Henna every three to four months. It still is a bright, bright red shade when I apply it. I get compliments on my hair color all the time. Have continued and will continue to buy this. I have yet to find a better product (not that I am looking to replace it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/23/12:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually keep this on for about 1 hour as per instructions. Last time I kept it on for 2 hours. My hair turned a deep, deep, rich beautiful wine red color. So no need to purchase the deep red version of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still in love with this brand and will continue purchasing it.product (not that I am looking to replace it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/23/12:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually keep this on for about 1 hour as per instructions.

            <li> The package got here on the due date, which was a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little apprehensive, however, about using the henna hair color, but I did it anyways.&lt;br /&gt;Bad. Idea.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was not a pretty red, at all.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, it was orange. A nasty, brassy looking orange color.&lt;br /&gt;Used it yesterday, woke up this morning and what color was my pillow?&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, orange. I will definitely NOT be using this product anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible idea, and now I get to spend even more money stripping and fixing my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with henna dye in the past, specifically the kind from Lush was extremely weak and only worked after many applications. I was skeptical about this brand, but I used it and I was pleasantly surprised by the results. My hair was light brown, and turned into a red maroon that shines bright red in the light. I did a strand test the night before, and found that it didn&#x27;t change a whole lot, so I boosted my mixture with some lime juice and coffee, wrapped my hair in plastic wrap, put a shower cap over that, and left it in for 3 hours. Even though I used gloves, my hands and nails are still stained orange from the cleanup, so keep in mind that it&#x27;s extremely high staining. I rated it at 5 out of 5, because I didn&#x27;t expect a natural hair dye to be as good as other kinds, and it was even better because it&#x27;s non-damaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I changed my rating to two stars, because while the color was perfect at first, It continued to leak out every day for months, ruining clothes, towels, and pillow cases. Every time I showered, it got into my nails and stained them orange. I love the concept of henna hair dye, but I would recommend trying a different brand.</li>
            <li> I Have tried a LOT of Henna and this is my favorite for beard reddening. It does your skin too but if I sleep on it and shave in the morning it is all gone. It gives you a very bright red and covers grey well.</li>
            <li> This come out a beautiful shade of red on my daughters blone hair.like shing copper. I sent a few back because i ordered to much. the package is a good size .she kept hers in for 2 hours. you don,t need that long.it,s been several weeks and several shampoos and the colors holding.I,ll get her to do the vidio for this tommorow. They was very good at my returning a few. when this is gone i,ll be ordering more.as one pack i barley used a quater of it.but then she has short hair.</li>
            <li> I have been relaxing my hair since I was about 10 years old. I had my hair permanently colored last year using Dark and Lovely only to have the color fall out when it came time to wash out the relaxer. I loved my red hair so much that I cried, literately. I started searching for a natural hair dye and found Henna Hut. I relax my hair every 3 months and a week later I color it. My hair goes from red to a burhundy brown for a week; which is also cute. I love this stuff. And the best part is that it arrives in 2 maybe 3 days (i noticed this depends on what time you place your order). Im happy and my husband loves it. The last package I ordered was for my wedding. Instead of paying $65 for a color, I paid $14 and a hour of my time. &amp;lt;3 Thank you so much Henna Hut.</li>
            <li> Note: This is my original review written about 2 days after I henna&#x27;ed. Scroll down for an updated review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you long for red hair that doesn&#x27;t fade after a week? Do chemical dyes leave your hair crispy and sad? I have tried chemical dyes a total of twice in my lifetime: the first was pink that turned brassy on me within a week and the second was blonde that not only didn&#x27;t work, but made my head itch. My dermatologist told me that chemical dyes were not good for someone like me who has very very sensitive skin. So when I decided to go red, henna it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this henna because regular BAQ (body art quality) henna would turn Cheeto orange on my naturally dark blonde/ light brown hair. I strand tested first (very, very important) and then went ahead with it. WOW WOW WOW. Nothing about my strand test could have prepared me for my beautiful new hair color. It is true to the color charts and just gorgeous. The henna went lighter over my highlights and the color is bright, multi-dimensional and sparkly.&lt;br /&gt;The process itself wasn&#x27;t that hard; I wore a plastic cape to protect my shirt and my mom helped me put it into my hair. Don&#x27;t worry about the people who say that henna is a pain to rinse out of your hair, it only takes about ten minutes and the shower drain is not the slightest bit clogged. :) My only complaint is that today,about a day after I henna&#x27;ed my hair bled orange on the back of my shirt when I exercised. Not cool. But other than that I&#x27;m very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This is my updated review*&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve had my henna in for about a week and the bleeding continued. The color faded a little bit and I wasn&#x27;t too concerned. I did some research and found a couple internet forums full of people who had used this product. Many people experienced the bleeding and said it stopped pretty quick on its own or could be stopped with a good shampoo&#x27;ing, either way without affecting the color. So for a few days I used nothing but water on my hair, wanting to make sure the color wasn&#x27;t affected, all the while hoping the bleeding would end soon. It didn&#x27;t, so a few hours ago I decided to shampoo it. The good news: the bleeding is officially stopped. The bad news: so is my beautiful color. After my shampoo with a Color Treated shampoo (for one cannot be too careful) my hair has gone from a lovely near ruby red to a dull orangey brown. I was so disappointed that after my hair dried, I wanted to cry. It really looks like a faded out chemical dye job, which was exactly what I was trying to avoid. Really, I couldn&#x27;t be more upset. I&#x27;m going to try a reapplication in hopes of getting my pretty color back but I don&#x27;t have a lot of hope for getting it to stick. :( I&#x27;ll do another update soon.sn&#x27;t affected, all the while hoping the bleeding would end soon.

            <li> i have dyed my hair many different colors throughout my life, but this henna looks by far the best (i am very pale so the intense red is striking) and doesn&#x27;t ruin my hair in the process. I follwed the instructions on the pouch (added warm water and let set for an hour) i also added bulgarian rose oil which, since it&#x27;s a little bit of a musky smell, worked well with what the henna already smelled like. the color looks amazing. 24 hours after dying i did a cider vinegar rinse which helps the color last longer and also minimalized the color from bleeding from my hair when wet.(after the rinse hair bled for the first two shampoos and didn&#x27;t stain my fingers) both my towels and pillow cases are red so if there was any residue left on either i wasn&#x27;t able to notice. color lasts about 3 weeks, i have shoulder length hair and half a pack does my whole head. as the henna builds on my hair it isn&#x27;t as thin and doesn&#x27;t get as damaged. henna can dry some peoples hair a little but a leave in conditioner applied to the ends when hair is wet keeps it from being dry and helps to avoid split ends. i&#x27;m completely satisfied with henna huts&#x27; product and plan on using it for a very long time. i would suggest them if someone was looking for good hair henna. i get compliments on my hair every day at work, thank you henna hut!</li>
            <li> I loved the natural, more orangey henna sold by Harvest Moon so I got this color to see how it would work. It has been long enough that my roots are about 1/2&amp;#34; (about a month) yet the water STILL does not run clear from my hair!!! The color is gorgeous, but the mess just isn&#x27;t worth it. Fortunately, it doesn&#x27;t really stain, but I went swimming last weekend and the white polkadots near the top of my swimsuit kept turning orange. This is pretty annoying as I have very long hair that takes a long time to dry, and I can&#x27;t really wear anything light colored at all because if my damp hair touches it, it leaves an orange mark. I will not be purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;I have scrubbed over and over with clarifying shampoo but the water never runs clear. It&#x27;s really bizarre. Again, even after swimming for a couple hours last week, when I shower, there is STILL orange coming out. I don&#x27;t even know how it&#x27;s possible. This did not happen with the Henna Hut Natural Red henna.</li>
            <li> I love the product but now I have dark brown hair, not the red I grew up with, I am sure it was a mistake but do not use it if the packet is not stamped with a color, mine was not.</li>
            <li> I NEVER write reviews but I am writing one for this product as I am sitting here with high sulfate shampoo on my head trying to get the stuff out. It is BEYOND AWFUL... awful to apply, awful blotchy results. I just hope I can get it out of my hair in time. WARNING- DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> Let me first begin by saying that the colour that your hair comes out depends on the colour of your hair before you put henna in it. My hair is dark brown so when I put the henna it did not change much. When you see it against the sun, it is a rich burgundy red. I would say that the photo used to advertise the shade of this product is VERY misleading. my hair looks nothing like that. In order to get that shade, you have to bleach all the pigment out of your hair and then apply the henna. HOWEVER, unless the henna is very very pure henna, it can react with any chemical dye that you put in your hair. i went on the Harvest Moon website and it appears that this henna is pure but I still would not risk putting it over bleached hair. I however you decide to do this, PLEASE DO A STRAND TEST FIRST.</li>
            <li> So I was originally really excited for this, I got the deep red and was looking forward to getting it. I loved the color when it first came out the first time I did it. The color was vibrant, but the bleeding is awful! It bled so much in about 4 days the color was gone. I did it again (the color sticks to my roots and bangs) but about halfway down it fades to this awful orange color. I did a protein mask thinking it would help the color stick so I bought this one. Nope, the first time I did it the color didn&#x27;t take. Thinking about just saving this because I know someone else who wants to try it. Initial expectation was ruined and now I&#x27;m gonna have to go back to chemical dyes. I hadn&#x27;t dyed my hair with permanent hair color since June of 2013.</li>
            <li> Great product!  No heat required, or plastic bag.  This a wonderful, fine powder that mixes well with hot water.  I left it in for 45 minutes and waited 18 hours to wash with shampoo.  I had no problems with it clogging my sink, rubbing off on clothes, or staining my tub.  Much better than other henna I have used.  It turned my dark brown hair a lovely deep burgundy color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna hair dye for a few months now.  My hair feels so much healthier than when I used regular hair dye.  It&#x27;s a bit messy using it, but you adjust and I am pleased with the final outcome!</li>
            <li> For starters, I personally couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of the hair dye mixture. I only dye the bottom half of my hair, so I used half the package, I followed all the instructions AND waited an hour before washing it out WITHOUT soap/shampoo and in result I had orange hair instead of the red hair like in the example picture. I dyed it the second time with the other half portion of the powder that was left and only got a darker result of orange. Its been a couple days since I dyed it with Henna Hut RED Hair Dye, when I take showers it still bleeds tremendously, plus the color has faded a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I did something wrong in the process, but the smell is mostly the reason I gave this product a low rating. When you wash it out without soap/shampoo you have to wait 24-48 hours before you can actually you shampoo to wash it, during that time my hair smelled like the product and I couldn&#x27;t stand it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-UPDATE 5/2/2012&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been over a year since my review and this product is still on my mind! I have dyed my hair various colors, like blue, red, pink, and purple (except I always use a brand called &#x27;Special Effects&#x27;). I&#x27;ve never had to bleach my hair to put a new color in, the color always completely fades after a month, also I am a natural blonde so it already looks like my hair is bleached. After using this product, the color NEVER came out. I had pasty orange looking hair. I tried bleaching it once, but it ended up turning it a pale green. NOW every time I put a new color in, the color never fades and leaves a weird orange tint to any of the colors I put in my hair. I have long hair, and its gunna take a awhile before all that orange-ish color hair has been grown out and cut away. I HATE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of hair dye products, always looking for that perfect red which would both look fantastic, not destroy my mid-back length hair, and minimize in the fading department. After using primarily &amp;#34;special effect&amp;#34; hair dye to achieve that extreme vibrant red (only to have it fade within a week), I stumbled across the concept of henna.  Thankfully, this is the first henna product I choose, because it has me hooked!  I had a vibrant, gorgeous red that barely faded.  I have in fact just purchased my second package to re-dye my hair this weekend.  From my research, the results will only keep getting better, as henna actually improves both the color and health of hair with use.</li>
            <li> I used Henna Hut &amp;#34;Red&amp;#34; for the first time one week ago, and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results! I had about 2&amp;#34; of roots with faded chemically dyed red about 4 months old. I was worried my roots would turn a different color than the rest of my hair, but that wasn&#x27;t the case! The color is nice and even all over, and you would never know how long my roots were before using the henna. You have to remember to shampoo your hair twice with a sulfate free shampoo before using henna, and again 24 hours after application. Very important - do not use conditioners with oil!!! This will prevent the henna from binding to the protein in your hair and the color will fade!! I recommend purchasing samples of their aloe vera shampoo and conditioner to use before and after using the henna for the best results...who knows, you might fall in love with their products like I did and get hooked!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to finally get bright red hair without having to bleach my head and constantly redye it from all of the fading. So I thought I&#x27;d give hair henna a try. BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT EVER. I have shoulder length hair but still used the entire packet of henna and covered my hair thoroughly. The instructions said to leave it in for 1 hour...but I left mine in for an hour and a half just to be safe. After I waited and rinsed my hair, I discovered that it wasn&#x27;t bright red AT ALL. It was a dark burgundy/brownish color with barely any red tint. This was such a waste of my time and money. My hair looks absolutely NOTHING like the example picture. Don&#x27;t buy this product, it doesn&#x27;t live up to its expectations. You&#x27;re better off using normal hair dye or finding a different brand of henna since this one is a total rip off.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, excellent product.</li>
            <li> I like keeping a bright red hue to my hair. I had to give up chemical dyes because of my severe migraines. This works just as well as the chemical dyes and even my hair stylist agrees its a great alternative to the chemicals she was dying my hair. We love the idea of playing in the mud (what it looks like when it&#x27;s ready for application)!</li>
            <li> In the past I had used pure henna which is great but requires more preparation and longer time in hair.  I decided to try this brand which although isn&#x27;t pure, does have good reviews in other sites.  I like that I get more for less.  My hair would require 200g of pure henna while 100g of Harvest Moon is enough.  I like having to only leave it on for 1 hour instead of 4 hours with the other henna. I don&#x27;t have to get lemon juice or prep the day before, just add tap water and use immediately. After 15 minutes of rinsing I don&#x27;t feel like I got all of it out, as evidenced by still having dye bleeding in subsequent showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like was that my hair didn&#x27;t feel soft and conditioned after rinsing like with regular henna which was annoying because the instructions said to not use conditioner for 24-48 hours so I waited 48 hours with hair that felt dry because I didn&#x27;t want to jeopardize the color.  I have black hair with some gray so the results were as expected, my hair looks normal black indoors but in the sunlight I get a beautiful auburn shine with coppery red highlights where the gray used to be, it is very pretty and exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 5 days and my hair still bleeds a little dye in the shower, I hope this will stop soon.  So far I haven&#x27;t noticed a deterioration in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;m not completely thrilled with the product I found the convenience factor a plus and will probably use it again when it&#x27;s time to touch up the grays.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of henna before and it works great.  I have not had any problems with this henna.  I decided to henna my hair after using a commercial dye on my locs which weakened them a bit.  The henna strengthens my hair while covering my gray so its perfect for me.</li>
            <li> This is the second henna dye product I&#x27;ve used in my hair. I previously used 100% henna from Ancient Sunrise. I wanted to try Henna Hut because of the immediate dye release and the fact that you only have to leave it on for 1 hour. I am biracial with curly, dark brown hair. This henna does work as claimed and it has a much more tolerable odor to me than Ancient Sunrise. My hair and scalp do feel better and my hair is a nice red tone in the sun that gets me complements when I&#x27;m outside. I have chin length hair (when wet) and was able to get 2 applications from a 100g bag of this dye. I had no trouble with application or rinsing, the water was clear and no unsightly stains on my towels or pillows. But if I happen to run my hand through my hair now that it is dry, my hand and nails will have an orange tint to them. This washes off easily but still, very annoying and did not occur with Ancient Sunrise. I would try this henna again but maybe next time I will do a vinegar rinse during the initial wash out and see how that affects things.</li>
            <li> This turned out simply amazing! I was a little bit worried because I couldn&#x27;t find any pictures of people with dark brown hair (basically black) that used this product but I decided to give it a try. I mixed the product with apple cider vinegar, fresh squeezed lemons, and water. I put it in my hair, warped my head with plastic wrap, and let it sit for about 5 hours before washing it out. It turned out a beautiful dark red and shines a bright red when light hits it. It made my hair a little dry for the first couple of days but I just made sure to condition it with apple cider vinegar along with my normal chemical free shampoo bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side to this product is that it&#x27;s been a week and I&#x27;m still seeing color run off when I wash my hair (which I do every day).  It&#x27;s a bright orange color that washes out and it keeps re-staining my fingers. That said, the color still seems to be the same so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s with the leaking color.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research for this product.  After reading several reviews and videos I decided to give it a try.  I will say it was a lot easier than I thought working with henna would be.  Initially I loved the color, a very bright beautiful red.  I was kinda surprised because I hoped my hair would be soft and healthy as they had stated, but it only had more shine.  The biggest disappointment is that after my first wash it faded drastically.  I try to wash my hair as little as possible and in the last four weeks it almost looks like my original hair color.  I am very sad that the beautiful red is gone so quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used henna tons of times on my hair to get it a dark auburn/red.  I&#x27;m naturally a dark brunette with some golden and red throughout.  I have long, thick, wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henna is always a super icky mess to mix up and apply to your hair, so be prepared and wear gloves and old clothes and wipe it off right away if it gets on anything you don&#x27;t want stained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product boasts that you only have to leave it on for an hour or less, but since henna is a natural plant dye, I always leave my henna on as long as possible (2 hours or more).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has red clay or something in it, and it smells nasty, not what I was used to for henna.  Henna normally just smells like plant tea or something, not great, but not dirty and nasty like this stuff does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the color, all I have to say is WOW.  After I rinsed and dried my hair, the red was amazing, even on the darkest parts of my hair that almost never show up red.  It was almost TOO red, but I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it almost completely rinses out after about five washes.  If you wash your hair every other day or less often, you can prolong the color, but every time your rinse your hair, be prepared for the water to rinse out an orange shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you mess with your hair when it&#x27;s wet after using this product, you will stain your fingernails.  Plus, if you towel dry your hair, it will stain your towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t used to it rinsing out so much.  Like I said, I&#x27;ve used natural henna before, but whatever they put in this stuff besides henna makes it run more and stain stuff other than your hair.</li>
            <li> It turned my grays green, and as soon as I washed my hair 3 days the grays were back! What a rip off!</li>
            <li> • Background info: Light brown chemically dyed hair, about 18 inches in length.&lt;br /&gt;• This product will permanently stain everything it touches. Even tile.&lt;br /&gt;• I was very excited about this product, and the color came out as a vivid red. It was gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;• BUT, the color faded completely into an orange/copper color after only 2 washes.&lt;br /&gt;• Your hair will continue to bleed for days&lt;br /&gt;• Waste of money, honestly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used hennahut products before, and the result was really good and the overall experience much better. It&#x27;s quite obvious that their product quality has decreased loads.</li>
            <li> Worked really well, I mean really well, but it was very chunky when I put it on, and very hard to get out!</li>
            <li> I really love this product since the first time I used. I am stuck with it. My hair look so shiny and healthy. I cant use any other dyer because I develop allergies. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dye. When my roots start to grow out, the fading effect it has looks so much more natural than chemical dyes. It leaves my hair soft and shiny every time, too.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff...hands down</li>
