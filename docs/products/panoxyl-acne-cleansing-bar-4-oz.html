    <ol>
            <li>This stuff works great!  </li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s the best cure for face and body acne.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent product and value</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worked great.</li>
            <li>The price great.</li>
            <li>good product and effective for greasy or oily skin</li>
            <li>This is an excellent soap for hot and/or humid weather.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the BEST acne soap I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>She went from having 20+ pimples (and twice as many blackheads) in these areas to maybe 4 or 5 at any given time.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t bleach out bedsheets or t-shirts the way the more concentrated cream does.  </li>
            <li>Basically the ones that dry peoples skin out are what is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I imagine she won&#x27;t be pimple free until she&#x27;s done puberty</li>
            <li>The price is great compared to physical stores</li>
            <li>This is a superior product by far.  </li>
            <li>By far the best facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly</li>
            <li>The 6 pack is worth the cost for ordering in bulk.</li>
            <li>As described and fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>the only product that is able to keep my acne under control. will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>Great product for everyday control and proper cleaning.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The real deal.</li>
            <li>but she found that didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as fast as the PanOxyl cream</li>
            <li>Works really well for acne and folliculitis.  </li>
            <li>It has left my skin feeling smooth as if blemishes were not even a problem to begin with.</li>
            <li>But if you want to clear your skin fast, and keep it clear, this is the product to use!</li>
            <li>This is the only stuff that works consistently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and it really works, unlike many other products I tried before, plus the price is really cheap compared to all the other sellers on amazon and ebay!</li>
            <li>A must have for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is apparently not standard as normal wash just doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>Get your moneys worth with these bars, little goes a long ways.</li>

            <li> This stuff works great!  By far the best facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> The 6 pack is worth the cost for ordering in bulk. I use this for folliculitis and back acne, and it definitely clears things up. One bar lasts me about a month for use on my shoulders, back, and chest/stomach. My dermatologist recommended this and it&#x27;s worked great.</li>
            <li> good product and effective for greasy or oily skin</li>
            <li> As described and fast shipping!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> The real deal. Pro Activ, clearasil, etc are all the same.  This is a superior product by far.  I ordered several since they last a long time and are hard to find.</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s the best cure for face and body acne.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else I have tried. My skin is apparently not standard as normal wash just doesn&#x27;t do anything for me. Basically the ones that dry peoples skin out are what is perfect for me. Get your moneys worth with these bars, little goes a long ways. Like the plastic trays it comes in, keeps t from getting all nasty like normal bar soap sitting on your counter top.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my teenaged daughter&#x27;s acne on her shoulders, back, and chest. Previously was using Proactiv deep cleansing shower cleanser but she found that didn&#x27;t help much. After using the product for only a week we noticed a change in the amount of pimples forming. She went from having 20+ pimples (and twice as many blackheads) in these areas to maybe 4 or 5 at any given time. I imagine she won&#x27;t be pimple free until she&#x27;s done puberty but this soap has helped so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She uses the soap after she&#x27;s done washing and conditioning her hair so that the conditioner doesn&#x27;t clog her pores again.</li>
            <li> My son uses this.. It definitely helps..</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product. It is so difficult to find in stores. The price great. Shipped quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and am ordering it again.  It doesn&#x27;t work as fast as the PanOxyl cream but it doesn&#x27;t bleach out bedsheets or t-shirts the way the more concentrated cream does.  You might have to use it for a few months to start seeing improvement in skin condition but it does work.  The price is great compared to physical stores</li>
            <li> Absolutely the BEST acne soap I have ever used! It is drying, so watch out for that. But if you want to clear your skin fast, and keep it clear, this is the product to use!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent soap for hot and/or humid weather.  It is an excellent product and value</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and it really works, unlike many other products I tried before, plus the price is really cheap compared to all the other sellers on amazon and ebay!</li>
            <li> Works really well for acne and folliculitis.  It is not overly drying and does not smell.  Great product for everyday control and proper cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that works consistently.</li>
            <li> Getting harder to locate in stores. A must have for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product and swears by it.</li>
            <li> a miracle! the only product that is able to keep my acne under control. will continue to buy. It has left my skin feeling smooth as if blemishes were not even a problem to begin with.</li>
