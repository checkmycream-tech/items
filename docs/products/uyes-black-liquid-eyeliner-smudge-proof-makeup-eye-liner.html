            <li>/&gt;Whatever the case may be, I learned my lesson about straying from what I know and love.  </li>

            <li>i love this stuff worth the money</li>
            <li>I finally found a great replacement eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It also feels comfortable on and not itchy.</li>
            <li>It came surprisingly early, which is always good.</li>
            <li>i went out for 7 hours and it stayed fresh!</li>
            <li>I seriously love this eyeliner, goes on smooth, bold and beautiful black, does NOT smudge even after spending 6 hours hiking in the hot sun.</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase more.</li>
            <li>I mean I wouldn&#x27;t call it OMG the best eyeliner out there</li>
            <li>I really like how it doesn&#x27;t smudge and easy to put on.</li>
            <li>but you have to work kind of fast as it tends to dry kind of fast.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge it is a very nice black color.</li>
            <li>It stays put and doesn&#x27;t budge, it&#x27;ll be great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>So overall an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Got here super fast!</li>
            <li>Arrived pretty quickly through US mail.</li>
            <li>It glides on smooth drys pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Very good.. last long no running down .. look good all time ..</li>
            <li>its really good for my sensitive eyes since i have sensitive skin and cant really wear make up.</li>
            <li>but if you are more advanced this makes it a lot harder to do wings.</li>
            <li>and I love the packaging with the cute little monkey :3.</li>
            <li>Eyeliner tends to last most of the day</li>
            <li>I definitely intend on purchasing more.</li>
            <li>Liquid goes on smooth, only takes 1 layer, and bold.</li>
            <li>easy to apply unlike others that smear instantly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s liquid and goes on easily and makes your eyes look bigger!</li>
            <li>Very disapointed that this is what they sent me when I paid for the product.</li>
            <li>It was very blotchy.  </li>
            <li>dont put too much liquid on at a time, and do put it too close to your eyelid because it WILL get into your eye..</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t really beat the price</li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t fit the same to screw it on</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother really.</li>
            <li>I normally do not apply liquid eyeliner in my eye but this product is great give you enough to make your eyes look bigger distributes evenly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good solid black color, but sometimes when I come home from school and look at it it kinda peels and bunches at the thinnest part.</li>
            <li>I love the black color it has.</li>
            <li>The applicator is very firm which makes it very easy to apply the eye liner</li>
            <li>I normally use MAC or Stila cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>I normally have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If you are new to liquid liner I would recommend getting this brand.</li>
            <li>My easy fix was to take the lid/wand/applicator that I was using previously on my eyeliner that run out and use it with this eyeliner liquid.</li>
            <li>And Wild after this one!</li>
            <li>Smooth slightly shiny</li>
            <li>Nothing bad about this product in my opinion, I would definitely recommend and I would re-purchase this eyeliner! :D</li>
            <li>It is also really black and the monkey on the packaging is really cute.</li>
            <li>other stuff in this company&#x27;s line seems identical but just comes in various other cute bottles.  </li>
            <li>i switched right back over to Wet</li>
            <li>This is a very black bold eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It came really early and was a present for my friend.</li>
            <li>Only their liquid last line works for me, but it is $$$ with a soft brush and is much gooier in consistency, which makes application a bit harder (I use that for swimming &amp; snowboarding).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really black and dry, after I apply to my eyelid nothing came out to the bottle.</li>

            <li> You can also wash it off with your usual cleanser and gentle rubbing.  </li>
            <li> Only problem though is that the tip gets dull a little bit after few times of using, and makes it a bit challenging to draw.</li>
            <li> other liquid eyeliner would smudge underneath my eye making it much more difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> but it screws a little to keep closed and not dry out</li>
            <li> Only problem I have is it does tend to smudge just a little sometimes.</li>
            <li> and I really did expect it to be worse.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s still wet</li>
            <li> I tried liquid eyeliner a long time ago &amp; didnt like it,so I was a little hesitant about this</li>
            <li> but I got it the other day</li>
            <li> i got a small pink pen type that dried out in a few days!</li>
            <li> I opened up the product and it was dried on the applicator and nothing else would come out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very black color .</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t glide on like my usual eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> I will stop by Target and spend five dollars for my usual eyeliner from now on.</li>
            <li> Its a bit of a small bottle</li>
            <li> Usually eyeliners will be off</li>
            <li> The brush was too stiff, and it doesn&#x27;t give a thick look when you apply.looks like a water color with water.</li>
            <li> The brush is a too hard like a marker tip....</li>
            <li> n kinda hard to get off the eyelashes.</li>
            <li> There is a little weird smell to the eyeliner</li>
            <li> The felt tip brush can make both really thin lines and thick lines.</li>
            <li> it is very poorly made.</li>
            <li> Who knows, maybe I got a bad batch?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I had a terrible night.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> i got something that was NOT what was in this picture!!!! i got a small pink pen type that dried out in a few days! TOTALY RIP OFF!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really black and dry, after I apply to my eyelid nothing came out to the bottle. It&#x27;s k wort to try. I won&#x27;t recommended.</li>
            <li> I opened up the product and it was dried on the applicator and nothing else would come out. Very disapointed that this is what they sent me when I paid for the product. Threw it out.</li>
            <li> Very good.. last long no running down .. look good all time .. its been a year and it still works love it..</li>
            <li> I have been using Revlon Color Stay liquid eyeliner for years and stuck with it because it was what I wanted for the price; however, this eyeliner had mostly good reviews so I decided to give it shot.  I&#x27;m sorely disappointed.  I shook it up just in case of separation and whatnot but this eyeliner is watery.  It didn&#x27;t glide on like my usual eyeliner.  It was very blotchy.  Who knows, maybe I got a bad batch?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the case may be, I learned my lesson about straying from what I know and love.  I will stop by Target and spend five dollars for my usual eyeliner from now on.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you are looking for water resistant eyeliner. When I sweat, I got &amp;#34;smoked eyes&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Its very good eyeliner. Smooth slightly shiny but you have to work kind of fast as it tends to dry kind of fast. I love it!  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> My daughter  loves this eye liner and she us a wing junkie.</li>
            <li> best eye liner i have bought i will no longer change eye liners again this stays on all day&lt;br /&gt;and all night mine stayed on untill the next day and i still had to wash it off i love this stuff worth the money</li>
            <li> I really like how it doesn&#x27;t smudge and easy to put on. I would recommend this to anyone. Also it looks great!</li>
            <li> I finally found a great replacement eyeliner. It stays put and doesn&#x27;t budge, it&#x27;ll be great for everyday use. Super happy with how it turned out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed white/chinese so have some overlap on my eyelid.  I normally use MAC or Stila cosmetics.  I have tried the MAC paint pots for years but they smudge by the end of the day.  Only their liquid last line works for me, but it is $$$ with a soft brush and is much gooier in consistency, which makes application a bit harder (I use that for swimming &amp; snowboarding).  The Stila stuff is OK, but is $$$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff comes with a foam applicator brush which creates a great line, and lasts all day.  You can also wash it off with your usual cleanser and gentle rubbing.  I normally have very sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t given me any grief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other stuff in this company&#x27;s line seems identical but just comes in various other cute bottles.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to give this a shot.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is very easy to apply. I use it daily and it is waterproof which is nice. Great price!</li>
            <li> I love this. Its a bit of a small bottle but.. I do like it. It works well and its just what I was looking for. Only problem I have is it does tend to smudge just a little sometimes.</li>
            <li> So i have had this liquid eyeliner for quite some time now and its amazing for the price. The felt tip brush can make both really thin lines and thick lines. It is also really black and the monkey on the packaging is really cute. So overall an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This arrived in the mail yesterday. The brush is a too hard like a marker tip.... WARNING.. dont put too much liquid on at a time, and do put it too close to your eyelid because it WILL get into your eye.. I had a terrible night. lol But the line looks very nice on my eye.</li>
            <li> I mean I wouldn&#x27;t call it OMG the best eyeliner out there but I was pleased with the results and price. Got here super fast!</li>
            <li> If you are new to liquid liner I would recommend getting this brand. The applicator is very firm which makes it very easy to apply the eye liner but if you are more advanced this makes it a lot harder to do wings. Eyeliner tends to last most of the day but if you have oily eyelids like I do you will get some creases by the end of the day. All in all you can&#x27;t really beat the price and I really did expect it to be worse.</li>
            <li> It came surprisingly early, which is always good. It&#x27;s a good solid black color, but sometimes when I come home from school and look at it it kinda peels and bunches at the thinnest part. I&#x27;ve had it for about five months, so it lasts a good while if you use it moderately. The applicator started stringing, but it only happened twice. Nonetheless, an excellent product.</li>
            <li> The brush was too stiff, and it doesn&#x27;t give a thick look when you apply.looks like a water color with water.</li>
            <li> I am so particular about my eyeliner and this one is perfect and easy to apply. I will certainly purchase more.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner, it arrived in week or so and I love the packaging with the cute little monkey :3. It seems like a big bottle for liquid eyeliner! It doesn&#x27;t smudge it is a very nice black color. The applicator brush makes it easy to get the shape of eyeliner you want!!! :) Also very easy removal, it stays on the lid when removed for the most part other liquid eyeliner would smudge underneath my eye making it much more difficult to get off. Nothing bad about this product in my opinion, I would definitely recommend and I would re-purchase this eyeliner! :D</li>
            <li> I have finally found an eyeliner that does not run or smudge. This is the best product that I have found, there may be others out there but I do not know of them so I will keep using and buying this brand.</li>
            <li> I tried liquid eyeliner a long time ago &amp; didnt like it,so I was a little hesitant about this but I got it the other day &amp; I LOVE it.. No complaints at all.. great eyeliner</li>
            <li> This cheap eyeliner works fantastic! It does what it claims! No smudge at all, not even after wearing it all day. I love it! And it does not sting my eyes either. Only problem though is that the tip gets dull a little bit after few times of using, and makes it a bit challenging to draw.</li>
            <li> Commodity excellent try it was very elegant and beautiful</li>
            <li> This is actually my first liquid eye liner and i am impressed by how smooth and easy applying it is! When it&#x27;s still wet it comes off easily with water so one mistake doesn&#x27;t ruin everything. It also feels comfortable on and not itchy.</li>
            <li> easy to apply unlike others that smear instantly. Would recommend... this eyeliner requires steady hands which is great for my daughter</li>
            <li> makes me panda eyes couple hours later..T.T</li>
            <li> So this has been the BEST eyeliner i&#x27;ve bought EVER! As soon as it came in I of course tried it on and its just perfect!! it goes on smoothly! doesn&#x27;t run and STAYS on! best part is that its not hard to wash off!</li>
            <li> This is a very black bold eyeliner. Liquid goes on smooth, only takes 1 layer, and bold. I don&#x27;t like the applicator tip at all. My easy fix was to take the lid/wand/applicator that I was using previously on my eyeliner that run out and use it with this eyeliner liquid. It don&#x27;t fit the same to screw it on but it screws a little to keep closed and not dry out (I hope this makes sense lol). There is a little weird smell to the eyeliner but that&#x27;s no biggie to me as foundations some times have smells to them. I would recommend this and purchase again! Great price too!</li>
            <li> Great price. Doesn&#x27;t smudge. Love the applicator brush. Arrived pretty quickly through US mail. It&#x27;s a very black color . No complaints on my end. I definitely intend on purchasing more.</li>
            <li> i switched right back over to Wet And Wild after this one! it is very poorly made. Don&#x27;t bother really.</li>
            <li> It came really early and was a present for my friend. She absolutely LOVED the product a lot! It&#x27;s a very great eyeliner. It&#x27;s liquid and goes on easily and makes your eyes look bigger! I love the black color it has. Also, it&#x27;s smudge proof and I highly reccomend this to people who are looking for a cheap, excellent eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Amazing product for the price! I seriously love this eyeliner, goes on smooth, bold and beautiful black, does NOT smudge even after spending 6 hours hiking in the hot sun.</li>
            <li> It works really good buts it not want i though if would be but if works good doe but it works good but it works good i dont know what else to say about this eyeliner doe</li>
            <li> It glides on smooth drys pretty fast. its really good for my sensitive eyes since i have sensitive skin and cant really wear make up. I have been looking for the perfect eyeliner to do my wing and corners. The only thing is it clumps my eyelashes together n kinda hard to get off the eyelashes. But i like it n will buy again</li>
            <li> I have used every type of liner there is, when I tell you this is the best.....TRUST ME! Usually eyeliners will be off n gone by the 4th hour i went out for 7 hours and it stayed fresh! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. i will be ordering again!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful Tip: For a bolder all day look use gel eyeliner under it!</li>
            <li> nice fluid line, i love it, now i can make the perfect cateye i always fail at doing, great make up tool!!</li>
            <li> I normally do not apply liquid eyeliner in my eye but this product is great give you enough to make your eyes look bigger distributes evenly</li>
