            <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>

            <li>Wonderful and pure Aloe.</li>

            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>My skin was smooth and the bumpy of my skin seemed to be greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>Then I decided to add it to my homemade flaxseed gel and it is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>so the effect is not so amazing but</li>
            <li>I really liked this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll rather make my own.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>Nice gel.</li>
            <li>I use this Aloe Vera to make my own vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>It was also nice and cooling since I keep it refrigerated (as the bottle recommends).</li>
            <li>This is a really nice product.</li>
            <li>I make my own hair care products.  </li>
            <li>Inexpensive and effective.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it won&#x27;t be as effective.  </li>
            <li>I liked the product...</li>

            <li>Loving it.</li>
            <li>smells nice.</li>
            <li>A good review is still pending upon more use.</li>
            <li>my own fault I guess..</li>
            <li>Great feel, nice and cool</li>
            <li>if this organic, chemical free, wonderful aloe vera works great on me, it will certainly work fabulous on you!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure most of their product are also good.</li>
            <li>I put this stuff in the fridge and it feels great and promotes quick healing.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!  : )</li>
            <li>This is by far THE best Aloe on the market.  </li>
            <li>Really great product and helps my serum stay fresh longer.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best aloe I have used for my skin.</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin feels great!</li>
            <li>The best bottled item I&#x27;ve tried so far is an 8oz bottle of aloe vera from AloeLife which uses seaweed as a thickening agent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would have been nice</li>
            <li>They felt, in most cases, in children, warts will go away in their own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like juice, kind of runny, but that&#x27;s how aloe vera is in nature.</li>
            <li>It was nice not to swell up like a balloon that time :)</li>
            <li>I like how light it feels on my face, but it does not have the most pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always great to find something that really works!</li>
            <li>Went on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Came on time and is very cheap.</li>
            <li>so I put some on every day for about 4 days and there was a huge improvement!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many kinds.</li>
            <li>There are  many things you can do with aloe Vera gel</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another Ideal gifts for beauty and health conscious.</li>
            <li>It safe and healthy.</li>
            <li>However, aloe vera is one of many ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>If I use alcohol based toner/astrigent, the alcolol dries out my skin even more.</li>
            <li>so I waited a couple more minutes to see if it would go away.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I bought this product expecting it to have a more gel like consistency</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t stand it unless I put a separate cream on top of it to cover up the smell.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>more liquid than gel consistency.  </li>
            <li>You can use this stuff for a lot more things.</li>
            <li>I love that its 100% organic as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great all-around moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good for itchy skin, whether it is from sunburn or just a rash or hives, since it helps calm irritation.</li>
            <li>, I just wish it moisturized my skin a bit more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>But its more over my mistake in not reading the product description well.</li>
            <li>thank-you !! :)</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say how well it does on burns, but I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look so healthy.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 more bottles of this because i don&#x27;t ever want to run out..</li>
            <li>I introduced to my family members, now they started to use and love it.</li>
            <li>As for the &amp;#34;consistency&amp;#34; though, I was expecting something more like gel.</li>
            <li>and I love that there aren&#x27;t a bunch of chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t leave this bottle on its side and have to make sure it remains upright because the liquid seeps out between the bottle top and the bottle.  </li>
            <li>so i didn&#x27;t end up satisfied, but the product came as described.</li>
            <li>I was truly amazed and satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Not sticky like so many</li>
            <li>It has also been used to treat sunburns and is SO much better than the store bought lotions and gels.</li>
            <li>This is the next best thing to have if you cannot have an Aloe Vera plant in your house :)</li>
            <li>It is too runny but it&#x27;s still ok.</li>
            <li>and it many cases it cures acne.</li>
            <li>I love to use this on my face.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Let’s just say it’s more comparable to water than gel or face lotion literally.</li>
            <li>and I use mostly organic products.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more like a juice I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li>I hear that Aloe Vera has many uses</li>
            <li>So cooling and really refreshing.</li>
            <li>Be sure to keep this in the fridge.</li>
            <li>I use this in my hair and i love the look.</li>
            <li>Was hoping for more of a gel texture to make hand sanitizer with my girl scouts.</li>
            <li>Being summer, it makes it easier to keep the bandages on during the day, and making sure if they fall off, they are replaced immediately.</li>
            <li>She has been better about telling me when one falls off.</li>
            <li>The more diligent you are the better</li>

            <li>I have been using it since then and trust me, I love it.</li>
            <li>:) I bought both of those together and have been using it since then.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is way better ,,,&lt;br</li>
            <li>its ok</li>
            <li>:) very fast shipping , the bottle was in good condition .</li>
            <li>Much cheaper, more effective!</li>
            <li>A pretty good product for the price.</li>
            <li>Plus it feels nice and cool when applied.</li>
            <li>Its pretty good stuff.  </li>
            <li>doesnt dry too much just perfect for a good night sleep...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how wonderful it is to hear that as lupus has aged me</li>
            <li>Bought to use on my face, and so far it&#x27;s doing a great job.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great to use on my natural coily hair to give it moisture.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and fresh and leaves our skin</li>
            <li>I am very happy that it does not have all the additives and preservatives that other aloe gels have.  </li>
            <li>and it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to work with</li>
            <li>It does not leave any residue and it absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is easy to spread over my skin and it is not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>The real stuff is amazing, I love it.</li>
            <li>Perhaps with a longer amount of time and more applications in a day, we would ha had more success....</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using this aloe internally to help with absorption of supplements, then I&#x27;m sure it is great.</li>
            <li>but the scent of tea tree oil was too strong for her.</li>
            <li>And I am sure, that in most cases, he was right.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected--a nice aloe Vera that absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>I have it in the fridge as many suggested and it does cool your irritated scalp faster.</li>
            <li>worked fine.</li>
            <li>I needed a sealant for my daughters 3b fine hair.</li>
            <li>But I put it in a fine mist spray bottle and used it that way.  </li>
            <li>Pure aloe has done amazing things for my health.</li>
            <li>Excellent product - actually is 100% pure.  </li>
            <li>This has done wonders for her, leaving her scar free.  </li>
            <li>Very Watery but nice product</li>
            <li>Great product, already bought a second bottle!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using on my face as a toner and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it make my skin look smooth without wrinkle and touched like baby skin.</li>
            <li>I use it along with a drop of tea tree oil and it is amazing how much my pores have shrunk.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff, I use it all the time, especially after sun exposure.</li>
            <li>This Aloe Vera is so smooth.</li>
            <li>Chem/Preservative free.</li>
            <li>It is a fantastic conductor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and will definitely recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This stuff made my hair so soft, and made my scalp feel so good.  </li>
            <li>I read that Aloe Vera was a good natural way to grow thicker hair faster.</li>
            <li>What you get is pure aloe vera with just a bit of natural grapeseed extract in it (which is also good for your skin!).</li>
            <li>Put on right after being in the sun to keep your skin healthy and pain free.</li>
            <li>She is being cooperative with this treatment since it doesn&#x27;t not hurt or smell, and is fairly quick and easy.</li>
            <li>As it turns out, it is much much nicer than the gel.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not sticky, makes skin feel very soft, and it worked great for moisturizing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As this one was too watery, I tried using it as my regular toner and it works amazing!  </li>
            <li>Plus its not really thick to cover a wound area effectively, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>In it&#x27;s most basic form, Aloe Vera is a most potent sticky, pus-like liquid.</li>
            <li>In it&#x27;s most basic form, Aloe Vera is a most potent sticky, pus-like liquid.</li>
            <li>Great for slathering on after a long day in the sun.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to buy this .</li>
            <li>it is cool and available any time.</li>
            <li>and I noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the cost!</li>
            <li>Aubrey Organics 100% Pure Aloe Vera is a great natural product to have if you&#x27;re suffering from acne or want to help fade blemishes or to add moisture to your hair when combined with bentonite clay.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s pure aloe, which is very important for me, but I wish it were a tid thicker.</li>
            <li>Most of what has been available to me has been in gel form, but I use those with much trepidation and discomfort.</li>
            <li>I found a 16 oz  product that is very similar here on Amazon that was much more cost effective.</li>
            <li>This is easily done and certainly worth</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin and acne</li>
            <li>Works great for dry itchy skin and scalp or whatever you want to use it for.</li>
            <li>Shake to combine, then pat onto damp, clean skin.</li>
            <li>Im glad i got it because my hair feels more alive..</li>
            <li>This is a very liquid product, not gel-like, it pours very easily out of the bottle, smooths onto the skin well and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Get this if you are looking for pure aloe vera, it&#x27;s so much better for you than anything you can buy at drugstores.</li>
            <li>Many people are under the mistaken impression that this is 100% pure aloe vera from the plant.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many Aloe Vera products that were supposed to be 100% Organic and nothing compares to Aubrey Organics Pure Aloe Vera Tonic.</li>
            <li>I love that it is pure aloe Vera</li>
            <li>I love that this is basically pure aloe.</li>
            <li>It truly is pure, so make sure you refrigerate it.</li>
            <li>When I searched on Amazon for 100% pure aloe vera, that is what I was looking for, and this is the item that came to the top of the search.</li>
            <li>I love this product but it is not 100% pure aleo vera like it says.</li>
            <li>It is clean, quick, absorbent and efficient.</li>
            <li>I have been browsing for 100% aloe vera products and came across this one with good enough reviews.</li>
            <li>vitamin e. Aloe has a good smell, especially after I remove from Ref.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  I still really like this product but I will say that the bottle top now leaks.  </li>
            <li>Good for sunburn as well as just regular moisturizing and itch relief.</li>
            <li>(The wart of my finger tip did a fair amount of flaking, but then the entire tip of my finger sort of fell off.</li>
            <li>(The wart of my finger tip did a fair amount of flaking, but then the entire tip of my finger sort of fell off.</li>
            <li>I tried coconut oil, shea butter, argan oil, maracuja oil, and sweet almond oil.  </li>
            <li>It is also the only solution that felt good with application.  </li>
            <li>The aloe felt cool and soothing upon application, whereas the creams and oils burned and itched.  </li>
            <li>After laser hair removal treatment on Brazilian and full legs, my skin is so tender and inflamed.</li>
            <li>Also says to keep refrigerated, and I like the cool sensation.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use regular moisturizer because they cause me to break out, so, I have used aloe Vera as my after-wash moisturizer since ever, and this is one of the good ones I have come across.</li>
            <li>I knew something had to be good about it because I took the last tube in the store!</li>
            <li>I am using theis product to cool the effects of radiation treatment for skin cancer on my lip and chin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it on my face as a light moisturizer and it immediately gives your skin a fresh glowing look.</li>
            <li>Product ok but the real aloe vera leaves that you buy in supermarket</li>
            <li>Not a bad product.</li>
            <li>that being said, this is not a bad product.</li>
            <li>It is a liquid which makes it pretty easy to gel.</li>
            <li>My toddler had a burn, this help to soothe and heal it very nicely with minimal scarring.</li>
            <li>Mixes great with my other products</li>
            <li>You could add other scents like peppermint and lemongrass also and that would be great for the summer for invigorating fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is also great for lots of other things as well.  </li>
            <li>Good product, for the most part its exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>All I want is 100% aloe vera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since finding this particular product, I keep one bottle on the frig door at all times for a more immediate cooling, soothing effect.</li>
            <li>Gets the job done quickly and cleanly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I put this on with some vitamin E oil and it heals him up quick.</li>
            <li>quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable because it&#x27;s all natural and safe to use on animals.</li>
            <li>So while I&#x27;m still on the hunt for my mild acne</li>
            <li>I use a mild organic unscented liquid Dr Bronner&#x27;s Castile soap for a face wash, and diluted Apple Cider Vinegar for toner.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for being an honest solution to sunburn, chemical burn, blotches, etc...</li>
            <li>It helps to lightly pat the skin after application, seems to help absorption, which is very fast and doesn&#x27;t leave any film on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also I highly recommend keeping it refrigerated as the consistency is better to work with.</li>
            <li>This works good on my hands &amp; face for minor blems &amp; growths.  </li>
            <li>Much too watery and easily spills when trying to apply some.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I apply it to my face every morning, and my skin is very soft and well moisturized, and now windburn is no longer a concern :)</li>
            <li>This combination is very effective at calming down inflammation and to help the healing process.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very cooling and feels great on dry damaged skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for every sking type, not only dry, it helps to cure some scars after spots.</li>
            <li>I love this as a general all over the face moisturizer, now that it is summer in Baltimore, this is the perfect moisturizer, it only requires a nickel size amount, and keeps the skin balanced, especially on the dog days of humid temperatures!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and very light and keeps the moisture in.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy/curly hair that gets really frizzy in the summer humidity, but this seems to keep it in control.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely a bit more liquid-y than your average aloe vera gel, but that&#x27;s a good thing!  </li>
            <li>, it dries good and does not feel strange on my skin, I cannot say it is good for the healing because I have use other items also with it, but there is some relief.  </li>
            <li>Yesterday my daughter came home with a sunburn on her shoulders and back and still it didn&#x27;t take much to give her a nice light coat of aloe.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this to make an amazing facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I used this product to help calm my skin after waxing</li>
            <li>I love the consistency of this 100% natural product.....not sticky.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft, elastic and healthy looking, from chin to toe nails.</li>
            <li>The dogs&#x27; pads are now soft, pliant and healthy.</li>
            <li>However, How can they call it 100% aloe vera when the ingredients clearly state more than aloe in it.</li>
            <li>I also use it as toner in the morning, it makes me look fresh and moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>It is like a thicker fluid and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great daily hair moisturizer for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I really love the fact that this totally natural and organic.</li>
            <li>an \\&quot;aloe\\&quot; that is natural... lighter... non greasy...quickly absorbent... makes your skin softer :)    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I use the actually Aloe from the plant itself.</li>
            <li>But this product comes in handy when I dont feel like taking out the time to cut open the plants and do all that</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m probably going to get my next batch from Mountain Rose Herbs.</li>
            <li>Worth buying it...</li>
            <li>The only drawbacks are needing to refrigerate it, though my hand wash is holding up nicely in the bathroom, but that adds to the belief that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li>This product has been the only thing to keep my face moisturized all day without any kind of oily residue.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY fine hair, and most products weigh it down.</li>
            <li>Great for acne prone skin, really calms and soothes inflammation after I give myself a peel, or other skin treatments.</li>
            <li>This went rancid super fast!</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and although you feel like you are only putting water on (because it is a fine, clear liquid), you notice the effect of it being more than water right away.  </li>
            <li>at all aloe is supposed to  moisturize and heal right</li>
            <li>Right after I was my face morning and night</li>
            <li>Says that right on the bottle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like you have to refrigerate it because I forget to use it unless it is right in front of me.</li>
            <li>It had a slight smell to it that wasn&#x27;t pleasant</li>
            <li>Love that it is organic and simple, does not have an ingredient list full of chemical preservatives.</li>
            <li>The rash will never go away but my dry skin and scales that come from the rash are infinitely better!</li>
            <li>Very pure aloe.  </li>
            <li>So far the best aloe vera I&#x27;ve tried came directly from aloe vera leaves that a neighbor grows,but has a very limited supply...</li>
            <li>So far this has shown the most positive progress.</li>
            <li>Short of trying to keep an aloe plant alive, this is the next best thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its gentle and cool on the eyes while wiping you face.</li>
            <li>Nothing better than Pure Aloe Vera, to soothe sensitive or irritated skin.  </li>
            <li>; countless uses; excellent results; ease of use; easily stored; lasts a long time; good value for the price; non-toxic, safe, no chemicals, preservatives or bad stuff in it at all.</li>
            <li>, I certainly wish I hadn&#x27;t waited all these years to try it!  </li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s 100% pure!</li>
            <li>First I don&#x27;t like the texture, then I find the texture is wonderfully mix and contain moisturize with a few drops of essential oils.</li>
            <li>The price is very much affordable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Price was very reasonable...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on burns, minor skin irritations and it even makes personal hygiene after bowel movements much more comfortable and pleasant by applying it on toilet paper or cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li>mom is a chef and often gets burns on her face from hot oil splashing.  </li>
            <li>This is what made me a believer in Aloe in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aubreys is liquidy because there are no additives that make it gel</li>
            <li>but i guess that&#x27;s what you pay for higher quality product.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels exactly like water.</li>
            <li>I guess I should have read the reviews first.  </li>
            <li>With the first application, the immediate burning sensation was lessened by the coldness of the liquid since my alos vera had been in the fridge.  </li>
            <li>Finally got this and in TWO DAYS it was so much better as to pretty much be called WELL!  </li>
            <li>I will be going back to buying aloe gel capsules from the drugstore since there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a better option.</li>
            <li>so I use this instead (used to use a aloe vera gel that works pretty well too, but this is way better) and my face is starting to look like me again!</li>
            <li>I think it would be better for me to just purchase the actual aloe vera plant.</li>
            <li>shipping was as much as product!  </li>
            <li>Just a note, though - that the consistency is runny exactly like water</li>
            <li>FYI more fluid than gel.</li>
            <li>But the design of the opener needs some skill to navigate: First, shake the bottle.</li>
            <li>and I can really tell that they have faded!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really find it that useful for that</li>
            <li>Skin just drinks it up and feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I really do love how it has left my skin feeling.</li>
            <li>this product is pretty watery and not gel like.</li>
            <li>but it is the first</li>
            <li>This has been my go-to face moisturizer, as it&#x27;s light and natural.</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;m writing a review based of AMAZON Aubrey&#x27;s organic aloe vera.</li>
            <li>Really really really like this product!</li>
            <li>You will most likely use it for something.</li>
            <li>Must have for your first aid kit</li>
            <li>And I am sure if we have left over, we will find use for it one way or another.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if they had been treated, when first requested, we may not be going through this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took some convincing to allow my daughter to give it a try, but when she finally came on board.</li>
            <li>It took some convincing to allow my daughter to give it a try, but when she finally came on board.</li>
            <li>Finally after many months of itching and pain, I saw online recommendations to try aloe vera for eczema.  </li>
            <li>Got it fast too!</li>
            <li>Can be worn under makeup and leaves skin incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am pretty allergic to bee stings, but when I got stung I decided to put some on the sting before I headed to the hospital</li>
            <li>I will definitely get more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different oils</li>
            <li>I use this as a daily moisturizer, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>The product is recommended to be refridgerated after first use and seems to truly keep alot of it&#x27;s intended effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Also this smells like a real aloe vera plant!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks. :)</li>
            <li>will definitely order more</li>
            <li>Of course, because it is so natural and has no added chemicals to make it more consistent, it is basically liquid, but it&#x27;s not hard to apply on face or hair or body.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing straight out of the bottle (which has a push-up type spout for releasing a small amount at a time) at room temp or can be kept in the frig for a more cooling, soothing immediate effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works very well as a light moisturizer for my sensitive combination skin, which is prone to irritation and redness.</li>
            <li>It does a great job with my acne as well, which is what I mainly purchased this for, helping to minimize the acne altogether as well as reduce redness without much aid as I only use an acne face cleanser once a day in the morning and a regular face cleanser at night.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft, clean, and supple.</li>
            <li>My plant just doesn&#x27;t grow fast enough for my needs (I use it in lotion mostly.)</li>
            <li>Not only has the scar faded and feels softer, but the aloe works as a GREAT moisturizer for my very sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li>Two days after receiving this product, while frying bread for Indian tacos, my tongs slipped out of my hand while lifting bread out of the oil and splattered a large amount of hot oil onto my stove and hand.</li>
            <li>product is AMAZING on acne scars and active cystic acne since aloe is antibacterial so is vitamin E. Dark spots are lightened amazingly with this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal - it&#x27;s watery because aloe really is that way!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much like pouring water on your hands and then applying it.  </li>
            <li>Its very liquidy which concerned me at first</li>
            <li>For the price, I would probably not buy it again since I can get a giant fresh aloe stalk at my local farmers market for about $1.75, but while I have it, I think it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li>Combine 1/4 C aloe with 1 TBSP vegetable glycerine (Frontier makes a good one) in a small glass bottle or jar.</li>
            <li>So, while natural is awesome, I opted to go with a different product that has a tiny preservative instead for future use.</li>
            <li>Keep selling and keep your high standards of success toward getting the real aloe ingredients.</li>
            <li>My skin&#x27;s super sensitive-</li>
            <li>Use it a lot in winter also for dry skin, works better then some lotions.</li>
            <li>It is not 100% Pure or even close.</li>
            <li>This is not correct even though this is advertised as 100% pure aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li>A product advertised as 100% pure aloe vera gel should contain 100% aloe vera.</li>
            <li>I want to know what % of this product is pure aloe vera?</li>
            <li>This stuff is about as pure as one can find.</li>
            <li>My vet suggested 100% pure aloe vera.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for  pure aloe vera for a while.</li>
            <li>I looked for pure aloe vera.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to me that it wasn&#x27;t pure gel.  </li>
            <li>This product is NOT 100% Pure Aloe Vera - it&#x27;s a lie!!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for pure aloe vera, this is not it.</li>
            <li>Not 100% pure aloe.  </li>
            <li>4 oz Gel Pure Aloe Vera&amp;#34; - but it is NOT a gel at all.</li>
            <li>It is a PURE Liquid... as watery as it could be, and a bit sticky...</li>
            <li>of course not 100% pure</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you want pure aloe vera without the added chemicals!</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it will help my sons skin clear up, delivery was great.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it is more of a water-feeling clear liquid and not a thick gel.</li>
            <li>I did not know there was so much difference in 100% pure aloe vera and product you buy over the counter.  </li>
            <li>it is not too expensive like brand name skin care but very good efficient.</li>
            <li>you can get in whole food market only 7 dollars... but this product this really good, but thin as i thought before, it is really pure and natural, gentle, i have really sensitive skin, overally, its really good.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I bought this Aloe Vera tonic at the Whole Foods Market.  </li>
            <li>This is the all-around soothing, healer.</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>my face is much smoother and there is zero irritation.</li>
            <li>no longer itch as much.</li>
            <li>but it also didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this after brushing my face with a gentle cleanser and exfoliating brush.</li>
            <li>I got a very think</li>
            <li>I like the coolness of the very moment that i put it on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Also, it says to keep it refrigerated, which also indicates it&#x27;s real aloe and that will prolong its usage.  </li>
            <li>Seems to go fast.</li>
            <li>I bought this for post-pregnancy stretch marks and it has been working really well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It works very well and keeps the skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>When we were out, we used the real Aloe Vera plant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works very well and keeps the skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li>When we were out, we used the real Aloe Vera plant.  </li>
            <li>This is so much nicer than applying a gel.</li>
            <li>It seems to work very well while my skin healed from sunburn.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin and wanted something that wasn&#x27;t going to really clog my pores.</li>
            <li>and it really helps my skin.</li>
            <li>works really well</li>
            <li>Serves its purpose very well.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t going to expect much from this lil jar, but after 9 days of applying it to my face morning and night&lt;</li>
            <li>Please be advised this is a very watery mixture.  </li>
            <li>This is very liquid like.  </li>
            <li>so I feel it really helped.</li>
            <li>I have to say it worked better than expected</li>
            <li>However, I did not want to use the product I used on my hand because it wasn&#x27;t straight aloe vera but was an aloe vera based gel.  </li>
            <li>Even when the top is closed and fastened.  </li>
            <li>however, it didn&#x27;t really do much for me...</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Mix it with your lotion to apply it easier, it has a very cooling effect.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and product was as described.</li>
            <li>Aubrey Sun Care Aloe Vera Gel really moisturized my skin and cleared up my acne.</li>
            <li>It was watery and I just didn&#x27;t really see the point of this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cooling and leaves my face feeling refreshed and ready for moisturizer..</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really help my skin</li>
            <li>I’m assuming it’s supposed to be very water’ d out if that make sense.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to use cotton wipes or balls because they have so much bacteria on them.</li>
            <li>That alone makes it an absolute keeper in my book.</li>
            <li>Has a much wetter consistency than the aloe gels</li>
            <li>Very watery.</li>
            <li>So if you want a gel dont bother, if you want something very watery-then yes, but I dont know why you would want that.</li>
            <li>This Aloe Vera is very liquidy</li>
            <li>, however I wish it were available in a larger size.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>did show some promising change in the warts, drying them, but did not get rid of them.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, the consistency is very watery, even when you put it in the fridge (which you should do)</li>
            <li>but the scent is now very calming.</li>
            <li>This product works very well for my purposes, which are to make a non-toxic hand wash.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Consistency is very watery, not gel like,</li>
            <li>Very soothing under the eyes.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really tried it on my face</li>
            <li>I picked this up at Whole Foods to treat an oil burn I got cooking in the kitchen</li>
            <li>but these are too greasy for using them before work and just couldn&#x27;t find anything that really moisturized my scalp without making it look greasy until I found this product.</li>
            <li>I had messed with it so much that it had scabbed over.</li>
            <li>Did find it at whole foods market.</li>
            <li>Now day 5 the spots are very drying and every so often I find myself scratching.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face before applying moisturizer and it absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I Use this product to detangle my hair before i put it in the bantu knots, and it works really well</li>
            <li>it is very versatile.</li>
            <li>its real.</li>
            <li>This really worked for me.</li>
            <li>expensive, but safe and effective.  </li>
            <li>It worked alright, but I honestly didn&#x27;t notice a big enough change in my hair to continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>REALLY RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR REAL NATURAL PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>But the kids are busy, so sometimes they don&#x27;t get replaced right away.</li>
            <li>But the kids are busy, so sometimes they don&#x27;t get replaced right away.</li>
            <li>A saturated cotton ball, a quick dab on each paw pad, it is dry and absorbed and they are done.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way which is great</li>
            <li>I do enjoy using this product and it feels good on my skin, makes it a little tight after application</li>
            <li>Third, when you&#x27;re done and close it, use the finger to lick the opener clean....</li>
            <li>So I only use this after shower and when my hands are clean.</li>
            <li>This is one of the only products I have taken the time to give a full review to because I really believe in it.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t had a burn of any type in years, so it went straight into the door of the fridge as I had read a previous purchaser placed hers in the fridge to give the product more of a cooling effect when using.   </li>
            <li>they product is only half as good as it pervious was.</li>
            <li>Highly highly recommended for sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li>Never went back to use a synthetic cream that full of hassle chemicals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a liquid, with the viscosity close to that of water, which surprised me at first..  </li>
            <li>This is used in part of a face mask, and I love the way my skin feels after applying this with other products!</li>
            <li>I like it best when it&#x27;s a little thick.  </li>
            <li>but I mainly use it for my Skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I even gave some to my cat when he was throwing up constantly, and he&#x27;s done better for the last 24 hours</li>
            <li>I have decently oily skin to begin with and this tends to help keep that under control somewhat.</li>
            <li>With all the unnatural ingredients in so many facial care products my face has finally revolted.  </li>
            <li>The price is a bit high</li>
            <li>I just cant speak highly enuff on this product..</li>
            <li>highly reccomend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product for any skin condition.</li>
            <li>What I was so sensitive to with all the other products I tried on the excema was the added ingredients (many are known irritants or cancer threats).  </li>
            <li>Plus its completely natural (unlike many other Aloe Vera gel products).</li>
            <li>I make my own mascara and other make up and this aloe is essential.</li>
            <li>, I just wish I got a little more for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Controlled it a little better than just using acne medicine alone.</li>
            <li>it came 2-3 days early !!</li>
            <li>It should therefore be refrigerated after opening, but i found that it seemed to be just fine for at least a week kept in a cool place but not refrigerated.</li>
            <li>Using them with radiotherapy (together with La Roche Posay B5), easy to apply and works extremely well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to moisturize with something sooo liquidy.</li>
            <li>She uses real aloe vera plants from the garden and applies it directly to her face.  </li>
            <li>, I use it every night on my face, it is very moisturizing and has made a slight improvement on my acne scars and fine lines.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any concrete result yet</li>
            <li>It works though, so it was worth paying double!</li>
            <li>Many people cannot tolerate the harsh effects of Retin-A, the redness etc.  </li>
            <li>past year, I decided to take action on my own.</li>
            <li>It goes on your skin nicely and sinks in completely without the residue that you get from commercial gels.</li>
            <li>If your skin is very sensitive to moisturizers that have alcohol in them,  then use this natural product 99 percent pure.  </li>
            <li>Love this product , my skin feels soft, fairer and less pimples ...</li>
            <li>I mean, perhaps I just kept using it like I was supposed to, but I didn&#x27;t feel or saw any kind of improvement at all.</li>
            <li>A nice pure product, however the consistency is too thin for my use.</li>
            <li>are the NEW INGREDIENTS:</li>
            <li>but this new formula is like acid on my skin.</li>
            <li>you need to use it and dry quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly for me at least, aloe seems to add all the good things back to my skin.</li>
            <li>As far as natural things go, this is the real deal..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, it works wonderfully on sunburns and other minor skin irritations.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>tried all kinds of organic, high end, alcohol-free toners for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this product for about a week, but I&#x27;m comfortable writing the review because it&#x27;s done half of what I needed already - calm my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the product that is as natural is it can get!</li>
            <li>My face has never been so clear and free of acne and other skin problems.</li>
            <li>I just recently starting using it consistently, and ohhh boy do I regret not using it all this time.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it this way a girl stopped me and simply said, &amp;#34;Your hair is perfect&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>As close as you can get to all natural but still has crap,in it!</li>
            <li>All natural and heals everything on your skin!</li>
            <li>Every mark, new and old that it touched, vanished.  </li>
            <li>Also, there was no longer a red mark of any kind on my hand where the oil had landed and no sensitivity to touch or running water as usually follows from these burns.   </li>
            <li>It does take time though - you won&#x27;t have dark spots one night and magically wake up the next day with them all gone.</li>
            <li>and I regretted multiple times as my skin instantly reacted to chemicals, however mild they might be, within one day of switch.  </li>
            <li>mixed this about 60/40 with water, added 2 drops of glycerine, 2 drops of jojoba, and a pinch of pure kaolin clay.  </li>
            <li>I use Aubrey Organics for external use and I also drink Premeier Research Labs AloePro, which is also a pure form of aloe.</li>
            <li>I am using this pure aloe vera as a facial moisturizer for my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>but since you put it in the refrigerator it feels great cold on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>Soothing and clear...</li>
            <li>Nothing worked to clear it up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a clear, watery texture</li>
            <li>/&gt;FYI,  I was surprised at how liquidy this was, basically like water.</li>
            <li>and I have been fighting with adult acne for years.</li>
            <li>Only a day or two, I can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>Aloe vera contains natural anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.</li>
            <li>but my skin is soft.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s about $2 cheaper on Amazon than at my local Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li>Works on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone who is looking for organic aloe; this is as close as it gets next to the real thing.</li>
            <li>but so far I like it a lot.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and I think it even helps prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li>I attempted to use this product in a completely 100% organic lotion, it didn&#x27;t turn out how I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s a natural product, it&#x27;s consistency varies.  </li>
            <li>It helps soften my skin and does wonders for my complexion, even making my cheeks naturally rosy looking.</li>
            <li>All natural.</li>
            <li>After days of research I came across an article for natural remedies for acne or blemishes.</li>
            <li>But my skin is really sensitive, so when I need a break from chemicals, I slather this on to heal my skin.</li>
            <li>I did add it to a few different products, and the one with more preserving natural ingredients is doing well.</li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This stuff comes out like water, so be carefully not to waste it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are using this as a natural remedy.&lt;br /&gt;First of, I have 4 kiddos.</li>
            <li>Having 4 busy kids, I sometimes forget.</li>
            <li>Makes my curls soft and manageable...</li>
            <li>So far it is what it says it is.</li>
            <li>Would not buy again since it is completely overpriced for a liquid.</li>
            <li>I have bought it for all of my sisters with acne prone or sensitive skin, and have continued to buy it for everyone who has come to me with skin problems.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>As stated it&#x27;s pure...as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to go all natural (hair, skin, body, etc.)</li>
            <li>It make my hands really sooth instantly!</li>
            <li>This product is slowly but surely fading the scars on my arms.</li>
            <li>I did exactly as one of the reviewers for this product stated, and poured a little of this on my burn immediately, then waited about 4-5 minutes and poured a little more on it.  </li>
            <li>Closed the 3\\&quot; plug-in metal stem right in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, this product by Aubrey truly is 100% natural and, in my opinion, works better than the other one.</li>
            <li>But other than that, it&#x27;s been helpful and it feels more natural than the other Aloe Vera gel that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>However if you&#x27;re a better consumer than I am and actually read further down in the description, you&#x27;ll see this ingredient list somewhere in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I applied several times the first day, and definitely keep it in the fridge.</li>
            <li>was so surprised to see such a burning red irritation when I purchased 100% PURE aloe.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product for anybody with any skin problems!&lt;br /&gt;I have looked for this product at Whole Foods and other holistic stores and could not find it anywhere.</li>
            <li>What does 100% pure aloe vera gel really mean and how much aloe vera is really in this product?</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really take long either.</li>
            <li>I also put a few drops of lavender essential oil into the bottle so not only does it feel refreshing</li>
            <li>I used Aubrey Organics - 100% Pure Aloe Vera Gel to massage into my leper girlfriend&#x27;s dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used Aubrey Organics - 100% Pure Aloe Vera Gel to massage into my leper girlfriend&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li>I use it for my son&#x27;s eczema it calm down the itching</li>
            <li>Our specialist recently retired and we are waiting on an appointment to a new specialist.</li>
            <li>I think I will be tapping my growing live aloe in the back yard</li>
            <li>cleanse my face, dry off, apply some witch hazel all over, then take this aloe from the fridge &amp; apply it to my whole face (lips too).</li>
            <li>it really soothes my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Just apply some to the affected areas and soothe it right down.</li>
            <li>Calms my skin right down.</li>
            <li>However, I have some acne scarring and after 2 weeks of using this i noticed a major difference in skin evenness and scar fading.</li>
            <li>If it is a more intense burn, I sometimes use the aloe and then a little soaking in cold water for maybe a few minutes and then the aloe again; this solves even the more intense burn.  </li>
            <li>My face feels lightly hydrated without the greasy or heavily wet feeling you get with other products.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find pure organic aloe gel, which is why I bought this bottle in the first place.</li>
            <li>Not really 100% Aloe Vera pure.</li>
            <li>My skin is less oily AND less try, my hyper pigmentation and acne has become more settled.</li>
            <li>Smaller than expected -  hard to push top open and then liquid spills out too fast.  </li>
            <li>watery, haven&#x27;t really used it long enough to know if it works.</li>
            <li>, it never scabbed over, and this morning I can barely see it.</li>
            <li>, it never scabbed over, and this morning I can barely see it.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT MADE MY SKIN RED AND SENSITIVE.</li>
            <li>Either an error, or their definition of &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is far different than mine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this stuff for a couple weeks now, but I&#x27;m noticing marked improvement.</li>
            <li>Bought it to make a DIY lotion with Young Living essential oils.</li>
            <li>I use it after shaving so the cold Aloe feels good.</li>
            <li>The package usually arrives right on time or even early sometimes.</li>
            <li>Seeing how my face revolted with other products I wanted to get pure aloe vera.  </li>
            <li>There are other ingredients but this is the closes I found to pure aleo vera.</li>
            <li>I was looking for pure aloe as opposed to that other stuff</li>
            <li>Even though I had read in previous reviews that it was very liquid, I was still surprised to find out how liquid it was.  </li>
            <li>Hardly any rubbing in, it is more like making one pass with a wet hand</li>
            <li>It smells to me a little funny, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but I don&#x27;t feel it smoothes my skin either...</li>
            <li>It was super runny and when we rubbed it onto our skin, it felt a little slimy and it took a while to dry but was still sticky.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t heal fast and he still has dark marks where the rashes were</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews, but this one was worth it.</li>
            <li>It was much thinner and appeared as if it was watered down.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this 2x daily along with red clay powder masks weekly for a month now and have noticed a major improvement in my skin tone and scarring.</li>
            <li>I had previously bought a &amp;#34;pure natural&amp;#34; aloe very gel by JASON.</li>
            <li>Background:&lt;br /&gt;I am a young Afro caribbean women with hyper pigmentation, and also suffer from a combo of oily and dry skin with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why everyone is saying this is the same consistency as aloe fresh squeezed from the plant.</li>
            <li>I scrunch a little and then spray a little oil or sea salt spray on top, then don&#x27;t touch it until it&#x27;s completely dry.  </li>
            <li>To little product for that much $$$</li>
            <li>I bought some with me on my vacation to Mexico and used it on days when I got a little too much sun.  </li>
            <li>After reading previous reviews that highly praised this for burns, I purchased this over other similar products for its high percentage of aloe vera content.  </li>
            <li>I could have bought one of the cheap aloe vera gels from supermarkets, but I bought this &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; one - WHAT A WASTE!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also great for burns I realized after I stupidly put my hand on a pot that had just been in the oven.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li> This lotion could be a bit more moisturizing, but it has been great for my acne scars, keloid scars, and reducing redness.</li>
            <li> If you are using it alone on your skin or hair, then again, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great.</li>

            <li> Wonderful and pure Aloe.</li>
            <li> I tried pure aloe from the aloe plant and my daughter said it felt perfect</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> My skin was smooth and the bumpy of my skin seemed to be greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to add it to my homemade flaxseed gel and it is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> so the effect is not so amazing but</li>
            <li> I really liked this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll rather make my own.</li>
            <li> Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Nice gel.</li>
            <li> I use this Aloe Vera to make my own vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> It was also nice and cooling since I keep it refrigerated (as the bottle recommends).</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product.</li>
            <li> I make my own hair care products.  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive and effective.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it won&#x27;t be as effective.  </li>
            <li> I liked the product...</li>

            <li> Loving it.</li>
            <li> smells nice.</li>
            <li> A good review is still pending upon more use.</li>
            <li> my own fault I guess..</li>
            <li> Great feel, nice and cool</li>
            <li> if this organic, chemical free, wonderful aloe vera works great on me, it will certainly work fabulous on you!</li>

            <li> I put this stuff in the fridge and it feels great and promotes quick healing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!  : )</li>
            <li> This is by far THE best Aloe on the market.  </li>
            <li> Really great product and helps my serum stay fresh longer.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best aloe I have used for my skin.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin feels great!</li>
            <li> The best bottled item I&#x27;ve tried so far is an 8oz bottle of aloe vera from AloeLife which uses seaweed as a thickening agent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would have been nice</li>
            <li> They felt, in most cases, in children, warts will go away in their own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like juice, kind of runny, but that&#x27;s how aloe vera is in nature.</li>
            <li> It was nice not to swell up like a balloon that time :)</li>
            <li> I like how light it feels on my face, but it does not have the most pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always great to find something that really works!</li>
            <li> Went on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Came on time and is very cheap.</li>
            <li> so I put some on every day for about 4 days and there was a huge improvement!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many kinds.</li>
            <li> There are  many things you can do with aloe Vera gel</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another Ideal gifts for beauty and health conscious.</li>
            <li> It safe and healthy.</li>
            <li> However, aloe vera is one of many ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> If I use alcohol based toner/astrigent, the alcolol dries out my skin even more.</li>
            <li> so I waited a couple more minutes to see if it would go away.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this product expecting it to have a more gel like consistency</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t stand it unless I put a separate cream on top of it to cover up the smell.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> more liquid than gel consistency.  </li>
            <li> You can use this stuff for a lot more things.</li>
            <li> I love that its 100% organic as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a great all-around moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good for itchy skin, whether it is from sunburn or just a rash or hives, since it helps calm irritation.</li>
            <li> , I just wish it moisturized my skin a bit more.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> But its more over my mistake in not reading the product description well.</li>
            <li> thank-you !! :)</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say how well it does on burns, but I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look so healthy.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 more bottles of this because i don&#x27;t ever want to run out..</li>
            <li> I introduced to my family members, now they started to use and love it.</li>
            <li> As for the &amp;#34;consistency&amp;#34; though, I was expecting something more like gel.</li>
            <li> and I love that there aren&#x27;t a bunch of chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t leave this bottle on its side and have to make sure it remains upright because the liquid seeps out between the bottle top and the bottle.  </li>
            <li> so i didn&#x27;t end up satisfied, but the product came as described.</li>
            <li> I was truly amazed and satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Not sticky like so many</li>
            <li> It has also been used to treat sunburns and is SO much better than the store bought lotions and gels.</li>
            <li> This is the next best thing to have if you cannot have an Aloe Vera plant in your house :)</li>
            <li> It is too runny but it&#x27;s still ok.</li>
            <li> and it many cases it cures acne.</li>
            <li> I love to use this on my face.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Let’s just say it’s more comparable to water than gel or face lotion literally.</li>
            <li> and I use mostly organic products.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s more like a juice I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> I hear that Aloe Vera has many uses</li>
            <li> So cooling and really refreshing.</li>
            <li> Be sure to keep this in the fridge.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair and i love the look.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for more of a gel texture to make hand sanitizer with my girl scouts.</li>
            <li> Being summer, it makes it easier to keep the bandages on during the day, and making sure if they fall off, they are replaced immediately.</li>
            <li> She has been better about telling me when one falls off.</li>
            <li> The more diligent you are the better</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve found that using these two together keeps my skin and organs healthy and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love the Aloe Vera and it works.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> (Recipe from Better Basics for the Home by Annie Bond.)</li>
            <li> my face looks better.</li>
            <li> know most people use this for sunburn, burns, bug bites.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and if it ever runs out, I don&#x27;t know what I will do.</li>
            <li> Aloe is created by God and that makes it better and safer to use than any antibacterial that kills off your beneficial bacteria.</li>

            <li> &amp; I love the gel and the juice any aloe that feels</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe my skin already looks way better</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This aloe vera product is more of a liquid than a gel.</li>
            <li> for much better prices.</li>
            <li> Did not expect it to be liquid and thought it was more of a gel.....</li>
            <li> and I have seen many results.</li>
            <li> When it is finish I will order more.</li>
            <li> This is way better for your health and for your skin.</li>
            <li> I have been reading much about aloe and how great it is for skin:</li>
            <li> It is more like a liquid.</li>
            <li> I love this brand.</li>
            <li> Almost out, wife says buy some more...</li>
            <li> I have been using it since then and trust me, I love it.</li>
            <li> :) I bought both of those together and have been using it since then.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is way better ,,,&lt;br</li>
            <li> its ok</li>
            <li> :) very fast shipping , the bottle was in good condition .</li>
            <li> Much cheaper, more effective!</li>
            <li> A pretty good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Plus it feels nice and cool when applied.</li>
            <li> Its pretty good stuff.  </li>
            <li> doesnt dry too much just perfect for a good night sleep...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how wonderful it is to hear that as lupus has aged me</li>
            <li> Bought to use on my face, and so far it&#x27;s doing a great job.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great to use on my natural coily hair to give it moisture.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice and fresh and leaves our skin</li>
            <li> I am very happy that it does not have all the additives and preservatives that other aloe gels have.  </li>
            <li> and it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with</li>
            <li> It does not leave any residue and it absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is easy to spread over my skin and it is not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> The real stuff is amazing, I love it.</li>
            <li> Perhaps with a longer amount of time and more applications in a day, we would ha had more success....</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using this aloe internally to help with absorption of supplements, then I&#x27;m sure it is great.</li>
            <li> but the scent of tea tree oil was too strong for her.</li>
            <li> And I am sure, that in most cases, he was right.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected--a nice aloe Vera that absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> I have it in the fridge as many suggested and it does cool your irritated scalp faster.</li>
            <li> worked fine.</li>
            <li> I needed a sealant for my daughters 3b fine hair.</li>
            <li> But I put it in a fine mist spray bottle and used it that way.  </li>
            <li> Pure aloe has done amazing things for my health.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - actually is 100% pure.  </li>
            <li> This has done wonders for her, leaving her scar free.  </li>
            <li> Very Watery but nice product</li>
            <li> Great product, already bought a second bottle!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using on my face as a toner and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it make my skin look smooth without wrinkle and touched like baby skin.</li>
            <li> I use it along with a drop of tea tree oil and it is amazing how much my pores have shrunk.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, I use it all the time, especially after sun exposure.</li>
            <li> This Aloe Vera is so smooth.</li>
            <li> Chem/Preservative free.</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic conductor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and will definitely recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my hair so soft, and made my scalp feel so good.  </li>
            <li> I read that Aloe Vera was a good natural way to grow thicker hair faster.</li>
            <li> What you get is pure aloe vera with just a bit of natural grapeseed extract in it (which is also good for your skin!).</li>
            <li> Put on right after being in the sun to keep your skin healthy and pain free.</li>
            <li> She is being cooperative with this treatment since it doesn&#x27;t not hurt or smell, and is fairly quick and easy.</li>
            <li> As it turns out, it is much much nicer than the gel.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not sticky, makes skin feel very soft, and it worked great for moisturizing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As this one was too watery, I tried using it as my regular toner and it works amazing!  </li>
            <li> Plus its not really thick to cover a wound area effectively, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> In it&#x27;s most basic form, Aloe Vera is a most potent sticky, pus-like liquid.</li>
            <li> In it&#x27;s most basic form, Aloe Vera is a most potent sticky, pus-like liquid.</li>
            <li> Great for slathering on after a long day in the sun.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to buy this .</li>
            <li> it is cool and available any time.</li>
            <li> and I noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> Aubrey Organics 100% Pure Aloe Vera is a great natural product to have if you&#x27;re suffering from acne or want to help fade blemishes or to add moisture to your hair when combined with bentonite clay.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s pure aloe, which is very important for me, but I wish it were a tid thicker.</li>
            <li> Most of what has been available to me has been in gel form, but I use those with much trepidation and discomfort.</li>
            <li> I found a 16 oz  product that is very similar here on Amazon that was much more cost effective.</li>
            <li> This is easily done and certainly worth</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin and acne</li>
            <li> Works great for dry itchy skin and scalp or whatever you want to use it for.</li>
            <li> Shake to combine, then pat onto damp, clean skin.</li>
            <li> Im glad i got it because my hair feels more alive..</li>
            <li> This is a very liquid product, not gel-like, it pours very easily out of the bottle, smooths onto the skin well and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Get this if you are looking for pure aloe vera, it&#x27;s so much better for you than anything you can buy at drugstores.</li>
            <li> Many people are under the mistaken impression that this is 100% pure aloe vera from the plant.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many Aloe Vera products that were supposed to be 100% Organic and nothing compares to Aubrey Organics Pure Aloe Vera Tonic.</li>
            <li> I love that it is pure aloe Vera</li>
            <li> I love that this is basically pure aloe.</li>
            <li> It truly is pure, so make sure you refrigerate it.</li>
            <li> When I searched on Amazon for 100% pure aloe vera, that is what I was looking for, and this is the item that came to the top of the search.</li>
            <li> I love this product but it is not 100% pure aleo vera like it says.</li>
            <li> It is clean, quick, absorbent and efficient.</li>
            <li> I have been browsing for 100% aloe vera products and came across this one with good enough reviews.</li>
            <li> vitamin e. Aloe has a good smell, especially after I remove from Ref.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  I still really like this product but I will say that the bottle top now leaks.  </li>
            <li> Good for sunburn as well as just regular moisturizing and itch relief.</li>
            <li> (The wart of my finger tip did a fair amount of flaking, but then the entire tip of my finger sort of fell off.</li>
            <li> (The wart of my finger tip did a fair amount of flaking, but then the entire tip of my finger sort of fell off.</li>
            <li> I tried coconut oil, shea butter, argan oil, maracuja oil, and sweet almond oil.  </li>
            <li> It is also the only solution that felt good with application.  </li>
            <li> The aloe felt cool and soothing upon application, whereas the creams and oils burned and itched.  </li>
            <li> After laser hair removal treatment on Brazilian and full legs, my skin is so tender and inflamed.</li>
            <li> Also says to keep refrigerated, and I like the cool sensation.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use regular moisturizer because they cause me to break out, so, I have used aloe Vera as my after-wash moisturizer since ever, and this is one of the good ones I have come across.</li>
            <li> I knew something had to be good about it because I took the last tube in the store!</li>
            <li> I am using theis product to cool the effects of radiation treatment for skin cancer on my lip and chin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my face as a light moisturizer and it immediately gives your skin a fresh glowing look.</li>
            <li> Product ok but the real aloe vera leaves that you buy in supermarket</li>
            <li> Not a bad product.</li>
            <li> that being said, this is not a bad product.</li>
            <li> It is a liquid which makes it pretty easy to gel.</li>
            <li> My toddler had a burn, this help to soothe and heal it very nicely with minimal scarring.</li>
            <li> Mixes great with my other products</li>
            <li> You could add other scents like peppermint and lemongrass also and that would be great for the summer for invigorating fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is also great for lots of other things as well.  </li>
            <li> Good product, for the most part its exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> All I want is 100% aloe vera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since finding this particular product, I keep one bottle on the frig door at all times for a more immediate cooling, soothing effect.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done quickly and cleanly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I put this on with some vitamin E oil and it heals him up quick.</li>
            <li> quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable because it&#x27;s all natural and safe to use on animals.</li>
            <li> So while I&#x27;m still on the hunt for my mild acne</li>
            <li> I use a mild organic unscented liquid Dr Bronner&#x27;s Castile soap for a face wash, and diluted Apple Cider Vinegar for toner.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for being an honest solution to sunburn, chemical burn, blotches, etc...</li>
            <li> It helps to lightly pat the skin after application, seems to help absorption, which is very fast and doesn&#x27;t leave any film on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also I highly recommend keeping it refrigerated as the consistency is better to work with.</li>
            <li> This works good on my hands &amp; face for minor blems &amp; growths.  </li>
            <li> Much too watery and easily spills when trying to apply some.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I apply it to my face every morning, and my skin is very soft and well moisturized, and now windburn is no longer a concern :)</li>
            <li> This combination is very effective at calming down inflammation and to help the healing process.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very cooling and feels great on dry damaged skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for every sking type, not only dry, it helps to cure some scars after spots.</li>
            <li> I love this as a general all over the face moisturizer, now that it is summer in Baltimore, this is the perfect moisturizer, it only requires a nickel size amount, and keeps the skin balanced, especially on the dog days of humid temperatures!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and very light and keeps the moisture in.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy/curly hair that gets really frizzy in the summer humidity, but this seems to keep it in control.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely a bit more liquid-y than your average aloe vera gel, but that&#x27;s a good thing!  </li>
            <li> , it dries good and does not feel strange on my skin, I cannot say it is good for the healing because I have use other items also with it, but there is some relief.  </li>
            <li> Yesterday my daughter came home with a sunburn on her shoulders and back and still it didn&#x27;t take much to give her a nice light coat of aloe.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this to make an amazing facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I used this product to help calm my skin after waxing</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of this 100% natural product.....not sticky.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft, elastic and healthy looking, from chin to toe nails.</li>
            <li> The dogs&#x27; pads are now soft, pliant and healthy.</li>
            <li> However, How can they call it 100% aloe vera when the ingredients clearly state more than aloe in it.</li>
            <li> I also use it as toner in the morning, it makes me look fresh and moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> It is like a thicker fluid and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great daily hair moisturizer for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I really love the fact that this totally natural and organic.</li>
            <li> an \\&quot;aloe\\&quot; that is natural... lighter... non greasy...quickly absorbent... makes your skin softer :)    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I use the actually Aloe from the plant itself.</li>
            <li> But this product comes in handy when I dont feel like taking out the time to cut open the plants and do all that</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m probably going to get my next batch from Mountain Rose Herbs.</li>
            <li> Worth buying it...</li>
            <li> The only drawbacks are needing to refrigerate it, though my hand wash is holding up nicely in the bathroom, but that adds to the belief that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> This product has been the only thing to keep my face moisturized all day without any kind of oily residue.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY fine hair, and most products weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Great for acne prone skin, really calms and soothes inflammation after I give myself a peel, or other skin treatments.</li>
            <li> This went rancid super fast!</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly and although you feel like you are only putting water on (because it is a fine, clear liquid), you notice the effect of it being more than water right away.  </li>
            <li> at all aloe is supposed to  moisturize and heal right</li>
            <li> Right after I was my face morning and night</li>
            <li> Says that right on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like you have to refrigerate it because I forget to use it unless it is right in front of me.</li>
            <li> It had a slight smell to it that wasn&#x27;t pleasant</li>
            <li> Love that it is organic and simple, does not have an ingredient list full of chemical preservatives.</li>
            <li> The rash will never go away but my dry skin and scales that come from the rash are infinitely better!</li>
            <li> Very pure aloe.  </li>
            <li> So far the best aloe vera I&#x27;ve tried came directly from aloe vera leaves that a neighbor grows,but has a very limited supply...</li>
            <li> So far this has shown the most positive progress.</li>
            <li> Short of trying to keep an aloe plant alive, this is the next best thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its gentle and cool on the eyes while wiping you face.</li>
            <li> Nothing better than Pure Aloe Vera, to soothe sensitive or irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> ; countless uses; excellent results; ease of use; easily stored; lasts a long time; good value for the price; non-toxic, safe, no chemicals, preservatives or bad stuff in it at all.</li>
            <li> , I certainly wish I hadn&#x27;t waited all these years to try it!  </li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s 100% pure!</li>
            <li> First I don&#x27;t like the texture, then I find the texture is wonderfully mix and contain moisturize with a few drops of essential oils.</li>
            <li> The price is very much affordable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Price was very reasonable...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on burns, minor skin irritations and it even makes personal hygiene after bowel movements much more comfortable and pleasant by applying it on toilet paper or cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li> mom is a chef and often gets burns on her face from hot oil splashing.  </li>
            <li> This is what made me a believer in Aloe in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aubreys is liquidy because there are no additives that make it gel</li>
            <li> but i guess that&#x27;s what you pay for higher quality product.</li>
            <li> It looks and feels exactly like water.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have read the reviews first.  </li>
            <li> With the first application, the immediate burning sensation was lessened by the coldness of the liquid since my alos vera had been in the fridge.  </li>
            <li> Finally got this and in TWO DAYS it was so much better as to pretty much be called WELL!  </li>
            <li> I will be going back to buying aloe gel capsules from the drugstore since there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a better option.</li>
            <li> so I use this instead (used to use a aloe vera gel that works pretty well too, but this is way better) and my face is starting to look like me again!</li>
            <li> I think it would be better for me to just purchase the actual aloe vera plant.</li>
            <li> shipping was as much as product!  </li>
            <li> Just a note, though - that the consistency is runny exactly like water</li>
            <li> FYI more fluid than gel.</li>
            <li> But the design of the opener needs some skill to navigate: First, shake the bottle.</li>
            <li> and I can really tell that they have faded!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really find it that useful for that</li>
            <li> Skin just drinks it up and feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really do love how it has left my skin feeling.</li>
            <li> this product is pretty watery and not gel like.</li>
            <li> but it is the first</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to face moisturizer, as it&#x27;s light and natural.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m writing a review based of AMAZON Aubrey&#x27;s organic aloe vera.</li>
            <li> Really really really like this product!</li>
            <li> You will most likely use it for something.</li>
            <li> Must have for your first aid kit</li>
            <li> And I am sure if we have left over, we will find use for it one way or another.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if they had been treated, when first requested, we may not be going through this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took some convincing to allow my daughter to give it a try, but when she finally came on board.</li>

            <li> Finally after many months of itching and pain, I saw online recommendations to try aloe vera for eczema.  </li>
            <li> Got it fast too!</li>
            <li> Can be worn under makeup and leaves skin incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am pretty allergic to bee stings, but when I got stung I decided to put some on the sting before I headed to the hospital</li>
            <li> I will definitely get more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different oils</li>
            <li> I use this as a daily moisturizer, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> The product is recommended to be refridgerated after first use and seems to truly keep alot of it&#x27;s intended effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Also this smells like a real aloe vera plant!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks. :)</li>
            <li> will definitely order more</li>
            <li> Of course, because it is so natural and has no added chemicals to make it more consistent, it is basically liquid, but it&#x27;s not hard to apply on face or hair or body.</li>
            <li> It is refreshing straight out of the bottle (which has a push-up type spout for releasing a small amount at a time) at room temp or can be kept in the frig for a more cooling, soothing immediate effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works very well as a light moisturizer for my sensitive combination skin, which is prone to irritation and redness.</li>
            <li> It does a great job with my acne as well, which is what I mainly purchased this for, helping to minimize the acne altogether as well as reduce redness without much aid as I only use an acne face cleanser once a day in the morning and a regular face cleanser at night.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft, clean, and supple.</li>
            <li> My plant just doesn&#x27;t grow fast enough for my needs (I use it in lotion mostly.)</li>
            <li> Not only has the scar faded and feels softer, but the aloe works as a GREAT moisturizer for my very sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li> Two days after receiving this product, while frying bread for Indian tacos, my tongs slipped out of my hand while lifting bread out of the oil and splattered a large amount of hot oil onto my stove and hand.</li>
            <li> product is AMAZING on acne scars and active cystic acne since aloe is antibacterial so is vitamin E. Dark spots are lightened amazingly with this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal - it&#x27;s watery because aloe really is that way!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much like pouring water on your hands and then applying it.  </li>
            <li> Its very liquidy which concerned me at first</li>
            <li> For the price, I would probably not buy it again since I can get a giant fresh aloe stalk at my local farmers market for about $1.75, but while I have it, I think it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li> Combine 1/4 C aloe with 1 TBSP vegetable glycerine (Frontier makes a good one) in a small glass bottle or jar.</li>
            <li> So, while natural is awesome, I opted to go with a different product that has a tiny preservative instead for future use.</li>
            <li> Keep selling and keep your high standards of success toward getting the real aloe ingredients.</li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s super sensitive-</li>
            <li> Use it a lot in winter also for dry skin, works better then some lotions.</li>
            <li> It is not 100% Pure or even close.</li>
            <li> This is not correct even though this is advertised as 100% pure aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> A product advertised as 100% pure aloe vera gel should contain 100% aloe vera.</li>
            <li> I want to know what % of this product is pure aloe vera?</li>
            <li> This stuff is about as pure as one can find.</li>
            <li> My vet suggested 100% pure aloe vera.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for  pure aloe vera for a while.</li>
            <li> I looked for pure aloe vera.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to me that it wasn&#x27;t pure gel.  </li>
            <li> This product is NOT 100% Pure Aloe Vera - it&#x27;s a lie!!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for pure aloe vera, this is not it.</li>
            <li> Not 100% pure aloe.  </li>
            <li> 4 oz Gel Pure Aloe Vera&amp;#34; - but it is NOT a gel at all.</li>
            <li> It is a PURE Liquid... as watery as it could be, and a bit sticky...</li>
            <li> of course not 100% pure</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you want pure aloe vera without the added chemicals!</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it will help my sons skin clear up, delivery was great.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it is more of a water-feeling clear liquid and not a thick gel.</li>
            <li> I did not know there was so much difference in 100% pure aloe vera and product you buy over the counter.  </li>
            <li> it is not too expensive like brand name skin care but very good efficient.</li>
            <li> you can get in whole food market only 7 dollars... but this product this really good, but thin as i thought before, it is really pure and natural, gentle, i have really sensitive skin, overally, its really good.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this Aloe Vera tonic at the Whole Foods Market.  </li>
            <li> This is the all-around soothing, healer.</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> my face is much smoother and there is zero irritation.</li>
            <li> no longer itch as much.</li>
            <li> but it also didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this after brushing my face with a gentle cleanser and exfoliating brush.</li>
            <li> I got a very think</li>
            <li> I like the coolness of the very moment that i put it on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Also, it says to keep it refrigerated, which also indicates it&#x27;s real aloe and that will prolong its usage.  </li>
            <li> Seems to go fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this for post-pregnancy stretch marks and it has been working really well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It works very well and keeps the skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> When we were out, we used the real Aloe Vera plant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works very well and keeps the skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li> When we were out, we used the real Aloe Vera plant.  </li>
            <li> This is so much nicer than applying a gel.</li>
            <li> It seems to work very well while my skin healed from sunburn.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and wanted something that wasn&#x27;t going to really clog my pores.</li>
            <li> and it really helps my skin.</li>
            <li> works really well</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose very well.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to expect much from this lil jar, but after 9 days of applying it to my face morning and night&lt;</li>
            <li> Please be advised this is a very watery mixture.  </li>
            <li> This is very liquid like.  </li>
            <li> so I feel it really helped.</li>
            <li> I have to say it worked better than expected</li>
            <li> However, I did not want to use the product I used on my hand because it wasn&#x27;t straight aloe vera but was an aloe vera based gel.  </li>
            <li> Even when the top is closed and fastened.  </li>
            <li> however, it didn&#x27;t really do much for me...</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Mix it with your lotion to apply it easier, it has a very cooling effect.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product was as described.</li>
            <li> Aubrey Sun Care Aloe Vera Gel really moisturized my skin and cleared up my acne.</li>
            <li> It was watery and I just didn&#x27;t really see the point of this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cooling and leaves my face feeling refreshed and ready for moisturizer..</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really help my skin</li>
            <li> I’m assuming it’s supposed to be very water’ d out if that make sense.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use cotton wipes or balls because they have so much bacteria on them.</li>
            <li> That alone makes it an absolute keeper in my book.</li>
            <li> Has a much wetter consistency than the aloe gels</li>
            <li> Very watery.</li>
            <li> So if you want a gel dont bother, if you want something very watery-then yes, but I dont know why you would want that.</li>
            <li> This Aloe Vera is very liquidy</li>
            <li> , however I wish it were available in a larger size.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> did show some promising change in the warts, drying them, but did not get rid of them.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, the consistency is very watery, even when you put it in the fridge (which you should do)</li>
            <li> but the scent is now very calming.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for my purposes, which are to make a non-toxic hand wash.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Consistency is very watery, not gel like,</li>
            <li> Very soothing under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really tried it on my face</li>
            <li> I picked this up at Whole Foods to treat an oil burn I got cooking in the kitchen</li>
            <li> but these are too greasy for using them before work and just couldn&#x27;t find anything that really moisturized my scalp without making it look greasy until I found this product.</li>
            <li> I had messed with it so much that it had scabbed over.</li>
            <li> Did find it at whole foods market.</li>
            <li> Now day 5 the spots are very drying and every so often I find myself scratching.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face before applying moisturizer and it absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> Price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I Use this product to detangle my hair before i put it in the bantu knots, and it works really well</li>
            <li> it is very versatile.</li>
            <li> its real.</li>
            <li> This really worked for me.</li>
            <li> expensive, but safe and effective.  </li>
            <li> It worked alright, but I honestly didn&#x27;t notice a big enough change in my hair to continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> REALLY RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR REAL NATURAL PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> But the kids are busy, so sometimes they don&#x27;t get replaced right away.</li>
            <li> But the kids are busy, so sometimes they don&#x27;t get replaced right away.</li>
            <li> A saturated cotton ball, a quick dab on each paw pad, it is dry and absorbed and they are done.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way which is great</li>
            <li> I do enjoy using this product and it feels good on my skin, makes it a little tight after application</li>
            <li> Third, when you&#x27;re done and close it, use the finger to lick the opener clean....</li>
            <li> So I only use this after shower and when my hands are clean.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only products I have taken the time to give a full review to because I really believe in it.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t had a burn of any type in years, so it went straight into the door of the fridge as I had read a previous purchaser placed hers in the fridge to give the product more of a cooling effect when using.   </li>
            <li> they product is only half as good as it pervious was.</li>
            <li> Highly highly recommended for sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li> Never went back to use a synthetic cream that full of hassle chemicals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a liquid, with the viscosity close to that of water, which surprised me at first..  </li>
            <li> This is used in part of a face mask, and I love the way my skin feels after applying this with other products!</li>
            <li> I like it best when it&#x27;s a little thick.  </li>
            <li> but I mainly use it for my Skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even gave some to my cat when he was throwing up constantly, and he&#x27;s done better for the last 24 hours</li>
            <li> I have decently oily skin to begin with and this tends to help keep that under control somewhat.</li>
            <li> With all the unnatural ingredients in so many facial care products my face has finally revolted.  </li>
            <li> The price is a bit high</li>
            <li> I just cant speak highly enuff on this product..</li>
            <li> highly reccomend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for any skin condition.</li>
            <li> What I was so sensitive to with all the other products I tried on the excema was the added ingredients (many are known irritants or cancer threats).  </li>
            <li> Plus its completely natural (unlike many other Aloe Vera gel products).</li>
            <li> I make my own mascara and other make up and this aloe is essential.</li>
            <li> , I just wish I got a little more for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Controlled it a little better than just using acne medicine alone.</li>
            <li> it came 2-3 days early !!</li>
            <li> It should therefore be refrigerated after opening, but i found that it seemed to be just fine for at least a week kept in a cool place but not refrigerated.</li>
            <li> Using them with radiotherapy (together with La Roche Posay B5), easy to apply and works extremely well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to moisturize with something sooo liquidy.</li>
            <li> She uses real aloe vera plants from the garden and applies it directly to her face.  </li>
            <li> , I use it every night on my face, it is very moisturizing and has made a slight improvement on my acne scars and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any concrete result yet</li>
            <li> It works though, so it was worth paying double!</li>
            <li> Many people cannot tolerate the harsh effects of Retin-A, the redness etc.  </li>
            <li> past year, I decided to take action on my own.</li>
            <li> It goes on your skin nicely and sinks in completely without the residue that you get from commercial gels.</li>
            <li> If your skin is very sensitive to moisturizers that have alcohol in them,  then use this natural product 99 percent pure.  </li>
            <li> Love this product , my skin feels soft, fairer and less pimples ...</li>
            <li> I mean, perhaps I just kept using it like I was supposed to, but I didn&#x27;t feel or saw any kind of improvement at all.</li>
            <li> A nice pure product, however the consistency is too thin for my use.</li>
            <li> are the NEW INGREDIENTS:</li>
            <li> but this new formula is like acid on my skin.</li>
            <li> you need to use it and dry quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly for me at least, aloe seems to add all the good things back to my skin.</li>
            <li> As far as natural things go, this is the real deal..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, it works wonderfully on sunburns and other minor skin irritations.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> tried all kinds of organic, high end, alcohol-free toners for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for about a week, but I&#x27;m comfortable writing the review because it&#x27;s done half of what I needed already - calm my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the product that is as natural is it can get!</li>
            <li> My face has never been so clear and free of acne and other skin problems.</li>
            <li> I just recently starting using it consistently, and ohhh boy do I regret not using it all this time.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it this way a girl stopped me and simply said, &amp;#34;Your hair is perfect&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> As close as you can get to all natural but still has crap,in it!</li>
            <li> All natural and heals everything on your skin!</li>
            <li> Every mark, new and old that it touched, vanished.  </li>
            <li> Also, there was no longer a red mark of any kind on my hand where the oil had landed and no sensitivity to touch or running water as usually follows from these burns.   </li>
            <li> It does take time though - you won&#x27;t have dark spots one night and magically wake up the next day with them all gone.</li>
            <li> and I regretted multiple times as my skin instantly reacted to chemicals, however mild they might be, within one day of switch.  </li>
            <li> mixed this about 60/40 with water, added 2 drops of glycerine, 2 drops of jojoba, and a pinch of pure kaolin clay.  </li>
            <li> I use Aubrey Organics for external use and I also drink Premeier Research Labs AloePro, which is also a pure form of aloe.</li>
            <li> I am using this pure aloe vera as a facial moisturizer for my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> but since you put it in the refrigerator it feels great cold on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> Soothing and clear...</li>
            <li> Nothing worked to clear it up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a clear, watery texture</li>
            <li> /&gt;FYI,  I was surprised at how liquidy this was, basically like water.</li>
            <li> and I have been fighting with adult acne for years.</li>
            <li> Only a day or two, I can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> Aloe vera contains natural anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.</li>
            <li> but my skin is soft.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s about $2 cheaper on Amazon than at my local Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li> Works on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who is looking for organic aloe; this is as close as it gets next to the real thing.</li>
            <li> but so far I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft and I think it even helps prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li> I attempted to use this product in a completely 100% organic lotion, it didn&#x27;t turn out how I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a natural product, it&#x27;s consistency varies.  </li>
            <li> It helps soften my skin and does wonders for my complexion, even making my cheeks naturally rosy looking.</li>
            <li> All natural.</li>
            <li> After days of research I came across an article for natural remedies for acne or blemishes.</li>
            <li> But my skin is really sensitive, so when I need a break from chemicals, I slather this on to heal my skin.</li>
            <li> I did add it to a few different products, and the one with more preserving natural ingredients is doing well.</li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This stuff comes out like water, so be carefully not to waste it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are using this as a natural remedy.&lt;br /&gt;First of, I have 4 kiddos.</li>
            <li> Having 4 busy kids, I sometimes forget.</li>
            <li> Makes my curls soft and manageable...</li>
            <li> So far it is what it says it is.</li>
            <li> Would not buy again since it is completely overpriced for a liquid.</li>
            <li> I have bought it for all of my sisters with acne prone or sensitive skin, and have continued to buy it for everyone who has come to me with skin problems.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> As stated it&#x27;s pure...as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to go all natural (hair, skin, body, etc.)</li>
            <li> It make my hands really sooth instantly!</li>
            <li> This product is slowly but surely fading the scars on my arms.</li>
            <li> I did exactly as one of the reviewers for this product stated, and poured a little of this on my burn immediately, then waited about 4-5 minutes and poured a little more on it.  </li>
            <li> Closed the 3\\&quot; plug-in metal stem right in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, this product by Aubrey truly is 100% natural and, in my opinion, works better than the other one.</li>
            <li> But other than that, it&#x27;s been helpful and it feels more natural than the other Aloe Vera gel that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> However if you&#x27;re a better consumer than I am and actually read further down in the description, you&#x27;ll see this ingredient list somewhere in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I applied several times the first day, and definitely keep it in the fridge.</li>
            <li> was so surprised to see such a burning red irritation when I purchased 100% PURE aloe.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for anybody with any skin problems!&lt;br /&gt;I have looked for this product at Whole Foods and other holistic stores and could not find it anywhere.</li>
            <li> What does 100% pure aloe vera gel really mean and how much aloe vera is really in this product?</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really take long either.</li>
            <li> I also put a few drops of lavender essential oil into the bottle so not only does it feel refreshing</li>
            <li> I used Aubrey Organics - 100% Pure Aloe Vera Gel to massage into my leper girlfriend&#x27;s dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used Aubrey Organics - 100% Pure Aloe Vera Gel to massage into my leper girlfriend&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> I use it for my son&#x27;s eczema it calm down the itching</li>
            <li> Our specialist recently retired and we are waiting on an appointment to a new specialist.</li>
            <li> I think I will be tapping my growing live aloe in the back yard</li>
            <li> cleanse my face, dry off, apply some witch hazel all over, then take this aloe from the fridge &amp; apply it to my whole face (lips too).</li>
            <li> it really soothes my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Just apply some to the affected areas and soothe it right down.</li>
            <li> Calms my skin right down.</li>
            <li> However, I have some acne scarring and after 2 weeks of using this i noticed a major difference in skin evenness and scar fading.</li>
            <li> If it is a more intense burn, I sometimes use the aloe and then a little soaking in cold water for maybe a few minutes and then the aloe again; this solves even the more intense burn.  </li>
            <li> My face feels lightly hydrated without the greasy or heavily wet feeling you get with other products.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find pure organic aloe gel, which is why I bought this bottle in the first place.</li>
            <li> Not really 100% Aloe Vera pure.</li>
            <li> My skin is less oily AND less try, my hyper pigmentation and acne has become more settled.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected -  hard to push top open and then liquid spills out too fast.  </li>
            <li> watery, haven&#x27;t really used it long enough to know if it works.</li>
            <li> , it never scabbed over, and this morning I can barely see it.</li>
            <li> , it never scabbed over, and this morning I can barely see it.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT MADE MY SKIN RED AND SENSITIVE.</li>
            <li> Either an error, or their definition of &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is far different than mine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this stuff for a couple weeks now, but I&#x27;m noticing marked improvement.</li>
            <li> Bought it to make a DIY lotion with Young Living essential oils.</li>
            <li> I use it after shaving so the cold Aloe feels good.</li>
            <li> The package usually arrives right on time or even early sometimes.</li>
            <li> Seeing how my face revolted with other products I wanted to get pure aloe vera.  </li>
            <li> There are other ingredients but this is the closes I found to pure aleo vera.</li>
            <li> I was looking for pure aloe as opposed to that other stuff</li>
            <li> Even though I had read in previous reviews that it was very liquid, I was still surprised to find out how liquid it was.  </li>
            <li> Hardly any rubbing in, it is more like making one pass with a wet hand</li>
            <li> It smells to me a little funny, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but I don&#x27;t feel it smoothes my skin either...</li>
            <li> It was super runny and when we rubbed it onto our skin, it felt a little slimy and it took a while to dry but was still sticky.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t heal fast and he still has dark marks where the rashes were</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews, but this one was worth it.</li>
            <li> It was much thinner and appeared as if it was watered down.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this 2x daily along with red clay powder masks weekly for a month now and have noticed a major improvement in my skin tone and scarring.</li>
            <li> I had previously bought a &amp;#34;pure natural&amp;#34; aloe very gel by JASON.</li>
            <li> Background:&lt;br /&gt;I am a young Afro caribbean women with hyper pigmentation, and also suffer from a combo of oily and dry skin with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why everyone is saying this is the same consistency as aloe fresh squeezed from the plant.</li>
            <li> I scrunch a little and then spray a little oil or sea salt spray on top, then don&#x27;t touch it until it&#x27;s completely dry.  </li>
            <li> To little product for that much $$$</li>
            <li> I bought some with me on my vacation to Mexico and used it on days when I got a little too much sun.  </li>
            <li> After reading previous reviews that highly praised this for burns, I purchased this over other similar products for its high percentage of aloe vera content.  </li>
            <li> I could have bought one of the cheap aloe vera gels from supermarkets, but I bought this &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; one - WHAT A WASTE!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also great for burns I realized after I stupidly put my hand on a pot that had just been in the oven.  </li>
            <li> Acne scars can take weeks to months to heal normally but this definitely cuts the time down.</li>
            <li> I read the labels to all the other brands and this was the only one that can truly say it is all natural.  </li>
            <li> Here were the old ingredients: Aloe leaf juice, citrus grapefruit extract, cyamopsis (guar gum), vitamin E (which lightens dark marks and scars).&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> I find a teeny tiny bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> (I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to comment); but the moment it touched my skin</li>
            <li> But it has proved to last a long time.</li>
            <li> When I took it off, there was still redness, but the pain had completely gone and the swelling had gone down quite a bit as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would use these on a burn or cracked skin due to its 100% natural characteristic.</li>
            <li> Second, one hand holds the bottle and the other hand covers the opener when you open it (because it will spill out a drop when you open it!!</li>
            <li> My skin is plum and soft, much less oil/shine on my face.</li>
            <li> I wear hats most of the time to avoid the cold wind, but I still need that extra moisture in my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> Vegan, cruelty-free, marked 98% organic, it is expensive, but seems worth it if you can dig up the money for it.  </li>
            <li> I say &#x27;almost&#x27; because like a moron, I tried catching it as a reflex action.</li>
            <li> After a few days my rash was completely gone!  </li>
            <li> With this new skin care routine and regular exfoliation, my acne is gone and no more.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that would soothe my adult acne, but sadly, this just fell right off my face.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find a pure aloe vera product that works so well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find pure aloe vera.</li>
            <li> this stuff,  pure aloe vera, is hard to find.</li>
            <li> Hard to find the pure aloe like this so get two or three.</li>
            <li> The consistency as some other reviewers noted is very watery, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> No more spending $30-$40 on high end toners.</li>
            <li> What you get is a small 4oz bottle of a watered down gel that is more like a juice that is so runny that it&#x27;s hard to apply where you want it</li>
            <li> and (although this stuff isn&#x27;t extremely expensive it also isn&#x27;t cheap either.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a long time for a product that didn&#x27;t contain artificial/carcinogenic preservatives, colorants etc.</li>
            <li> ...my bottle had two long strands of hair stuck inside the label attached to the bottle.</li>
            <li> 4 oz also goes a long way.</li>
            <li> , no stinging, no burning and her skin did NOT turn red or even pink at all.</li>
            <li> I feel the purchase was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is light, absorbs quickly, is clear, and has practically no scent, just a very faint botanical aloe smell.</li>
            <li> The wart will slowly change in size, the moisture of the aloe will help soften the wart and eventually it will separate from the skin, sometimes with happened as part of the flaking, but depending on the wart it may come out as a whole.  </li>
            <li> I have lupus and get a rash across my nose and cheeks and a very dry face, I also have skin conditions on my scalp that causes dry, red sores across my forehead.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and have to deal with acclimating to sudden changes in the environment which is very harsh on my sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It smells the same as the SUPER expensive aloe vera I got in salon.</li>
            <li> This product helps instantly with sunburns and other ailments.</li>
            <li> I think this is the only aloe vera product that I&#x27;ve found without other chemicals or ingredients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one I could find without preservatives or other additives.</li>
            <li> My cat&#x27;s heels were raw and scabbed because of weight-loss due to his heart medication, and I needed a natural topical solution that wouldn&#x27;t harm him if he licked it off.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try as a moisturizer for my dry skin during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I hope that this will help my dry, itchy, flaky scalp.  </li>
            <li> It will harden as it dries, once completely dry, I scrunch my fingers through again to get rid of any hardened strands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> anywhere I have dry patches or rashes when they come up.</li>
            <li> I use this on sunburns, dry skin, and underarms when irritated.</li>
            <li> and it use this product to seal my deva curl products and allow my hair to air dry.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be on the dry side</li>
            <li> And when I use this or a aloe vera plant my face is dry either way.</li>
            <li> No dry spots; no cracks so they injure their pads a lot less than before when running and digging and playing.</li>
            <li> after shaving my legs in the shower, and it works better than all the expensive and not-so-expensive lotions and creams I&#x27;ve wasted my money on all these years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this product while I was on vacation on the beach every single day.</li>
            <li> but this one didn&#x27;t do a single thing for my skin.</li>
            <li> I chose the Aubrey brand for its limited additives.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend putting it in a small spray/mist bottle, and spraying it directly over your face.</li>
            <li> I actually chose THIS product because I read reviews saying it moisturized and helped with dark spots</li>
            <li> I even tried a small amount on my skin and it made my skin soft as well.  </li>
            <li> It is better than some of the other aloe vera products that are loaded with artificial colors, preservitives and scents.</li>
            <li> Especially for thinner hair to condition without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Pure Aloe Vera in a bottle is very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> My first day I got some bad sunburn, and this product really helped to soothe the discomfort and keep my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> have used it on a pretty bad burn from a curling iron and it cleared up really well, without scaring.</li>
            <li> Red marks after acne is less notible.</li>
            <li> so I ended up running over to The Vitamin Shop and getting a bigger bottle for less.</li>
            <li> Just wish they would sell this product in a larger bottle at less price.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this gel for very dry, scaly skin.  </li>
            <li> (I did all the other treatments along with her, but due to the location on my particular wart, I had a hard time keeping a bandages on it.</li>
            <li> and this was the only moisturizer I could find with little or no chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in Afghanistan right now, and the air is not only really dry but really cold at the moment too.</li>
            <li> ;, on her hand) is now flat and less noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> could just be my ignorance, it is now what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put it on their feet and legs when the playing gets too rough</li>
            <li> A few weeks prior to my skin breakout I got a burn on my hand and used aloe vera.  </li>
            <li> I fill my palm w/ the product and finger through wet hair.  </li>
            <li> It was not what I wanted or expected.</li>
            <li> I had a wart on my finger tip, partially under my nail.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s what I expected since it doesn&#x27;t have any fillers or anything else to make it gel.</li>
            <li> Too liquid...... wasn&#x27;t as expected.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people think it&#x27;s not real because its watery or you have to refrigerate it.</li>
            <li> then I expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an african-American woman with thick, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> It was not a super intense and continual burning now that usually comes from these burns, but there was still a very slight burning sensation on my hand for the next few minutes</li>
            <li> I have a small aloe plant that I had used for small cuts and burns, but it was too small for such a large burn, so this was needed.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m down to the last little bit of the bottle after a year of using it, so it&#x27;s time to buy another one.</li>
            <li> I ve been using rhis for a little over a month abd a half, so patience is key</li>
            <li> It is drying so a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount to set a good base my makeup and other products apply to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this for the face and other areas</li>
            <li> Just like some of the other reviews, I also think it&#x27;s a bit too liquid-ish.</li>
            <li> From what I can tell is that my skin is not hydrated enough, so it produces somehow excessive sebum trying to keep the moisture.</li>
            <li> But other than that, nothing else happened.</li>
            <li> usually it will has some left around the opener....</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t contain any fillers like other aloe vera products I have researched and thought about purchasing .After using this</li>
            <li> appreciate the lack of preservatives and other additives.</li>
            <li> have tried other aloes since, but they did not work as well, so I&#x27;m coming back.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will buy it again</li>
            <li> I had asked the pediatrician about treating the warts, as they have passed them to each other.</li>
            <li> The doctors were NOT willing to treat them.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been the EXTREME exception to this theory.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, after almost 4 years of finding a wart growing on my daughters hand, when she was 3 and in PreK.</li>
            <li> I tried benadryl cream and four other homeopathic rash/psoriasis/eczema creams.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked and won&#x27;t buy any other aloe vera product anymore.</li>
            <li> It has other ingredients, one of which is grapefruit extract.  </li>
            <li> This makes the product difficult to apply to the face, since you must first get it to stay on your fingers.  </li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re trying to use it as an ingredient of other body care products, then the consistency is faaaaaaar too runny.</li>
            <li> : they removed the vitamin E which helps lighten scars, ADDED PLAIN WATER (as if this wasn&#x27;t watery enough) added citric acid and radish root which are both irritating to the skin, I never got redness or sores from the old formula</li>
            <li> Then again the results are very minimal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it myself a few time on extremely dry patches of skin</li>
            <li> Not a very good deal overall.  </li>
            <li> My troubled spot goes down for a little bit right after I apply it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find 100% Aloe Vera in local stores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Previous review:&lt;br /&gt;Lightens dark acne scars</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are only treating a few warts(or clusters of small warts) at a time to keep the treatment application tolerable for my daughter.</li>
            <li> If you have scars or dark spots when your acne heals, this speeds up the healing.</li>
            <li> and I also see that this helps with dark spots.</li>
            <li> and it is not to wet or heavy on my hair.</li>
            <li> I dumped it down the drain.</li>
            <li> My skin is calmed down by this aloe vera juice.</li>
            <li> There ARE other organic aloes out there (on Amazon even!)</li>
            <li> Because it had been in the frig and was cold, I could feel the relief right away</li>
            <li> Because it had been in the frig and was cold, I could feel the relief right away</li>
            <li> But I guess that&#x27;s because I live in a very cold and highly windy area.</li>
            <li> 6 dogs in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Is it 1% or half of 1%?</li>
            <li> AND MY FACE IS SO MUCH LESS OILY</li>
            <li> It stopped the slight burning sensation and redness I get with Retin-A.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You only have to use a small amount, so don&#x27;t feel concerned that the bottle is small.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling you, it&#x27;s as if I broke off the aloe vera plant in half and just applied the liquid inside to my face.</li>
            <li> It is slightly thicker, but I think it may take a bit longer to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint it that it leaves your hands somewhat sticky for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Before I started using the aloe, I used to have to soak my finger for at least half an hour in water just to not be in pain and the next few days</li>
            <li> When the bumps dried, I was left with small to medium sized marks!  </li>
            <li> Even when my skin was clearing, without make-up, it didn&#x27;t look like it due to the spots being left behind.</li>
            <li> and I do notice that this can leave my skin a little tight.</li>
            <li> I suffer from mild acne, but the scars were bad.</li>
            <li> Wish it were a little thicker, it is a little to runny.</li>
            <li> AND IT EVEN HELPED A LITTLE ON MY SCARS</li>
            <li> This little bottle was just a miracle for me.</li>
            <li> One drawback is that it is a little runny so take that into account when you are dispensing it.</li>
            <li> I would continue the treatment for a little while after the wart seems to be gone.</li>
            <li> I would continue the treatment for a little while after the wart seems to be gone.</li>
            <li> Just a little on a cotton ball swabbed all-over the face</li>
            <li> The lotion they provide to combat the dry skin is just as bad and leaves your hands very greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all from aveda to bio-elements and from what i can tell i just wasted a bunch of money with little results..</li>
            <li> About a year ago I developed red, flaking, itching, painful skin around the crease of my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> but it is very soothing and cold.  </li>
            <li> we keep it in the fridge so its cold and ready to go when we need it.</li>
            <li> but as it dried, it hurt like heck.</li>
            <li> but as it dried, it hurt like heck.</li>
            <li> Lots of money and time wasted till I tried this Aloe Vera.     </li>
            <li> Use it everyday under a heavier moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> A few days ago though my toes became swollen and inflammed</li>
            <li> I was taking this bottle with me in my purse and after a few accidents I can no longer do that.</li>
            <li> My skin hates this and dried out from it.</li>
            <li> I use sunscreen, vitamin c and a salicylic acid exfoliant that all seem to just set my skin on fire for a few minutes every morning and night.  </li>
            <li> So in the meantime we are trying an Aloe treatment, We started with using our plant, but it was so messy to apply.</li>
            <li> title is misleading in my humble</li>
            <li> So thin, in fact, that when you open the flip-top, liquid splatters out from the direction of the opening-- and gets on mirror, furniture, or anything within two feet in that direction.</li>
            <li> oh harsh hand sanitizes.</li>
            <li> Does not feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I had a few blotches and this cleared it up in no time.</li>
            <li> I used it to soothe my Shingles virus rash, after blisters were dried up.  </li>
            <li> Feel like water and was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> So I would not spend the money on this again, too much wasted.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 just because it is a little bit hard to apply due to it being so liquid.</li>
            <li> Extremely watery and hard to apply to your skin.  </li>
            <li> So far I have been unable to find 100% pure aloe vera gel that isn&#x27;t very expensive for the quantity you get.  </li>
            <li> Organic products, such as this one, rank high, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> This adds just a touch of body without being greasy, sticky, stiff, or drying.</li>
            <li> For a very shy girl this is a hardship for her, and really effects her self esteem.</li>
            <li> I applied it right where I had 3 disgusting left over pimples and</li>
            <li> Sadly, my cat went into heart failure in November 2008, but in the last few weeks of my boy&#x27;s life, this aloe did work in healing raw heels.  </li>
            <li> Well, it is anything but natural: sickly artificial fragrance, chemical thickeners, preservatives</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve dabbed this on the dogs&#x27; chests and bellies after they&#x27;ve laid in the sun and dirt of the yard in the warmer months to sooth the irritation and small scrapes and well as insect bites on them and me.</li>
            <li> It did scar a teeny bit, but nothing like I thought it would based on my past experiences of burning myself.</li>
            <li> It did scar a teeny bit, but nothing like I thought it would based on my past experiences of burning myself.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there is any fading</li>
            <li> From past 3 months , this is always on my face at night ...</li>
            <li> The aloe helps prevent excessive sebum production which can inhibit the acne from surfacing.  </li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed because it is so watery.</li>
            <li> (Gel is usually chemical in these products)</li>
            <li> Not sure I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I keep this in my refrigerator and whenever I burn myself in the kitchen, I put a small amount on the burn.  </li>
            <li> It immediately soothes the burn and if it is a small burn, I don&#x27;t have to do anything else.  </li>
            <li> and I can use my finger (the usual place I burn myself in the kitchen) again without any pain.  </li>
            <li> I love to use it as a base for DIY face tonics and astringents!</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having rashes all over my body lately and I placed this in the freezer for a few hours and applied it all over my arms and legs</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trail with Aloe:&lt;br /&gt;We soak small pieces of gauze in this aloe, and use nexcare waterproof bandages to keep them in place.</li>
            <li> I prefer to do it morning and night, but sometimes are not able to.</li>
            <li> not purchase it again, and I am unable to use the one I presently have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works</li>
            <li> Not sure how to describe it, something between body odor and rotten food.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use this in ample amounts, so even though its a small bottle, it lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the aloe vera stopped me from reacting or if I just didn&#x27;t react this time, but I got to the doctor with no reaction.</li>
            <li> He would rub a small amount of it on the rash twice a day and eventually it went away.</li>
            <li> The reason I give this 4 stars because I&#x27;m not really sure whether it is the Aloe Vera or Vitamin E</li>
            <li> It was very messy to apply.</li>
            <li> Honestly not even sure if it works because I can&#x27;t get past the horrible smell.  </li>
            <li> In a small district it is hard label to get past.</li>
            <li> I read aloe in gel form is not very good because the chemicals used to make it a gel are carcinogenic.  </li>
            <li> Other products left a layer of sticky residue or smelled bad.</li>
            <li> The plastic in which it is housed is not marked for recycling, so that&#x27;s sad too.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for some type of natural relief which ended up being virtually impossible because almost all store bought products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to moisturize with this because it&#x27;s literally like a bottle of water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like water, which makes it a bit hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I will keep purchasing this product as the plant itself is hard to carry around when travelling.</li>
            <li> It diluted the skin lotion recipe I was using it for into a sloppy mess.</li>
            <li> I knew immediately that this heating element was at least 400 degrees</li>
            <li> and I honestly do not like any of their products.</li>
            <li> i thought it would come really late buy boy</li>
            <li> If there is any sign of the wart returning, treat it again for at least another week.</li>
            <li> If there is any sign of the wart returning, treat it again for at least another week.</li>
            <li> And it isn&#x27;t a struggle to apply a thick gunk and then spend all the time rubbing it in to each toe pad and dew claw pad</li>
            <li> in mind this is not a gel nor a thick lotion-type product.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a problem for me me, but if you&#x27;re looking for a product with a thick consistency, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> The wart will slowly change in size, the moisture of the aloe will help soften the wart and eventually it will separate from the skin, sometimes with happened as part of the flaking, but depending on the wart it may come out as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I add a very small amount into my conditioner and let it sit in my hair while I wash and shave.</li>
            <li> Seriously works wonders for redness and irritation.</li>
            <li> It is now 4 days since I was that dumb</li>
            <li> It is now 4 days since I was that dumb</li>
            <li> Not sure how to use and apply because it feels weird splashing on this liquid.  </li>
            <li> Definitely try it out on burns; you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> After reading the ingredients list on my Aloe Vera Gel, I noticed there were a lot of unnecessary ones in there to have it as a gel.  </li>
            <li> so is thin rather than gloopy and has a neutral scent.</li>
            <li> But my poor daughter is now in a position of being labeled as the warty girl at school.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and grows maybe a cm a month.</li>
            <li> My son got stung at a football game and the aloe vera helped with the swelling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s FALSE ADVERTISING.</li>
            <li> Amazons aloe vera is false.</li>
            <li> It is very thin, so if you are looking for a thick gel this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re expecting that thick green gel that you buy at Walmart, then you&#x27;ll be disappointed, because this is rather watery because it&#x27;s just aloe vera juice, without chemicals or thickeners in it.</li>
            <li> The new formula is TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> and it hit hard !!</li>
            <li> have replaced all my foot/hand creams and body lotions and merely use this instead.</li>
            <li> It has replaced 2 pad protector products I&#x27;ve used for years, both of which were extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
            <li> I suffered with excema and horrible itching for about 8 months, while trying all manner of topical treatments.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it had a weird smell to it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the product because I suffer from hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> I brought this on a suggestion from my sister for a rash that was being difficult to heal.  </li>
            <li> i use it for random things too,  </li>
            <li> This item is made from quality ingredients, but it is a very thin liquid which may not work for all intended uses.</li>
            <li> Very thin consistency, but absorbs well.</li>
            <li> This Aloe product is very thin, almost to the point of being like water.  </li>
            <li> : 1/21/10 - Burned myself BADLY being dumb 4 days ago.</li>
            <li> Made me break out horribly.. wish I could find something that is organic that actually works :(</li>
            <li> To make it gel-like, carcinogenic preservatives are used, as well as artificial colors, scents, etc.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like that it has to be refrigerated, inconvenient to run downstairs when I get out of the shower, just to grab the bottle and apply this.</li>
            <li> I also think the aloe helped heal/prevent cracking skin around my knuckles in cold weather.</li>
            <li> Rather than the automatic &#x27;run under cold water&#x27;, I grabbed the aloe I keep on the frig door and slowly dribbled it into my hand and let it run over the side where the worst part of the burn was.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t so unpleasant</li>
            <li> I keep on the frig door and slowly dribbled it into my hand and let it run over the side where the worst part of the burn was.</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO FIND LOTION</li>
            <li> Cold windy days and years of coloring have taken its toll on my hair &amp; scalp :(  </li>
            <li> it was a bad, bad burn.</li>
            <li> My son has really bad cracks in his heals.  </li>
            <li> product has alcohol and that is bad for skin.</li>
            <li> It also helped to relieve the painful, itchy shingles that were a side effect of the chemo and radiation treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;**Before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Has no gel consistency :(</li>
            <li> was i wrong !!</li>
            <li> Smells awful.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t and tried to use it after opening and it had a terrible smell.</li>
            <li> I got a terrible sunburn this summer and bought this to help with the healing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This Aloe is great, it is liquid-y and not sticky. I like this for the face and other areas you need to use it and dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of this 100% natural product.....not sticky.  I add it to my facial toner.</li>
            <li> Now this is what i am used to using. This product was very good.</li>
            <li> thought it would be a gel and not a liquid. could just be my ignorance, it is now what I expected.</li>
            <li> I had previously bought a &amp;#34;pure natural&amp;#34; aloe very gel by JASON. Well, it is anything but natural: sickly artificial fragrance, chemical thickeners, preservatives I can&#x27;t pronounce. On the other hand, this product by Aubrey truly is 100% natural and, in my opinion, works better than the other one. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this Aloe Vera tonic at the Whole Foods Market.  I read the labels to all the other brands and this was the only one that can truly say it is all natural.  After washing my face and applying Kiss My Face Toner, I apply Aubrey Aloe Vera all over my face and add an extra layer over problem areas (like red spots and acne).  My face feels lightly hydrated without the greasy or heavily wet feeling you get with other products.  I&#x27;m only 24 and I&#x27;m using this product along with a daily mineral sunscreen to prevent scars, discoloration, age spots, and wrinkles.  Others have noted that it makes their skin look younger and wrinkle free.&lt;br /&gt;My mom is a chef and often gets burns on her face from hot oil splashing.  She uses real aloe vera plants from the garden and applies it directly to her face.  This has done wonders for her, leaving her scar free.  This is what made me a believer in Aloe in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aubreys is liquidy because there are no additives that make it gel like.  I would recommend putting it in a small spray/mist bottle, and spraying it directly over your face.</li>
            <li> Just like some of the other reviews, I also think it&#x27;s a bit too liquid-ish. But other than that, it&#x27;s been helpful and it feels more natural than the other Aloe Vera gel that I have tried.  The price is a bit high but i guess that&#x27;s what you pay for higher quality product.</li>
            <li> My house is never without aloe vera and I&#x27;ve tried many kinds. Most of what has been available to me has been in gel form, but I use those with much trepidation and discomfort. To make it gel-like, carcinogenic preservatives are used, as well as artificial colors, scents, etc. All I want is 100% aloe vera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since finding this particular product, I keep one bottle on the frig door at all times for a more immediate cooling, soothing effect. One bottle is in the bathroom medicine cabinet and one in the bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have replaced all my foot/hand creams and body lotions and merely use this instead. No scents, no greasy residue, no rubbing it in forever and still have slippery fingers/hands, no gunk on the door knobs, etc. I find a teeny tiny bit goes a long way and it dries very quickly. It keeps my skin soft, elastic and healthy looking, from chin to toe nails. Hardly any rubbing in, it is more like making one pass with a wet hand and it is done! And after almost 28 months of various cancer treatments that burned, irritated and destroyed my skin, this has been a Godsend. It also helped to relieve the painful, itchy shingles that were a side effect of the chemo and radiation treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily on all the dogs&#x27; paw pads, twice/daily in the winter months. It has replaced 2 pad protector products I&#x27;ve used for years, both of which were extremely expensive. The dogs&#x27; pads are now soft, pliant and healthy. No dry spots; no cracks so they injure their pads a lot less than before when running and digging and playing. Heck, even walking them used to tear up their pads. And it isn&#x27;t a struggle to apply a thick gunk and then spend all the time rubbing it in to each toe pad and dew claw pad real good so they don&#x27;t gunk up the floor, carpets and beds. A saturated cotton ball, a quick dab on each paw pad, it is dry and absorbed and they are done. 6 dogs in less than 5 minutes. Thank you Aubrey Organics!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this for kitchen accidents (that tea kettle gets me a lot as do the oven racks and micro steam!), hand, foot and body lotion, to soothe sunburned arms/shoulders, just about anything and everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind this is not a gel nor a thick lotion-type product. It looks and feels exactly like water. No scent, no color. Just aloe vera. It is refreshing straight out of the bottle (which has a push-up type spout for releasing a small amount at a time) at room temp or can be kept in the frig for a more cooling, soothing immediate effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve dabbed this on the dogs&#x27; chests and bellies after they&#x27;ve laid in the sun and dirt of the yard in the warmer months to sooth the irritation and small scrapes and well as insect bites on them and me. I&#x27;ve put it on their feet and legs when the playing gets too rough and they scrape/cut themselves on the stones, sticks in the yard. This is the all-around soothing, healer. It is clean, quick, absorbent and efficient. Gets the job done quickly and cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it myself, esp. after shaving my legs in the shower, and it works better than all the expensive and not-so-expensive lotions and creams I&#x27;ve wasted my money on all these years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One product; countless uses; excellent results; ease of use; easily stored; lasts a long time; good value for the price; non-toxic, safe, no chemicals, preservatives or bad stuff in it at all. Short of trying to keep an aloe plant alive, this is the next best thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be without this ever! Can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 1/21/10 - Burned myself BADLY being dumb 4 days ago. Pulled the heating unit from the electric griddle when finished &#x27;griddling&#x27; pancakes and almost dropped it. I say &#x27;almost&#x27; because like a moron, I tried catching it as a reflex action. Well, I caught it alright. Closed the 3\\&quot; plug-in metal stem right in the palm of my hand. I knew immediately that this heating element was at least 400 degrees and I could tell from the sensation in my palm it was a bad, bad burn. Rather than the automatic &#x27;run under cold water&#x27;, I grabbed the aloe I keep on the frig door and slowly dribbled it into my hand and let it run over the side where the worst part of the burn was. Because it had been in the frig and was cold, I could feel the relief right away but as it dried, it hurt like heck. I repeated the application throughout the day about 5 times, using maybe 4 drops each time. It is now 4 days since I was that dumb and I never got a blister, never had it bubble up, it never scabbed over, and this morning I can barely see it. It did scar a teeny bit, but nothing like I thought it would based on my past experiences of burning myself. Also, by the second day, it no longer hurt when I got my hands in warm/hot water like burns do for days after the initial attack. This situation alone will definitely ensure I NEVER run out of this stuff.he aloe I keep on the frig door and slowly dribbled it into my hand and let it run over the side where the worst part of the burn was.

            <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;m asked for a review.  Already reviewed.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Not same product as pictured. Very unsatisfied. This is not a gel and not 100 % Aloe Vera. Not even the same bottle as pictured. Look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a gel not a liquid.</li>
            <li> Very good for the skin!</li>
            <li> I really liked this but it&#x27;s too expensive. I found a 16 oz  product that is very similar here on Amazon that was much more cost effective.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, smells great too. Wish it came in a bigger bottle though</li>
            <li> I have been browsing for 100% aloe vera products and came across this one with good enough reviews. However, How can they call it 100% aloe vera when the ingredients clearly state more than aloe in it. Just a thought!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is called a gel. It looks, feels and behaves like tap water from a rusty pipe. I couldn&#x27;t use it for anything, because it just ran off my hand like water. I dumped it down the drain.</li>
            <li> There are  many things you can do with aloe Vera gel but I mainly use it for my Skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; aloe vera gel is good for face moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I mix my aloe gel with Coconut oil, water, essential oil and avocado oil. Rub it on my face every morning. It makes the skin smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my scar and skin burn. I mix aloe with vitamin e. Aloe has a good smell, especially after I remove from Ref.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another Ideal gifts for beauty and health conscious. ( I Don&#x27;t just Give the aloe itself. Make home made product then Give it as a Gift. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company carry good aloe gel and juice. I&#x27;m sure most of their product are also good. The price is very much affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stop buying expensive face moisturizer with so many chemical ingredients that I don&#x27;t even understand. I&#x27;ll rather make my own. It safe and healthy.</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO FIND LOTION THAT DOESN&#x27;T AGGRIVATE MY SKIN.  I THOUGHT ALOE VERA WOULD BE THE WAY TO GO UNFORTUNATLY THIS PRODUCT MADE MY SKIN RED AND SENSITIVE.</li>
            <li> The name is deceptive. It is not 100% Pure or even close.</li>
            <li> Pure Aloe Vera in a bottle is very hard to find.  This product had no added chemicals or alcohol.  Quick shipping. I used this to treat radiation therapy site.  Worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This is great aloe vera without any preservatives. If you&#x27;re expecting that thick green gel that you buy at Walmart, then you&#x27;ll be disappointed, because this is rather watery because it&#x27;s just aloe vera juice, without chemicals or thickeners in it. It feels soothing when you put it on your skin, and it works awesome after a sunburn. I also use it as toner in the morning, it makes me look fresh and moisturized all day. Get this if you are looking for pure aloe vera, it&#x27;s so much better for you than anything you can buy at drugstores. Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> This is awesome.  I have used it on everything.  My son has really bad cracks in his heals.  I put this on with some vitamin E oil and it heals him up quick.</li>
            <li> Wish was sold in bigger bottle !!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a long time for a product that didn&#x27;t contain artificial/carcinogenic preservatives, colorants etc. This is the product that is as natural is it can get! Instead of adding preservatives, Aubrey recommends to keep the liquid in your fridge. This is easily done and certainly worth it considering you are eliminating the necessity of synthetised preservatives. REALLY RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR REAL NATURAL PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Many people are under the mistaken impression that this is 100% pure aloe vera from the plant. This is not correct even though this is advertised as 100% pure aloe vera gel. A product advertised as 100% pure aloe vera gel should contain 100% aloe vera. However, aloe vera is one of many ingredients in this product. I want to know what % of this product is pure aloe vera? Is it 1% or half of 1%? What does 100% pure aloe vera gel really mean and how much aloe vera is really in this product? Unless you get this question answered, stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> Buy it again and again. Nice gel.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be helping my skin. Wish it were a little thicker, it is a little to runny. Otherwise great.</li>
            <li> Aloe vera is supposed to be great for the skin and an anti inflammatory. I bought this to use as part of a homemade face toner. I love it, I just wish I got a little more for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI,  I was surprised at how liquidy this was, basically like water. I expected it to be a bit thicker, like the gel that comes directly from the plant, but it&#x27;s not. It wasn&#x27;t a problem for me me, but if you&#x27;re looking for a product with a thick consistency, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have read the reviews first.  Thist is not Aloe Vera Gel.  It&#x27;s just watery aloe vera.  Like the stuff you can drink as a supplement.  Disappointing.  I wanted something that would soothe my adult acne, but sadly, this just fell right off my face.  Amazon shouldn&#x27;t call this aloe vera gela when the bottle just says \\&quot;aloe vera.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It is a liquid, not a gel as indicated her. Not sure how to use and apply because it feels weird splashing on this liquid.  Don&#x27;t think the bottle has not indication how to use it either.</li>
            <li> I have oily and acne-prone skin and I have been fighting with adult acne for years. From what I can tell is that my skin is not hydrated enough, so it produces somehow excessive sebum trying to keep the moisture. If I use alcohol based toner/astrigent, the alcolol dries out my skin even more. I have been trying all kinds of facial moiturizer from designer bands to those doctor&#x27;s lines. Lots of money and time wasted till I tried this Aloe Vera.     After I wash my face, I put this Aloe Vera juice on as a toner, followed by regurlad moisturizer and sunscreen. (I may leave out those moisturizer someday.) Only a day or two, I can really tell the difference. My skin is plum and soft, much less oil/shine on my face. My skin is calmed down by this aloe vera juice. Red marks after acne is less notible. With this new skin care routine and regular exfoliation, my acne is gone and no more.</li>
            <li> After reading previous reviews that highly praised this for burns, I purchased this over other similar products for its high percentage of aloe vera content.  I was surprised that it is more of a water-feeling clear liquid and not a thick gel. I hadn&#x27;t had a burn of any type in years, so it went straight into the door of the fridge as I had read a previous purchaser placed hers in the fridge to give the product more of a cooling effect when using.   Two days after receiving this product, while frying bread for Indian tacos, my tongs slipped out of my hand while lifting bread out of the oil and splattered a large amount of hot oil onto my stove and hand. I thought, \\&quot;Wow, I actually have something on hand for this!\\&quot;  I did exactly as one of the reviewers for this product stated, and poured a little of this on my burn immediately, then waited about 4-5 minutes and poured a little more on it.  With the first application, the immediate burning sensation was lessened by the coldness of the liquid since my alos vera had been in the fridge.  It was not a super intense and continual burning now that usually comes from these burns, but there was still a very slight burning sensation on my hand for the next few minutes but it seemed to be diminishing still, so I waited a couple more minutes to see if it would go away.  After waiting a total of about 5 minutes after the initial application, I reapplied the aloe vera gel and this time, with the cooling effect, immediately the last of the burning sensation was gone.  Also, there was no longer a red mark of any kind on my hand where the oil had landed and no sensitivity to touch or running water as usually follows from these burns.   I haven&#x27;t used aloe vera gel in the past, so this was my first experience and with using it for burns.  I had no idea how well this product would work on burns or I would have made a purchase years ago.  Nevertheless, I have now discovered the \\&quot;benefits\\&quot; of aloe vera on burns and I have to say, I certainly wish I hadn&#x27;t waited all these years to try it!  Excellent, excellent product! I definitely recommend it and will buy the same product again.</li>
            <li> quick shipping. product is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a moisturizer for my face and my skin looks so much better!  It has even helped with my acne- my face is much smoother and there is zero irritation.</li>
            <li> I use this for my cat&#x27;s skin when her ears start to crack and her hair has been growing back since then. I feel comfortable because it&#x27;s all natural and safe to use on animals.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Use it everyday under a heavier moisturizer. Great for acne prone skin, really calms and soothes inflammation after I give myself a peel, or other skin treatments. I keep it in the fridge.</li>
            <li> This is by far THE best Aloe on the market.  I suffered with excema and horrible itching for about 8 months, while trying all manner of topical treatments.  Finally got this and in TWO DAYS it was so much better as to pretty much be called WELL!  I even gave some to my cat when he was throwing up constantly, and he&#x27;s done better for the last 24 hours - so it looks like a &amp;#34;cure all&amp;#34; product!  What I was so sensitive to with all the other products I tried on the excema was the added ingredients (many are known irritants or cancer threats).  This stuff is about as pure as one can find.</li>
            <li> very super good quality~~!!!</li>
            <li> This product is the consistency of water. I&#x27;m not sure why everyone is saying this is the same consistency as aloe fresh squeezed from the plant. Aloe is definitely thicker than water. I will be going back to buying aloe gel capsules from the drugstore since there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a better option.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely and in good shape.  I used in making lip balm and sunscreen.  Easy to work with</li>
            <li> I use this as my face moisturizer and after two weeks the effect is amazing! I have lupus and get a rash across my nose and cheeks and a very dry face, I also have skin conditions on my scalp that causes dry, red sores across my forehead. I don&#x27;t want to put the steroid creams they prescribe on my face and scalp so I use this instead (used to use a aloe vera gel that works pretty well too, but this is way better) and my face is starting to look like me again! The rash will never go away but my dry skin and scales that come from the rash are infinitely better! The red sores on my forehead, across my hairline, are starting to go away and no longer itch as much. My neighbors and friends have started to tell me how \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; I look because I&#x27;m starting to look like me again! I can&#x27;t tell you how wonderful it is to hear that as lupus has aged me considerably!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if this organic, chemical free, wonderful aloe vera works great on me, it will certainly work fabulous on you! Thank you Aubrey Organics for giving me my face back with this miracle plant!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product expecting it to have a more gel like consistency but it ended up being too watery. It is almost like a toner. Plus, it had a weird smell to it and I couldn&#x27;t stand it unless I put a separate cream on top of it to cover up the smell. It didn&#x27;t break out my skin but it also didn&#x27;t do much. Then again, I only used it for 2 weeks and I stopped because of the smell. I think it would be better for me to just purchase the actual aloe vera plant.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for such a small bottle. Good ingredients though.</li>
            <li> My hair, face spritz, for bags under my eyes. It really is a great product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Use it almost everyday. Great for dry skin and acne</li>
            <li> A pretty good product for the price. It came out like a liquid rather than a gel, but in my understanding, I think Aloe Vera juice is supposed to have a watery consistency. Didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but I prefer using tea tree oil for blemishes, personally.</li>
            <li> Not a gel... it is runny and liquid. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was recommended to use Aubrey organics and I honestly do not like any of their products.As for this one since its watery you can use this as a skin toner like witch hazel.Aloe vera contains natural anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.Its gentle and cool on the eyes while wiping you face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to moisturize with this because it&#x27;s literally like a bottle of water. It&#x27;s kind of hard to moisturize with something sooo liquidy. It doesn&#x27;t stay on or absorb into my skin the way that I feel it should. I keep putting it on and on and on but it doesn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I did not know there was so much difference in 100% pure aloe vera and product you buy over the counter.  This stuff is great, TRY IT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for only two days and I&#x27;ve seen great improvement in my acne and acne scars (lighter and flatter). I&#x27;ve been using this after brushing my face with a gentle cleanser and exfoliating brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this because I read it would help with fading of scars. I&#x27;m not sure if there is any fading but my skin is soft.</li>
            <li> I believe there may have been an error in fulfilling my order.  I got a very think liquid NOT the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; I ordered.  Either an error, or their definition of &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is far different than mine.  It diluted the skin lotion recipe I was using it for into a sloppy mess.</li>
            <li> Love this product , my skin feels soft, fairer and less pimples ... From past 3 months , this is always on my face at night ... doesnt dry too much just perfect for a good night sleep... relax and let this Aloe gel do the work for u ...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know.  I like the coolness of the very moment that i put it on my skin.  But other than that, nothing else happened.</li>
            <li> I ordered this gel for very dry, scaly skin.  It works well but more liquid than gel consistency.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product if you&#x27;re in the market for aloe. Price was very reasonable...shipping was as much as product!  It works though, so it was worth paying double!</li>
            <li> Love this aloe so perfect for my skin will purchase again..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like that it has to be refrigerated, inconvenient to run downstairs when I get out of the shower, just to grab the bottle and apply this. Plus its not really thick to cover a wound area effectively, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Used for acne. Controlled it a little better than just using acne medicine alone.</li>
            <li> I thought that this product was going to be somewhat like a gel, and turns out that it is the same consistency as water. It was very messy to apply.</li>
            <li> I use this in my homemade vitamin C serum.  Really great product and helps my serum stay fresh longer.</li>
            <li> ...my bottle had two long strands of hair stuck inside the label attached to the bottle. This packaging issue has me worried about overall quality control.</li>
            <li> THIS ALOE VERA IS THE BEST IT HAS CLEARED UP ALOT OF MY ACNE AND MY FACE IS SO MUCH LESS OILY AND IT EVEN HELPED A LITTLE ON MY SCARS I HAVE NEVER HAD ALOE VERA LIKE THIS BEFORE WILL BUY ALAWYS THIS BRAND</li>
            <li> After reading the ingredients list on my Aloe Vera Gel, I noticed there were a lot of unnecessary ones in there to have it as a gel.  That&#x27;s why I thought I&#x27;d try this product.  It&#x27;s the real deal - it&#x27;s watery because aloe really is that way!  Also, it says to keep it refrigerated, which also indicates it&#x27;s real aloe and that will prolong its usage.  This is a great value and something you just don&#x27;t find in stores.  I highly recommend it if you want pure aloe vera without the added chemicals!</li>
            <li> This stuff dose wonders on sunburn. Just apply some to the affected areas and soothe it right down. Actually it helps getting away sunburns a lot faster than if not applied with anything. You can use this stuff for a lot more things. I love that its 100% organic as well. Only thing &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a bigger bottle. Seems to go fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this for post-pregnancy stretch marks and it has been working really well.  It&#x27;s also a great all-around moisturizer.  Also, it&#x27;s about $2 cheaper on Amazon than at my local Whole Foods.  Just a note, though - that the consistency is runny exactly like water but that&#x27;s how it should be.</li>
            <li> I use this Aloe Vera to make my own vitamin C serum. It works great. It is like a thicker fluid and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> My esthetician recommended using 100% aloe for helping with acne, so I found this on Amazon.com and purchased it.  The aloe helps prevent excessive sebum production which can inhibit the acne from surfacing.  Although this product has a watery substance, it absorbs into the skin quicker and easier because of it.</li>
            <li> Very Watery but nice product</li>
            <li> This is a great daily hair moisturizer for naturally curly hair. Especially for thinner hair to condition without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the turnaround time. It reached me in lesser time than the standard shipping. The product also exceeded my expectations and as someone pointed out, was very effective when i placed my hands accidentally on the stove. Yikes, it hurts even now. Aloe vera certainly helped !!!!!</li>
            <li> Made me break out horribly.. wish I could find something that is organic that actually works :(</li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed because it is so watery. As it turns out, it is much much nicer than the gel.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not sticky, makes skin feel very soft, and it worked great for moisturizing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> While I was in Peru, I worked at a frog hospital. I used Aubrey Organics - 100% Pure Aloe Vera Gel to massage into my leper girlfriend&#x27;s dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works very well and keeps the skin moisturized. When we were out, we used the real Aloe Vera plant. In it&#x27;s most basic form, Aloe Vera is a most potent sticky, pus-like liquid.</li>
            <li> Great product for soothing irritated areas of the body.  I absolutely love it!  : )</li>
            <li> This is not Aloe gel, but instead Aloe Juice. Product is mis-labled. Having used the Aubry gel, it is one of the best, but this is not it.</li>
            <li> If your skin is very sensitive to moisturizers that have alcohol in them,  then use this natural product 99 percent pure.  Keep in the refrigerator after opening.  This is a liquid</li>
            <li> I wish I can get my money back do not buy it it&#x27;s like water doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m moisturizing my face at all aloe is supposed to  moisturize and heal right</li>
            <li> Awesome! Starting to see results.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for razor burn!  Do keep in mind that the bottle recommends that you keep this stuff in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> My cat&#x27;s heels were raw and scabbed because of weight-loss due to his heart medication, and I needed a natural topical solution that wouldn&#x27;t harm him if he licked it off.  My vet suggested 100% pure aloe vera.  Sadly, my cat went into heart failure in November 2008, but in the last few weeks of my boy&#x27;s life, this aloe did work in healing raw heels.  I&#x27;ve used it myself a few time on extremely dry patches of skin and it works great!</li>
            <li> While I was in Peru, I worked at a frog hospital.  I used Aubrey Organics - 100% Pure Aloe Vera Gel to massage into my leper girlfriend&#x27;s dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works very well and keeps the skin moisturized.  When we were out, we used the real Aloe Vera plant.  In it&#x27;s most basic form, Aloe Vera is a most potent sticky, pus-like liquid.</li>
            <li> Great product, already bought a second bottle!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using on my face as a toner and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish the bottles were bigger!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for  pure aloe vera for a while. This one is as good as taking the aloe from a plant. I use it on my face and has helped lighten the brown spots and marks. It also immensely helps in lightening the scars from burn during cooking. Also apply it on my hair for frizz and also gives a shine and smoothness especially as i am trying to do a no shampoo phase</li>
            <li> This is so much nicer than applying a gel. It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky and works instantly to make you feel cooler. It seems to work very well while my skin healed from sunburn.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s pure aloe, which is very important for me, but I wish it were a tid thicker. It&#x27;s like water, which makes it a bit hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I used this product while I was on vacation on the beach every single day. My first day I got some bad sunburn, and this product really helped to soothe the discomfort and keep my skin hydrated. It was also nice and cooling since I keep it refrigerated (as the bottle recommends). It&#x27;s also good for itchy skin, whether it is from sunburn or just a rash or hives, since it helps calm irritation. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I got this at my doctors advice for a scar I got on my forehead to soften the tissue. Not only has the scar faded and feels softer, but the aloe works as a GREAT moisturizer for my very sensitive facial skin. When I&#x27;m done treating my scar I might use it instead of the pricey face lotion I use. It absorbs immediately. No acne (actually helped?) Works on sensitive skin. Needs to be in the fridge because it does not contain many preservatives, so it might not be great for the beach. I imagine it would be great for kids. FYI more fluid than gel. (Gel is usually chemical in these products)</li>
            <li> I wanted something that I could just keep in the bathroom.... not to have to go to the refrigerator every time I wanted to use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too watery and smells like plastic. Also it feels like it takes forever for my skin to soak it up. Not sure I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This Organic Aloe Vera is the best you can get. I have tried so many Aloe Vera products that were supposed to be 100% Organic and nothing compares to Aubrey Organics Pure Aloe Vera Tonic. Even though it&#x27;s only 4 oz it lasted me for several month. I have had acne problems for years and nothing would work for me. This little bottle was just a miracle for me. Using it ever morning on my face and also as after shave. My face has never been so clear and free of acne and other skin problems. It does not leave any residue and it absorbs very quickly. Other products left a layer of sticky residue or smelled bad. Highly recommend this product for anybody with any skin problems!&lt;br /&gt;I have looked for this product at Whole Foods and other holistic stores and could not find it anywhere. I was told they discontinued selling Aubrey Organics for some reason. So glad Amazon has it for a great price!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product. I decided to give it a try as a moisturizer for my dry skin during the winter months. I have acne prone skin and wanted something that wasn&#x27;t going to really clog my pores. So far so good. I have decently oily skin to begin with and this tends to help keep that under control somewhat. I have also used it for burns and it really helps my skin. However, you must know that this product does not have a gel-like substance that people are used to from store bought aloe vera. This is liquid and should be refrigerated after opened. Plus it feels nice and cool when applied. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for organic aloe; this is as close as it gets next to the real thing.</li>
            <li> works really well, I just wish it moisturized my skin a bit more. but so far I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and pure Aloe. I love it. It&#x27;s very refreshing and it works.</li>
            <li> It smells to me a little funny, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but I don&#x27;t feel it smoothes my skin either... just alright.</li>
            <li> Great for slathering on after a long day in the sun. Makes a wonderful face cream, too. I also like the fact that it&#x27;s aloe and not aloe plus a bunch of chemicals added in. One drawback is that it is a little runny so take that into account when you are dispensing it. Remember to keep it refrigerated!</li>
            <li> Works well with Nuface.</li>
            <li> Best Aloe Ever! I keep a bottle on hand, in the fridge for burns, etc, but I also use this daily as a facial skin toner after cleansing. It keeps my skin soft and I think it even helps prevent breakouts. This is a very liquid product, not gel-like, it pours very easily out of the bottle, smooths onto the skin well and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a wonderful skin product! This is by far the best aloe I have used for my skin. I truly hope Amazon keeps selling it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an african-American woman with thick, naturally curly hair. I use this as a sealant after I apply my leave-in conditioner and moisturizer. Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I was waiting and waiting for this product to make my daughters diaper wipes before she had to go back to daycare. It didn&#x27;t arrive when they said it would so I ended up running over to The Vitamin Shop and getting a bigger bottle for less.</li>
            <li> I attempted to use this product in a completely 100% organic lotion, it didn&#x27;t turn out how I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product. Serves its purpose very well. I was expecting aloe vera cream instead of gel liquid and hence 4 stars. But its more over my mistake in not reading the product description well. B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;P-Muri.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to buy this . hurricane sandy was supposed to hit yesterday and the day before that !! and it hit hard !! i didn&#x27;t think i would get it on time . i thought it would come really late buy boy was i wrong !! it came 2-3 days early !! i&#x27;m a happy customer !! :) very fast shipping , the bottle was in good condition . i haven&#x27;t opened it yet , but hopefully the product itself is good !! thank-you !! :)</li>
            <li> I keep it in the fridge, and use it as an after shave.  Great feel, nice and cool, no alcohol sting.  Since it&#x27;s a natural product, it&#x27;s consistency varies.  I like it best when it&#x27;s a little thick.  Sometimes it&#x27;s too watery. That&#x27;s why I took away a star.</li>
            <li> I use this to mix with Vitamin C powder and it works great. I won&#x27;t go on and on - it serves it&#x27;s purpose, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> and I use 1-2 drops on my face as a toner. It&#x27;s very refreshing. I haven&#x27;t burned myself in the year I&#x27;ve had it so I can&#x27;t say how well it does on burns, but I love this stuff. It makes my skin look so healthy. I think I&#x27;m down to the last little bit of the bottle after a year of using it, so it&#x27;s time to buy another one. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to expect much from this lil jar, but after 9 days of applying it to my face morning and night&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed on the renewal of my skin.. my pores are almost non existent and my face is glowing/dewy.. I&#x27;ve tried it all from aveda to bio-elements and from what i can tell i just wasted a bunch of money with little results.. I bought 2 more bottles of this because i don&#x27;t ever want to run out.. I just cant speak highly enuff on this product.. MIX WITH COCOCARE VIT E FOR AWESOME RESULTS!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought to use on my face, and so far it&#x27;s doing a great job. It helps soften my skin and does wonders for my complexion, even making my cheeks naturally rosy looking. It does a great job with my acne as well, which is what I mainly purchased this for, helping to minimize the acne altogether as well as reduce redness without much aid as I only use an acne face cleanser once a day in the morning and a regular face cleanser at night. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> This is used in part of a face mask, and I love the way my skin feels after applying this with other products!</li>
            <li> Please be advised this is a very watery mixture.  I love that it is pure aloe Vera, I use it every night on my face, it is very moisturizing and has made a slight improvement on my acne scars and fine lines.</li>
            <li> This is listed as Aloe Vera GEL and it is not gel.</li>
            <li> Background:&lt;br /&gt;I am a young Afro caribbean women with hyper pigmentation, and also suffer from a combo of oily and dry skin with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product a while ago but just couldn&#x27;t make a commitment to using it. I just recently starting using it consistently, and ohhh boy do I regret not using it all this time. Right after I was my face morning and night I use a small amount to set a good base my makeup and other products apply to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly for me at least, aloe seems to add all the good things back to my skin. My skin is less oily AND less try, my hyper pigmentation and acne has become more settled.</li>
            <li> This is great aloe. Put on right after being in the sun to keep your skin healthy and pain free.</li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s super sensitive- I&#x27;m also on Retin-A for acne, which increases sensitivity &amp; can cause redness/peeling occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;This aloe is a lifesaver, so soothing. Gels you get in stores have all kinds of garbage fillers in them, that leave my skin burning and sticky-feeling. Not this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleanse my face, dry off, apply some witch hazel all over, then take this aloe from the fridge &amp; apply it to my whole face (lips too). Calms my skin right down. I apply my Retin-A &amp; moisturizer after that. I&#x27;ve only had this stuff for a couple weeks now, but I&#x27;m noticing marked improvement. Will definitely buy again. And again.</li>
            <li> i have been using this for years, it is great. and it make my skin look smooth without wrinkle and touched like baby skin. I introduced to my family members, now they started to use and love it. it is not too expensive like brand name skin care but very good efficient.</li>
            <li> First I don&#x27;t like the texture, then I find the texture is wonderfully mix and contain moisturize with a few drops of essential oils. Never went back to use a synthetic cream that full of hassle chemicals. But the design of the opener needs some skill to navigate: First, shake the bottle. Second, one hand holds the bottle and the other hand covers the opener when you open it (because it will spill out a drop when you open it!! That&#x27;s the part of the design I dislike the most!!) Third, when you&#x27;re done and close it, use the finger to lick the opener clean.... usually it will has some left around the opener....</li>
            <li> Aubrey products are always the highest quality. All natural. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I read aloe in gel form is not very good because the chemicals used to make it a gel are carcinogenic.  This is very liquid like.  I like it.  I recommend it for the skin before acne treatments or anti wrinkle treatments.  It is also recommended for the hair.  It moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I make my own hair care products.  I add this to my mixture of cream and oil for moisture in my hair. Very Good . Just wish it was in a larger size.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This is a good product. Best for sunburns and mild irritations. As for the &amp;#34;consistency&amp;#34; though, I was expecting something more like gel. All in all: good product + good company reputation.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace another facial skin care product which has yet to run out so I can&#x27;t speak to how it works under make-up. A few days ago though my toes became swollen and inflammed and I remembered I had the aloe in the fridge so I put some on every day for about 4 days and there was a huge improvement! I&#x27;ve had this before and it lasted months so I feel it really helped. Since I had some extra in my hand I put it on some scars from bug bites and I can really tell that they have faded! I have to say it worked better than expected and I love that there aren&#x27;t a bunch of chemicals in it. I&#x27;m happy to put it in the fridge if that means they can keep the toxic chemicals out of it! I&#x27;m looking forward to trying it on my face, after toner and under moisturizer. It&#x27;s always great to find something that really works!</li>
            <li> Great, but wish they made it in gel form!  It is very cooling and feels great on dry damaged skin.  It&#x27;s hard to find 100% Aloe Vera in local stores.</li>
            <li> I rate this product with 4 out of 5 stars because this product works and does what I purchased it to do. I really love the fact that this totally natural and organic. It also doesn&#x27;t contain any fillers like other aloe vera products I have researched and thought about purchasing .After using this I would definitely recommend this product to a friend or family member.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a last resort to an allergic reaction I was having on my face.  With all the unnatural ingredients in so many facial care products my face has finally revolted.  I looked everywhere for some type of natural relief which ended up being virtually impossible because almost all store bought products have some type of non-natural ingredients.  A few weeks prior to my skin breakout I got a burn on my hand and used aloe vera.  I figured that it definitely would not hurt to give aloe vera a chance to heal my allergic reaction.  However, I did not want to use the product I used on my hand because it wasn&#x27;t straight aloe vera but was an aloe vera based gel.  Seeing how my face revolted with other products I wanted to get pure aloe vera.  Amazon seemed to be the only place I could locate the 100% aloe vera.  The only ingredient in the bottle.  Yes, it has the consistency of water but it didn&#x27;t deter me from using it.  It had a slight smell to it that wasn&#x27;t pleasant but it wasn&#x27;t so unpleasant I could not stand it.  After a few days my rash was completely gone!  Also, my face seemed to also lose some of the breakouts that I had.  I now use it daily under my moisturizer and makeup in hopes of it being like a protectant to any chemicals in the products I am using.  In fact, I also have recently started using some of it on my scalp after washing my hair and before styling my hair.  I hope that this will help my dry, itchy, flaky scalp.  If it works I&#x27;ll update this review.  I recommend this purchase and would like to purchase a bigger bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I still really like this product but I will say that the bottle top now leaks.  I can&#x27;t leave this bottle on its side and have to make sure it remains upright because the liquid seeps out between the bottle top and the bottle.  Even when the top is closed and fastened.  I feel like I have lost quite a bit of product because of this and (although this stuff isn&#x27;t extremely expensive it also isn&#x27;t cheap either.  I was taking this bottle with me in my purse and after a few accidents I can no longer do that.</li>
            <li> i bought this to make homemade baby wipes. didn&#x27;t really find it that useful for that so i didn&#x27;t end up satisfied, but the product came as described. worked fine.</li>
            <li> I mix this with shea butter and apply to my hair, but I thought it would be thicker.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the product because I suffer from hyperpigmentation. Anytime I have an injury, bite, scrape, no matter what, I&#x27;m left with a mark after it heals.  I was bit by something several times on my arms and I scratched them. When the bumps dried, I was left with small to medium sized marks!  I looked for pure aloe vera.  I found this on Amazon.com and decided to try it.  It worked wonders for me.  Every mark, new and old that it touched, vanished.  I was very happy with the product. Didn&#x27;t really take long either. Inexpensive and effective.  I was truly amazed and satisfied.  Follow the directions though and keep it in the fridge after each use. Otherwise, it won&#x27;t be as effective.  Good luck with your healing!</li>
            <li> Not really 100% Aloe Vera pure. Says that right on the bottle. So it&#x27;s misleading to state this in the ad for it. That said, Aubrey is a good quality brand and I&#x27;ve found it to be great anyway.</li>
            <li> Skin just drinks it up and feels so soft and smooth. It helps to lightly pat the skin after application, seems to help absorption, which is very fast and doesn&#x27;t leave any film on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the lack of preservatives and other additives. It should therefore be refrigerated after opening, but i found that it seemed to be just fine for at least a week kept in a cool place but not refrigerated.</li>
            <li> I liked the product...however, it didn&#x27;t really do much for me... so I do not believe that I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I recently read research that described the benefits of using Aloe Vera with a Retin-A product for Acne sufferers, it actually improved the resolution of acne.  Many people cannot tolerate the harsh effects of Retin-A, the redness etc.  I used this over my Retin-A and was AMAZED how well it worked.  It stopped the slight burning sensation and redness I get with Retin-A.  I use Retin-A for anti-aging purposes, not acne....but it worked like a treat.  Went on very smoothly.  Would recommend any time.  Plus its completely natural (unlike many other Aloe Vera gel products).</li>
            <li> I keep this in my refrigerator and whenever I burn myself in the kitchen, I put a small amount on the burn.  It immediately soothes the burn and if it is a small burn, I don&#x27;t have to do anything else.  If it is a more intense burn, I sometimes use the aloe and then a little soaking in cold water for maybe a few minutes and then the aloe again; this solves even the more intense burn.  By the next day, the burn seems to be gone and I can use my finger (the usual place I burn myself in the kitchen) again without any pain.  Before I started using the aloe, I used to have to soak my finger for at least half an hour in water just to not be in pain and the next few days I would still feel where I had burnt myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only have to use a small amount, so don&#x27;t feel concerned that the bottle is small.  Yesterday my daughter came home with a sunburn on her shoulders and back and still it didn&#x27;t take much to give her a nice light coat of aloe.  It absorbs very quickly and although you feel like you are only putting water on (because it is a fine, clear liquid), you notice the effect of it being more than water right away.  My daughter&#x27;s sunburn took two separate coats about 2 hours apart to make her feel as if she didn&#x27;t need anymore.  She&#x27;s still a bit red today, but not in pain.</li>
            <li> After days of research I came across an article for natural remedies for acne or blemishes. And aloe vera was listed. I was tempted to buy an aloe vera plant but went ahead with this. Uhm, it&#x27;s definitely not an acne cure. I apply it twice a day with a cotton ball before moisturizing. I do still get breakouts, and they last just about the same length of time. However, I have some acne scarring and after 2 weeks of using this i noticed a major difference in skin evenness and scar fading. So while I&#x27;m still on the hunt for my mild acne I know that this is the only thing I&#x27;ll be using for scarring.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this because it was too runny.  It seemed to me that it wasn&#x27;t pure gel.  It was much thinner and appeared as if it was watered down.  It probably wasn&#x27;t but I just didn&#x27;t like the texture.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my face as a toner after cleansing my face. I really do love how it has left my skin feeling.</li>
            <li> This item is made from quality ingredients, but it is a very thin liquid which may not work for all intended uses.</li>
            <li> Use this as hair gel.  I have fine, wavy/curly hair that gets really frizzy in the summer humidity, but this seems to keep it in control.  I fill my palm w/ the product and finger through wet hair.  I scrunch a little and then spray a little oil or sea salt spray on top, then don&#x27;t touch it until it&#x27;s completely dry.  It will harden as it dries, once completely dry, I scrunch my fingers through again to get rid of any hardened strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also applied some on a rash and it cleared up w/in one week.  Note: this product is pretty watery and not gel like.</li>
            <li> This a liquid not a gel. I really like it. It is easy to spread over my skin and it is not sticky at all. I find it cools my skin and relieves itchiness. Good for sunburn as well as just regular moisturizing and itch relief. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> you can get in whole food market only 7 dollars... but this product this really good, but thin as i thought before, it is really pure and natural, gentle, i have really sensitive skin, overally, its really good.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be getting a gel solution. Instead I got liquid only. It was not what I wanted or expected.</li>
            <li> wonderfull&lt;br /&gt;i used for all&lt;br /&gt;my hair&lt;br /&gt;my face&lt;br /&gt;my nails&lt;br /&gt;my face look better now, is really good for acnec</li>
            <li> Excellent product - actually is 100% pure.  She keeps it in the refrigerator.  It was used during radiation therapy to help alleviate skin burns.</li>
            <li> Not sticky like so many but this is a liquid not a gel</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own beach spray for my hair. It has also been used to treat sunburns and is SO much better than the store bought lotions and gels. 4 oz also goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this as a general all over the face moisturizer, now that it is summer in Baltimore, this is the perfect moisturizer, it only requires a nickel size amount, and keeps the skin balanced, especially on the dog days of humid temperatures!</li>
            <li> As far as natural things go, this is the real deal.. I&#x27;m telling you, it&#x27;s as if I broke off the aloe vera plant in half and just applied the liquid inside to my face. Of course, because it is so natural and has no added chemicals to make it more consistent, it is basically liquid, but it&#x27;s not hard to apply on face or hair or body. The skin absorbs it immediately :-)&lt;br /&gt;You get a feeling of &#x27;tightness&#x27; in your face after you apply it, same feeling you get if you were applying a face mask or liquid collagen, you immediately feel your face a bit tighter. I applied it right where I had 3 disgusting left over pimples and in 5 minutes one of them started to peel off!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;amazing. This is the next best thing to have if you cannot have an Aloe Vera plant in your house :)</li>
            <li> Great product and good for your skin!  Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> It helps my face&#x27;s acne scars and redness.  Mix it with your lotion to apply it easier, it has a very cooling effect.</li>
            <li> I got this product to help with my box scars on my face. I use it along with a drop of tea tree oil and it is amazing how much my pores have shrunk. I will order again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just reordered this product.  It&#x27;s thick, it works wonderfully on sunburns and other minor skin irritations.  I&#x27;ve used it to make different skin creams for friends and family and I&#x27;ve found that it works wonderfully every time.  A great buy!</li>
            <li> Great product! I love to use it as a base for DIY face tonics and astringents!</li>
            <li> Great quality Aloe Vera. Bought it to make a DIY lotion with Young Living essential oils. Fast shipping and product was as described. Worked great for my lotion. I would buy again!</li>
            <li> I love that this is basically pure aloe. Aloe isn&#x27;t the only ingredient but it is the first and the rest aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34;. It is a liquid which makes it pretty easy to gel. I use this on my face, hands, and anywhere I have dry patches or rashes when they come up.</li>
            <li> Aubrey Sun Care Aloe Vera Gel really moisturized my skin and cleared up my acne. I would&lt;br /&gt;recommend this aloe vera gel to my friends wanting moisturize skin.</li>
            <li> It is too runny but it&#x27;s still ok.</li>
            <li> I got this for my face since I have acne prone skin. I heard Aloe Vera does wonders for the skin and it many cases it cures acne. So i got the organic one and followed the steps. but this one didn&#x27;t do a single thing for my skin. It was watery and I just didn&#x27;t really see the point of this. I mean, perhaps I just kept using it like I was supposed to, but I didn&#x27;t feel or saw any kind of improvement at all.</li>
            <li> an \\&quot;aloe\\&quot; that is natural... lighter... non greasy...quickly absorbent... makes your skin softer :)    gives you best feeling when you use it \\&quot;cool\\&quot; after refrigeration.</li>
            <li> This product helps instantly with sunburns and other ailments. Just be sure to store it in the fridge!</li>
            <li> GREAT for sunburns!  Very thin consistency, but absorbs well.</li>
            <li> My skin hates this and dried out from it. Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, I use it all the time, especially after sun exposure. Just makes the skin feel good. Use it a lot in winter also for dry skin, works better then some lotions.</li>
            <li> I love to use this on my face. Somehow I remember this being thicker than it is now. But my skin is really sensitive, so when I need a break from chemicals, I slather this on to heal my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is slowly but surely fading the scars on my arms. (scratch marks) It takes a lot longer with burn marks for some reason but you start to see results after 3 weeks or so of consecutive application. Then again the results are very minimal but i&#x27;m hoping that it will eventually fade entirely. Also I highly recommend keeping it refrigerated as the consistency is better to work with.</li>
            <li> This went rancid super fast! It truly is pure, so make sure you refrigerate it. Unfortunately, it shipped over a period of a couple days in the hot sun, so be aware of the conditions in which you order this product. I did add it to a few different products, and the one with more preserving natural ingredients is doing well. I used it in a facial moisturizer that began to smell like vinegar after two weeks. I opened the bottle in the refrigerator of what was left of this product and noticed a brown ring around the bottom of the bottle. So, while natural is awesome, I opted to go with a different product that has a tiny preservative instead for future use.</li>
            <li> I use this as a daily moisturizer and it&#x27;s the only thing that doesn&#x27;t make my face oily during the day. I think this is the only aloe vera product that I&#x27;ve found without other chemicals or ingredients. This has been my go-to face moisturizer, as it&#x27;s light and natural.</li>
            <li> In addition to working great on sunburns, this is awesome as a facial toner!  I leave it in the fridge and pour some onto a cotton pad after I wash my face.  It&#x27;s cooling and leaves my face feeling refreshed and ready for moisturizer.. sunscreen.. makeup.. etc.  I&#x27;m already on my 7th bottle!!  No more spending $30-$40 on high end toners. :)</li>
            <li> I needed a sealant for my daughters 3b fine hair. Hey Fran Hey recommended this and I love it!!  It&#x27;s all natural and very light and keeps the moisture in.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really help my skin like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I just like that it is aloe vera liquid and I like using it as an addition when moisturizing my face/skin.  I keep it in the refrigerator as instructed on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Excellent on the hair.</li>
            <li> I’m assuming it’s supposed to be very water’ d out if that make sense. Let’s just say it’s more comparable to water than gel or face lotion literally.</li>
            <li> This Aloe Vera is so smooth. Kept in the refrigerator it is cool and available any time. Aubrey Organics is always a good choice.</li>
            <li> Even though I had read in previous reviews that it was very liquid, I was still surprised to find out how liquid it was.  It&#x27;s pretty much like pouring water on your hands and then applying it.  We used it after sun exposure and it seems to have hydrated our skin as we did not blister or peel, it also prevented skin redness.  I am very happy that it does not have all the additives and preservatives that other aloe gels have.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 just because it is a little bit hard to apply due to it being so liquid.</li>
            <li> Good product, for the most part its exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected--a nice aloe Vera that absorbs easily. It is very thin, so if you are looking for a thick gel this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I&#x27;ve been having rashes all over my body lately and I placed this in the freezer for a few hours and applied it all over my arms and legs, I was very impressed by the effectiveness of this product!  The consistency as some other reviewers noted is very watery, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m writing a review based of AMAZON Aubrey&#x27;s organic aloe vera. Why? It&#x27;s FALSE ADVERTISING. When I got this at the vitamin shoppe, the bottle says 98% aloe vera!! This is not 100%! The real stuff is amazing, I love it. Amazons aloe vera is false.</li>
            <li> I make my own mascara and other make up and this aloe is essential. I don&#x27;t have to worry about impurities so close to my eye. There are a ton of uses. it&#x27;s a Must Have.</li>
            <li> A very good product. Used it to make organic baby wipes. Excellent result.</li>
            <li> product has alcohol and that is bad for skin.</li>
            <li> Really really really like this product! I have very sensitive skin and I use mostly organic products. This product I use sort of like a toner. It&#x27;s liquid-y and is not a gel like substance. you just have to put couple drops on your hand and dab it on your face. I don&#x27;t like to use cotton wipes or balls because they have so much bacteria on them. So I only use this after shower and when my hands are clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for about a week, but I&#x27;m comfortable writing the review because it&#x27;s done half of what I needed already - calm my sensitive skin.  I use sunscreen, vitamin c and a salicylic acid exfoliant that all seem to just set my skin on fire for a few minutes every morning and night.  I thought it was the price I had to pay for the benefits they provided.  I actually chose THIS product because I read reviews saying it moisturized and helped with dark spots (I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to comment); but the moment it touched my skin I knew I&#x27;d use it every time I wash and buy it again and again.  This stuff put the fire out immediately without drying my skin out further!  That alone makes it an absolute keeper in my book. Can I give it another star?</li>
            <li> I love this aloe vera!  It does come out of the bottle in a watery texture but I used it last year for sunburn and it was relieved both my pain along with any concerns I had for what I was putting on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this product as an astringent twice a day after washing my face. My sensitive skin feels great!</li>
            <li> Has a much wetter consistency than the aloe gels you&#x27;re probably used to but is very effective with healing properties.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on burns, minor skin irritations and it even makes personal hygiene after bowel movements much more comfortable and pleasant by applying it on toilet paper or cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li> The best aloe vera formulation that I have been able to find. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of additives so is thin rather than gloopy and has a neutral scent. It works very well as a light moisturizer for my sensitive combination skin, which is prone to irritation and redness.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Hard to find a pure aloe vera product that works so well. I use this on sunburns, dry skin, and underarms when irritated.</li>
            <li> i think is good im in china my friend says this is good for sunburn,hahaha</li>
            <li> too liquidy......go with Aloe Life brand.</li>
            <li> Very watery. I purchased to use on face as  a conductor with &amp;#34;Nuface&amp;#34;. But its too watery to use for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;It isnt a gel as labelled, it feels like water. So if you want a gel dont bother, if you want something very watery-then yes, but I dont know why you would want that.</li>
            <li> Mixes great with my other products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I use the actually Aloe from the plant itself. But this product comes in handy when I dont feel like taking out the time to cut open the plants and do all that extra work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin either, it&#x27;s more like a juice I&#x27;d say. No complaints here.</li>
            <li> I had been reading a lot of reviews online, and getting tips from friends about Aloe Vera for the hair and scalp, so I decided to try it for myself.  This stuff made my hair so soft, and made my scalp feel so good.  This Aloe Vera is very liquidy but since you put it in the refrigerator it feels great cold on the scalp.  I even tried a small amount on my skin and it made my skin soft as well.  I hear that Aloe Vera has many uses so why not buy it?  You will most likely use it for something.</li>
            <li> Seriously works wonders for redness and irritation. So cooling and really refreshing. Be sure to keep this in the fridge. Amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that has helped my postacne scars to significantly lighten up without any irritation! I ve been using rhis for a little over a month abd a half, so patience is key but you won&#x27;t regret buying this product!</li>
            <li> Very pure aloe.  It&#x27;s a liquid, with the viscosity close to that of water, which surprised me at first..  This worked great for me, as I purchased it to use as a spray-in hair conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed this about 60/40 with water, added 2 drops of glycerine, 2 drops of jojoba, and a pinch of pure kaolin clay.  The first time I used it this way a girl stopped me and simply said, &amp;#34;Your hair is perfect&amp;#34;.  Nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other aloes since, but they did not work as well, so I&#x27;m coming back.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will buy it again, however I wish it were available in a larger size.</li>
            <li> Aubrey Organics 100% Pure Aloe Vera is a great natural product to have if you&#x27;re suffering from acne or want to help fade blemishes or to add moisture to your hair when combined with bentonite clay. Aloe Vera will do it all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin I recommend you use Aloe Vera only on spots needed. I combined tea tree oil, geranium oil and aloe vera juice together for spot treatments at bedtime. This combination is very effective at calming down inflammation and to help the healing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Aloe Vera is also a great astringent. It&#x27;s so beneficial and I can&#x27;t go without this product. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not a very good deal overall.  What you get is a small 4oz bottle of a watered down gel that is more like a juice that is so runny that it&#x27;s hard to apply where you want it,it&#x27;s not all aloe vera,the second biggest ingredient is grapefruit.  So far the best aloe vera I&#x27;ve tried came directly from aloe vera leaves that a neighbor grows,but has a very limited supply...The best bottled item I&#x27;ve tried so far is an 8oz bottle of aloe vera from AloeLife which uses seaweed as a thickening agent.I bought it thru Amazon..So far I have been unable to find 100% pure aloe vera gel that isn&#x27;t very expensive for the quantity you get.  Good luck with your search.</li>
            <li> My toddler had a burn, this help to soothe and heal it very nicely with minimal scarring. Must have for your first aid kit</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair and i love the look. My curls are well defined and if I forget to use this product (it is stored in the fridge) I have to rewash in a day or two to get my desired style</li>
            <li> I use it as a make up removal in the night and a moisturizer for the day before I put make up on. It&#x27;s perfect for every sking type, not only dry, it helps to cure some scars after spots.</li>
            <li> expensive, but safe and effective.  Just wish they would sell this product in a larger bottle at less price.  This stuff comes out like water, so be carefully not to waste it.</li>
            <li> I apply this to my face and neck after evening shower; its the best moisture repair for the skin I have ever used. Ive noticed a decrease in neck wrinkles</li>
            <li> Quality product. I add this aloe vera to my home made sun burn sprays. Love it !</li>
            <li> It WAS GOOD BUT THEY CHANGED THE INGREDIENTS to get an NSF rating and just like avalon organics they product is only half as good as it pervious was. Here were the old ingredients: Aloe leaf juice, citrus grapefruit extract, cyamopsis (guar gum), vitamin E (which lightens dark marks and scars).&lt;br /&gt;Here are the NEW INGREDIENTS: Aloe leaf juice, aqua (WATER) Radish root ferment Filtrate, cymaopis (guar gum) citric acid&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s review: they removed the vitamin E which helps lighten scars, ADDED PLAIN WATER (as if this wasn&#x27;t watery enough) added citric acid and radish root which are both irritating to the skin, I never got redness or sores from the old formula but this new formula is like acid on my skin. The new formula is TERRIBLE. Another company that ruined a perfectly good product that worked just to get a NSF rating. Crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous review:&lt;br /&gt;Lightens dark acne scars&lt;br /&gt;This product is AMAZING on acne scars and active cystic acne since aloe is antibacterial so is vitamin E. Dark spots are lightened amazingly with this. I really like this product and yes I do keep it in the refrigerator. Its very liquidy which concerned me at first but once I saw how well it works, I&#x27;m happy with it. It is drying so a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for more of a gel texture to make hand sanitizer with my girl scouts. It was super runny and when we rubbed it onto our skin, it felt a little slimy and it took a while to dry but was still sticky. I ended up purchasing some gel at a drug store for the project. I&#x27;m sure it would have been nice had I needed it for something else.</li>
            <li> First impression, I thought the bottle was small for the price. But it has proved to last a long time. A little goes a long way. And I am sure if we have left over, we will find use for it one way or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are using this as a natural remedy.&lt;br /&gt;First of, I have 4 kiddos. And the eldest 3 have had issues with contracting warts on their hands/knees/elbows. I had asked the pediatrician about treating the warts, as they have passed them to each other. The doctors were NOT willing to treat them. They felt, in most cases, in children, warts will go away in their own. My daughter has been the EXTREME exception to this theory.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, after almost 4 years of finding a wart growing on my daughters hand, when she was 3 and in PreK. She now has over 50 spreading all over her hands and arms, now spreading to her legs, and chin. Even after repeated requests to the doctor to do something to treat them, they insisted on leaving them alone.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is only 7.5yrs now. She has been having issues with peers not wishing to hold her hands, and constantly being asked what is all over her hands and arms. For a very shy girl this is a hardship for her, and really effects her self esteem. I feel, if they had been treated, when first requested, we may not be going through this. But I trusted the pediatricians opinion. And I am sure, that in most cases, he was right. But my poor daughter is now in a position of being labeled as the warty girl at school. In a small district it is hard label to get past. Especially when each grade only consist of 4-8 students.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This past year, I decided to take action on my own. Trying home remendies such as duct tape, tea tree oil...then finally getting a referral to the specialist, he tried using a blistering &amp;#34;Bug-juice&amp;#34; put her on a fermadahyde ointment(as my daughter was unwilling to try freezing, don&#x27;t blame her).. Our specialist recently retired and we are waiting on an appointment to a new specialist. So in the meantime we are trying an Aloe treatment, We started with using our plant, but it was so messy to apply. I decided to find an alternative, that is when I came across this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how our home treatments have gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trial with Tea tree oil:&lt;br /&gt;This did show some promising change in the warts, drying them, but did not get rid of them. Perhaps with a longer amount of time and more applications in a day, we would ha had more success....but the scent of tea tree oil was too strong for her. I now using the remainder of our in shampoo, which is in theory helps repel lice. Hey! Why not? I must say the kids have not had any issues with lice. So all is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trail with duct tape:&lt;br /&gt;My daughter would just pull it off. This may work, if you keep it on, but...I guess it is NOT for us. We even tried getting duct tape with characters on them; her choice was Hello Kitty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trail with Aloe:&lt;br /&gt;We soak small pieces of gauze in this aloe, and use nexcare waterproof bandages to keep them in place. So far this has shown the most positive progress. It has been 2 weeks and the largest wart(as her specialist dubbed, &amp;#34;the mother wart&amp;#34;, on her hand) is now flat and less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are only treating a few warts(or clusters of small warts) at a time to keep the treatment application tolerable for my daughter. She is being cooperative with this treatment since it doesn&#x27;t not hurt or smell, and is fairly quick and easy. We change the bandage 1-2xs a day. I prefer to do it morning and night, but sometimes are not able to. Having 4 busy kids, I sometimes forget. :(&lt;br /&gt;**Before trying this on my daughter I tested it on myself.  I had a wart on my finger tip, partially under my nail. I had froze 4-5 times and kept returning. (I did all the other treatments along with her, but due to the location on my particular wart, I had a hard time keeping a bandages on it. With this I ended up using a rubber finger cot over gauze and bandage, which seemed to do the trick) I tried 2, 1 week treatments of this. And since then, it has been gone for 4 months! Seriously!&lt;br /&gt;It took some convincing to allow my daughter to give it a try, but when she finally came on board. Being summer, it makes it easier to keep the bandages on during the day, and making sure if they fall off, they are replaced immediately. But the kids are busy, so sometimes they don&#x27;t get replaced right away. She has been better about telling me when one falls off. The more diligent you are the better it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you know it is working?&lt;br /&gt;1. The wart will start to turn white in color, then the layers begin to flake away, sometimes you won&#x27;t noctice as it will be stuck to the gauze or bandage.&lt;br /&gt;2. The wart will slowly change in size, the moisture of the aloe will help soften the wart and eventually it will separate from the skin, sometimes with happened as part of the flaking, but depending on the wart it may come out as a whole.&lt;br /&gt; (The wart of my finger tip did a fair amount of flaking, but then the entire tip of my finger sort of fell off. I left it untreated for a week, but thought I saw a sign of it returning, so I retreated it for another week)&lt;br /&gt;3. I would continue the treatment for a little while after the wart seems to be gone. If you decide to stop, keep and eye on the spot you treated.&lt;br /&gt;4. If there is any sign of the wart returning, treat it again for at least another week. Repeat as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from warts, I suggest you give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update: We have seen her specialist, he has put her on his own regiment, but the aloe started a good progress at minimizing the largest warts. So with the doctors regiments these pre tested warts are almost gone. The ones I did not treat are still very present. I may treat them with the aloe, and continue the doctors regiment as well. But I will wait until our follow up appointment to decide.it has been gone for 4 months! Seriously! It took some convincing to allow my daughter to give it a try, but when she finally came on board.

            <li> This product is NOT 100% Pure Aloe Vera - it&#x27;s a lie!!&lt;br /&gt;When I applied it to my daughter&#x27;s skin, it turned red and felt burning within 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I was so surprised to see such a burning red irritation when I purchased 100% PURE aloe. I started thinking she is allergic to it.&lt;br /&gt;So I tried pure aloe from the aloe plant and my daughter said it felt perfect, no stinging, no burning and her skin did NOT turn red or even pink at all. THIS MEANS THIS PRODUCT HAS UNDECLARED INGRIDIENTS SUCH AS ALCOHOL OR GLYCERIN THAT IRRITATE skin.  I could have bought one of the cheap aloe vera gels from supermarkets, but I bought this &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; one - WHAT A WASTE!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Great for hair and skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find pure aloe vera. My plant just doesn&#x27;t grow fast enough for my needs (I use it in lotion mostly.) It did the job and was what I wanted (100% aloe, no additives), but pretty pricey and a small container so I&#x27;m probably going to get my next batch from Mountain Rose Herbs.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected -  hard to push top open and then liquid spills out too fast.  Wouldn&#x27;t reorder.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product out of desperation to treat stubborn eczema on my eyelids.  About a year ago I developed red, flaking, itching, painful skin around the crease of my eyelids.  I couldn&#x27;t get rid of it.  I stopped using cosmetics.  I tried benadryl cream and four other homeopathic rash/psoriasis/eczema creams.  I tried coconut oil, shea butter, argan oil, maracuja oil, and sweet almond oil.  I tried washing only with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap, and applying nothing else to my eyelids.  None of this worked.  Finally after many months of itching and pain, I saw online recommendations to try aloe vera for eczema.  I chose the Aubrey brand for its limited additives.  With twice daily applications, my eczema was gone in two weeks.  It is also the only solution that felt good with application.  The aloe felt cool and soothing upon application, whereas the creams and oils burned and itched.  Because I had great results, I continue to use Aubrey&#x27;s aloe to my face and hands after washing.  My skin looks great and the eczema has not returned.  I also think the aloe helped heal/prevent cracking skin around my knuckles in cold weather.</li>
            <li> this stuff,  pure aloe vera, is hard to find. but find it i did, and used it to make a moisturizer</li>
            <li> Much too watery and easily spills when trying to apply some.&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase it again, and I am unable to use the one I presently have.</li>
            <li> Makes my curls soft and manageable...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed in this product. The consistency is just like water. There is no scent or texture. As suggested, I refrigerated it hoping the cooler temperature would thicken the consistency. It did not. I feel the purchase was a complete waste of money. I will not recommend this I will not order this again.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and night. My skin can tell the difference. I will be ordering this again. I have had an aloe vera plant which I used for burns and cuts, but this bottle is easier to take care of.</li>
            <li> When I searched on Amazon for 100% pure aloe vera, that is what I was looking for, and this is the item that came to the top of the search. However if you&#x27;re a better consumer than I am and actually read further down in the description, you&#x27;ll see this ingredient list somewhere in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Aloe barbadensis (aloe) leaf juice*, citrus grandis (grapefruit) extract, cyamopsis tetragonoloba (guar) gum*, tocopherol (vitamin E).*Organic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title is misleading in my humble opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, this is not a bad product. It is better than some of the other aloe vera products that are loaded with artificial colors, preservitives and scents. As others have mentioned, the consistency is very watery, even when you put it in the fridge (which you should do) so I decided to just put it in a spray bottle to use as a skin toner/refresher instead. I also put a few drops of lavender essential oil into the bottle so not only does it feel refreshing but the scent is now very calming. You could add other scents like peppermint and lemongrass also and that would be great for the summer for invigorating fragrance. I paid $9.25 for this about a week ago and it is now $7.50 here on Amazon. For the price, I would probably not buy it again since I can get a giant fresh aloe stalk at my local farmers market for about $1.75, but while I have it, I think it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years as my go to medical item for burns, sunburns and skin irritations.  I always keep a bottle in my refrigerator. This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product! All organic, no nasties.</li>
            <li> Worth buying it... Too good</li>
            <li> Extremely watery and hard to apply to your skin.  I&#x27;m not sure if it works but it is very soothing and cold.  I would rather pick up a gel in the future</li>
            <li> This lotion could be a bit more moisturizing, but it has been great for my acne scars, keloid scars, and reducing redness.</li>
            <li> I love this product but it is not 100% pure aleo vera like it says. There are other ingredients but this is the closes I found to pure aleo vera.</li>
            <li> Using them with radiotherapy (together with La Roche Posay B5), easy to apply and works extremely well.</li>
            <li> This is the good stuff. Use it on cuts and burns and watch it heal. Hard to find the pure aloe like this so get two or three. I put one in my bug out bag. Never know when you will need this but it is a must have for any household.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Chem/Preservative free. Pure aloe has done amazing things for my health. I use Aubrey Organics for external use and I also drink Premeier Research Labs AloePro, which is also a pure form of aloe. I&#x27;ve found that using these two together keeps my skin and organs healthy and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I use it for my son&#x27;s eczema it calm down the itching</li>
            <li> So far it is what it says it is. I will continue to buy it once I finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> Aloe juice not gel. Wish I paid attention. Oh well serves its purpose and works well.</li>
            <li> Helps a lot with sunburn.</li>
            <li> The product provided a cooling and healing effect for my skin.  Got it fast too!</li>
            <li> Received on time and at a great price.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for my purposes, which are to make a non-toxic hand wash. Vegan, cruelty-free, marked 98% organic, it is expensive, but seems worth it if you can dig up the money for it.  The only drawbacks are needing to refrigerate it, though my hand wash is holding up nicely in the bathroom, but that adds to the belief that it&#x27;s organic. Organic products don&#x27;t last forever like chemical ones. The plastic in which it is housed is not marked for recycling, so that&#x27;s sad too.</li>
            <li> After laser hair removal treatment on Brazilian and full legs, my skin is so tender and inflamed. I apply this aloe-vera liquid to my skin and it keeps my skin moist comforts my it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t claim it dose wonders but seems to be soothing.</li>
            <li> I love the Aloe Vera and it works.  I don&#x27;t like you have to refrigerate it because I forget to use it unless it is right in front of me.</li>
            <li> Keep it in the fridge to keep it nice and cold. Works great for dry itchy skin and scalp or whatever you want to use it for. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for for a loooong time. Aloe Vera without all the chemicals. If you read the ingredient lists on your regular aloe vera lotion / gel that you can buy in any grocery store, there are always chemicals added to make the aloe vera juice into a gel. Aubrey Organics&#x27; Aloe Vera does not contain these additives. What you get is pure aloe vera with just a bit of natural grapeseed extract in it (which is also good for your skin!). That&#x27;s why the consistency is a bit different, too. It&#x27;s more like juice, kind of runny, but that&#x27;s how aloe vera is in nature. It goes on your skin nicely and sinks in completely without the residue that you get from commercial gels. Wonderful product! Keep it in your fridge to prolong its shelf life and to add to its skin cooling and restoring properties! I&#x27;m hooked and won&#x27;t buy any other aloe vera product anymore.</li>
            <li> This product is not 100% aloe vera as it states. It has other ingredients, one of which is grapefruit extract.  So if you are looking for pure aloe vera, this is not it.</li>
            <li> Sunburn was a lot more manageable after this!</li>
            <li> As close as you can get to all natural but still has crap,in it! Buy an aloe plant. Cut off spear as needed.  Much cheaper, more effective!</li>
            <li> and so I burn myself allot. I put this stuff in the fridge and it feels great and promotes quick healing. Came on time and is very cheap.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for for an addition to home-made moisturizers.  This is not a gel.</li>
            <li> Not 100% pure aloe.  Consistency of water not gel.  Smells awful.  Honestly not even sure if it works because I can&#x27;t get past the horrible smell.  Not sure how to describe it, something between body odor and rotten food.  Will not order again.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my face and my boyfriend uses this as an after shave. Smells nice and fresh and leaves our skin smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I highly reccomend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S: it is reccomended for this to be kept in the fridge.</li>
            <li> Its pretty good stuff.  we keep it in the fridge so its cold and ready to go when we need it.</li>
            <li> I got this product to see if it would help my sons eczema. Which it did not do, however, I think that claim is hit or miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it on a pretty bad burn from a curling iron and it cleared up really well, without scaring.</li>
            <li> I use this as a face moisturizer after I wash my face. It doesn&#x27;t help with my oily skin, but it WORKS GREAT with breakouts. Also says to keep refrigerated, and I like the cool sensation. You don&#x27;t need to use this in ample amounts, so even though its a small bottle, it lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this to make an amazing facial moisturizer. Combine 1/4 C aloe with 1 TBSP vegetable glycerine (Frontier makes a good one) in a small glass bottle or jar. Shake to combine, then pat onto damp, clean skin. Can be worn under makeup and leaves skin incredibly soft and smooth. (Recipe from Better Basics for the Home by Annie Bond.)</li>
            <li> Soothing and clear...&lt;br /&gt;Consistency is very watery, not gel like, but yeah, its still moisturizing ... I can&#x27;t use regular moisturizer because they cause me to break out, so, I have used aloe Vera as my after-wash moisturizer since ever, and this is one of the good ones I have come across.</li>
            <li> Have dreads and this works great to tightening my locks.</li>
            <li> watery, haven&#x27;t really used it long enough to know if it works. I can say with this and the queen helene mint julep mask my face looks better. I have cystic acne.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and grows maybe a cm a month. I read that Aloe Vera was a good natural way to grow thicker hair faster. I love this stuff! I add a very small amount into my conditioner and let it sit in my hair while I wash and shave. My hair grew 1.5 inches in a month! It is slightly thicker, but I think it may take a bit longer to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know most people use this for sunburn, burns, bug bites. All I&#x27;ve used it for beside my hair is bee stings. My son got stung at a football game and the aloe vera helped with the swelling. I am pretty allergic to bee stings, but when I got stung I decided to put some on the sting before I headed to the hospital (I don&#x27;t use epipens). I&#x27;m not sure if the aloe vera stopped me from reacting or if I just didn&#x27;t react this time, but I got to the doctor with no reaction. It was nice not to swell up like a balloon that time :)</li>
            <li> I would say you have to refrigerate. I didn&#x27;t and tried to use it after opening and it had a terrible smell. I had to throw it away!</li>
            <li> This Aloe product is very thin, almost to the point of being like water.  This makes the product difficult to apply to the face, since you must first get it to stay on your fingers.  So thin, in fact, that when you open the flip-top, liquid splatters out from the direction of the opening-- and gets on mirror, furniture, or anything within two feet in that direction.</li>
            <li> This is advertised as a gel, but it is not. It is a liquid and not a gel. Would not buy again since it is completely overpriced for a liquid.</li>
            <li> This product will give you temporary relief. If you have foot problems see a podiatrist and get a good ointment.</li>
            <li> I use this as the moisture for my micro-mini current eye zone lifting massager. It is a fantastic conductor. Very soothing under the eyes. Recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a miracle product! I travel a lot and have to deal with acclimating to sudden changes in the environment which is very harsh on my sensitive acne prone skin. This product has been the only thing to keep my face moisturized all day without any kind of oily residue.  It has also kept my breakouts at bay while conditioning my healing skin. I have bought it for all of my sisters with acne prone or sensitive skin, and have continued to buy it for everyone who has come to me with skin problems. Just a little on a cotton ball swabbed all-over the face and I am set! I love this product, and if it ever runs out, I don&#x27;t know what I will do. This is one of the only products I have taken the time to give a full review to because I really believe in it.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Have been using this stuff on my face for almost a year and have seen great improvements in my skin. The package usually arrives right on time or even early sometimes.</li>
            <li> Aloe is created by God and that makes it better and safer to use than any antibacterial that kills off your beneficial bacteria. I didn&#x27;t give this a five star, because it doesn&#x27;t state how the aloe was processed.</li>
            <li> I work in a hospital setting and use a lot oh harsh hand sanitizes. The lotion they provide to combat the dry skin is just as bad and leaves your hands very greasy. I wanted to try this product and have only used it for a week and can already see a difference in rehydration. I will definitely get more. My only complaint it that it leaves your hands somewhat sticky for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> A nice pure product, however the consistency is too thin for my use. I prefer a thicker gel to use as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I got a terrible sunburn this summer and bought this to help with the healing. I have a small aloe plant that I had used for small cuts and burns, but it was too small for such a large burn, so this was needed. Also, I keep it in the refrigerator and applying it to burnt skin when it&#x27;s chilled adds an extra level of relief.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy using this product and it feels good on my skin, makes it a little tight after application but I was hoping for some change in my skin moisture or appearance and haven&#x27;t seen that.</li>
            <li> I am using this pure aloe vera as a facial moisturizer for my acne prone skin. I use a mild organic unscented liquid Dr Bronner&#x27;s Castile soap for a face wash, and diluted Apple Cider Vinegar for toner. The aloe vera is wonderful. It leaves my skin soft, clean, and supple. No tightness, no overly moist feeling, no film or residue feeling. No shinny skin. Does not feel heavy. It is light, absorbs quickly, is clear, and has practically no scent, just a very faint botanical aloe smell. It is not a slimy gel, it is much more liquidy than a gel.  Loving it. Will buy more. Love that it is organic and simple, does not have an ingredient list full of chemical preservatives. Excellent skincare.</li>
            <li> I love this product and my hair does too. I have naturally curly hair and it use this product to seal my deva curl products and allow my hair to air dry. Does wonder a for curls and keeps my hair looking healthy and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I used this product to help calm my skin after waxing and I noticed a significant difference. My skin was smooth and the bumpy of my skin seemed to be greatly reduced. I haven&#x27;t really tried it on my face but I&#x27;m eager to see what it will do.</li>
            <li> I picked this up at Whole Foods to treat an oil burn I got cooking in the kitchen and it worked to ease the sting and pain in minutes. I knew something had to be good about it because I took the last tube in the store! Definitely try it out on burns; you won&#x27;t be disappointed. A tip: keep reapplying to get the best results. I applied several times the first day, and definitely keep it in the fridge.</li>
            <li> To little product for that much $$$&amp; I love the gel and the juice any aloe that feels gooD bit I think I will be tapping my growing live aloe in the back yard</li>
            <li> I was looking for some aloe vera to apply on my eyelash.  As this one was too watery, I tried using it as my regular toner and it works amazing!  My troubled spot goes down for a little bit right after I apply it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 04/16/13:&lt;br /&gt;I tried all kinds of organic, high end, alcohol-free toners for sensitive skin and they still bothered my face.  I only tried samples of toners if the product receives excellent reviews and I regretted multiple times as my skin instantly reacted to chemicals, however mild they might be, within one day of switch.  I am now using this aloe vera only.  Highly highly recommended for sensitive skin!!! I am hoping this product never gets discontinued because I wouldn&#x27;t know what to do about my daily facial care without this.</li>
            <li> The product description on Amazon says: &amp;#34;Pure Aloe Vera Gel by Aubrey Organics 4 oz Gel Pure Aloe Vera&amp;#34; - but it is NOT a gel at all. It is a PURE Liquid... as watery as it could be, and a bit sticky...</li>
            <li> There was no aloe vera in this bottle.  I received a bottle of water.</li>
            <li> Use it on my face. I love it.</li>
            <li> Cold windy days and years of coloring have taken its toll on my hair &amp; scalp :(  My hair is dry/frizzie and my scalp seems to get irritated as the weather gets colder. I wear hats most of the time to avoid the cold wind, but I still need that extra moisture in my hair and scalp. I&#x27;ve used many different oils but these are too greasy for using them before work and just couldn&#x27;t find anything that really moisturized my scalp without making it look greasy until I found this product. I like the fact that it has a liquid not gel-like texture which is perfect for using before work and excellent for overnight treatment without the use of any wraps or hats. I have it in the fridge as many suggested and it does cool your irritated scalp faster. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and will definitely recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I use this as a daily moisturizer, and I love it.  I had a blemish on my nose and nothing worked.  I had messed with it so much that it had scabbed over. Nothing worked to clear it up. I finally tried aloe and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> I am using theis product to cool the effects of radiation treatment for skin cancer on my lip and chin.  It is very good and eases the discomfort!</li>
            <li> I use this for rashes &amp; it softens skin also. smells nice. you must keep it in the fridge. Did find it at whole foods market. (no S &amp; H)</li>
            <li> It works good for my hair an i luv it.. Im glad i got it because my hair feels more alive..</li>
            <li> OMG!!! I can&#x27;t believe my skin already looks way better and no longer breaks out only after 1 week! It smells the same as the SUPER expensive aloe vera I got in salon. AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been diagnosed with a bladder infection, and I&#x27;ve received med&#x27;s from my doctor. And since then, I now have a rash. I was told that this would help relieve the itching as well as healing the rash. Now day 5 the spots are very drying and every so often I find myself scratching. I put this on 3 to 4 times a day.  Any suggestions?&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using this  for a couple of days. If I don&#x27;t see any changes on my skin, I too will purchase the actual plant and try that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in Afghanistan right now, and the air is not only really dry but really cold at the moment too. I was having problems with my cheeks getting windburned on an almost daily basis, so I bought this. I apply it to my face every morning, and my skin is very soft and well moisturized, and now windburn is no longer a concern :) Love it.</li>
            <li> This aloe vera product is more of a liquid than a gel. I use it on my face before applying moisturizer and it absorbs fast. I like how light it feels on my face, but it does not have the most pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I think its value must be assessed differently against its various uses. It is hard to find pure organic aloe gel, which is why I bought this bottle in the first place. I know I can trust Aubrey Organics. If you&#x27;re using this aloe internally to help with absorption of supplements, then I&#x27;m sure it is great. If you are using it alone on your skin or hair, then again, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great. However, if you&#x27;re trying to use it as an ingredient of other body care products, then the consistency is faaaaaaar too runny. There ARE other organic aloes out there (on Amazon even!) for much better prices.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle for me - but definitely a necessity in my acne regimen! If you have scars or dark spots when your acne heals, this speeds up the healing. Even when my skin was clearing, without make-up, it didn&#x27;t look like it due to the spots being left behind. It wasn&#x27;t until I started using this every night with a cotton ball after washing that I noticed a difference. It does take time though - you won&#x27;t have dark spots one night and magically wake up the next day with them all gone. Acne scars can take weeks to months to heal normally but this definitely cuts the time down. Definitely stocking up on this stuff!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. It&#x27;s the only one I could find without preservatives or other additives. It&#x27;s like a clear, watery texture but that&#x27;s what I expected since it doesn&#x27;t have any fillers or anything else to make it gel. I also like that there is no alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> A good review is still pending upon more use.</li>
            <li> I was looking for pure aloe as opposed to that other stuff and I found this by Aubrey Organics.  I bought some with me on my vacation to Mexico and used it on days when I got a little too much sun.  A little goes a long way which is great plus it is unscented and not sticky.</li>
            <li> As stated it&#x27;s pure...as far as I can tell.  So it&#x27;s watery and has to be refrigerated after opening. I use it after shaving so the cold Aloe feels good.</li>
            <li> Did not expect it to be liquid and thought it was more of a gel..... my own fault I guess..</li>
            <li> Leaves hair shiny and moisturized</li>
            <li> The closest product to the actual aloe plant.  I have been using this product since it arrived and I have seen many results. I have used it morning and night. The product is recommended to be refridgerated after first use and seems to truly keep alot of it&#x27;s intended effectiveness. I had a few blotches and this cleared it up in no time. I know it does work miracles for me and face. I will keep purchasing this product as the plant itself is hard to carry around when travelling. Thanks so much for being an honest solution to sunburn, chemical burn, blotches, etc... Excellent product that is as close to the plant as you can get. Keep selling and keep your high standards of success toward getting the real aloe ingredients.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face as a light moisturizer and it immediately gives your skin a fresh glowing look. I&#x27;m a drk complexion AA female and I also see that this helps with dark spots. It takes some time, but it does work!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin refreshed. I use it at night after shower. I use it to get rid of acne. I haven&#x27;t seen any concrete result yet but I love it!</li>
            <li> Nothing better than Pure Aloe Vera, to soothe sensitive or irritated skin.  Aloe Vera is great for sunburn relief.  I used it to soothe my Shingles virus rash, after blisters were dried up.  Organic products, such as this one, rank high, in my opinion.  Price was reasonable.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Feel like water and was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I brought this on a suggestion from my sister for a rash that was being difficult to heal.  I like it, it dries good and does not feel strange on my skin, I cannot say it is good for the healing because I have use other items also with it, but there is some relief.  When it is finish I will order more.</li>
            <li> I Use this product to detangle my hair before i put it in the bantu knots, and it works really well i can just tell that it is moisturizing my hair and it is not to wet or heavy on my hair. i use it for random things too,  it is very versatile.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  It is definitely a bit more liquid-y than your average aloe vera gel, but that&#x27;s a good thing!  You don&#x27;t want all the extra chemicals that go into those gels.  This is way better for your health and for your skin.</li>
            <li> Too liquid...... wasn&#x27;t as expected.  But I put it in a fine mist spray bottle and used it that way.  A lot runs off even with misting though.  So I would not spend the money on this again, too much wasted.  Need a thicker Aloe product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a while ago to use it to seal my 3b/c curly hair.  It worked alright, but I honestly didn&#x27;t notice a big enough change in my hair to continue to use it.  Then I decided to add it to my homemade flaxseed gel and it is AMAZING.  My hair has never been so shiny and moisturized.  And my curls are SO defined.  I just make a batch of flaxseed gel with 2 cups of water then add  1/4 cup brown flaxseeds.  After it&#x27;s finished I add about 1/4 cup aloe vera juice and keep it in the fridge.  It lasts about 2 weeks, and my hair loves it!  Combined with leave-in conditioner, this gel keeps my curls looking good for 3 to 4 days before I need to wash it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great for burns I realized after I stupidly put my hand on a pot that had just been in the oven.  I burned my entire palm.  I just soaked a paper towel in the aloe vera that I keep in the fridge so it was nice and cold, and kept it on my hand for 15 minutes.  When I took it off, there was still redness, but the pain had completely gone and the swelling had gone down quite a bit as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically this is an amazing product!!</li>
            <li> I have been reading much about aloe and how great it is for skin: burns, scrapes, discoloration, scars, etc. In addition to all the wonderful things people have said in their feedback, I want to add that I now use this as a gel for my hair. I have VERY fine hair, and most products weigh it down. This adds just a touch of body without being greasy, sticky, stiff, or drying.</li>
            <li> it is not a gel. It is more like a liquid. Has no gel consistency :(</li>
            <li> Great product, am never without.</li>
            <li> I think I received a bottle of water.  If I could give it 0 stars I would.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great to use on my natural coily hair to give it moisture.  It is also great for lots of other things as well.  I love this brand.</li>
            <li> This works good on my hands &amp; face for minor blems &amp; growths.  Sooths itches.  Works best when used 2-3 times per day.  Rated a 4 since I would like it to be thicker consistency.  I wanted something totally aloe instead of the products they sell for sunburn which have alcohols &amp; etc plus aloe.  Almost out, wife says buy some more...</li>
            <li> About to order my second bottle. Have been using this 2x daily along with red clay powder masks weekly for a month now and have noticed a major improvement in my skin tone and scarring. My skin tends to be on the dry side and I do notice that this can leave my skin a little tight. When it does I blot my face with a cotton ball soaked with rose and glycerin water and that works perfect for me. Highly recommend this product for any skin condition. It&#x27;s well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to go all natural (hair, skin, body, etc.) and this was the only moisturizer I could find with little or no chemicals. I love it! It make my hands really sooth instantly! As for the face, it isn&#x27;t as moisturizing. But I guess that&#x27;s because I live in a very cold and highly windy area. But applying this with a thicker moisturizer helps relieve the wind burn. I am currently considering putting this in a spray bottle, and seeing if it has the same moisturizing effects on my hair.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got a rash from using axe body spray. It was all over his arms n chest. He tried corizone and benedryl but those did nothing. I found this for him online. He would rub a small amount of it on the rash twice a day and eventually it went away. It didn&#x27;t heal fast and he still has dark marks where the rashes were but this was the only product that helped.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people think it&#x27;s not real because its watery or you have to refrigerate it. If you&#x27;ve ever had a aloe vera plant you will find that you to refrigerate it after you peel and scoop the plant and it turns watery. Also this smells like a real aloe vera plant! And when I use this or a aloe vera plant my face is dry either way. Do the research..its real.</li>
            <li> This is a Organic liquid Aloe that I have used on my skin with great effect.  Soothes, cools and calms skin irritation without any harmful chemicals or preservatives.  I would use these on a burn or cracked skin due to its 100% natural characteristic.</li>
            <li> When I thread my upper lip I use this to help with the redness and it works well.</li>
            <li> I bought this item from this seller a month back. I have been using it since then and trust me, I love it. I have seen drastic improvement in my skin. I suffer from mild acne, but the scars were bad. I have been using this product generously along with Vitamin E by Fruit of Earth and the results are amazing! I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews, but this one was worth it. I hope this helps anybody trying to get rid of acne and/or scars. This really worked for me. The reason I give this 4 stars because I&#x27;m not really sure whether it is the Aloe Vera or Vitamin E doing wonders on my skin. :) I bought both of those together and have been using it since then.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks. :)</li>
            <li> awesome product for the price, good quality!!!! it works wonders!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thinner then I expected but i have no complaints. We haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it will help my sons skin clear up, delivery was great.</li>
            <li> Product ok but the real aloe vera leaves that you buy in supermarket is way better ,,,&lt;br /&gt;Its of course not 100% pure so the effect is not so amazing but its ok</li>
            <li> it really soothes my dry skin. will definitely order more</li>
            <li> All natural and heals everything on your skin!</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with some scaring/red marks.  I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in red marks in a quicker period of time, while using the Aloe Vera.  Plus, it&#x27;s 100% pure!</li>
