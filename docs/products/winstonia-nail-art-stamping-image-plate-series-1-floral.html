            <li>I love this plate</li>
            <li>The designs on this plates are great for stamping on you big toe</li>
            <li>I have used this one several times, and am happy with the images.  </li>
            <li>Love this n fun to create love all the different looks and very easy to do will be buying more</li>
            <li>example, the top right image of the two flowers at the corners, will not stamp the centers of the flowers on the nail bed.</li>
            <li>I love nail stamping and these images were so pretty online.</li>
            <li>This particular plate is great if you want to try the new &amp;#34;lead light&amp;#34; technique.  </li>
            <li>the image on the bottom right corner - the large shaded rose image - has a defect.</li>
            <li>The 2 large, open floral designs on this plate are great for that.</li>
            <li>I just got this last week and this image plate looks so great to create a fun and pretty mani on your nails.  </li>
            <li>n tried quickly moving to place n scrape then pop onto nails</li>
            <li>The designs look very pretty.</li>
            <li>This was my first Winstonia plate purchase, and I would most definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li>First time review ever!</li>
            <li>stamps great images are big but come out very clear</li>
            <li>I have several Winstonia plates, and I love how cleanly they stamp.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting compliments at work on my first run on trying these (see pics).  </li>
            <li>However, the width of the images would make even stamping on longer nails a bit of a challenge as you don&#x27;t get the entire idea with most of the image cut off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really like this plate!</li>
            <li>Images were good size, not too small, not too large.  </li>
            <li>but the marshmallow(the really squishy one) stamper plus konad stamper preped them like they say n guess what never worked i have a bucket of polishes diffrent brands</li>
            <li>I did end up contacting the seller, and they did send me a replacement plate, even though I was outside of the 30 day window by a week or so, so the seller is fantastic...</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast..</li>
            <li>They pick up and print very well.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s an area in the middle of that image, just below the rose that is in the middle...</li>
            <li>or if your nails have a big surface, they print clear and the details are lovely.</li>
            <li>Special stamping polishes don&#x27;t really work either, i find the cheaper polishes(very thick consistency) work better.</li>
            <li>The plate is of good quality but the images are way too big for my average width nails.</li>
            <li>but if you are buying the plate specifically for that particular image, I would pass.</li>
            <li>HIghly recommend.</li>
            <li>i wasted more polish remover removing polish on these plates thAn what i got to not even see on my nails.....</li>
            <li>large enough for clients with large nail beds.</li>
            <li>I could position the lower OR top flower to include the center of the flower, but them , parts of then only part of the petals would make it in the transfer for both flowers.</li>
            <li>The replacement plate that I received had the exact same issue.</li>
            <li>Such pretty images though.</li>
            <li>I have the first and second generation of the Winstonia stamping plates.</li>
            <li>has clear design just need to learn how not to smudge when stamping, but over all stamps are all clear and arrived early..</li>

            <li> Dont buy!!!!!!!!  I bought four plates but the marshmallow(the really squishy one) stamper plus konad stamper preped them like they say n guess what never worked i have a bucket of polishes diffrent brands an array of many colors i tried n tried quickly moving to place n scrape then pop onto nails never grabbed one single art for my nails tried it for a week countless hours per dayn still nothing this disgusts me i wasted more polish remover removing polish on these plates thAn what i got to not even see on my nails.....i will stick to airbrushing instead how awful.............</li>
            <li> The plate has design flaw...the image on the bottom right corner - the large shaded rose image - has a defect. I have included photos with my review. I did end up contacting the seller, and they did send me a replacement plate, even though I was outside of the 30 day window by a week or so, so the seller is fantastic...but if you are buying the plate specifically for that particular image, I would pass. The replacement plate that I received had the exact same issue. There&#x27;s an area in the middle of that image, just below the rose that is in the middle...not sure what it is, but it ruins the whole image when stamping.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that image, the rest of the plate stamps beautifully. This was my first Winstonia plate purchase, and I would most definitely buy more. They are perfectly etched (except for that bottom right image, lol) and they stamp and transfer beautifully.</li>
            <li> Images were good size, not too small, not too large.  I&#x27;m getting compliments at work on my first run on trying these (see pics).  Stamps were perfectly embossed just right to pickup the polish well, and easy clean.  I love this one!  What else can I say, pics speak for themselves.</li>
            <li> I love nail stamping and these images were so pretty online. The plate is of good quality but the images are way too big for my average width nails. I keep my nails short, just past the nail tip.

            <li> i gave this one 4 starts because the designs were my favorite on this one, but to start this off when i received it, this is the one out of 3 that i bought and it was scratched down the middle :( it still works but i have to be erasing the line from the stamper when it comes out. I love the winstonia designs but they&#x27;re hard to stamp if you don&#x27;t have right polishes. Special stamping polishes don&#x27;t really work either, i find the cheaper polishes(very thick consistency) work better.</li>
