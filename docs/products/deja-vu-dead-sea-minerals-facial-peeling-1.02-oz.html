            <li>Great products.</li>

            <li>but i am not at all happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>and I would have been more than happy to tell them that YES!!</li>
            <li>n can give me a good deal on buying two n</li>
            <li>Loved the product....loved the price....</li>
            <li>Good product, sketchy sells people.</li>
            <li>It was great to find it at a more affordable price.</li>
            <li>I used the salt scrub first and it was awesome</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>love the sales guy that worked with me product work!</li>

            <li>it is amazing.</li>
            <li>The product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>the magnet that is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I had tried everything from clay masks, to astringents, to store-bought exfoliants, to dermatological surgical procedures to get these pores drained but none were as effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to find it on Amazon for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I liked the product</li>
            <li>Nice to see amazon has it cheaper.</li>
            <li>its perfect if u have very sentitive skin.</li>
            <li>lmao hope it works[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This product dose a excellent job of exfoliating in a gentle way.</li>
            <li>you might be ripped off too buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>Plus I&#x27;m so happy Amazon is selling it because it is a lot more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>- there are better, more reputable products out there.  </li>
            <li>This is the best facial exfoliator I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Initially I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>Tried many products but nothing renewed and clarified my face like this product.</li>
            <li>I am assuming this is what causes it to become more of a gel like substance.</li>
            <li>it concerns me as whether or not this is an authentic product.  </li>
            <li>If you notice how they say they&#x27;re gonna drop the price this time because they like you or because you&#x27;re handsome then they are basically inviting you to haggle.  </li>
            <li>This is also a lot better than a chemical peel.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you want to do, nor is something its meant to do.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say I love all of them.</li>
            <li>and I love it,</li>
            <li>Lovely product, but sketchy sales people.</li>
            <li>Need to purchase more.</li>
            <li>These products make my skin look luminous and healthy.</li>
            <li>I had buyers remorse after spending $250, but now I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>They do need a better translator for the writing on the boxes though, lots of typos and grammer boo boos. :)</li>
            <li>I  was impressed how my skin got the glooming after applying this  facial peeling.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>After all that, the product worked ok.</li>
            <li>It came without me being able to use it.  </li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I  have used their products since 2004 and I absolutely love them and your skin is always</li>
            <li>It does smell lovely but the pump does not work.</li>
            <li>Which is obviously more time consuming than I prefer.</li>
            <li>someone tried to sale me this product in the mall for 4x more money.  </li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t how many of you have tried this</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure there are cheaper ways of making your skin feel softer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m reporting the company to the better business bureau as should you if you have purchased this product and discover what I have.th it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure there are cheaper ways of making your skin feel softer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m reporting the company to the better business bureau as should you if you have purchased this product and discover what I have.ice a week for two weeks but then go to once a week after that.</li>
            <li>And the results are outstanding.</li>
            <li>I am very excited to use it weekly.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product at the mall yesterday, after a very friendly saleswoman chatted me up.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a brave new world.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling clean, smooth and looking stunning!</li>
            <li>The product is the best money ever spent.</li>
            <li>I use other Deja Vu products and have been impressed with them also.</li>
            <li>I have never been taken so easily</li>
            <li>My skin looking great and feel super soft and much more healther.  </li>
            <li>I personally liked the product but the amount of it left in the bottle when it reached was surprising.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, my first try with it was amazing.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is it works and is better than paying full price for it in the mall.</li>
            <li>I use this product once a week and my skin feel clean smooth and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I have huge pores.</li>
            <li>A bottle that flimsy or cheap</li>
            <li>24 on amazon 60 in the mall plus free soap ...</li>
            <li>The salesmen told me it was an 80 dollar product, ended up selling to me for 40 dollars, I come online to do more research to see if what I bought was worth it and its on Amazon for 20 dollars.</li>
            <li>â€¦Not impressed with this junk which I doubt is from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li>guess they just WON&#x27;T be happy until the next atopic person comes along and buys their sales pitch.</li>
            <li>and i liked it really and wanted to give it a try</li>
            <li>It had like 10% filled</li>
            <li>Followed up with my own skin moisturizer and my skin felt new!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get too excited bc</li>
            <li>After the first use, I could not pump any more of the product out.  </li>
            <li>My pores were so clean</li>
            <li>I will buy from amazon next time, but so far, I&#x27;m impressed</li>
            <li>Used it a few years ago &amp; so happy to find it on Amazon a lot more affordable than what I paid for it at the mall.</li>
            <li>Think Whole Foods cosmetics section - much better stuff.</li>
            <li>The only good thing was I received it on time</li>
            <li>This product is a superior facial peel and exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I, too, was hit by a very pushy but incredibly charismatic salesman at a mall kiosk.</li>
            <li>Head of Dermatology at Straub Hospital has insisted on a full Patch Test for me in August.</li>
            <li>I think the product is ok, but either this is a different product, or they changed the formula, because I used this stuff about 5 years ago, and it came in a jar that you use a spatula to scoop out, and the product seemed far superior.</li>
            <li>Really helped with clearing up my skin, and so easy to use...</li>
            <li>Also, funny how the prices become whatever you happen to have in your wallet!  </li>
            <li>I also have fine facial hair, but I did not have an issue with it getting caught in it or not being able to rinse it</li>
            <li>works awesome on my acne to remove dead skin before exfoliating and is a heck of a lot cheaper then the dejavu site!!!</li>
            <li>I do not like the overly pushy Deja Vu sales people at the malls, but this is one product of theirs that works great (and the dead sea scrub</li>
            <li>so I knew it wasn&#x27;t flimsy, and got to spend a few minutes flirting with an attractive Israeli</li>
            <li>Worth a try to see for yourself.</li>
            <li>Im not crazy about this product.</li>
            <li>Soft, smooth, flake free and radiant.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product and I like it but check Amazon prices and DO NOT buy at your local mall.</li>
            <li>Giving credit where it&#x27;s due, the salesperson (a young Israeli &amp;#34;hipster&amp;#34;!) was really really good!  </li>
            <li>Foreign companies and businesses are moving into the US and a good number of mall kiosks like this belong to those businesses.  </li>
            <li>yes you heard me right people.  </li>
            <li>and I was right.</li>
            <li>All you want to do is rip your skin right off your bones.</li>
            <li>My pores are very large on chin and nose/cheeks ever since adolescence which always bothered me.</li>
            <li>Like many of the others, I was in the mall and was pulled over by a young, cute Israeli, selling this product.&lt;br /&gt;the exfoliate and some facial peel.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy these products ever again, purely on principle, now that I see how cheap they really are.  </li>
            <li>The more you pump out and rub the more it resembles \\&quot;dead skin.\\</li>
            <li>the price that this seller is asking is VERY reasonable.</li>
            <li>I was originally bombarded into buying many of the products and spent over $100.</li>
            <li>I tried this on one side of my face first to see if I could tell a difference.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the facial peel.</li>
            <li>and it really softens my skin and gives it a fresh, youthful glow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just be aware--</li>
            <li>I use this 2 times a week and my skin is so clear, smooth and even toned.</li>
            <li>This product definitely works and makes a difference; however, I find myself using more of it than I&#x27;d like too.</li>
            <li>I first saw this product at a mall kiosk, where they wanted to charge 3X the cost here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I also won&#x27;t buy anymore because I can get it here so much cheaper!</li>
            <li>so much cheaper on amazon!</li>
            <li>so if I had read some of the reviews first (I didn&#x27;t because my sister said \\&quot;here, try this!\\&quot; and I did)</li>
            <li>I love this, it definitely leaves my face</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the results of the facial peeling product.</li>
            <li>My conclusion is that the item was either in hot temperatures and</li>
            <li>Both of which I can safely say are garbageâ€™ as the French would say.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Dead sea is a good product.</li>
            <li>He was extremely insistent and enthusiastic.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face so soft and smooth, it&#x27;s really incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face, eyes, neck, ears, chest and upper right arm were so swollen with urticaria and severe contact dermatitis that my primary care physician had to put me on a respirator and send me to Straub Hospital via ambulance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These products may be fine and all, but I did spend about $80 on the facial peel (they threw  in a salt scrub--thanks) and</li>
            <li>Every time I used it, more dead skin came off, and my face felt very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I certainly CAN post the digital pictures of my face which were taken by my Primary Care Physician on YELP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing how much dead skin and grime this takes away.</li>
            <li>getting third very discounted or free</li>
            <li>Go with something much cheaper.</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t say that it will work for everyone, it drastically and gently improved my skin texture, complexion and unclogged my pores.</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t much to the product</li>
            <li>Even when you put it on your face you canâ€™t see or really feel the product or anything it is doing.</li>
            <li>I have really oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>But now I found it so much cheaper on amazon....</li>
            <li>Gently exfoliates.</li>
            <li>The price here is reasonable.</li>
            <li>really like their products.</li>
            <li>but for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>and I could kick myself for the whole thing.</li>
            <li>and it works really well for me</li>
            <li>Wish I had seen these reviews before I bought this from a very pushy guy at the mall kiosk.</li>
            <li>Shockingly (haha)</li>
            <li>I was all ready to give him a piece of my mind, but the kiosk was unmanned</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle</li>
            <li>I have never used the products I regrettably bought by a VERY pushy salesman at the mall.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to go through the whole sales push.</li>
            <li>I was also roped into buying this product at the mall, like many of the other people who have written reviews.</li>
            <li>It also really helps in avoiding ingrown hairs (probably not a concern for the majority of females who I would assume mainly purchase this product).</li>
            <li>It gums up on your face so quickly that you can&#x27;t even rinse it off fast enough!!!</li>
            <li>It did not smooth onto the face like most dead sea faciall peels and did not seem as effective.</li>
            <li>I also have extremely sensitive skin, so certain products tend to really inflame my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read a lot of negative comments about deja vu, but I have to say that after using the facial peel,cleanser, night cream, eye cream and serum for a week, my skin looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li>older skin</li>
            <li>And particularly around my nose I was getting skin buildup, then scaling.  </li>
            <li>Unfortuatly, the next fool may NOT be able to seek IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION.</li>
            <li>Once I looked for a price online, I was like wow this is too much money for a face peeler.</li>
            <li>First things first, I&#x27;m a 24 year old male who got roped into buying this from one of those overly persuasive girls at the mall kiosk.</li>
            <li>I am just the kind of sucker they are looking for.</li>
            <li>I paid a little more than what Amazon sells for, but I got my product right away and got to see it actually work</li>
            <li>I packaged it and sent it right back.  </li>
            <li>This product is the most gentle and effective exfoliant I have ever tried, it removes the dry skin on my cheeks without causing a rash like store-bought exfoliants yet the salt granules are small enough to remove enough skin to drain comedones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not prevalent in the states so most people don&#x27;t know how to do it, but in general with these products you should be able to get them down to around the cost plus shipping and then a few dollars.  </li>
            <li>I certainly CAN file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.</li>
            <li>Granted he threw in two other product  and said they free.  </li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>They have a new product the Mudd facial&lt;</li>
            <li>And in the process you likely have fun interacting with the salesperson, get to see the product in action, and don&#x27;t have to wait for your item to ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for anyone with delicate, fair skin that&#x27;s prone to drying, especially in winter.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>and my skin is finally clear and the tone, texture, and scarring have improved dramatically!</li>
            <li>I completely could!  </li>
            <li>Complete scam!</li>
            <li>Obviously they didn&#x27;t have a deal with master card, and they were just willing to say anything to get you to buy the product.</li>
            <li>I made one simple attempt to squirt the product into my hands so that i could use it for the first time, and the lid broke.  </li>
            <li>I had gotten this facial peel from the mall first for 45 dollars:</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting married in only a few days and obviously am LIVID with this product that is neither \\&quot;kind\\&quot;, \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;suitable for all skin types\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It gently &amp; easily removes the dead skin with no irritation.</li>
            <li>Not only was the salesman at the kiosk in the mall overly pushy and convincing, but he also used the exact same jargon as a previous review \\&quot;student discount\\&quot;, except this guy said \\&quot;Are you</li>
            <li>I certainly CAN bring the pictures of my distorted elephant face and upper body to KHON News - Action Line.</li>
            <li>The product I have is a taller bottle and what comes out is some sort of clear product.</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft after.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the portion of the scar that had the solution applied to it had diminished nearly %50.</li>
            <li>Peeling is the same product that the one i purchase from the mall but much cheaper at Amazon.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive and it didn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and people remark how young I look.</li>
            <li>I also find that it doesn&#x27;t do a completely even job around my chin</li>
            <li>I still use it now just because of how soft my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;so soft and your puffy eyes are gone in minutes.  </li>
            <li>This is the same product and works very well</li>
            <li>If you have thin sensitive skin or your skin has acne which is inflamed any exfoliant, including the most gentle like this product will irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>That SLUDGE from the Dead Sea most likely contains TONS of sulfa</li>
            <li>I washed my face and once it dried the same exact flakes were still there!!!</li>
            <li>no grease no mess.</li>
            <li>My acne was mainly on my forehead, chin, jaw and upper lip.</li>
            <li>It will only \\&quot;peel\\&quot; off the same exact amount of product you use.</li>
            <li>Simply apply a small dab on each area of the face and using a circular motion with little pressure it removes the top layer of damaged, dry or dead skin cells remarkably well.</li>
            <li>I get a build up of dead dry skin and then my skin gets oily on top of that.</li>
            <li>A very expensive mistake - just a word of warning to others who might think this stuff sounds like a great deal (at the mall kiosk</li>
            <li>I expected the bottle to be made with higher quality.  </li>
            <li>I often get really dry skin on my arms and sometimes use this product to scrub my arms, which really helps as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I spent my last 35 bucks on it (the \\&quot;student discount\\&quot;) and it was worth it.</li>
            <li>The dead skin litterally just comes off and it leaves ur skin soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously, when your face looks like the Elephant Woman and it is so hot and bumpy and extremely pruritic you have to cancel all your work.</li>
            <li>bottle was more than half empty and it smelled and felt gross.</li>
            <li>I find it helps to remove the dead dry skin better than just using a cleanser or facial scrub.</li>
            <li>My other skin care products seem to work so much better since I don&#x27;t have a build up of dead skin and oil on my face anymore.</li>
            <li>I purchased anyway, as you can barely get away from these people..</li>
            <li>Moisturizer is absorbed by the dead skin cells and the moisturizer cannot do what it&#x27;s suppose to do-</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and the salesman said it would help with sensitive dry skinâ€¦.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a gimmick, but I used it on my forehead which is sometimes oily, and has little to no dead skin and next to nothing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now out so much money due to this.</li>
            <li>When I first bought this I was a little nervous.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to anyone who has a tough time draining their pores or wants to gently remove dull dead skin to bring radiant new skin to the surface.</li>
            <li>Dry your face/skin well again to promote a soft and moist surface and apply your moisturizer, preferably one with sunscreen and not too greasy.</li>
            <li>so I just left my empty bottle and took a new one that I was hoping wasn&#x27;t used as a tester.  </li>
            <li>hes a sucker for pretty eyes, curly hair, and accents!</li>
            <li>You just pump a little onto your finger and rub on the area and the skin just gently comes away.</li>
            <li>Removes all of the dead skin cells and leaves my skin soft, clear, and luminous.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great products.</li>

            <li> but i am not at all happy with the purchase.</li>

            <li> n can give me a good deal on buying two n</li>
            <li> Loved the product....loved the price....</li>
            <li> Good product, sketchy sells people.</li>
            <li> It was great to find it at a more affordable price.</li>
            <li> I used the salt scrub first and it was awesome</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>

            <li> it is amazing.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> the magnet that is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I had tried everything from clay masks, to astringents, to store-bought exfoliants, to dermatological surgical procedures to get these pores drained but none were as effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled to find it on Amazon for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I liked the product</li>
            <li> Nice to see amazon has it cheaper.</li>
            <li> its perfect if u have very sentitive skin.</li>
            <li> lmao hope it works[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This product dose a excellent job of exfoliating in a gentle way.</li>
            <li> you might be ripped off too buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> Plus I&#x27;m so happy Amazon is selling it because it is a lot more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> - there are better, more reputable products out there.  </li>
            <li> This is the best facial exfoliator I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Initially I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> Tried many products but nothing renewed and clarified my face like this product.</li>
            <li> I am assuming this is what causes it to become more of a gel like substance.</li>
            <li> it concerns me as whether or not this is an authentic product.  </li>
            <li> If you notice how they say they&#x27;re gonna drop the price this time because they like you or because you&#x27;re handsome then they are basically inviting you to haggle.  </li>
            <li> This is also a lot better than a chemical peel.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you want to do, nor is something its meant to do.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say I love all of them.</li>
            <li> and I love it,</li>
            <li> Lovely product, but sketchy sales people.</li>
            <li> Need to purchase more.</li>
            <li> These products make my skin look luminous and healthy.</li>
            <li> I had buyers remorse after spending $250, but now I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> They do need a better translator for the writing on the boxes though, lots of typos and grammer boo boos. :)</li>
            <li> I  was impressed how my skin got the glooming after applying this  facial peeling.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> After all that, the product worked ok.</li>
            <li> It came without me being able to use it.  </li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I  have used their products since 2004 and I absolutely love them and your skin is always</li>
            <li> It does smell lovely but the pump does not work.</li>
            <li> Which is obviously more time consuming than I prefer.</li>
            <li> someone tried to sale me this product in the mall for 4x more money.  </li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t how many of you have tried this</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure there are cheaper ways of making your skin feel softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reporting the company to the better business bureau as should you if you have purchased this product and discover what I have.th it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure there are cheaper ways of making your skin feel softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reporting the company to the better business bureau as should you if you have purchased this product and discover what I have.ice a week for two weeks but then go to once a week after that.</li>
            <li> And the results are outstanding.</li>
            <li> I am very excited to use it weekly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at the mall yesterday, after a very friendly saleswoman chatted me up.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a brave new world.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling clean, smooth and looking stunning!</li>
            <li> The product is the best money ever spent.</li>
            <li> I use other Deja Vu products and have been impressed with them also.</li>
            <li> I have never been taken so easily</li>
            <li> My skin looking great and feel super soft and much more healther.  </li>
            <li> I personally liked the product but the amount of it left in the bottle when it reached was surprising.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my first try with it was amazing.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is it works and is better than paying full price for it in the mall.</li>
            <li> I use this product once a week and my skin feel clean smooth and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I have huge pores.</li>
            <li> A bottle that flimsy or cheap</li>
            <li> 24 on amazon 60 in the mall plus free soap ...</li>
            <li> The salesmen told me it was an 80 dollar product, ended up selling to me for 40 dollars, I come online to do more research to see if what I bought was worth it and its on Amazon for 20 dollars.</li>
            <li> â€¦Not impressed with this junk which I doubt is from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> guess they just WON&#x27;T be happy until the next atopic person comes along and buys their sales pitch.</li>
            <li> and i liked it really and wanted to give it a try</li>
            <li> It had like 10% filled</li>
            <li> Followed up with my own skin moisturizer and my skin felt new!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get too excited bc</li>
            <li> After the first use, I could not pump any more of the product out.  </li>
            <li> My pores were so clean</li>
            <li> I will buy from amazon next time, but so far, I&#x27;m impressed</li>
            <li> Used it a few years ago &amp; so happy to find it on Amazon a lot more affordable than what I paid for it at the mall.</li>
            <li> Think Whole Foods cosmetics section - much better stuff.</li>
            <li> The only good thing was I received it on time</li>
            <li> This product is a superior facial peel and exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I, too, was hit by a very pushy but incredibly charismatic salesman at a mall kiosk.</li>
            <li> Head of Dermatology at Straub Hospital has insisted on a full Patch Test for me in August.</li>
            <li> I think the product is ok, but either this is a different product, or they changed the formula, because I used this stuff about 5 years ago, and it came in a jar that you use a spatula to scoop out, and the product seemed far superior.</li>
            <li> Really helped with clearing up my skin, and so easy to use...</li>
            <li> Also, funny how the prices become whatever you happen to have in your wallet!  </li>
            <li> I also have fine facial hair, but I did not have an issue with it getting caught in it or not being able to rinse it</li>
            <li> works awesome on my acne to remove dead skin before exfoliating and is a heck of a lot cheaper then the dejavu site!!!</li>
            <li> I do not like the overly pushy Deja Vu sales people at the malls, but this is one product of theirs that works great (and the dead sea scrub</li>
            <li> so I knew it wasn&#x27;t flimsy, and got to spend a few minutes flirting with an attractive Israeli</li>
            <li> Worth a try to see for yourself.</li>
            <li> Im not crazy about this product.</li>
            <li> Soft, smooth, flake free and radiant.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice product and I like it but check Amazon prices and DO NOT buy at your local mall.</li>
            <li> Giving credit where it&#x27;s due, the salesperson (a young Israeli &amp;#34;hipster&amp;#34;!) was really really good!  </li>
            <li> Foreign companies and businesses are moving into the US and a good number of mall kiosks like this belong to those businesses.  </li>
            <li> yes you heard me right people.  </li>
            <li> and I was right.</li>
            <li> All you want to do is rip your skin right off your bones.</li>
            <li> My pores are very large on chin and nose/cheeks ever since adolescence which always bothered me.</li>
            <li> Like many of the others, I was in the mall and was pulled over by a young, cute Israeli, selling this product.&lt;br /&gt;the exfoliate and some facial peel.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy these products ever again, purely on principle, now that I see how cheap they really are.  </li>
            <li> The more you pump out and rub the more it resembles \\&quot;dead skin.\\</li>
            <li> the price that this seller is asking is VERY reasonable.</li>
            <li> I was originally bombarded into buying many of the products and spent over $100.</li>
            <li> I tried this on one side of my face first to see if I could tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the facial peel.</li>
            <li> and it really softens my skin and gives it a fresh, youthful glow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just be aware--</li>
            <li> I use this 2 times a week and my skin is so clear, smooth and even toned.</li>
            <li> This product definitely works and makes a difference; however, I find myself using more of it than I&#x27;d like too.</li>
            <li> I first saw this product at a mall kiosk, where they wanted to charge 3X the cost here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I also won&#x27;t buy anymore because I can get it here so much cheaper!</li>
            <li> so much cheaper on amazon!</li>
            <li> so if I had read some of the reviews first (I didn&#x27;t because my sister said \\&quot;here, try this!\\&quot; and I did)</li>
            <li> I love this, it definitely leaves my face</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the results of the facial peeling product.</li>
            <li> My conclusion is that the item was either in hot temperatures and</li>
            <li> Both of which I can safely say are garbageâ€™ as the French would say.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Dead sea is a good product.</li>
            <li> He was extremely insistent and enthusiastic.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face so soft and smooth, it&#x27;s really incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face, eyes, neck, ears, chest and upper right arm were so swollen with urticaria and severe contact dermatitis that my primary care physician had to put me on a respirator and send me to Straub Hospital via ambulance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These products may be fine and all, but I did spend about $80 on the facial peel (they threw  in a salt scrub--thanks) and</li>
            <li> Every time I used it, more dead skin came off, and my face felt very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I certainly CAN post the digital pictures of my face which were taken by my Primary Care Physician on YELP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazing how much dead skin and grime this takes away.</li>
            <li> getting third very discounted or free</li>
            <li> Go with something much cheaper.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t say that it will work for everyone, it drastically and gently improved my skin texture, complexion and unclogged my pores.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t much to the product</li>
            <li> Even when you put it on your face you canâ€™t see or really feel the product or anything it is doing.</li>
            <li> I have really oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> But now I found it so much cheaper on amazon....</li>
            <li> Gently exfoliates.</li>
            <li> The price here is reasonable.</li>
            <li> really like their products.</li>
            <li> but for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> and I could kick myself for the whole thing.</li>
            <li> and it works really well for me</li>
            <li> Wish I had seen these reviews before I bought this from a very pushy guy at the mall kiosk.</li>
            <li> Shockingly (haha)</li>
            <li> I was all ready to give him a piece of my mind, but the kiosk was unmanned</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle</li>
            <li> I have never used the products I regrettably bought by a VERY pushy salesman at the mall.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to go through the whole sales push.</li>
            <li> I was also roped into buying this product at the mall, like many of the other people who have written reviews.</li>
            <li> It also really helps in avoiding ingrown hairs (probably not a concern for the majority of females who I would assume mainly purchase this product).</li>
            <li> It gums up on your face so quickly that you can&#x27;t even rinse it off fast enough!!!</li>
            <li> It did not smooth onto the face like most dead sea faciall peels and did not seem as effective.</li>
            <li> I also have extremely sensitive skin, so certain products tend to really inflame my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of negative comments about deja vu, but I have to say that after using the facial peel,cleanser, night cream, eye cream and serum for a week, my skin looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li> older skin</li>
            <li> And particularly around my nose I was getting skin buildup, then scaling.  </li>
            <li> Unfortuatly, the next fool may NOT be able to seek IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION.</li>
            <li> Once I looked for a price online, I was like wow this is too much money for a face peeler.</li>
            <li> First things first, I&#x27;m a 24 year old male who got roped into buying this from one of those overly persuasive girls at the mall kiosk.</li>
            <li> I am just the kind of sucker they are looking for.</li>
            <li> I paid a little more than what Amazon sells for, but I got my product right away and got to see it actually work</li>
            <li> I packaged it and sent it right back.  </li>
            <li> This product is the most gentle and effective exfoliant I have ever tried, it removes the dry skin on my cheeks without causing a rash like store-bought exfoliants yet the salt granules are small enough to remove enough skin to drain comedones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not prevalent in the states so most people don&#x27;t know how to do it, but in general with these products you should be able to get them down to around the cost plus shipping and then a few dollars.  </li>
            <li> I certainly CAN file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.</li>
            <li> Granted he threw in two other product  and said they free.  </li>
            <li> Live and learn.</li>
            <li> They have a new product the Mudd facial&lt;</li>
            <li> And in the process you likely have fun interacting with the salesperson, get to see the product in action, and don&#x27;t have to wait for your item to ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone with delicate, fair skin that&#x27;s prone to drying, especially in winter.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> and my skin is finally clear and the tone, texture, and scarring have improved dramatically!</li>
            <li> I completely could!  </li>
            <li> Complete scam!</li>
            <li> Obviously they didn&#x27;t have a deal with master card, and they were just willing to say anything to get you to buy the product.</li>
            <li> I made one simple attempt to squirt the product into my hands so that i could use it for the first time, and the lid broke.  </li>
            <li> I had gotten this facial peel from the mall first for 45 dollars:</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting married in only a few days and obviously am LIVID with this product that is neither \\&quot;kind\\&quot;, \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;suitable for all skin types\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It gently &amp; easily removes the dead skin with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Not only was the salesman at the kiosk in the mall overly pushy and convincing, but he also used the exact same jargon as a previous review \\&quot;student discount\\&quot;, except this guy said \\&quot;Are you</li>
            <li> I certainly CAN bring the pictures of my distorted elephant face and upper body to KHON News - Action Line.</li>
            <li> The product I have is a taller bottle and what comes out is some sort of clear product.</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft after.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the portion of the scar that had the solution applied to it had diminished nearly %50.</li>
            <li> Peeling is the same product that the one i purchase from the mall but much cheaper at Amazon.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive and it didn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and people remark how young I look.</li>
            <li> I also find that it doesn&#x27;t do a completely even job around my chin</li>
            <li> I still use it now just because of how soft my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;so soft and your puffy eyes are gone in minutes.  </li>
            <li> This is the same product and works very well</li>
            <li> If you have thin sensitive skin or your skin has acne which is inflamed any exfoliant, including the most gentle like this product will irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> That SLUDGE from the Dead Sea most likely contains TONS of sulfa</li>
            <li> I washed my face and once it dried the same exact flakes were still there!!!</li>
            <li> no grease no mess.</li>
            <li> My acne was mainly on my forehead, chin, jaw and upper lip.</li>
            <li> It will only \\&quot;peel\\&quot; off the same exact amount of product you use.</li>
            <li> Simply apply a small dab on each area of the face and using a circular motion with little pressure it removes the top layer of damaged, dry or dead skin cells remarkably well.</li>
            <li> I get a build up of dead dry skin and then my skin gets oily on top of that.</li>
            <li> A very expensive mistake - just a word of warning to others who might think this stuff sounds like a great deal (at the mall kiosk</li>
            <li> I expected the bottle to be made with higher quality.  </li>
            <li> I often get really dry skin on my arms and sometimes use this product to scrub my arms, which really helps as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spent my last 35 bucks on it (the \\&quot;student discount\\&quot;) and it was worth it.</li>
            <li> The dead skin litterally just comes off and it leaves ur skin soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously, when your face looks like the Elephant Woman and it is so hot and bumpy and extremely pruritic you have to cancel all your work.</li>
            <li> bottle was more than half empty and it smelled and felt gross.</li>
            <li> I find it helps to remove the dead dry skin better than just using a cleanser or facial scrub.</li>
            <li> My other skin care products seem to work so much better since I don&#x27;t have a build up of dead skin and oil on my face anymore.</li>
            <li> I purchased anyway, as you can barely get away from these people..</li>
            <li> Moisturizer is absorbed by the dead skin cells and the moisturizer cannot do what it&#x27;s suppose to do-</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and the salesman said it would help with sensitive dry skinâ€¦.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a gimmick, but I used it on my forehead which is sometimes oily, and has little to no dead skin and next to nothing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now out so much money due to this.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this I was a little nervous.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to anyone who has a tough time draining their pores or wants to gently remove dull dead skin to bring radiant new skin to the surface.</li>
            <li> Dry your face/skin well again to promote a soft and moist surface and apply your moisturizer, preferably one with sunscreen and not too greasy.</li>
            <li> so I just left my empty bottle and took a new one that I was hoping wasn&#x27;t used as a tester.  </li>
            <li> hes a sucker for pretty eyes, curly hair, and accents!</li>
            <li> You just pump a little onto your finger and rub on the area and the skin just gently comes away.</li>
            <li> Removes all of the dead skin cells and leaves my skin soft, clear, and luminous.  </li>
            <li> When the young man told me he would walk me to the spa on the other end of the mall</li>
            <li> I have less open pours and it leaves my skin so soft</li>
            <li> At first, I just didn&#x27;t want to be rude and brush her off.</li>
            <li> Also, this last me a really long time even though I use it often.</li>
            <li> but I got out to my car, spread a drop of the product on a flat plastic surface, rubbed</li>
            <li> Its basically like putting a layer of white glue on your finger and waiting for it to dry to peel it off.</li>
            <li> Except in this instance you do not need to wait for the product to dry, it does it instantly.</li>
            <li> I went home to try it only to discover the bottle was empty after one teenie tiny squirt.  </li>
            <li> But I have had absolutely no problem with this product over the last 6 months of regular (some weeks</li>
            <li> It has barely any scent so it does not compete with your other products.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the mall demo of the product, but was not willing to pay their outrageous price.</li>
            <li> DID NOT see any posted LICENSE OF COSMETOLOGY at their toilet stall at the mall !</li>
            <li> Not too harsh on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I usually walk away with a smile and a firm &amp;#34;no thank you&amp;#34; but for some reason I stopped and got stuck.</li>
            <li> It does not burn or irriatate my skin, nor does it make it red or feel abrasive like other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> An added bonus is that it didn&#x27;t irritate and dry my skin out at all like all the prescriptions had.</li>
            <li> My main complaint was that I wish it would have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those suckers who bought the salt scrub at a mall kiosk and got this thrown in because I didn&#x27;t want to pay the high price.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but this product caused me no irritation or excessive dryness whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly that, FALSE advertising.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; was simply WAY to watered down &amp; when I would apply the product on my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;The skin on my face gets very dry and no matter what I use it stays that way.</li>
            <li> have very dry flaky skin on my face.</li>
            <li> There was little tiny pieces stuck to my face like glue.  </li>
            <li> I have to pick those little pieces off each facial hair, and it takes forever.  </li>
            <li> He caught me when I was tired and hungry, and obviously not thinking clearly.</li>
            <li> I never noticed anything different with my skin or all this dead skin that should have come off my face from using this product.</li>
            <li> B00340T6XU Avani Dead Sea Skin Renewal Facial Peel]]</li>
            <li> Its a total sham, scam, whatever you want to call it</li>
            <li> Its a total sham, scam, whatever you want to call it</li>
            <li> really wonder how these products can be sold with their outlandish promises and false advertisements.</li>
            <li> I received my bottle of Deja Vu Dead Sea Minerals Facial Peeling the other day.  </li>
            <li> I do recomend a dead sea facial in other brands but would not buy this one again.</li>
            <li> It removes any and all dry or dead facial skin after you&#x27;ve washed and dried your face.</li>
            <li> I overcompensate with tons of moisturizer usually applied multiple times after cleansing or exfoliating or both.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what the big deal about this product was.</li>
            <li> Just extremely over priced in malls.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount to get the job done.</li>
            <li> it &amp;#34;spoiled&amp;#34; or it simply was past</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product along with the nail file buffer/cuticle oil/lotion kit and am extremely livid.  </li>
            <li> This product gets all of that dead dry skin off</li>
            <li> Also I want to say I used this product twice and the bottle is already empty which made me realize that it was never full to begin with.</li>
            <li> It was like taking away the dull of it and  giving me back my rejuvenator moment without suffering anything.</li>
            <li> So, bottom line, not worth your money.</li>
            <li> The price went from $120, to half off, then down to 40</li>
            <li> Not only it was broken from the inside stem, so I was not able to use it properly, but when I tried getting some of the product out by hand, I came to find that the product did not even work.</li>
            <li> I have used the dead sea facail peel in other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a scar from a grease burn for almost five years that was slightly hidden by my sleeve.</li>
            <li> The day after each use my skin was softer and clearer than it had ever previously been.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m latina and black</li>
            <li> yet it sloughs all the dead skin and leaves nothing but radiant and soft skin behind.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want any more of their Dead Sea Crap.</li>
            <li> may be less</li>
            <li> My cheeks were dry and used to form layers of dead skin which used to make the surface look dull.</li>
            <li> She could&#x27;ve told me this little bottle was $200</li>
            <li> so the scars I get are soooo dark!</li>
            <li> I am a little hestitant about this product in particular.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look anything like the image and it came broken.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> This is a product that works well and removes the dead skin as stated.</li>
            <li> I have used everyday for 3 weeks and can tell a difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li> It gentely rubbed off the dead skin.</li>
            <li> Well, they killed me for over $200.  </li>
            <li> Dead Sea Minerals Face</li>
            <li> but I felt it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> it cannot penetrate the skin below the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money with this product.  </li>
            <li> I noticed I had a few dried flakes on my face, which is what?</li>
            <li> Dead skin trying to come off.</li>
            <li> So I figured I would just get it off with the dead skin peeler.</li>
            <li> It created what seemed to looked dead skin crumbling off.</li>
            <li> &quot; This product is made to look like your dead skin is coming off</li>
            <li> I have no idea how they can claim this is making your dead skin off and get away with it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not remove your dead skin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not remove your dead skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff seemed like a waste.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this product, your missing out.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, it really isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> Halfway through the bottle the nozzle broke and of course, since the bottle does not twist off I cannot reach the broken part of the nozzle or the half used product that I spent a lot of money on.  </li>
            <li> In any event, I used this last night on my poor change in weather, kinda flaky, dull looking skin.</li>
            <li> I was not very happy after checking amazon and found it priced for half the price.  </li>
            <li> I was roped into buying this at the mall after the saleswoman demonstrated it on a small patch on one of my cheeks.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m too polite to say no :/ ).</li>
            <li> you see your dead skin literally fall off as you wash your face..then you put on your moisturizer and its like silk!</li>
            <li> But worst of all is that the products contain ingredients deemed to be harmful and most legit companies don&#x27;t even use them anymore.  </li>
            <li> What a sham!</li>
            <li> I feel really dumb for getting sucked into this sham of a</li>
            <li> I feel really dumb for getting sucked into this sham of a</li>
            <li> I hardly wear any make up since ive been using these products.</li>
            <li> I was one of the suckers who was pulled into the kiosk to let my wrist be &amp;#34;exfoliated&amp;#34; and have some gunk put under my eye.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t even resell it on ebay or Amazon to the suckers who haven&#x27;t figured out the trick yet.</li>
            <li> have filed a complaint with the State of Hawaii Office of Consumer Protection and the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs.</li>
            <li> but no, she practically put the product in a bag and forced us to buy something we didn&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> There is not any down time and it doesn&#x27;t burn, sting, itch or anything!!!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to the T, and woke up the next day with horribly inflamed, red, irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> Try to avoid the sales people in the mall, because they seriously don&#x27;t take no for an answer.</li>
            <li> Once this stuff attaches to any facial hairs, it&#x27;s almost impossible to remove.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, it&#x27;s too much trouble to have to deal with that.  </li>
            <li> I have bad skin, I&#x27;m lonely.</li>
            <li> The box came opened and maybe tampered with not happy</li>
            <li> item came with a broken pump/nozzle.  </li>
            <li> Not a happy customer.</li>
            <li> and they just CAN NOT list all the secret ingredients.</li>
            <li> Their Dead Sea Crap ALMOST KILLED ME !!</li>
            <li> you discover a pattern of shady sales practices at malls where no refunds are ever issued, even if you have a bad reaction to a product.  </li>
            <li> These are known as comedones or white heads, and they were not inflamed, but used to form these nasty bumps on my skin.</li>
            <li> What a rip-off!  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I will agree with the angry reviewers in the 1 star section.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical but hopeful.</li>
            <li> DID YOU WRONG.</li>
            <li> This whole line is worthless crap!</li>
            <li> and i was so mad when i came to know</li>
            <li> However, it is very difficult to pump the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> it made it very difficult to get the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It gets so bad that it even gets flaky between my eyebrows and around my hairline.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> but I will not buy again because I am very unhappy with my experience.</li>
            <li> , I can still feel that crap on my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m outraged .3.</li>
            <li> I hate this product!!!!</li>
            <li> and it is awful.  </li>
            <li> The worst stay away!</li>
            <li> I had horrible scarring all over my face and this too ALL OF THAT</li>
            <li> Can you believe they sell this crap for $170 on their website?!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a product that works well and removes the dead skin as stated. I would recommend this product to friends and family. I have used everyday for 3 weeks and can tell a difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li> I just found this in my moms draw &amp; decided to try it. I never used a facial peeler in my life so I had no idea what to expect. The minute I put it on, my skin started peeling off. It was amazing. Once I looked for a price online, I was like wow this is too much money for a face peeler. Go with something much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I was convinced by a sales person to purchase this product.  I followed the instructions to the T, and woke up the next day with horribly inflamed, red, irritated skin.  I&#x27;m getting married in only a few days and obviously am LIVID with this product that is neither \\&quot;kind\\&quot;, \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;suitable for all skin types\\&quot; which is how it is advertised.     DO NOT USE IT!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave me a sample of hers to try. It was AMAZING!! I have huge pores. I tried this on one side of my face first to see if I could tell a difference. I completely could!  My pores were so clean and I may be seeing what I want to see... but they seemed tighter.     It gentely rubbed off the dead skin. And I actually felt glowing after. My skin was so soft after. I am very excited to use it weekly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to write about my personal experience with this product. While I can&#x27;t say that it will work for everyone, it drastically and gently improved my skin texture, complexion and unclogged my pores. If you have thin sensitive skin or your skin has acne which is inflamed any exfoliant, including the most gentle like this product will irritate your skin. I have patchy skin, where my chin&#x27;s pores used to become clogged and then skin would grow over the pore preventing the pore from draining. These are known as comedones or white heads, and they were not inflamed, but used to form these nasty bumps on my skin. I had tried everything from clay masks, to astringents, to store-bought exfoliants, to dermatological surgical procedures to get these pores drained but none were as effective. My cheeks were dry and used to form layers of dead skin which used to make the surface look dull. All store-bought exfoliants I had tried used to feel scratchy and used to irritate and redden my face so I stopped using them. This product is the most gentle and effective exfoliant I have ever tried, it removes the dry skin on my cheeks without causing a rash like store-bought exfoliants yet the salt granules are small enough to remove enough skin to drain comedones. I exfoliate with this product once a week and use the hydrating mineral gel immediately after. It&#x27;s never caused me a rash. I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to anyone who has a tough time draining their pores or wants to gently remove dull dead skin to bring radiant new skin to the surface. Plus I&#x27;m so happy Amazon is selling it because it is a lot more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I hate this product!!!! It gums up on your face so quickly that you can&#x27;t even rinse it off fast enough!!! The pump also broke within two uses.  I purchased it in a mall for about $40 and I would never purchase this again!!!!!</li>
            <li> The box came opened and maybe tampered with not happy I ordered this for a gift for my wife when we were in Vegas and came across a store</li>
            <li> I was one of the suckers who was pulled into the kiosk to let my wrist be &amp;#34;exfoliated&amp;#34; and have some gunk put under my eye.  Giving credit where it&#x27;s due, the salesperson (a young Israeli &amp;#34;hipster&amp;#34;!) was really really good!  I ended up shelling out $100 for the eye goop and the exfoliant.  Just tried the exfoliant on my face this morning and it is awful.  I thought that simply rinsing my face would wash away the stuff but no..... I scrubbed.  And scrubbed.  And scrubbed, with a washcloth and an hour later, I can still feel that crap on my face.  And I don&#x27;t see or feel any difference on my skin (except for the grainy residue that won&#x27;t come off!!)  A very expensive mistake - just a word of warning to others who might think this stuff sounds like a great deal (at the mall kiosk, the prices are double what you see here on Amazon).  Don&#x27;t do it - there are better, more reputable products out there.  Think Whole Foods cosmetics section - much better stuff.</li>
            <li> Complete scam! I have sensitive skin and the salesman said it would help with sensitive dry skinâ€¦. Of course 10 minutes later my hands were hurting and I returned literally 20 minutes later and they refused to refund my money for the unopened, unused, products I just bought! The worst stay away!</li>
            <li> First things first, I&#x27;m a 24 year old male who got roped into buying this from one of those overly persuasive girls at the mall kiosk. At first, I just didn&#x27;t want to be rude and brush her off. She started showing me the products, then took this facial peel and starting rubbing it on my wrist. I&#x27;ve had a scar from a grease burn for almost five years that was slightly hidden by my sleeve. When I went to wash it off I noticed that the portion of the scar that had the solution applied to it had diminished nearly %50. She could&#x27;ve told me this little bottle was $200 and I still would&#x27;ve bought it. I started using this on my face once every week or so. The day after each use my skin was softer and clearer than it had ever previously been. It also really helps in avoiding ingrown hairs (probably not a concern for the majority of females who I would assume mainly purchase this product).</li>
            <li> These products may be fine and all, but I did spend about $80 on the facial peel (they threw  in a salt scrub--thanks) and the incredibly hard-core sales lady said, \\&quot;You are killing me!\\&quot;  Well, they killed me for over $200.  What a rip-off!  And of course they are non-refundable.  STAY AWAY FROM THE STORE ON CHRISTOPHER STREET IN MANHATTAN.  I won&#x27;t buy these products ever again, purely on principle, now that I see how cheap they really are.  Shame on Deja Vu!</li>
            <li> I was roped into buying this at the mall after the saleswoman demonstrated it on a small patch on one of my cheeks. I spent my last 35 bucks on it (the \\&quot;student discount\\&quot;) and it was worth it. I&#x27;m thrilled to find it on Amazon for a fraction of the price. I do not like the overly pushy Deja Vu sales people at the malls, but this is one product of theirs that works great (and the dead sea scrub too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin on my face gets very dry and no matter what I use it stays that way. I get a build up of dead dry skin and then my skin gets oily on top of that. It gets so bad that it even gets flaky between my eyebrows and around my hairline. I overcompensate with tons of moisturizer usually applied multiple times after cleansing or exfoliating or both. This product gets all of that dead dry skin off and now I only use just the slightest bit of moisturizer after. It leaves my face so soft and smooth, it&#x27;s really incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, the best product have I ever used on my face.</li>
            <li> Deja Vu Dead Sea Minerals Face Peeling is the same product that the one i purchase from the mall but much cheaper at Amazon.I use this product once a week and my skin feel clean smooth and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product and bought as gifts for 6 years now.  It was great to find it at a more affordable price.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial exfoliator I have ever used.  I have sensitive skin, but this product caused me no irritation or excessive dryness whatsoever.  Introduced it to my sister and she thinks it is the greatest too.  You have to use it to believe it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the facial peel. I have been using it for about 3 years. I use it all over the face and it really softens my skin and gives it a fresh, youthful glow. I often get really dry skin on my arms and sometimes use this product to scrub my arms, which really helps as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware-- the picture is NOT the product. I knew this when I made my purchase. So, don&#x27;t be alarmed if you decide to purchase this product and find it looks different. The facial peel actually comes in a longer pump bottle.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! It gently &amp; easily removes the dead skin with no irritation. I am so impressed. My co-workers have commented that my skin is glowing. They started using the product too. I use other Deja Vu products and have been impressed with them also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne since I was 12. I&#x27;m 31 now. I&#x27;ve been to the Drs and nothing they ever gave me worked so I figured I was just doomed to have acne the rest of my life. Then my boyfriend got roped into buying these products at the mall. I used the salt scrub first and it was awesome so I tried the facial peeling next. Initially I wasn&#x27;t impressed. There wasn&#x27;t much to the product and I didn&#x27;t \\&quot;feel\\&quot; it working but by the next day it looked like my acne was clearing up. I didn&#x27;t get too excited bc occassionally my skin likes to play tricks on me but I&#x27;ve been using the product once a week for 5 weeks now and my skin is finally clear and the tone, texture, and scarring have improved dramatically! An added bonus is that it didn&#x27;t irritate and dry my skin out at all like all the prescriptions had. My skin is extremely sensitive and it didn&#x27;t bother me at all. My bf getting suckered into buying this stuff was the best thing that has ever happened to my skin! Now I thank god hes a sucker for pretty eyes, curly hair, and accents! LOL!</li>
            <li> I was not sure what the big deal about this product was. Someone I work with told me about it so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;First the picture shown is not what I have so maybe I never got the proper product. Second I couldnâ€™t tell if I was doing the proper thing with the product. The product I have is a taller bottle and what comes out is some sort of clear product. Even when you put it on your face you canâ€™t see or really feel the product or anything it is doing. I never noticed anything different with my skin or all this dead skin that should have come off my face from using this product. Sorry but I felt it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - been using for years! Tried many products but nothing renewed and clarified my face like this product. Removes all of the dead skin cells and leaves my skin soft, clear, and luminous.  When I start using a lot of moisturizer I know it&#x27;s time to use the facial peeling.  Moisturizer is absorbed by the dead skin cells and the moisturizer cannot do what it&#x27;s suppose to do- it cannot penetrate the skin below the dead skin cells. Excellent product and Amazon is the BEST place to order from.</li>
            <li> I expected the bottle to be made with higher quality.  Halfway through the bottle the nozzle broke and of course, since the bottle does not twist off I cannot reach the broken part of the nozzle or the half used product that I spent a lot of money on.  I liked the product but I will not buy again because I am very unhappy with my experience.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and people remark how young I look. My pores are very large on chin and nose/cheeks ever since adolescence which always bothered me. Barring doing masks daily nothing helped until I bought this product for $40.00 at a kiosk in the mall. Feeling like I was ripped off but know ing she still reduced the price I tried it and it worked. My pores are smaller than a pinhead after 3 days of use. I use it after cleaning my skin and than moisturize. Nice to see amazon has it cheaper. Dead sea is a good product. If I had the money I would have the entire line.</li>
            <li> I see some people saying it&#x27;s watery and such. The guy at the mall immediately opened it once I purchased it and said he had to let the air out. I am assuming this is what causes it to become more of a gel like substance. He was extremely insistent and enthusiastic. He made it seem like he was hiding the &amp;#34;discount&amp;#34; he was giving me, from his boss who was walking around. He said it was 80$ but then he pulls out a calculator and shows me $39.99! And woe is me I forgot to check trust amazon and I fell for it. He also charged me for the moisturizer despite me telling him to only charge me for the facial peeling first, since I wasn&#x27;t not sure my card was at it&#x27;s limit. He saw that I had mastercard and said they have some deal with mastercard and gave me another discount on the moisturizer after he showed me the price it would pull up oh the computer. Obviously they didn&#x27;t have a deal with master card, and they were just willing to say anything to get you to buy the product. On the other hand, it really isn&#x27;t that bad. Just extremely over priced in malls. The people who sell it, namely the guy I had the misfortune of encountering, are so sus.</li>
            <li> The lid/top/squirter whatever it is called broke the moment I touched it.  I made one simple attempt to squirt the product into my hands so that i could use it for the first time, and the lid broke.  I packaged it and sent it right back.  it concerns me as whether or not this is an authentic product.  A bottle that flimsy or cheap: maybe thats the reason why this product is only $35 vs the competitors same product at $89.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for those complaining about getting ripped off- it&#x27;s a brave new world.  Foreign companies and businesses are moving into the US and a good number of mall kiosks like this belong to those businesses.  If you notice how they say they&#x27;re gonna drop the price this time because they like you or because you&#x27;re handsome then they are basically inviting you to haggle.  It&#x27;s not prevalent in the states so most people don&#x27;t know how to do it, but in general with these products you should be able to get them down to around the cost plus shipping and then a few dollars.  And in the process you likely have fun interacting with the salesperson, get to see the product in action, and don&#x27;t have to wait for your item to ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure I paid a little more than what Amazon sells for, but I got my product right away and got to see it actually work so I knew it wasn&#x27;t flimsy, and got to spend a few minutes flirting with an attractive Israeli woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: Learn to haggle.</li>
            <li> I have really oily acne prone skin. I had horrible scarring all over my face and this too ALL OF THAT AWAY within 2 months.  I had gotten this facial peel from the mall first for 45 dollars:( but i was so impressed with it that i didn&#x27;t mind the price. But now I found it so much cheaper on amazon.... My acne was mainly on my forehead, chin, jaw and upper lip. I&#x27;m latina and black so the scars I get are soooo dark! I use this 2 times a week and my skin is so clear, smooth and even toned. My other skin care products seem to work so much better since I don&#x27;t have a build up of dead skin and oil on my face anymore. I also just it on my chest and shoulders since I tend to get acne and scarring there too. Also, this last me a really long time even though I use it often. You only need a small amount to get the job done. This is also a lot better than a chemical peel. There is not any down time and it doesn&#x27;t burn, sting, itch or anything!!! I love this it is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product definitely works and makes a difference; however, I find myself using more of it than I&#x27;d like too. One squirt only works for about 1/4 to 1/3 of my face. I also find that it doesn&#x27;t do a completely even job around my chin but that could just be me. Bottom line is it works and is better than paying full price for it in the mall.</li>
            <li> Gently exfoliates. I use this once a month. Amazing how much dead skin and grime this takes away. Not too harsh on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The package was different from the picture. I was not impressed. I was really disappointed. The only good thing was I received it on time</li>
            <li> This product does a great job as a peel without being too drying. I combine it with their gel moisturizer. The price here is reasonable. I first saw this product at a mall kiosk, where they wanted to charge 3X the cost here at Amazon. I was impressed with the mall demo of the product, but was not willing to pay their outrageous price. Thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money with this product.  I tried it and the product got STUCK on my face, yes you heard me right people.  There was little tiny pieces stuck to my face like glue.  I didn&#x27;t see any improvement and picking the product off my face isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;m sure you want to do, nor is something its meant to do.  I did check the expiration date and no it wasn&#x27;t expired.  So, bottom line, not worth your money.</li>
            <li> I will agree with the angry reviewers in the 1 star section. I was originally bombarded into buying many of the products and spent over $100. I am never doing that again. Try to avoid the sales people in the mall, because they seriously don&#x27;t take no for an answer. That being said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like their products. I bought their bath salts, cuticle and nail set, and the facial peel and I have to say I love all of them. Since this is the facial peel I&#x27;ll just review that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry flaky skin on my face. I also have extremely sensitive skin, so certain products tend to really inflame my skin. To the point that I have to rewash my face just to stop the burning sensation. When I first bought this I was a little nervous.&lt;br /&gt;However, my first try with it was amazing. Every time I used it, more dead skin came off, and my face felt very soft and smooth. It&#x27;s extremely simple to use as well. You just pump a little onto your finger and rub on the area and the skin just gently comes away. At first I thought it was a gimmick, but I used it on my forehead which is sometimes oily, and has little to no dead skin and next to nothing came off. I still use it now just because of how soft my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> So I got the facial peel and I love it, but now that I see it online for $20 I&#x27;m outraged .3. I paid $60 for this and $40 for the moisturizer (They sweetened the deal with the nail kit and I&#x27;m too polite to say no :/ ). Lovely product, but sketchy sales people. I also won&#x27;t buy anymore because I can get it here so much cheaper! Never going to the mall again .o.</li>
            <li> I received my bottle of Deja Vu Dead Sea Minerals Facial Peeling the other day.  After the first use, I could not pump any more of the product out.  I had to twist off the pump part and dig the product out with a q-tip.  Needless to say, it&#x27;s too much trouble to have to deal with that.  I think the product is ok, but either this is a different product, or they changed the formula, because I used this stuff about 5 years ago, and it came in a jar that you use a spatula to scoop out, and the product seemed far superior.</li>
            <li> Need to purchase more. Looking to purchase three different products if u have them n can give me a good deal on buying two n getting third very discounted or free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susanisrlern@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> I saw these products at a mall and they wanted big bucks to buy them.. I found them here on Amazon for a fraction of the cost. I have less open pours and it leaves my skin so soft.. use it with the day cream. I hardly wear any make up since ive been using these products.</li>
            <li> its like a microderm in a bottle! but for much cheaper. you see your dead skin literally fall off as you wash your face..then you put on your moisturizer and its like silk! I use this once a month and face is glowing after!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of negative comments about deja vu, but I have to say that after using the facial peel,cleanser, night cream, eye cream and serum for a week, my skin looks and feels great.  I&#x27;m 45 with combination skin and starting to get sun spots and lines. These products make my skin look luminous and healthy. I&#x27;ve even been going out without makeup. I had buyers remorse after spending $250, but now I&#x27;m glad I did. I will buy from amazon next time, but so far, I&#x27;m impressed and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products. They do need a better translator for the writing on the boxes though, lots of typos and grammer boo boos. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those suckers who bought the salt scrub at a mall kiosk and got this thrown in because I didn&#x27;t want to pay the high price.  I&#x27;m still kicking myself 3 months later for being taken by these people.  This facial peel really isn&#x27;t peeling the dead skin cells; it&#x27;s the product that makes a peeling look.  I suspect there&#x27;s glue in it.  Once this stuff attaches to any facial hairs, it&#x27;s almost impossible to remove.  I have to pick those little pieces off each facial hair, and it takes forever.  This whole line is worthless crap!</li>
            <li> This product is a superior facial peel and exfoliator. It removes any and all dry or dead facial skin after you&#x27;ve washed and dried your face. Simply apply a small dab on each area of the face and using a circular motion with little pressure it removes the top layer of damaged, dry or dead skin cells remarkably well. It does not burn or irriatate my skin, nor does it make it red or feel abrasive like other products I&#x27;ve used. It has barely any scent so it does not compete with your other products. You must moisturize after rinsing your face to remove the skin particles. Dry your face/skin well again to promote a soft and moist surface and apply your moisturizer, preferably one with sunscreen and not too greasy. I use it 2 to 3 times a week as my skin ages I find it helps to remove the dead dry skin better than just using a cleanser or facial scrub. It is an after you wash your face application so you can still cleanse your face as you did before. Last note: the price that this seller is asking is VERY reasonable. Worth a try to see for yourself.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at the mall yesterday, after a very friendly saleswoman chatted me up. I have bad skin, I&#x27;m lonely. I am just the kind of sucker they are looking for. She put the peel on my arm and it seems to peel off skin. In my head I said, it&#x27;s probably just the product making those \\&quot;peels\\&quot; and not my skin. I purchased anyway, as you can barely get away from these people.. but I got out to my car, spread a drop of the product on a flat plastic surface, rubbed and I was right. It&#x27;s not peeling your skin. The product coagulates and looks like peeled skin. Like Elmer&#x27;s Glue. I have never been taken so easily and I could kick myself for the whole thing. The bottle that was in the box, has a broken/stuck pump so I can&#x27;t even resell it on ebay or Amazon to the suckers who haven&#x27;t figured out the trick yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after an Jewish sales man came up to me and put a dabble on my face  and hands and wiped it puff with towel.  I have say I have nothing against the product but for the price that he gave me there on the spot is 140.00 for this peeling facial bottle.  I was not very happy after checking amazon and found it priced for half the price.  Granted he threw in two other product  and said they free.  I did not like how pushy he was and I would not go back to buy the product again.  If I end up liking the product, I will purchase at amazon and avoid these pushy sales man and women that they hire. I feel like I was ripped off and lied to.</li>
            <li> I am a little hestitant about this product in particular.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look anything like the image and it came broken.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I will still try the product to see if it works.</li>
            <li> Great products. However, it is very difficult to pump the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> dont buy this in malls! they&#x27;ll rip u off! so much cheaper on amazon! and it works really well for me</li>
            <li> As this product was demonstrated in Las Vega, I couldn&#x27;t buy there. I  was impressed how my skin got the glooming after applying this  facial peeling. It was like taking away the dull of it and  giving me back my rejuvenator moment without suffering anything. Love it.</li>
            <li> Wish I had seen these reviews before I bought this from a very pushy guy at the mall kiosk. He caught me when I was tired and hungry, and obviously not thinking clearly. Shockingly (haha) the price went from $119.99 to $20 plus tax. When I handed him two 20s, he tried to give me lotion instead of my change!!  I finally got away from him after purchasing the facial peel. I went home to try it only to discover the bottle was empty after one teenie tiny squirt.  I had to drive back to the mall the next day, despite 6 inches of snow, to get another bottle since they won&#x27;t give refunds (surprise!!!)  I was all ready to give him a piece of my mind, but the kiosk was unmanned so I just left my empty bottle and took a new one that I was hoping wasn&#x27;t used as a tester.  After all that, the product worked ok. Live and learn.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work.  It came without me being able to use it.  It doesn&#x27;t squirt out the contents.  The bottle is quite a disappointment&lt;br /&gt;You pay for something and can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> this product cleans all the dirt grease and oil off my skin. it makes my face have a glo to it. i love it and i do stock up on these product. it works well even with the vita gel. no grease no mess. I dont break out with these products. its perfect if u have very sentitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent peel.  The product is amazing.  It&#x27;s gentle yet it sloughs all the dead skin and leaves nothing but radiant and soft skin behind.  I would recommend it for anyone with delicate, fair skin that&#x27;s prone to drying, especially in winter.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. The dead skin litterally just comes off and it leaves ur skin soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> The product does not work as said and it DID NOT come with a stick for the pump.  That means that I have to unscrew it and hit it on my hand in order for it to come out of bottle!  I won&#x27;t purchase another Deja Vu Product.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and sensitive skin so if I had read some of the reviews first (I didn&#x27;t because my sister said \\&quot;here, try this!\\&quot; and I did) then I might NOT have tried it at all.  But I have had absolutely no problem with this product over the last 6 months of regular (some weeks it&#x27;s daily) use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My older skin (I am 67) does not exfoliate as well as younger skin.  And particularly around my nose I was getting skin buildup, then scaling.  This Deja Vu product works wonders and does not irritate my skin at all.  I use it before I get into the shower on my face, on my upper chest, on my elbows ... well, you get the idea!</li>
            <li> The deja vu bulls*** is a  scam. The one time I actually bothered to pay attention to kiosk at the mall. 24 on amazon 60 in the mall plus free soap ...lmao hope it works[[ASIN:B00340T6XU Avani Dead Sea Skin Renewal Facial Peel]]</li>
            <li> Loved the product....loved the price....but the pump dispenser didn&#x27;t work.....it made it very difficult to get the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> works awesome on my acne to remove dead skin before exfoliating and is a heck of a lot cheaper then the dejavu site!!!</li>
            <li> I was quite happy with this product. My main complaint was that I wish it would have lasted longer. I will probably buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product dose a excellent job of exfoliating in a gentle way. Leaves skin feeling clean, smooth and looking stunning!</li>
            <li> item came with a broken pump/nozzle.  and the product doesnt actually work.  it just dries up and peels away, without actually removing a layer of your skin.  save your money. don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> The product does its job. It made my skin \\&quot;luminous\\&quot; as the salesman said. BUT do your research for prices before you buy!! The salesmen told me it was an 80 dollar product, ended up selling to me for 40 dollars, I come online to do more research to see if what I bought was worth it and its on Amazon for 20 dollars. Good product, sketchy sells people. Be smarter than me and look up stuff before you buy it!!</li>
            <li> I was also roped into buying this product at the mall, like many of the other people who have written reviews. I have combination skin, with acne on my cheeks, occasional break outs on my forehead and sides of my chin. I&#x27;ve been using proactiv for years, but it recently stopped working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it and my skin is glowing. My cheeks already look clearer, it seemed to have remove some of my acne scars. I also have fine facial hair, but I did not have an issue with it getting caught in it or not being able to rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for a friend, but buy it online it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than at the mall.</li>
            <li> Im not crazy about this product. My friend recc. but the peel gets stuck on my face like glue, i have to pluck it off</li>
            <li> I have never used the products I regrettably bought by a VERY pushy salesman at the mall.  He literally wouldn&#x27;t take NO for an answer.  If you research this online you discover a pattern of shady sales practices at malls where no refunds are ever issued, even if you have a bad reaction to a product.  Also, funny how the prices become whatever you happen to have in your wallet!  Then, when you shop online, the prices are only about 10% of what you pay at the mall.  But worst of all is that the products contain ingredients deemed to be harmful and most legit companies don&#x27;t even use them anymore.  Use at your ownrisk!</li>
            <li> I  have used their products since 2004 and I absolutely love them and your skin is always&lt;br /&gt;so soft and your puffy eyes are gone in minutes.  They have a new product the Mudd facial&lt;br /&gt;with the magnet that is amazing.  The thing that bothers me is when you go anywhere the&lt;br /&gt;mall or otherwise you have options if the answer is no and you don&#x27;t like what is being&lt;br /&gt;sold walk away we have choices but don&#x27;t slam a product you have never used just because&lt;br /&gt;you did not choose to leave and be talked into something you did not want.  This is a&lt;br /&gt;America we have choices..  The product is the best money ever spent.</li>
            <li> I love this, it definitely leaves my face soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve used it on my feet as well (after a vigorous ped egg scrubbing) and it DRASTICALLY improved my feet. It&#x27;s the softest they&#x27;ve ever been!</li>
            <li> great&lt;br /&gt;I recommand</li>
            <li> It does smell lovely but the pump does not work. I have to remove the pump and shake the product out like ketchup. Which is obviously more time consuming than I prefer.</li>
            <li> I, too, was hit by a very pushy but incredibly charismatic salesman at a mall kiosk. The price went from $120, to half off, then down to 40 and I walked away. I took it home for $25 when he came back for me ;)  In any event, I used this last night on my poor change in weather, kinda flaky, dull looking skin. I was a bit skeptical but hopeful. Wow! I was seriously impressed. Followed up with my own skin moisturizer and my skin felt new! Soft, smooth, flake free and radiant.  I intend to continue using this product but next time I&#x27;ll purchase through Amazon so I don&#x27;t have to go through the whole sales push.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the results of the facial peeling product. My skin is very sensitive so maybe this is why it irritated my skin but I will never be purchasing or using this product again. Also I want to say I used this product twice and the bottle is already empty which made me realize that it was never full to begin with. Not a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I love it! Really helped with clearing up my skin, and so easy to use...no waiting for peel results. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed with this product. Not only it was broken from the inside stem, so I was not able to use it properly, but when I tried getting some of the product out by hand, I came to find that the product did not even work. The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; was simply WAY to watered down &amp; when I would apply the product on my face it would simply turn to this rubbery-foam, and at the end I would have white specks on my face . My conclusion is that the item was either in hot temperatures and it &amp;#34;spoiled&amp;#34; or it simply was past it&#x27;s expiration date.</li>
            <li> Like many of the others, I was in the mall and was pulled over by a young, cute Israeli, selling this product.&lt;br /&gt;the exfoliate and some facial peel. Both of which I can safely say are garbageâ€™ as the French would say.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Oil Of Olay for years, I am 43. I have never had a problem with OOO, thought Iâ€™d try&lt;br /&gt;Something elseâ€¦Not impressed with this junk which I doubt is from the Dead Sea. Probably from Mortonâ€™s&lt;br /&gt;Salt. The product did nothing for my face.Iâ€™m sticking with oâ€™l faithfulâ€¦Oil Of Olay.</li>
            <li> someone tried to sale me this product in the mall for 4x more money.  This is the same product and works very well</li>
            <li> PEOPLE NEED TO STOP GIVING THIS PRODUCT 1 STAR BECAUSE THEY FELT THEY GOT RIPPED OFF AT A STORE OR KIOSK. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PRODUCT AND IF IT WORKS. THE STAR SYSTEM IS FOR HOW THE PRODUCT WORKS NOT FOR HOW SOME SALES PERSON DID YOU WRONG. GIVE THE \\&quot;PRODUCT\\&quot; THE STARS IT DESERVES AND GO YELP THE STORE THAT RIPPED YOU OFF!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wonder how these products can be sold with their outlandish promises and false advertisements. This is exactly that, FALSE advertising. Yes, I recently wrote a review raving about this product because I was fooled as well. Why the change in my tune? I took a closer look at the product and my skin today. I noticed I had a few dried flakes on my face, which is what? Dead skin trying to come off. So I figured I would just get it off with the dead skin peeler. I pumped the product out onto my fingers and rubbed it into my face and it did its \\&quot;peeling.\\&quot; I washed my face and once it dried the same exact flakes were still there!!! So I don&#x27;t how many of you have tried this but you might want to after you read what I&#x27;m about to tell you. I pumped some onto my fingers and rubbed them together and it did the same thing as it does on my face. It created what seemed to looked dead skin crumbling off. Now some of you are going to say yeah well that might be the skin on your fingers rubbing off. Well, I did it a second, third, fourth, and fifth time. Each time getting the same result. The more you pump out and rub the more it resembles \\&quot;dead skin.\\&quot; This product is made to look like your dead skin is coming off but it is not. Its basically like putting a layer of white glue on your finger and waiting for it to dry to peel it off. Except in this instance you do not need to wait for the product to dry, it does it instantly. What a sham! Watch closer the next time you use this product. It will only \\&quot;peel\\&quot; off the same exact amount of product you use. I have no idea how they can claim this is making your dead skin off and get away with it. Its a total sham, scam, whatever you want to call it but it&#x27;s not remove your dead skin. I feel really dumb for getting sucked into this sham of a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why 2 stars and not 1? Because it did make my skin feel softer after using it. Its up to you what you want to do but I&#x27;m sure there are cheaper ways of making your skin feel softer. But if you are looking for something that peels you skin, this is not it. Can you believe they sell this crap for $170 on their website?! what a joke. I&#x27;m reporting the company to the better business bureau as should you if you have purchased this product and discover what I have.th it.

He said 1 bottle should last around 10 months for 1 person.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product and I like it but check Amazon prices and DO NOT buy at your local mall. I usually walk away with a smile and a firm &amp;#34;no thank you&amp;#34; but for some reason I stopped and got stuck. When the young man told me he would walk me to the spa on the other end of the mall, that was it!!! &amp;#34;That&#x27;s enough, I am going in this direction, do not follow me, goodbye&amp;#34; and he finally got the message.</li>
            <li> I bought the Magnetic Mud Mask and had a SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTION. My face, eyes, neck, ears, chest and upper right arm were so swollen with urticaria and severe contact dermatitis that my primary care physician had to put me on a respirator and send me to Straub Hospital via ambulance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Head of Dermatology at Straub Hospital has insisted on a full Patch Test for me in August. I assure you that a sample of Deja Vu&#x27;s Magnetic Mud Mask as well as the Vivo Per Lei Facial Peeler WILL BE INCLUDED in my Patch Testing. I&#x27;m going to have diagnostic laboratory undeniable PROOF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, when your face looks like the Elephant Woman and it is so hot and bumpy and extremely pruritic you have to cancel all your work. All you want to do is rip your skin right off your bones. I don&#x27;t give a rat&#x27;s ass about their so called &amp;#34;policy&amp;#34; of No Refunds, Just Exchanges and Only within 14 Days. I don&#x27;t want any more of their Dead Sea Crap. Their Dead Sea Crap ALMOST KILLED ME !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have filed a complaint with the State of Hawaii Office of Consumer Protection and the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. I certainly CAN file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. I certainly CAN bring the pictures of my distorted elephant face and upper body to KHON News - Action Line. I certainly CAN post the digital pictures of my face which were taken by my Primary Care Physician on YELP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All they had to do was hand me a waiver and I would have been more than happy to tell them that YES!! I AM ALLERGIC TO SULFA DRUGS AND SULFA PRODUCTS!!  That SLUDGE from the Dead Sea most likely contains TONS of sulfa but we as consumers will NEVER know because its so mysterious and they just CAN NOT list all the secret ingredients. Gimme a break!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DID NOT see any posted LICENSE OF COSMETOLOGY at their toilet stall at the mall !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess they just WON&#x27;T be happy until the next atopic person comes along and buys their sales pitch.Unfortuatly, the next fool may NOT be able to seek IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION. Guess they just won&#x27;t be happy until the have a WRONGFUL DEATH LAW SUIT on their hands.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product along with the nail file buffer/cuticle oil/lotion kit and am extremely livid.  Not only was the salesman at the kiosk in the mall overly pushy and convincing, but he also used the exact same jargon as a previous review \\&quot;student discount\\&quot;, except this guy said \\&quot;Are you Jewish\\&quot;?  \\&quot;If you are, you get the \\&quot;Jewish student discount\\&quot;.  He was marketing this product to sell for $80, but would give it to me for $40.  Now that I see what it actually retails for, I&#x27;m so pissed.  I&#x27;m going to try to return it.  BEWARE OF MALL KIOSKS!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even want this. I was walking by the mall kiosk and the woman practically went up to me and my sister and showed us a sample. We thought it was a sample but no, she practically put the product in a bag and forced us to buy something we didn&#x27;t want. She kept lowering the price and made me take out my credit card to buy it. I&#x27;m now out so much money due to this. If you or anyone you know come across this, they are a bunch of fakes and liars.</li>
            <li> I have used the dead sea facail peel in other brands. This stuff seemed like a waste. It did not smooth onto the face like most dead sea faciall peels and did not seem as effective. I do recomend a dead sea facial in other brands but would not buy this one again.</li>
            <li> love the sales guy that worked with me product work!</li>
            <li> i guess it was all used up before it got to me. i saw this product in a mall and i liked it really and wanted to give it a try and i was ripped off. It had like 10% filled may be less and i was so mad when i came to know it was like that. i was out for a vacation and only got my hands on it after may be 35 days or so and i didnt want to return it but i am not at all happy with the purchase. I personally liked the product but the amount of it left in the bottle when it reached was surprising. i cannot say do not buy from this seller cause i could be the only one getting a rotten apple from the bunch but hey who knows ?? you might be ripped off too buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing stuff. Used it a few years ago &amp; so happy to find it on Amazon a lot more affordable than what I paid for it at the mall.</li>
            <li> bottle was more than half empty and it smelled and felt gross.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this product, your missing out.  I have use this producted for about  a year. And the results are outstanding. My skin looking great and feel super soft and much more healther.  It&#x27;s a must for all ages.</li>
