            <li> Too much will weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> My hair was getting frizzy and lifeless from coloring my hair and blow drying and using a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never been this soft and yet manageable without being weighed down.  </li>
            <li> Have very thick, coarse hair and this product really helps in manageability.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dry as the desert sand  </li>
            <li> hair was rough and dry ...</li>
            <li> I use it after I shampoo my hair and definitely see less frizz in my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was breaking off, falling out from a few different things including menopause.</li>
            <li> I have long thick coarse hair and am always looking for something to protect and soften my hair.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have very dry thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It takes very little to go a long way.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this product to anyone with thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> The smell of the product is less than to be desired.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thin hair so couldn&#x27;t afford the handfuls of hair coming out each DAY.</li>
            <li> not sure I like how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I am surprised, and so thankful (my hair was in BAD shape).</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this brand now.</li>
            <li> With the crazy amount of time I have bleached my hair, you can hardly noticel.</li>
            <li> I then bought this to hopefully help my weird hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guilty of reading reviews and not writing them...</li>
            <li> Usually I am not impressed</li>

            <li> This product is working great for my damaged hair, and I would recommend that anyone who thinks they need hair repair to try it. A little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s worth the money. SO glad I found this item!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s cheaper here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is by far the Best product I&#x27;ve used to repair damaged hair!  It makes my hair soft and no frizz. I Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while now. It&#x27;s all I use. Keeps my hair stong and doesn&#x27;t give me end breakage. A little goes a long way. Too much will weigh hair down. Perfect for summer blondes.</li>
            <li> Smells good and has been helping my hair a lot from my last bleaching process</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!!! My hair was breaking off, falling out from a few different things including menopause. I have long, thin hair so couldn&#x27;t afford the handfuls of hair coming out each DAY. I bought this and the Alterna RX Repair shampoo and conditioner and WOW!!!! Within 3 days, the breakage stopped and within a week, NO hair falling out at all!!! It&#x27;s light weight, smells great and even though it says use 3 times a week, I use a pea size amount each day and it marvelous! If you buy this with the luxurious shampoo and conditioner, your hair will literally transform. My hair is colored and highlighted and now it&#x27;s soft, manageable and has a great shine! I also use the Alterna lengthening elixir and that&#x27;s a great product too, but I haven&#x27;t seen hair growth. It does add beautiful sheen to the hair without being greasy. I&#x27;m totally hooked on Alterna hair products and I&#x27;m just thrilled with the outcome. Best thing I&#x27;ve purchased and you get great deals on here next to Sephora.</li>
            <li> makes my hair supper silky. I am addicted to this brand now. if you want stronger hair I recommend this to you.</li>
            <li> I swear by this product.  It adds protein and saves my color!  I have fewer all over color applications as this has protein and keeps my hair strong.  I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t help myself not writing a review about this! I had a very frizzy hair but not anymore!! Since first use it made my hair soooo sleek !! Love it Love it</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Ships fast. Very pleased</li>
            <li> Fabulous product for aging hair!  All of the Alterna products are well worth the price.  But especially nice when you can get it discounted!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of this product! It does what is says it will do! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I love all the products of alterna, use them for more than 2 years. previously used different expensive brands, but the best Alterna not found!!</li>
            <li> Great service thanks Amazon. Product makes my spun sugar hair look and feel like real hair again; hair is shiny and feels silky. Excellent product, good price. :)</li>
            <li> I like the feel and look of my hair. I recommend all of the Caviar hair products. They really work.</li>
            <li> Love this. Smells wonderful and makes my hair super soft. With the crazy amount of time I have bleached my hair, you can hardly noticel. Would definitally reccomend.</li>
            <li> My hair was getting frizzy and lifeless from coloring my hair and blow drying and using a flat iron.  I started using this product and my hair is so much more healthy and prettier.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  It takes very little to go a long way.  My hair has never been this soft and yet manageable without being weighed down.  Use with the Instant Recovery Shampoo and Conditioner for the strongest, softest hair ever!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.  I love Alterna products, but this one is useless.  Oh, well.  Save your money.  Try their other products, which are much better, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent</li>
            <li> my work requires my hair to be covered by this black nylon scarf.... 7 years of this has not been good for my hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;my hair was rough and dry ... now its so soft my hair dresser ant help but comment every time he blow drys it or colours.... i now have other therapists coming up to me at his salon asking about Alterna :)</li>
            <li> Works well and smells incredible</li>
            <li> this is a very good product i wish i can get it for the price it was i would buy it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about this brand FOREVER, but had never used it until I got a sample in &amp;#34;beauty box.&amp;#34;  The sample was of the Caviar Repair Mask, which I promptly fell in love with and purchased.  I then bought this to hopefully help my weird hair.  I have salt and pepper hair from my crown back, with silver in the front.  The silver hair is soft and very manageable.  The S&amp;P, not so much.  It has a tendency to either be crunchy or softer than mouse fur, and about attractive.  This product leaves my hair manageable, rinses clean without weighing down my hair, and smells wonderful.  This goes on my list of holy grail products...</li>
            <li> This is nice because it is a leave in treatment.  This was recommended by a youtube post.</li>
            <li> I have very dry thick coarse hair. This product is the best. After one use I saw the difference in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone with thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away. I have all over platinum high lights and this left my hair super shiny and soft. I am completely amazed by this product.</li>
            <li> I have the old mans hair where it use to be oily now it&#x27;s dry as the desert sand  this really works</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, makes my hair so smooth and healthy. I&#x27;ve been using for several months but noticed a difference immediately.</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel so much better.  My hair feels and looks healthier and has more shine. Some really good stuff!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guilty of reading reviews and not writing them... But I just had to write one for this product. For me this product has been life changing! I have coarse, brittle curly hair, the ends were fried from color, etc. This stuff makes my hair look like I have just gotten a keratin treatment at a salon. And it&#x27;s lasted. I know the only way to fix split ends is to cut them off, but for me this actually appears to have mended mine. I have used every high end product you can imagine and this is the first one that actually &amp;#34;changed&amp;#34; my hair for the better. I am surprised, and so thankful (my hair was in BAD shape). I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this!</li>
            <li> I have long thick coarse hair and am always looking for something to protect and soften my hair.  Usually I am not impressed but I saw an immediate difference with this hair treatment.  I use it after I shampoo my hair and definitely see less frizz in my hair.  I will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> It does what I hoped it would do and was not greasy. would recomend it to a friend, my hair was falling out when I started using it</li>
            <li> do not like this product, it does not work. would like to send back, but do not know how.</li>
            <li> The product did soften my hair but did not help with the split ends.  The smell of the product is less than to be desired.  I doubt I will spend this kind of money again.</li>
            <li> i just started using this product about a month ago and I can see a big difference...my hair is stronger and doesn&#x27;t fall out anymore.  This is a great product for women with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with alterna products.</li>
            <li> its ok...  not sure I like how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been softer and more put together.  Love the smell, the conditioned feeling, the bounce.  I will NEVER stop using this.</li>
            <li> Use quite a few Alterna products and this one is a favorite!!  Have very thick, coarse hair and this product really helps in manageability.  It helps keep humidity out, adds some shine (not oily-looking), seals ends of hair and seems to take the bulk-out of my hair which can be very big in mass.  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Not too heavy and smells so good. Great product for a blowout</li>
