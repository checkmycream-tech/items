            <li>Good stuff, hope they never discontinue it.</li>
            <li>have been using neutrogena naturals moisturizer which I really liked</li>
            <li>Very light feeling on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It works OK</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>this product works ok ,give it a chance to see what will happend to your skin</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li>I must say, it works for me better than the much-more-expensive products I&#x27;ve been buying at Sephora (from clinique, peter thomas roth).  </li>
            <li>But what I love most is how smooth my face looks and feels and stays moisturized all day</li>
            <li>This does a decent to good job controlling the blemishes.</li>
            <li>It is by far the most amazing lotion EVER.</li>
            <li>It does go on your face smoothly and feels silky</li>
            <li>My sister used it as well and has also experienced the same symptoms I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am happy with it and will buy it in the three-pack next time.</li>
            <li>but if it works for you Buy replacements ASAP!!!&lt;br /&gt;Never have any available or on Sale...</li>
            <li>Love it ;)</li>
            <li>My forehead looks better after using it twice a day for a week, and my monthly acne seemed to go away much quicker.</li>
            <li>and it has helped so much already I even notice more even tone. .</li>
            <li>It is seriously the best on the market!</li>
            <li>/&gt;We decided to switch back to our Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Lotion, which worked perfectly with the Fade gel and actually moisturized our face.</li>
            <li>Tried it all (murad, proactive etc) and this cheap item worked better by far</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy at all and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s pros are: it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin sticky like the Clear Pore did, and it isn&#x27;t as drying to the skin so you can use it more than once per day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>or it just won&#x27;t work), and it is scented, which I don&#x27;t like very much.</li>

            <li>so I know for sure that this lotion is a big part of helping to clear my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really just enough because it somewhat absorbs quite quickly.</li>

            <li> I am a 29 year old female and started using this when I was 21.</li>
            <li> but my skin is so sensitive to other acne medications like benzoyl peroxide.  .</li>
            <li> (you have to use a pretty thick layer of it</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, with occasional acne (usually before that time of the month) on my cheeks and chin, and acne on my forehead.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too harsh, makes my skin soft, and seems to help with acne.</li>
            <li> There is still some red scars on my face from previous blemishes but they are definitely starting to lessen.</li>
            <li> I usually use a new moisturizer my skin will break out within 2 days but not with this</li>
            <li> Sometimes i put a little extra and I still don&#x27;t break out like I would have when I use a regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have oily but dry skin</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, just helps it.  </li>
            <li> These products keep my face clear and fade past acne marks.</li>
            <li> Within the first few weeks of use, I stopped breaking out on my forehead, and then slowly my acne/pimples started to dissappear.</li>
            <li> but it does not really add anything to my face care process.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, you might try using another moisturizer with it as it&#x27;s not super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I put a lot of this on...about the size of a quarter which might seem like a alot especially with it&#x27;s consistency being like royal icing piped through a small tip, ( if you know what that&#x27;s like</li>
            <li> This lotion keeps my skin moisterized all day at work although my skin does look a little shiny the last few hours of the day; I have toning wipes for that.</li>
            <li> I used it religiously for at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> So for a year and a half I kept switching between products to get rid of my pimples with no luck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit thicker then</li>
            <li> Other moisturizers usually break my skin out, so I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> Lotion has a tendency to be greasy, but this product never makes my face feel greasy or dried out.</li>
            <li> It is a really small quantity for the price.  </li>
            <li> I still notice breakouts like usual and it did not help.</li>
            <li> ; I seriously looked like Tyrone Biggums in the two weeks that I used this product.</li>
            <li> Never was that bad when I was a teen</li>
            <li> This product is not great.  </li>
            <li> With those two i could feel it working without irritating my skin</li>
            <li> and it clumped once the two mad contact.</li>
            <li> but my acne wasn&#x27;t as bad as it is now for some reason I stopped using it .</li>
            <li> bad bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this thing is actually working. It&#x27;s the first time that something is helping reduce the acne.</li>
            <li> This product is not great.  It is a really small quantity for the price.  It does go on your face smoothly and feels silky but it does not really add anything to my face care process.  I finished the lotion and moved onto a different one and had no change in how my face feels or looks.  I think you can get a better product for less money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I started breaking out on my chin, cheeks and forehead two years ago (age 24). Never was that bad when I was a teen but my skin decided to change on me. So for a year and a half I kept switching between products to get rid of my pimples with no luck. It wasnt til last summer I finally got my cleansers down ( a 10% benzoyl bar soap and an oil free acne wash with charcoal by Garnier). With those two i could feel it working without irritating my skin but it still wasnt enough to really see a difference and I knew it had to do with my moisturizer. So I got this, and within a day I could tell that these helpes to calm my pimples down. Within the first few weeks of use, I stopped breaking out on my forehead, and then slowly my acne/pimples started to dissappear. I think it&#x27;s been over 6 months since using this but only within the last two months I realized I dont have anymore acne on my face! All I have left are scars. Whenever I stray away from this lotion, I end up with a pimple somewhere so I know for sure that this lotion is a big part of helping to clear my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I put a lot of this on...about the size of a quarter which might seem like a alot especially with it&#x27;s consistency being like royal icing piped through a small tip, ( if you know what that&#x27;s like haha) but it&#x27;s really just enough because it somewhat absorbs quite quickly. Sometimes i put a little extra and I still don&#x27;t break out like I would have when I use a regular moisturizer. This will not make you oily or shiny at all!</li>
            <li> Will not buy again. I used this once with the Rapid Clear Fade Gel and it clumped once the two mad contact. It never moisturized my face. All it did was give me awful &amp;#34;Dry skin wrinkles.&amp;#34; I seriously looked like Tyrone Biggums in the two weeks that I used this product. My sister used it as well and has also experienced the same symptoms I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We decided to switch back to our Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Lotion, which worked perfectly with the Fade gel and actually moisturized our face. Will definitely send this back.</li>
            <li> After nursing along my last tube of Neutrogena&#x27;s discontinued \\&quot;Clear Pore\\&quot; night time gel for ages, I decided to try this as a substitute. It&#x27;s the same medicine (salicylic acid) in the same amount (2%) and works in a similar way. Comparatively it&#x27;s cons are: it&#x27;s opaque, so you have to rub it in a lot to make it disappear (you have to use a pretty thick layer of it or it just won&#x27;t work), and it is scented, which I don&#x27;t like very much. However it&#x27;s pros are: it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin sticky like the Clear Pore did, and it isn&#x27;t as drying to the skin so you can use it more than once per day.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with it and will buy it in the three-pack next time.</li>
            <li> Works great! This is definitely the product I&#x27;ve been looking for. My skin is so smooth and it really helps to clear up any acne or pimples.</li>
            <li> It works OK but if it works for you Buy replacements ASAP!!!&lt;br /&gt;Never have any available or on Sale...</li>
            <li> I just had to say give it a try it really works to fade out you acne.  Love it ;)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find the stuff in the stores anymore or on the website. I prefer Clinique but I need a cheaper alternative. This fits the bill nicely! I have oily/sensitive skin with new spots appearing each week. This does a decent to good job controlling the blemishes.</li>
            <li> Tried it all (murad, proactive etc) and this cheap item worked better by far</li>
            <li> Definately aids in clearing up acne anywhere you put it, including parts of your body.. like I tend to put it on my upper shoulder blade areas where I have pimples there sometimes from my bra straps rubbing constantly.</li>
            <li> Works well without being too greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and cant live without it! I apply it to my face every morning and it makes my skin soft and smooth. Lotion has a tendency to be greasy, but this product never makes my face feel greasy or dried out. Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  I use it along with the Rapid Clear Fight and Fade Gel.  I can&#x27;t using benzoyl peroxide since it is too drying.  These products keep my face clear and fade past acne marks.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work.  Still have same amount of acne.</li>
            <li> this product works ok ,give it a chance to see what will happend to your skin remember it takes time to see the results.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products. This lotion keeps my skin moisterized all day at work although my skin does look a little shiny the last few hours of the day; I have toning wipes for that. It&#x27;s a little bit thicker then the Stress 3-in-1 product but I prefer that. I assume it&#x27;s working against the pimples because I have not had any in two weeks.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, with occasional acne (usually before that time of the month) on my cheeks and chin, and acne on my forehead. Most skin products are way too harsh for my skin, including the cleanser in this line. Other moisturizers usually break my skin out, so I decided to give this one a try. It isn&#x27;t too harsh, makes my skin soft, and seems to help with acne. My forehead looks better after using it twice a day for a week, and my monthly acne seemed to go away much quicker. It&#x27;s a bit pricey for the size, but it worked for me, so I&#x27;ll buy again. My pores also look a bit smaller. I have normal to combination skin. If you have dry skin, you might try using another moisturizer with it as it&#x27;s not super moisturizing. I use a facial sunscreen beneath it as this offers no protection.</li>
            <li> I have tried this lotion in the past and remember I liked it then but my acne wasn&#x27;t as bad as it is now for some reason I stopped using it . .I have been using neutrogena naturals moisturizer which I really liked but I needed something to help with my acne so I decided to give this a try again. .after about a week I could see an approvement, bumps are smaller and redness is going away I haven&#x27;t had any new break outs either . .when I usually use a new moisturizer my skin will break out within 2 days but not with this and I wanted to give up on salicylic acid products competely because it never works but my skin is so sensitive to other acne medications like benzoyl peroxide.  . But what I love most is how smooth my face looks and feels and stays moisturized all day I have oily but dry skin and it has helped so much already I even notice more even tone. . I can&#x27;t wait to see my results in a month. .I hope amazon never stops selling this!</li>
            <li> bad bad very bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not rapid, and it does nothing for acne, it doesn&#x27;t even moisturize. I used it religiously for at least 2 weeks. Nothing. I ended up throwing it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy any of the rapid clear products from Neutrogena is all I can say.</li>
            <li> Works well, you just need to apply 3 or 4 layers and or do not rub it in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather purchase the pricier products that actually work.  This did nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> You can just sometimes tell whether a product is doing something good to your skin or not in a few days. This is one of those facial products that I didn&#x27;t really notice an effect and didn&#x27;t care to retry it after a few applications. I still notice breakouts like usual and it did not help. It&#x27;s now sitting in my draw.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.  Says it is the only thing that works to moisturizes but keeps her face cleared too.</li>
            <li> I literally never write reviews but this product deserves it. I have oily skin and have suffered from acne for YEARS! I put this on after cleansing and toning my face morning and night. My skin has made an incredible improvement since using it. It has cleared my pores, and after a week, my skin is flawless! There is still some red scars on my face from previous blemishes but they are definitely starting to lessen. I would definitely recommend this product! It is seriously the best on the market!</li>
            <li> I am a 29 year old female and started using this when I was 21. It is by far the most amazing lotion EVER. I always suffered from acne prone skin and it&#x27;s also very sensitive. This helps keep my acne, blackheads and white heads at bay. It&#x27;s not greasy at all and absorbs quickly. I recommend this to all of my friends. I&#x27;ve tried several times to switch to wrinkle prevention creams because of my age and each time I break out. I always run back to this product and seems like I&#x27;ll have to always use it because it&#x27;s the only thing that doesn&#x27;t break my skin out! For a small price, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I think this product is terrific, have really noticed an improvement.  I must say, it works for me better than the much-more-expensive products I&#x27;ve been buying at Sephora (from clinique, peter thomas roth).  I am 38 years old and still suffer from acne breakouts quite frequently, and am always searching for something to help make that stop.  I think I&#x27;ve found a solution!  Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, just helps it.  Good stuff, hope they never discontinue it.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great!  Very light feeling on my skin.  I let my daughter try it and it has cleared up the bumps on her cheeks!  She is now using it every day.  We would highly recommend it!</li>
