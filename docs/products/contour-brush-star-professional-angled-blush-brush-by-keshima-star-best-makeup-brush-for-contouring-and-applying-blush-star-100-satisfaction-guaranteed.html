            <li>Very nice brush for a reasonable price, actually better then my Sigma angled blush brush because the bristles are a little more stiff for applying lighter shades of blush or bronzer.</li>
            <li>from you very soon!</li>
            <li>I do not use most of my angled brushes just for the fact that every one I have is to flimsy and does not give me enough control.</li>

            <li>a little to narrow  but good quality bristles</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and the bristles doesn&#x27;t fall out.</li>

I am a&lt;br /&gt;huge fan and because I love this brush so much I will be buying future&lt;br /&gt;products from you very soon!</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful. I have used it to apply my contouring powder to my face. The brush is soft and the bristles doesn&#x27;t fall out. It has the perfect angle to get under my cheek bones to apply my contouring powder. This brush is make of good quality materials and will hold up for long term use. The handle feels good in my hand so it make it that much easier to use. This contour brush is exceptional and I would recommend it. Sample received for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft. Just thought it would be a little bit bigger but maybe it&#x27;s sippsed to be small :)</li>
            <li> Like many women, I have a lot of makeup brushes. Even so, I like to have a few of each kind of brush.&lt;br /&gt;This is a really nice contour brush. I like to use it with either my bronzer or blush. It&#x27;s just the right size and shape for my face. It&#x27;s also a better quality brush than some of the brushes that I currenly have in my makeup bag. This brush has not shed at all, which is one of the main things that I always watch out for when picking my brushes. I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this contour brush in exchange for my unbiased review. No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush for a reasonable price, actually better then my Sigma angled blush brush because the bristles are a little more stiff for applying lighter shades of blush or bronzer. It is almost an exact copy of Sigma&#x27;s brush except for the stiffer bristles (density is the same). I do recommend for light blush/bronzer application.</li>
            <li> A very nice brush.  I use it basically for my highlighter.  No broken bristles left on my face so far - I would of liked it to be a little fuller but for the price &amp; what I use it for, it&#x27;s working out very good.</li>
            <li> I would have wanted the bristles on this brush to have a wider set span.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for applying your blush. Seems to hit all the right places with one swoop.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this brush! I can not say it enough! I do not use most of my angled brushes just for the fact that every one I have is to flimsy and does not give me enough control. This one does! Its dense and gives the perfect amount of control needed. I used it for my blush and was super shocked how well it applied it. Of course I was filming a GRWM when I first tried this so most of you will see my react completely to this product. It has cruelty free goat hair bristles and the stem is made incredible well. It does not shake or wiggle at all and there is absolutely no shedding. They undergo a seven step process to make sure they do not shed. I wish all brush manufacturers did that! I immediately wanted more brushes from this company the moment I used this brush. I have now tossed all my other angled brushes and only have this one. This is also a safe buy in my opinion since they have a complete money back guarantee! If you do not like the product, you can get your money back and that&#x27;s always a reassuring feeling! I don&#x27;t think any of you will have a problem fastly falling in love with their brushes though! Upon them being so well made and cruelty free, they are also very affordable and that is a huge plus in my book! Its amazing to have great quality brushes that you can actually afford to buy! I would highly recommend this product! I got this item free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review!</li>
            <li> Deff not the best brush</li>
            <li> Soft, good quality brush; easy to use and clean.. Just as good as any sephora brush, half the price-/ perfect for contouring</li>
            <li> I have so many makeup brushes ranging from the cheapest of cheap ($1. Elf brushes) to the most expensive (Up to $60- piece) and this brush fits in towards the upper range although it&#x27;s super affordable. I have experienced minimal shedding. It works great with my loose blush pigments. Picks up the perfect amount and applies in evenly and smoothly. Works great for blending and also for contouring too! Highly recommend it. I did receive this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Works great for achieving the perfect contour. I use it on my cheeks with a darker colored blush (dallas by benefit) or a matte bronzer. It accentuates my cheekbones and gives me a natural look.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot on high end named brushes and this one is equally great. i got the brush and I love it, It&#x27;s a great brush for the price and I like how the hairs don&#x27;t fall out...i prefer white bristles to see how much product im applying</li>
            <li> a little to narrow  but good quality bristles</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Keshima Makeup Brushes. This brush is super soft, full and doesn&#x27;t shed! It helps give me an even application. I use it daily for blush and contouring. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 3 weeks and even with daily use and cleaning it still hasn&#x27;t shed and remains soft. It is definitely a high quality makeup brush! I did receive this product discounted or free of charge in exchange for a review, however all opinions are 100% honest based on my own experience.</li>
            <li> Beautiful container I just receive this today I tried the brushes, they are so soft I love these brushes better than the brushes I currently have which was a lot  more expensive. So happy I bought this and also better price.</li>
            <li> Great item.  I might buy a couple more.</li>

            <li> Amazing brush!  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love the brush. Perfect for contouring very cheap too but a high end item! Brush is super soft also</li>
            <li> It was a good brush but when i cleaned it man did that ruin it. Used baby shampoo and now it stinks.</li>
            <li> Good quality, I use it to contour and is perfect size.</li>
            <li> Very good brush for contouring and may also be used for finishing powder. I also recommend this contouring set:  http://goo.gl/qYSwID  it comes with easy to follow instructions and good quality product too.</li>
