    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now, great stuff!</li>
            <li>GREAT stuff!</li>
            <li>non-drying was great.  </li>
            <li>This Nutribiotic product performs in that way better than any cleanser I&#x27;ve found since I started searching for the perfect cleanser in my teens 25 years ago.</li>
            <li>This product incorporates many wonderful skin-benefiting herbs and botanicals, and the added bonuses are panthenol and allantoin.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>This was also priced to make it a good buy.</li>
            <li>This product kills everything and is a wonderful way to keep an infection clean.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I have rosecea and this cleanser is very mild and very effective.</li>
            <li>It may not remove all makeup, so I follow up with a antisceptic astringent (my own concoction), rinse and apply an evening moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s a good product and my face looks healthy.</li>
            <li>This cleanser foams up quite nicely.</li>
            <li>I use to wash my face and it is very gentle and works great.</li>
            <li>I give this a 4 star because it leaves face not ph balance and its able to wash my eye makeup off.</li>
            <li>what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>Thank you Nutribiotic for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cleanser for years and am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>wonderful for ph balancing the female body!  </li>
            <li>I have many issues with UTI, Candida infections, etc..</li>
            <li>we both love it.    </li>
            <li>I suppose i could run it into the cloth more.  </li>
            <li>I have tried SO many soaps, and this is the one I prefer for the body.</li>
            <li>We were happy to find it through amazon at a much lower price than we did in health food stores.</li>
            <li>This probably gets most of any dirt, but does not remove oily film or residue.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The pump is great, very practical.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good and love the tingle after rinsed off.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li>Great product for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is also created without any comedogenic oils or butters, free of parabens, sulfates, colorings, cocamide DEA, chlorine derivatives, fragrances, preservatives, and all while being ph balanced, hypoallergenic, deep-cleaning but not stripping or drying -</li>
            <li>The scent is light.</li>
            <li>When I first tried this, I fell in love.  </li>
            <li>Face feels clean with no irritation.</li>
            <li>I like a thorough-feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>It is non-irritating and clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>For my easily irritated combination-oily skin I need cleanser to both clean and rinse really well AND not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive, lathers well, and one bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite face wash- very gentle, and leaves my skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>i am currently pregnant which has caused me to have more acne than a 12 year old boy.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference except perhaps not as much redness?</li>
            <li>This is great non-soap for people who don&#x27;t like harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Hope this info is useful.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish was that it was more readily available.</li>
            <li>There are a few other brands/washes that I love, but this is the best one I have come across that I can use long-term because it&#x27;s affordable!</li>
            <li>Right?</li>
            <li>While this is a non-irritating &#x27;cleanser,&#x27; it doesn&#x27;t actually clean very well.</li>
            <li>This product made a difference the first time I used it</li>
            <li>I actually think this cleans makeup off my face better than the Cetaphil did.  </li>
            <li>so glad that there are no dangerous chemicals in this product like other facial cleansers and even happier that it actually works better than anything i&#x27;ve ever tried before!!</li>
            <li>Having had sensitive skin my entire life, and wanting to eliminate as many toxins from my daily life, this cleanser is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased just the small bottle and did not have that problem, however, because I liked it</li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>For all the natural ingredients that go into this cleanser, a fragrant essential oil would have been nice.</li>
            <li>This is a gentle liquid soap (although the company calls it a &amp;#34;skin cleanser&amp;#34;) that you can use for your hands and body.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle on my rosacea/sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absorbing into my body so that all I can taste is citricidal.  </li>
            <li>I may put a few drops of my own just to add an aroma.</li>
            <li>My only thumbs down comment is that it does not smell pleasant.</li>
            <li>Although I will add, I do love Clearly Natural glycerine bar soaps, but Nutribiotic sensitive has been the only wash that I can use all-over, including my face.</li>
            <li>The problem with so many non-soap products is they don&#x27;t clean skin well enough and they&#x27;re not clean rinsing.</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal follower of Cerave for several years.</li>
            <li>Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash in a clear/white bottle with a red logo and red top.)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been re-ordering this product for several years, having very sensitive skin but still wanting a cleanser that will lather and make me feel clean afterward.</li>
            <li>I also use a few other products by them as well-- great company.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more drying than I&#x27;d like, but prefer the non soap product over others.</li>
            <li>but geez people, the stuff is being absorbed at such a high level</li>
            <li>I usually buy this from whole foods and it has a lovely minty scent from the herbs it&#x27;s made of.  </li>
            <li>Not as thick, or as effective.  </li>
            <li>I was worried at first that it left a residue after rinsing, but it does not.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or leave any strong lasting fragrances on my skin.</li>
            <li>However, recent batches have had an odd texture, more like clumpy gel.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a bottle directly from Nutribiotics in July 2014 and as of today&#x27;s date, I still have a little more than 1/4 of the cleanser left.</li>
            <li>the huge volcanoes on my face went down dramatically!</li>
            <li>Our purchase was clearly diluted.  </li>
            <li>I have highly sensitive skin, prone to stress-related and hormonal breakouts.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try Nutribiotic as it contains grapefruit seed extract, a natural anti-biotic, anti-inflammatory.</li>
            <li>Anyone with sensitive skin should give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Supposed to be for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Gave away to a friend who loves this product but hadn&#x27;t tried the sensitive one.</li>
            <li>The only place I can find it is on line, and sometimes, I don&#x27;t even have much luck there.</li>
            <li>I felt that it cleaned me just as well or nearly as well as Dial.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s been in the bottle for too long sitting in a hot Amazon warehouse?  </li>
            <li>Next time, i&#x27;ll buy from Whole Foods again.  </li>
            <li>My family has sensitive skin, so finding something that was hypoallergenic and</li>
            <li>The ingredients are natural and helpful with troubling skin dermatitis.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this gentle product for several years now.  </li>
            <li>It definitely was not weak.  </li>
            <li>Aside from being economical, this is the only cleanser I&#x27;ve tried thus far that has worked for my sensitive, African American skin.</li>
            <li>It is nearly 100% clear and it Barely foams.  </li>
            <li>I dont know if the acne/clarity is from using that soap (as well as a new cleanser especially for the face instead of Dial:</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this is the only body wash I have found which works for me without irritation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, and has a barely there scent.</li>
            <li>So far it works and my skin is bouncing back.</li>
            <li>On top of it I have found many natural-type non-soap products very bad for the shower drain with their tendency to gunk and build up.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry and hyper-sensitive skin, along with adult hormonal acne on my face.</li>
            <li>We have purchased from other outlets before and still had it around when this new bottle was opened.  </li>
            <li>It has been a little drying for me, leaving my skin tight after washing during the winter, but I use some sensitive skin lotion right after and all is well again.</li>

            <li> We have purchased from other outlets before and still had it around when this new bottle was opened.  </li>
            <li> It has been a little drying for me, leaving my skin tight after washing during the winter, but I use some sensitive skin lotion right after and all is well again.</li>
            <li> Later I noted that dry areas such as elbows still had dryness but over a [30%] smaller surface area.  </li>
            <li> So, it goes without saying it last a long time....</li>
            <li> Lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and is not particularly sudsy.  </li>
            <li> This soap contains a small amount of grapefruit seed extract, which is supposed to kill germs naturally.</li>
            <li> This bottle is larger than your average bottle of bathroom hand soap.</li>
            <li> I wish more brick and mortar stores carried it but the shipping for the gallon size wasn&#x27;t bad on the website I found.</li>
            <li> Meaning whatever they&#x27;re made of however gentle is clogging and does not rinse off the skin thoroughly, which in itself is irritating to skin.</li>
            <li> I am a huge grapefruit seed extract fan and was very sad to find that I didn&#x27;t like this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty tragic when your food and drinks taste bitter all the day long.  </li>
            <li> Upon switching to the Non-soap skin cleanser I immediately noticed that my skin looked slightly smoother.  </li>
            <li> did not clean by hands at all</li>
            <li> and once you are in that cycle, any little thing can set it off.</li>
            <li> I would like a little scent, so</li>
            <li> It dried my skin to the point that my skin was flaking off, even after 3 days of use.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff! I purchased a bottle directly from Nutribiotics in July 2014 and as of today&#x27;s date, I still have a little more than 1/4 of the cleanser left. So, it goes without saying it last a long time....well worth the money. Aside from being economical, this is the only cleanser I&#x27;ve tried thus far that has worked for my sensitive, African American skin. I use it on my face in the morning and evening. This cleanser does the trick without drying my oily/combination, acne prone skin. It may not remove all makeup, so I follow up with a antisceptic astringent (my own concoction), rinse and apply an evening moisturizer. Hope this info is useful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been re-ordering this product for several years, having very sensitive skin but still wanting a cleanser that will lather and make me feel clean afterward. It&#x27;s not oily, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, and has a barely there scent. Can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> People should try this. It does work!</li>
            <li> Our purchase was clearly diluted.  We have purchased from other outlets before and still had it around when this new bottle was opened.  Not as thick, or as effective.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good and love the tingle after rinsed off.  Takes care of oily skin.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I like this brand of non soap, but noticed an alcohol smell &amp; there isn&#x27;t alcohol listed in the ingredients.  It&#x27;s a little more drying than I&#x27;d like, but prefer the non soap product over others.</li>
            <li> I give this a 4 star because it leaves face not ph balance and its able to wash my eye makeup off.I will buy this again</li>
            <li> I am a huge grapefruit seed extract fan and was very sad to find that I didn&#x27;t like this cleanser.  It dried my skin to the point that my skin was flaking off, even after 3 days of use.  I had to return it.  :(</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this is the only body wash I have found which works for me without irritation. Also it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive, lathers well, and one bottle lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now, great stuff!</li>
            <li> The problem with so many non-soap products is they don&#x27;t clean skin well enough and they&#x27;re not clean rinsing. Meaning whatever they&#x27;re made of however gentle is clogging and does not rinse off the skin thoroughly, which in itself is irritating to skin. On top of it I have found many natural-type non-soap products very bad for the shower drain with their tendency to gunk and build up. For my easily irritated combination-oily skin I need cleanser to both clean and rinse really well AND not irritate my skin. (And not give my shower a slow drain!)  This Nutribiotic product performs in that way better than any cleanser I&#x27;ve found since I started searching for the perfect cleanser in my teens 25 years ago. I wish more brick and mortar stores carried it but the shipping for the gallon size wasn&#x27;t bad on the website I found.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and hyper-sensitive skin, along with adult hormonal acne on my face. This product incorporates many wonderful skin-benefiting herbs and botanicals, and the added bonuses are panthenol and allantoin. It is also created without any comedogenic oils or butters, free of parabens, sulfates, colorings, cocamide DEA, chlorine derivatives, fragrances, preservatives, and all while being ph balanced, hypoallergenic, deep-cleaning but not stripping or drying - what more could you ask for? GREAT stuff! Thank you Nutribiotic for such a wonderful product! I will probably be using this product for life, I hope it never changes! How come this stuff was never mentioned/suggested in all of my doctor and dermatologist visits over the years!? It beats ivory, sebamed, dove, aveeno, cetaphil, nivea, and neutrogena. Although I will add, I do love Clearly Natural glycerine bar soaps, but Nutribiotic sensitive has been the only wash that I can use all-over, including my face. There are a few other brands/washes that I love, but this is the best one I have come across that I can use long-term because it&#x27;s affordable!</li>
            <li> I have highly sensitive skin, prone to stress-related and hormonal breakouts. I have been a loyal follower of Cerave for several years. I thought I would try Nutribiotic as it contains grapefruit seed extract, a natural anti-biotic, anti-inflammatory. So far it works and my skin is bouncing back. My only thumbs down comment is that it does not smell pleasant. It smells downright undesirable. The only way to describe it is it smells industrial or sterile. For all the natural ingredients that go into this cleanser, a fragrant essential oil would have been nice. I may put a few drops of my own just to add an aroma. Otherwise it&#x27;s a good product and my face looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleanser for years and am pleased with it.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and is not particularly sudsy.  Anyone with sensitive skin should give it a try.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Supposed to be for sensitive skin.  Ugh.  Didn&#x27;t work for me - worse than soap!  Will not purchase again.  Gave away to a friend who loves this product but hadn&#x27;t tried the sensitive one.</li>
            <li> I have rosecea and this cleanser is very mild and very effective. I&#x27;m hooked. Face feels clean with no irritation. Good value. Lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> wonderful for ph balancing the female body!  I have many issues with UTI, Candida infections, etc.. and once you are in that cycle, any little thing can set it off. This is the only cleanser I have used in the nether regions for over 10 years and NO Problems!!!!!!!!!! I can&#x27;t reccomend it enough. And the pump lasts forever it seems!</li>
            <li> Having had sensitive skin my entire life, and wanting to eliminate as many toxins from my daily life, this cleanser is pretty nice. I would like a little scent, so I&#x27;ll buy the fruit scented one next time.  I&#x27;ve used the Nutribiotic Shower Gel for years, and finally decided to try the cleanser. I also use a few other products by them as well-- great company. This was also priced to make it a good buy.</li>
            <li> I have had sores on my skin for years and nothing that the doctor has given me has worked.  This product made a difference the first time I used it and my skin is clearing.  I use it with an oatmeal moisturizer.    I got some for my daughter in law and it is clearing her acne - we both love it.    This is the hypoallergenic type with aloe and GSE.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!  It is so gentle on my rosacea/sensitive skin. I was worried at first that it left a residue after rinsing, but it does not. It leaves your face feeling clean and soft.  I used to be a devotee of Cetaphil, but I wanted to get away from the sodium lauryl sulfates in it. I actually think this cleans makeup off my face better than the Cetaphil did.  I can&#x27;t see myself using another face wash in the future. The only thing I wish was that it was more readily available. The only place I can find it is on line, and sometimes, I don&#x27;t even have much luck there.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference except perhaps not as much redness? At any rate, it is the utter lack of concern for my face, and the fact that I haven&#x27;t noticed if it is working, tells me that it must be working, or I would have noticed that it WASN&#x27;T. Right? So I WILL buy it again.</li>
            <li> Am I the  only one that tastes this in their system?  It&#x27;s absorbing into my body so that all I can taste is citricidal.  Why would they put that in &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin formula.  It&#x27;s pretty tragic when your food and drinks taste bitter all the day long.  I had originally purchased just the small bottle and did not have that problem, however, because I liked it so well I ordered the gallon size from their webstore and the stuff is horrible and nothing like what I purchased from Whole foods.  What a disaster.  And my skin feels like parchment paper but the bottle I got from WF did not do that.  They must have a quality control standard to meet for it to be on a retailers shelf and their website just sells the left over that won&#x27;t pass the standards?  I&#x27;m speculating on this but geez people, the stuff is being absorbed at such a high level you feel like your blood is infected with bubbles of citricidal.</li>
            <li> I like a thorough-feeling clean.  I am used to using Dial antibacterial soap.  Upon switching to the Non-soap skin cleanser I immediately noticed that my skin looked slightly smoother.  Later I noted that dry areas such as elbows still had dryness but over a [30%] smaller surface area.  I also noticed that instead of my usual 6 or so zits per month, I had about 3.  I dont know if the acne/clarity is from using that soap (as well as a new cleanser especially for the face instead of Dial: Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash in a clear/white bottle with a red logo and red top.)  I felt that it cleaned me just as well or nearly as well as Dial.  It definitely was not weak.  I plan to re-order.  Oh, if you are wondering: the scent is extremely weak and I suppose it smells like a plant/being out in nature, plus a floral scent.&lt;br /&gt;.5 to 1 star off because:&lt;br /&gt;I wish the liquid was not so thin because sometimes some keeps dripping after I have pumped or it gets onto my wash cloth but then some of it falls off of the cloth or drips through before making it to my body (or a thin glob slides down my body.)  I suppose i could run it into the cloth more.  It is nearly 100% clear and it Barely foams.  So, I wish that it was easier to identify as well..so that if it drops it can be found again.  This is a small thing but something that could use some improving.</li>
            <li> i am currently pregnant which has caused me to have more acne than a 12 year old boy. after washing my face with this product only 2 times (!) the huge volcanoes on my face went down dramatically! i will definitely keep using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am a big fan of the nutribiotic grapefruit seed extract (use it in my neti pot and have had 0 sinus infections since starting it, whereas i used to have 3+/year). so glad that there are no dangerous chemicals in this product like other facial cleansers and even happier that it actually works better than anything i&#x27;ve ever tried before!!</li>
            <li> I usually buy this from whole foods and it has a lovely minty scent from the herbs it&#x27;s made of.  This one smells like... plastic or something?  I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s been in the bottle for too long sitting in a hot Amazon warehouse?  Not something I want to wash my face with.  Next time, i&#x27;ll buy from Whole Foods again.  Blech.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this, I fell in love.  My family has sensitive skin, so finding something that was hypoallergenic and non-drying was great.  However, recent batches have had an odd texture, more like clumpy gel.  It didn&#x27;t work as well for cutting grease, etc.  I&#x27;ve stopped buying this soap.</li>
            <li> This is great non-soap for people who don&#x27;t like harsh chemicals. I have tried SO many soaps, and this is the one I prefer for the body. Use it with a pouf, and you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I like it. I use to wash my face and it is very gentle and works great. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the only skin cleanser I use for showering now. I had horribly itchy skin (rash or fungus) and this product along with some other prescription products helped a lot. The ingredients have anti-fungal components. I am sticking with this product and definitely would recommend it. It is gentle and smells pleasant. The ingredients are natural and helpful with troubling skin dermatitis.</li>
            <li> did not clean by hands at all</li>
            <li> My husband has used this for many years but was unable to get it since moving to a rural area in the desert.  We were happy to find it through amazon at a much lower price than we did in health food stores.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite face wash- very gentle, and leaves my skin feeling clean. It has been a little drying for me, leaving my skin tight after washing during the winter, but I use some sensitive skin lotion right after and all is well again.</li>
            <li> Great product for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This product kills everything and is a wonderful way to keep an infection clean.</li>
            <li> While this is a non-irritating &#x27;cleanser,&#x27; it doesn&#x27;t actually clean very well. I needed something sinkside to remove dirt and oil from my hands before handling contact lenses or dressing wounds. This probably gets most of any dirt, but does not remove oily film or residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gentle product for several years now.  It is non-irritating and clean feeling.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle liquid soap (although the company calls it a &amp;#34;skin cleanser&amp;#34;) that you can use for your hands and body. I used up two bottles in a about two months as a hand soap, only using it occasionally on my face. The pump is great, very practical. The scent is light. This soap contains a small amount of grapefruit seed extract, which is supposed to kill germs naturally. This bottle is larger than your average bottle of bathroom hand soap. This cleanser foams up quite nicely. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or leave any strong lasting fragrances on my skin. I will be buying this again.</li>
