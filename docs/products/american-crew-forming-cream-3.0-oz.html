            <li>And not to mention it smells great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this before and it is a great product.</li>
            <li>I have medium length (2.5 inches) hair and this works great for styling my hair to the side.</li>
            <li>Great for Styling Hair and at a great price</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a lot at a time, so I get great mileage for the size you get</li>
            <li>great product for control and medium shine.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff with perfect shine and holding power.</li>
            <li>an this stuff holds great.</li>
            <li>I use it from hair lengths of 3/4 to almost 2 inches and get a great style and sustained hold.</li>
            <li>GREAT</li>
            <li>Look good while ffeling good, I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li>Very nice cream for shine and moulding.  </li>
            <li>Granted, I used it perhaps four or five times a week, but it is very effective and efficient.</li>
            <li>best texture, best smell, best natural look....</li>
            <li>Product works great and leaves a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>This gives me additional body and very good hold...smells nice too.</li>
            <li>this stuff looks amazing and lasts all day!  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say, I will never buy another!</li>
            <li>wet\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got him this cream and he couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it!</li>
            <li>His hair looks amazing and it smells so good!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li>it has a mildly pleasant chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent hold and washes off easily for me.  </li>
            <li>This is the best for people with fine hair too....</li>
            <li>Amazing price for a great product.</li>
            <li>When you buy the package it is almost as good as a two for one deal.</li>
            <li>Good hold without being too crunchy.</li>
            <li>Holds my hair in place, has a good consistency.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great forming cream, nice hold, not a greasy or crunchy finish.</li>
            <li>Smells good, isn&#x27;t too sticky but isn&#x27;t like putting lotion in your hair either.</li>
            <li>Not a lot of shine so good for work place as well.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair in place, it smells good, and it is non-greasy.</li>
            <li>Its a good balance of hold and look.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>This product works great and even has a nice fragrance too it.</li>
            <li>what product is good for what hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Get my hair fairly damp, work the Fiber in, and it would give me good hold...</li>
            <li>And the Fiber is fairly sticky...</li>
            <li>so your hair needs to be fairly damp to work it in, but then it doesn&#x27;t want to stay</li>
            <li>Good product, will buy again.</li>
            <li>Good hold without leaving hair greasy or shiny.</li>
            <li>Probably good for shorter hair, but the product did not suit me.</li>
            <li>The package and shipping was good.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Its smell good but it won&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>Looks good and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
            <li>It provides good hold that lasts all day</li>
            <li>but yet it has good holding power.</li>
            <li>Gives a good matte finish to my hair, which I wanted to begin with.</li>
            <li>Gives good hold.</li>
            <li>Holds great and makes hair look nice not crunchy like gel.</li>
            <li>Styles nicely, holds GREAT.</li>
            <li>Although I spend time doing my hair and this product is very easy to work with and gives a great result.</li>
            <li>This forming cream has a great light odor, nothing over powering and the product itself works great.</li>
            <li>Quick and perfect.</li>
            <li>find that it works best on towel-dried hair, using a finger&#x27;s worth of product (imprecise, I know--maybe a mL or two).</li>
            <li>so obviously I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I got this for my boyfriend and he is very pleased with it, and so am I!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I m very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>Great product and much more convenient ordering it from Amazon  than waiting for my hairdresser to order it.</li>
            <li>love the hold and great scent</li>
            <li>Most of all it works wonders for me!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>personally I love this!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect and it&#x27;s exactly what is says it is.</li>
            <li>smells great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Holding power is great but not as strong as the grooming cream.</li>
            <li>This one smells more like a pleasant lotion and doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;greaser&amp;#34; look to your hair,</li>
            <li>This gel is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>but it turned out that the cream is really amazing if you use it together with the fiber.</li>
            <li>Nice hold and no flakes like gel.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice hold and shine to hair without adding any stiffness.</li>
            <li>I ended up with 2 pea-sized dabs, one on each finger, that I would then warm with my hands and work through my hair.</li>
            <li>This holds well, smells nice and does the job.</li>
            <li>Nice hold.</li>
            <li>Nice scent to it.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice waxy cream texture.</li>
            <li>For me, that shinier look is nice if I&#x27;m going to a wedding, or dressing up...that sort of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you pull the front of your hair up (kind of like a spike) but it doesn&#x27;t give you the greasy or shiny look.</li>
            <li>I used some Davines No. 2 for Wizards from a salon for a while and liked that</li>
            <li>My review title is my honest assessment of what this feels like.</li>
            <li>Makes his hair nice without being overly gel like.</li>
            <li>Really great and unique....</li>
            <li>This stuff is great - not just because it holds your hair in place, but more important because it washes out effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Smells great and you can form your hair what ever way you want, plus when it drys your hair is soft and looks great.</li>
            <li>a strong hold which is good in this application.</li>
            <li>It smells good, but doesn&#x27;t hold strongly.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price, holds strong throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I think it smells pretty good!  </li>
            <li>Great for medium length hair, easy to use, not too sticky, comes off easy and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Finding it on Amazon for this price was great, and I bought a couple years&#x27; worth to offset the shipping cost.  </li>
            <li>This forming cream is the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li>love this prodcuct and honestly will mention its pros and cons because it does has its cons!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Forming Cream is by far the best &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is the most effective stuff I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Product works great right after I get my haircut</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband, he was almost out of last container &amp; was very happy to see I bought more!</li>
            <li>Great stuff smells great consistancy is great and makes it feel not greesy or to hard in your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>perfect for short hair men</li>
            <li>This stuff is perfect for holding my hair short and spiky.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Great deal, it is the real stuff.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I have also found Fiber to hold hair in place much better while remaining pliable all day.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used to style my hair.</li>
            <li>and I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wax + spray is good when im going out and doing something more exciting</li>
            <li>/&gt;What would work better for me:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright if you want to just control unruly hair (probably better with almost nonexistant amount + some water + hair dryer though).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the L&#x27;Oreal Out of Bed texturiser that I bought.</li>
            <li>The best part is that you don&#x27;t need a lot to keep your hair in place for the entire day.</li>
            <li>I used Paul Mitchel gel for many many years...</li>
            <li>I tended to use more</li>
            <li>glad to find it online</li>
            <li>and this Forming Cream from Crew is one of the better products.  </li>
            <li>All hair products have some scent to them, I am glad that this one is not flowery or fruity</li>
            <li>Pomade leaves hair glossy looking, this is more greasy looking.  </li>
            <li>is my most favorite.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It smells even better, is easier to rub onto hands and apply to hair.</li>
            <li>Make sure you do your research on the product you need for your hair.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is quite possibly the best hair styling product I have used.</li>
            <li>I love it :)</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li>American Crew nailed the formula for the perfect hold, sheen, and durability.</li>
            <li>What more can I say.</li>
            <li>I like this one better than the fiber.</li>
            <li>I was once a hair model, and have had multiple stylists as well as barbers, as well as people not in the hair industry tell me that my hair is magnificent.</li>
            <li>I just love</li>
            <li>Before I used the Axe products before it and this is way better.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump your hair together like gel, or give the greasy appearance of most gels.</li>
            <li>This product was just OK for me.  </li>
            <li>Holds all day, and doesn&#x27;t flatten out when wearing headphones most of the day.</li>
            <li>, this is probably one of the best hair products for men with short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>This works great for styling my hair, and you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li>I used wax for a bit in college, but this is so much better.  </li>
            <li>Now the pomade has much more</li>
            <li>But I think this is my favorite -</li>
            <li>Mostly fragrance</li>
            <li>Best all around hair product I have ever used over the last 25 years.</li>
            <li>After trying many types of forming creams, I like this one a lot.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll find that it gets the job done even better than this.</li>
            <li>Since it is waterbased it isn&#x27;t as permanent as the Molding Clay, which is what I moved to, but I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Some people love it</li>
            <li>RUBBER\\&quot; is so appropriate as it moves with your hair.</li>
            <li>I have medium to short hair and this product is perfect.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried alternatives (mostly in the name of saving a buck) like Suave styling paste and Tabac cream.</li>
            <li>but I am 110% satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product well over 2 years now and love it.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves this product and the price on Amazon is so much better than buying it at Floyd&#x27;s Barbershop.</li>
            <li>Reduces frizz without otherwise being able to tell it is there.</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I prefer the AXE line of hair cream / pomade better.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a GREAT product and I will order again!</li>
            <li>American CREW is the best!  </li>
            <li>Perfect middle ground.</li>
            <li>It feels more creamier than the grooming cream which feels like greasy wax or lard.</li>
            <li>......would buy again when I need more.</li>
            <li>and it acutally hides my thinning bald spot at the top of my head.</li>
            <li>I tried this &#x27;Forming Cream&#x27; hoping that it would be more like the Davines.  </li>
            <li>3 0unces lasted more than 3 months.</li>
            <li>better than crew body.</li>
            <li>and I still haven’t found anything better for my hair.</li>
            <li>Authentic forming cream.  </li>
            <li>(I have about inches of hair on top of my undercut).</li>
            <li>Would hae paid more in the store for it.  </li>
            <li>If the right amount is used it will have a great hold and leave you hair with a natural look and almost no shine which is great</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and this cream thickens it up and makes it so easy to style.</li>
            <li>WOW, I never thought I&#x27;d find a product that makes my hair LOOK SO GOOD!  </li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Great hair product for fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>It works best when you put it in while the hair is dry.</li>
            <li>Works best with dry hair.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, not too strong.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product but make sure to rinse your hand with water because the cream itself is really sticky</li>
            <li>It does a great job of holding hair still and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>This was very surprising to me given that American Crew Fiber is a 10/10 product.</li>
            <li>Glad you had it available.</li>
            <li>Forming Cream is the primary product I use for my hair and have been using it for many years now.</li>
            <li>Great product at far lower price than retail</li>
            <li>It does do a good job of holding the hair throughout the whole day.</li>
            <li>I love the powder fresh smell and the way it makes his hair form without hardening his hair when it is set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!</li>
            <li>easy to sculpt and use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only styling product I&#x27;ve found that has a perfectly creamy texture and moves my hair where I want it without being too powerful.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and keeps your hair in place.</li>
            <li>Easy 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I found it on Amazon and it was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>This product is great unless you want your hair style to last more than an hour.  </li>
            <li>(it rinses out easily in the shower if that is a concern).</li>
            <li>Washing it is easy.</li>
            <li>, im sure you would be happy with the end results if YOU HAVE SHORT HAIR.</li>
            <li>Does not leave residue in your hair and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although it is mostly for asians, the smell is much nicer, the hold is AMAZING for being PLIABLE.</li>
            <li>Not only does it have a light hold and keeps your hair from feeling &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;, but it also smells incredible.</li>
            <li>It washes out easily</li>
            <li>Washes out easy</li>
            <li>This cream makes it easy to style and doesn&#x27;t leave any &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; like sprays do.</li>
            <li>This stuff takes care of that, its almost the consistency of lotion and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>If I get into some strong winds or work has me scratching my head</li>
            <li>Best forming cream out there, hands down</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non greasy, doesn&#x27;t crust up or flake, has a nice masculine smell and washes out very easily.</li>
            <li>Works well on fine hair.</li>
            <li>Smell is fine too.</li>
            <li>so it works fine for me.</li>
            <li>Product is not too strong or light for hold.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the very first product I ever used before realizing there is better stuff out there.</li>
            <li>Soft hold, good scent and easy to work with</li>
            <li>This is very easy to use and gets consistent results.</li>
            <li>Light weight cream that is low sheen and great hold.  </li>
            <li>Great product, I&#x27;ve used it for several years.</li>
            <li>your a guy and have medium short hair this stuff is great</li>
            <li>styles hair great, adding just enough shine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you want to sculp hair with no obvious shine.</li>
            <li>Only product ever used works great</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of this great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great buy, and amazon always has the cheapest price over the local stores anyway.</li>
            <li>I have not found anything like this product and trust me my cabinet is filled with $20+ salon grade styling products.</li>
            <li>You might want to finish with a light hairspray.</li>
            <li>I have short, curly hair and it keeps it looking great</li>
            <li>This is great for when my hair is short and I style it in a fohawk.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years - it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and I don&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
            <li>They smell great, and they are relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Regardless of the mistake I decided to experiment and found the product worked fabulous with the style of my hair.</li>
            <li>It works great, actually.  </li>
            <li>lasts the whole day and makes my hair shiny and nice.</li>
            <li>This is great to use if you&#x27;re looking to style your hair with a &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; type hold that doesn&#x27;t harden like a lot of the white glue hair</li>
            <li>Works best if blow dried after applied.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely fantastic forming cream.</li>
            <li>This smells great, just like all the American Crew products.</li>
            <li>Clean and washes from your hands easy</li>
            <li>It seems to have good control so far though.</li>
            <li>I recently moved to using this after using Crew Pomade for years, I like this much better, though I loved the pomade as well.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is very good in comparison to other places where I&#x27;ve seen it on sale.</li>
            <li>Very, very useful, and very, very fun to use.</li>
            <li>For example, you can have your hair fairly damp with the stickier (ie high hold) products, and still be able to work it in really well.</li>
            <li>I found fiber to work best the shorter my hair was, but even then it was a super strong and stiff hold.  </li>
            <li>I have a full head of hair but my hair is fine and can sometimes be frizzy.</li>
            <li>Also - it is SUPER strong.</li>
            <li>I know that good products usually cost good money, but get a tube of groom &amp; clean on here or at the grocery store for a couple bucks</li>
            <li>smells is great love the smell, it smells so soft and natural</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t count on this to make your hair \\&quot;shiny\\&quot; but it definitely works amazing for styling!  </li>
            <li>Pretty much my favorite gel.</li>
            <li>decided to leave the rest of my original review below.</li>
            <li>I had a lot more hair, and because it&#x27;s a \\&quot;higher hold,\\</li>
            <li>I accidentially bought it instead of the original target:</li>
            <li>The only problem I ran into is that straight out of the box it smells very good but is overpowering.</li>
            <li>My fave is still Paul Mitchell Clean Cut.</li>
            <li>I can easily clean it up with a pocket comb.</li>
            <li>The tub I got smelled pleasant enough (sort of vanilla like)</li>
            <li>some might need specially</li>
            <li>For my medium-length hair, it has the best hold without getting hard like hair gel or hair spray.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But it is designed this way,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and works perfectly for my hard hair which always a pain to keep a style.</li>
            <li>I love so much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So if you are looking for a good hold opt for American Crew Fiber instead!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good product but can act different depending on how you use</li>
            <li>It makes my wavy fizzy hair, straight and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Nice hold without the old school shine.</li>
            <li>and it gets warm and soft?</li>
            <li>This forming cream offers a nice alternative to gel that creates a spiky look</li>
            <li>I have been using Crew Forming Cream for more that 2 years, and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>At first it was sticky and didn&#x27;t blend in easily, and it made my hands sticky</li>
            <li>It has brought me the most consistent styling so far; I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fresh and clean too.</li>
            <li>I love the way the defining paste smells, matte looks nice, and it&#x27;s super easy to get that messy but controlled look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ordered this product and delivery was really quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different ones, but I pick this one my favorite.</li>
            <li>A quick comb and a part</li>
            <li>Top of hair style is blended to have enough to part on top.  </li>
            <li>It also has a nice medium shine and smells so much better than 99% of other hair products that you&#x27;d find on the shelves.</li>
            <li>though, quick to set the desired look, has a strong hold, and still keeps it so someone can easily run their fingers through it that can be quickly fixed with a comb.</li>
            <li>All of the American Crew hair creams are good, I&#x27;ve tried them all, but the forming cream is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s new barber recommended this and we absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I think I found my new favorite hair product.  </li>
            <li>I typically use Fiber to provide great body and style to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I can keep my hair looking dry and still maintain good hold.</li>
            <li>Funny how the process changes over time!</li>
            <li>I look so hot with this stuff in my hair!  </li>
            <li>Lucky, Amazon make it right</li>
            <li>your hair stays put, but isn&#x27;t hard or shiny looking afterwards and looks very good.</li>
            <li>Thought the American Crew Fiber was solid, smelled good too but the Forming Cream is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>Worth the price for me.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It has a good amount of shine without being too wet.</li>
            <li>Always have liked American Crew Products.</li>
            <li>Fiber is more waxy and this is soft like paste.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and does not leave flakes like most products.</li>
            <li>Just some more control over natural looking hair.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>Of all the hair products I have tried so far, this is my favorite one.  </li>
            <li>Pricey but worth the cash.</li>
            <li>but this one is by far the best one, it gives your hair a sleek shiny look, whilst giving it a firm hold, basically making it possible to make any kind of hairstyle you want.</li>
            <li>far as the hold goes specifically, I tried the product for well over a week, and never was I able to keep my hair from falling over longer than 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Still a good enough hold without nearly as much shine.</li>
            <li>Experiment and have fun,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better then the axe natural look cream.</li>
            <li>For the price, it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>This goop keeps my dome piece as fresh as Don Draper.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this, as I don&#x27;t like the look many other products left in my hair.</li>
            <li>- it was light, not very noticeable, and washed out very easily.  </li>
            <li>I will occasionally use Fiber for a bit more hold and a different look, but it tends to sweat out more easily than the Forming Cream</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of gloss and hold for my medium length hair.</li>
            <li>Being water-based as well means it washes right out, even without shampooing.</li>
            <li>Seems to be just right - not too sticky, but gets the job done</li>
            <li>Hopefully my experience will point you in the right direction.</li>
            <li>For me, it did not look right at all.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll leak right through the screw threads.</li>
            <li>The price was right at AMAZON too....</li>
            <li>Great natural look all day long.</li>
            <li>I have used many different products over the years (from many different salons, cheap stuff from WalMart, etc.)</li>
            <li>Apply when hair is slightly damp for best shaping and hold, only takes a dime sized dollop for medium length mens haircut.</li>
            <li>I find that it works best when applied to wet hair, although I have used it on dry hair along with a splash of water to help spread the cream through my hair.  </li>
            <li>remember: you must apply the cream on a dry hair for best results;;; won&#x27;t work if your hair is still wet....</li>
            <li>Crew Forming Cream works great, as a small amount - two pee sized drops for medium length hair</li>
            <li>First off, I rarely write a review for a product.</li>
            <li>It has a lasting effect and and I can easily wash it out when I shower!</li>
            <li>I wanted a little more spike and \\&quot;verticalness\\&quot; to my hair, so what I had to do was start drying it more.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the Forming Cream is more liquidity and is easy to apply in any weather condition</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and quick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used four different American Crew wax/pomades, and they are all great.</li>
            <li>My hair feels healthy and not dry.</li>
            <li>American Crew Forming Cream has been described as medium hold &amp; medium shine, and this is very accurate.</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair that is poofy, therfore styling can be a bit problematic at times.</li>
            <li>/&gt;HOWEVER, the smell is very much the smell of a barbershop, like the smell of talcum powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very straight, shorter hair</li>
            <li>Great hair cream that will hold your hair nice and smooth without the stiff look of hard gel.</li>
            <li>It does not make it rock hard, it&#x27;s clean, smells good etc.</li>
            <li>i will say to me is low to medium hold I need to use an extra product for hold or use hairspray to keep my hair in place because this cream kind of melts in our hair and does not give you that strong hold</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good gift for the guy who likes a little body cream.</li>
            <li>I was leaving my hair fairly damp, and putting the pomade into that didn&#x27;t give it much hold at all (though depending the style you want...like a more traditional mad men kind of look without a lot of spike, then that would be fine).</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite hair gel, gives it a nice wet look and at the same time the cream is easy to manipulate</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This did exactly that.  </li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More accessable at local stores</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t exactly have</li>
            <li>Remember to check the options before you buy, there are lot more types of these for specific hair types.</li>
            <li>However it was a bit more unruly to use than on my short hair</li>
            <li>I use American Cream Forming Cream and love it of anything else out on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend checking it out at target or your local beauty store before buying on amazon to make sure you like it.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I ever purchased online.</li>
            <li>I tried many different products, especially the cheaper end ones and found most made my hair look too shinny or greasy.</li>
            <li>Says alot from this seller when i was sent 2 of the smaller cointainers that cost more instead of just saying that they are out.</li>
            <li>American Crew also makes difi distruct, which is the same product but with a better smell (imo, but I think most would agree).    </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t used to this at first.</li>
            <li>But before you give up on any one product, vary the dampness of your hair first.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well!  </li>
            <li>Overall I have used this gel now for over a year and love it.</li>
            <li>, it looks more like a matte low shine when the product dries.</li>
            <li>First look at the picture of the item I received and what is for first thought of it?</li>
            <li>These are OK but can&#x27;t rep;ace the American Crew product.</li>
            <li>Definitely will be buying more from here instead of the stores.</li>
            <li>It gave me a headache at first when I used it.</li>
            <li>It provides a consistent look day to day.</li>
            <li>expect that I will get a few months of good use out of this container.</li>
            <li>But Forming cream is really good for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Keeps a good firm hold without looking too shinny.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, I&#x27;ve used many other including American Crew</li>
            <li>Have tried several other products and this is the best that I have had so far.</li>
            <li>After commenting on other reviews I have te pleasure to make my own review on this item which I bought here in Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not to mention it smells so clean and professional</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my long-time stylist to add more style-ability to my short, straight hair.</li>
            <li>Really good product for both sexes, especially for short hair.</li>
            <li>the years i have tried a few other high end hair products and have been happy with some but at $30 bucks it wasn&#x27;t that much better then</li>
            <li>A lot of products have a pretty intense smell at application, but this product’s smell lingers throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and my boyfriend uses it everyday.</li>
            <li>It keeps your hair &#x27;workable&#x27; as long as you don&#x27;t go to sleep, at which point you&#x27;ll need to shower to regain control :)</li>
            <li>Also, I agree with the other commentors, you only need like two fingertips worth to get a good amount of hold.</li>
            <li>Here in NYC, finding American Crew products is easy...</li>
            <li>The 3 oz size will last me about 5-6 months easily.</li>
            <li>I am then able to dry then curl my hair into place.  </li>
            <li>Forming cream is less effective when over-worked into hair.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and one container lasts me 8-10 months, so it is worth the little extra you pay.  </li>
            <li>I have short, fine hair and it is getting thinner.  </li>
            <li>When it comes to amount, even when my hair was very long, I didn&#x27;t need much, I would just lightly run my index and middle fingers over the top to the product.</li>
            <li>That stuff is REALLY sticky...which is fine for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kept my hair in shape for a whole day and smells nice too with little flaking.</li>
            <li>so I can reapply like ten times in the morning, and keep looking hot hot hot!</li>
            <li>It is true that this product is great in shaping hair without being too greasy, stiff, or other problems.  </li>
            <li>You only need to lightly dip one finger and spread it around your hands, this stuff gets real sticky and the smallest amounts will cover medium length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>great product that works well with my hair since I am losing my hair in the last few years.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;VERY highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Works like expected and smells much better than the competing creams.  </li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced for how much you get though.</li>
            <li>Use too much and your hair will probably end up looking greasy/wet.</li>
            <li>I love my wet hair</li>
            <li>and then I have to use too much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It will look and feel like you haven&#x27;t applied enough, but once your hair dries it will be held lightly in place.</li>
            <li>(very &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really enjoy the smell or the texture of it and was recommended to this product by a friend who works at a local barber shop here in Columbus.</li>
            <li>However, I can’t really stand the smell at all.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how much I use, THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK.</li>
            <li>When your hair is damp after the shower get a finger tip amount (play around with it to see how much you like), rub it in your hands and then run all through hair.</li>
            <li>But lets be real, if you want your girl to run your hands through it....  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this daily now for a few years and simply put: this is the best.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to use much for it to work.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t think anything else does either.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the smell of the product.  </li>
            <li>I received my order in a very timely manner.  </li>
            <li>The hold becomes even MORE pronounced, but it also becomes harder to work into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need much of it</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still much cheaper than the fancier salon brands.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and product was a advertised.</li>
            <li>The product works as advertised, I was very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a side note it takes a while to get used to how much to use for your hair.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>I really like the sheen of this stuff</li>
            <li>good product to help control my crazy hair a bit better</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product...been searching for a cream that would hold constantly all day long.</li>
            <li>Far superior to stiff gels.  </li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re ready to shower it washes out quickly and easily, leaving little detectable residue.</li>
            <li>Looks very natural if you put it in your hair when it&#x27;s dry and if you want more of a shiny look put it in when it&#x27;s damp.</li>
            <li>Much better than other brands.</li>
            <li>You can get the exact amount you need because its almost a compound texture but a little more creamy.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve used every other product under the sun, here is why you would love AC Forming</li>
            <li>- I use less than a dime&#x27;s worth for a fluffy, textured, awesome look to my short hair.</li>
            <li>A small dab works perfectly for my thick head of hair and provides the right amount of hold throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Works well, not too much shine, decent hold.</li>
            <li>I saw this sternly, and it really catches them off guard, and they usually end up telling me that I have really nice hair regardless.</li>
            <li>long worked fine...</li>
            <li>Apart from that minor detail, it smells good (in no way overwhelming) and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Any product designed to hold your hair a certain way is going to be leave a residue and make your hair stiffer than normal.  </li>
            <li>was the high shine and depending on how much used, greasy feel to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Just the right amount and is the same product as the one my room mate bought from the grocery store at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>It holds his hair in shape without the dreaded tacky shine that many other products, even high dollar products, do.  </li>
            <li>It will not dry out and get white and flaky like many products.</li>
            <li>Also I usually go to the gym at the end of the day and work up a pretty good sweat, the product doesn&#x27;t cause any discomfort and holds relatively well even though there is a lot of sweat</li>
            <li>With almost daily use, the 3 ounce jar is still 1/4 full after nine months.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is that it smells like an OLD MAN.</li>
            <li>definitely love the way it sits in my hair, doesn&#x27;t get real stiff or super shiny like a gel.</li>
            <li>I found the product to live up to the advertisement!</li>
            <li>: less is more.</li>
            <li>Again, use WAY less than you think you need, it isn&#x27;t mostly water like hair gel.</li>
            <li>of Imperial classic pomade coming &amp; hoping that works.</li>
            <li>This particular hair cream describes itself as medium hold</li>
            <li>It has a decent hold.</li>
            <li>To the multiple positive reviews of this product, let me start with, what product were you using, because it certainly wan&#x27;t this one?!  </li>
            <li>Then, to keep my hair from being as flat, I would add just a tiny bit more after my hair was dry again, that would work through just fine now that there was cream already in my hair.  </li>
            <li>If you have fine hair and are trying to give yourself a \\&quot;Mad Men\\&quot; type style but want to skip the greasiness, this is a good product.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t put much in my hair at all - just barely get a bit on the end of one finger - but it always seems like too much.  </li>
            <li>The cream used to be a great in between for those not wanting a complete slick back that most other pomades give, but also want some control and staying power while looking somewhat natural.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>to fast&lt;br /&gt;Turns into oil if tempeture is high</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you don&#x27;t like using gel or mousse.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t even have the high hold forming cream on the company site</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s highly adaptable.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it for any high hold styles, though.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone.  </li>
            <li>Highly recomended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>it never just stays flat or where I want it to go, mostly looks like a big puff ball.</li>
            <li>Has a great smell and isn&#x27;t too firm like other pomades or waxes that make your hair like feel like concrete.</li>
            <li>When I went a little longer that got a little intense, so on the advice of my barber I switched over to the Forming Cream and it worked great.</li>
            <li>, I just wish it had a little more stiffness to it</li>
            <li>After cutting my hair to a much shorter 3\\&quot; in length, I was able to use the cream to help form my hair into just about any style I wanted (much like Pomade) - without my hair looking shiny or feeling greasy (provided you didn&#x27;t use too much, which is easy to do when you&#x27;re still going through the learning curve).  </li>
            <li>To fix this I simply left the lid off for a couple of hours (not too long you don&#x27;t want it to dry out) and then it still had its pleasant scent without being so overpowering.</li>
            <li>All of the Crew products are great, so you can&#x27;t really go wrong with any of them.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot of it and it can hold very well with natural shine.</li>
            <li>I find the &#x27;Forming Cream&#x27; to be far too fragrant, and it feels very greasy in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I use this forming cream everyday and I love it.</li>
            <li>I normally have my hair parted and bangs pushed up and over...</li>
            <li>This allowed me to kill the friz that normally plaques my hair.</li>
            <li>Efron/ Justin Bieber with it being short on the sides and long on top,</li>
            <li>It smells good, is not sticky after a few minutes, and it doen&#x27;t take long to set.</li>
            <li>smelled good enough that girls always compliment me and usually end up sniffing my hair.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price of it here on Amazon compared to going to the normal beauty supply or markets that charge almost $18...not including tax.  </li>
            <li>The scent is defintely not overwhelming, in fact it&#x27;s pretty mild, which is exactly what I want in a hair cream.  </li>
            <li>I am a 38 year old man and have very fine hair, and when I use mousse or gel, my hair tends to get very brittle and stiff, and doesn&#x27;t look natural.  </li>
            <li>On short hair right now.</li>
            <li>This sh!t right here is like handing a business card that simply says “I&#x27;ll call you.”</li>
            <li>Now, I blow dry my hair bone dry, and then use the defining paste (matte, and holds good with just a tiny spritz of hairspray).</li>
            <li>Obviously some funny chemical reaction going on there, and it wasn&#x27;t too noticeable (so no 4-star demotion), but probably worth mentioning for those of you who wear sunglasses with white plastic frames.</li>
            <li>they couldn&#x27;t accept a refund on a brand new, unopened item.</li>
            <li>I can live with it.</li>
            <li>I used gel for years,until a stylist put some of this stuff in my new &#x27;do.  </li>
            <li>Done are the days of cheap gel, imitation creams, and budget pomades.</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft.</li>
            <li>but I personally think the Defining Paste is awesome for matte, and forming cream if you want a little bit of shine (but it&#x27;s harder to work into your bone dry hair, and doesn&#x27;t smell as good).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I called around to our local salons, and this size container consistently runs $17-23.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair looking natural and not over-styled!</li>
            <li>I had long hair prior (6 months growth so past my ears), and this stuff worked great too at giving a Matte look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a personal preference on the smell, it&#x27;s pretty pungent.</li>
            <li>Soft to the touch and no clumps or flakes!</li>
            <li>I started trying their Fiber product on that short hair, and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>After reading all these stellar reviews I was convinced to purchase this product, American Crew Forming Cream.</li>
            <li>Significantly cheaper than Target and other stores.</li>
            <li>only thing I would caution is that I had a pair of Original Penguin sunglasses with a white plastic frame which started to turn pinkish along the stems which were in contact with my hair.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re still on the fence, give one of the smaller sizes a try first.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, allows for a little movement through the day and not greasy.</li>
            <li>One cool thing is: if you wear a hat, usually that would mess up your hair for the entire day while using gel or hairspray, but with Crew, you can easily fix it right to where you had it before!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for those men who still want some movement within their hair or who have light, less dense hair.</li>
            <li>I was attempting to buy American Crew Fiber, and mistakenly purchased the Forming Cream because the color on the main photo of this listing is very blueish, which is the color of the Fiber, and not green, the color of the Forming Cream.</li>
            <li>Great for guys with thick hair that tends to poof, gives weight that keeps the hair down.</li>
            <li>Holds great, but doesn&#x27;t look too slick or get too stiff.</li>
            <li>it actually took to long to get here and by that time I was actually using another product that is far better.</li>
            <li>It gives flexible control, not stiff or &amp;#34; hard&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>but it ain&#x27;t no plain jane.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I will be getting me the American Crew Grooming cream which is for high shine and high hold</li>
            <li>I have short hair and was expecting a little more shine.</li>
            <li>much lighter and easier to work with for a semi natural look with medium / short hair.</li>
            <li>(i don&#x27;t have a lot of hair), which surprised me</li>
            <li>I was dubious with reviews that say use two fingers (especially two pea size dabs, really?), but tried a couple of fingers anyway.</li>
            <li>Come to think of it, it probably would last a whole year.</li>
            <li>I think Axe does a similar job at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>Im 30 years old and after showering and drying my hair</li>
            <li>Just a natural looking product that looks like you just stepped out of the hair salon.</li>
            <li>Everything appeared to be in order when I received it, however when I use it it does not hold near as well as the identical one I purchased at the Barber.</li>
            <li>People tell me I sometimes use too much gel in my hair, and I reply that I actually use a forming cream.</li>
            <li>Moderate shine, for modern hair styles.</li>
            <li>I also have some left over forming cream, and it works really well too, just gives the hair a shinier look.</li>
            <li>blow dry the hair in the front up, blow dry the rest totally dry, put some defining paste in my palm, rub my hands together vigorously and warm it up, and then work it into my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will probably have to try a couple different products until you find the one you really like.</li>
            <li>I use this along with LS&amp;B Disorder to give me the old and the shine I desire.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my absolute last resort for styling my hair.</li>
            <li>WHY WOULD ANY COMPANY MAKE A HAIR PRODUCT THAT SMELLS LIKE OLD MAN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I need to keep it professional.</li>
            <li>But I have longish hair up front (1960s style) and I want a natural looking hold.</li>
            <li>American Crew makes a few different kinds but this one is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>IT WORKS-AND ITS NOT MESSY</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair looking and feeling natural.  </li>
            <li>I hate gel, this is perfect</li>
            <li>good, but too expensive</li>
            <li>Even the best smell will become an annoying odor if I have to breath it throughout the day.</li>
            <li>If your hair isn&#x27;t as thick you&#x27;ll be able to throw this in and not have to worry for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>Plain and simple, its cheaper on Amazon and works better than competing brands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I move onto the Pomade, the other thing to consider is...varying the dampness of your hair prior to the product will have a HUGE effect on how it works.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty sweet, but you have to keep in mind that a very small amount of this goes a mile.</li>
            <li>You put this into your hair either dry or damp, and it will not do anything but lay there and be greasy, while making you smell like a Super Clips for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very mild musky masculine initially, but is not noticeable after a little while; so, it works for women.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for medium to fine hair and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have fairly thin hair and style it for a &amp;#34;business look&amp;#34; with a lot of curvature and clean lines and used to need a lot of time in the morning to fix it just right.</li>
            <li>It has a subtle, elegant fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what hair styles this product would be used for as I most likely will never use it.  </li>
            <li>my hair really short, I was using their \\&quot;classic wax,\\&quot; which they no longer make.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair short, almost like a buzz and usually let it grow longer so that I can comb it over (by longer I&#x27;m talking 4-5 inches on the top, sometimes more).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice forming cream for someone who has long or thick hair.</li>
            <li>It adds texture, and is good enough for shaping when their hair is short, but when it grows out the hold is weak and at the end of the day their hair is in greasy bed-head mode.</li>
            <li>For short hair, use the high hold products with damp hair.</li>
            <li>wanted a certain hold for my hair which didn&#x27;t look shiny or wet, and feels soft and natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been overpaying for too long / thanks amazon [...]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the classic Palmade before: it was okay, but I was looking for something a bit less &#x27;heavy&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>If either product is shipped when it&#x27;s too hot outside or left in a hot car, the ingredients will break down and it will be ruined.</li>
            <li>&quot; my hair in the direction I want, and to get it much drier (not 100% dry, but maybe 75%).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Depending on how much you use/how often, this can dry out before you use all of</li>
            <li>Much easier to style dry hair with this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great natural smell&lt;br /&gt;Great natural low to medium shine</li>
            <li>only complaint is that is is not a glossy look, but more of a greasy look.  </li>
            <li>It allows you to play with your hair later in the day with a light shine and firm hold.</li>
            <li>I admit that I don&#x27;t know much about styling hair, so maybe I just chose the wrong product; based on the description I was expecting a better match for my needs.</li>
            <li>I swirl it around and get just the right amount to control my wily cowlick plus a little extra to give my fine hair a little texture.</li>
            <li>little dab goes a long way and it washes out easily.</li>
            <li>I wish American Crew brought back their high hold &amp; natural shine forming cream.</li>
            <li>I typically put a dime sized amount into towel dried hair and then either let it air dry or blow dry it, either way it looks great.</li>
            <li>I have gone to about 5 different local stores looking for this particular hair gel and</li>
            <li>I have to use considerably less of this than other products I&#x27;ve paid more for and gotten lesser results.</li>
            <li>For other styles you can put this in dry or wet and it will keep your hair from sticking out all over the place and gives your hair a healthy shine.</li>
            <li>I am a very high maintenance individual that spends countless hours in perfecting my overall appearance.</li>
            <li>The other positive reviews were correct.</li>
            <li>I take a dime-size amount on my finger, rub it over all my fingers and run my fingers through my hair in the general direction</li>
            <li>careful how much you use otherwise</li>
            <li>only thing my dog will try and lick my hair if he gets near my head</li>
            <li>There have been numerous times when women will ask to feel my hair and tell me how soft it is.</li>
            <li>Holds very well, but keep in mind your hair should be as dry as possible if getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I use this stuff regularly with fine thick hair and it works well until hairs length gets to be beyond 3 to 4 inches</li>
            <li>I had to put it close to the AC for few hours to get it back to normal shape, it did helped but the cream is also creamy and it melts fast but still is usable</li>
            <li>All AC products are great, but it will be a waste if you buy the wrong product.</li>
            <li>One thing to keep in mind if you purchase this product is to always place the lid on after using so it does not dry out.</li>
            <li>It also will never dry, so</li>
            <li>Not too shiny, not too weak, not too strong.</li>
            <li>sent the exact same product that was in the store except there was a sticker on the lid that peeled away at half the cover when I took it</li>
            <li>Item is exactly the same as I bought in salons and department stores but for a lot less.  </li>
            <li>I just barely cover the tip of my pointer finger and that&#x27;s enough for me.</li>
            <li>reeived this item few days after paying for it and it arrived pretty melted</li>
            <li>As I aforementioned, I do have thin hair so for some people, applying more might be necessary.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and straight (thanks, Asian genetics!)</li>
            <li>You must be very careful when handeling this gel as if you use to much it will make your hair look white, sticky, spikey and unnatural.</li>
            <li>It goes in sticky but after about 30 minutes that feeling goes away, it stays soft to the touch, gives a nice firm but not too firm, medium hold, little bit of a shine, and some texture.</li>
            <li>While the product doesn’t hold my stubborn Asian hair up, it does a decent job at giving texture and a bit of fluff.</li>
            <li>cream came almost oily due to the high temp.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much near your scalp or it could dry your skin.  </li>
            <li>Try applying it when the hair is already a bit dry so you can have a natural and brighter hair.</li>
            <li>(I do this when my hair is modestly damp, after it&#x27;s mostly dry after a shower).</li>
            <li>I have slightly wavy hair, not stick straight or curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have extremely thick which grows really quickly.</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair and this stuff works to style it.</li>
            <li>If you want your hair a little more pasted down and wet looking</li>
            <li>This product gives my hair volume and holds it in place with a dry look, whereas gel causes the hair to stick together and appears thinner than it really is with a wet look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using American Crew Forming Cream for a few years now, and I love that it holds my hair in place without being clumpy or hard (like gel).  </li>

            <li> And not to mention it smells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have medium length (2.5 inches) hair and this works great for styling my hair to the side.</li>
            <li> Great for Styling Hair and at a great price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot at a time, so I get great mileage for the size you get</li>
            <li> great product for control and medium shine.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff with perfect shine and holding power.</li>
            <li> an this stuff holds great.</li>
            <li> I use it from hair lengths of 3/4 to almost 2 inches and get a great style and sustained hold.</li>
            <li> GREAT</li>
            <li> Look good while ffeling good, I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> Very nice cream for shine and moulding.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I used it perhaps four or five times a week, but it is very effective and efficient.</li>
            <li> best texture, best smell, best natural look....</li>
            <li> Product works great and leaves a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This gives me additional body and very good hold...smells nice too.</li>
            <li> this stuff looks amazing and lasts all day!  </li>
            <li> and I can honestly say, I will never buy another!</li>
            <li> wet\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got him this cream and he couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it!</li>
            <li> His hair looks amazing and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> it has a mildly pleasant chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent hold and washes off easily for me.  </li>
            <li> This is the best for people with fine hair too....</li>
            <li> Amazing price for a great product.</li>
            <li> When you buy the package it is almost as good as a two for one deal.</li>
            <li> Good hold without being too crunchy.</li>
            <li> Holds my hair in place, has a good consistency.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great forming cream, nice hold, not a greasy or crunchy finish.</li>
            <li> Smells good, isn&#x27;t too sticky but isn&#x27;t like putting lotion in your hair either.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of shine so good for work place as well.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair in place, it smells good, and it is non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Its a good balance of hold and look.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> This product works great and even has a nice fragrance too it.</li>
            <li> what product is good for what hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Get my hair fairly damp, work the Fiber in, and it would give me good hold...</li>
            <li> And the Fiber is fairly sticky...</li>
            <li> so your hair needs to be fairly damp to work it in, but then it doesn&#x27;t want to stay</li>
            <li> Good product, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good hold without leaving hair greasy or shiny.</li>
            <li> Probably good for shorter hair, but the product did not suit me.</li>
            <li> The package and shipping was good.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Its smell good but it won&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Looks good and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
            <li> It provides good hold that lasts all day</li>
            <li> but yet it has good holding power.</li>
            <li> Gives a good matte finish to my hair, which I wanted to begin with.</li>
            <li> Gives good hold.</li>
            <li> Holds great and makes hair look nice not crunchy like gel.</li>
            <li> Styles nicely, holds GREAT.</li>
            <li> Although I spend time doing my hair and this product is very easy to work with and gives a great result.</li>
            <li> This forming cream has a great light odor, nothing over powering and the product itself works great.</li>
            <li> Quick and perfect.</li>
            <li> find that it works best on towel-dried hair, using a finger&#x27;s worth of product (imprecise, I know--maybe a mL or two).</li>
            <li> so obviously I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend and he is very pleased with it, and so am I!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I m very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Great product and much more convenient ordering it from Amazon  than waiting for my hairdresser to order it.</li>
            <li> love the hold and great scent</li>
            <li> Most of all it works wonders for me!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> personally I love this!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect and it&#x27;s exactly what is says it is.</li>
            <li> smells great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Holding power is great but not as strong as the grooming cream.</li>
            <li> This one smells more like a pleasant lotion and doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;greaser&amp;#34; look to your hair,</li>
            <li> This gel is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> but it turned out that the cream is really amazing if you use it together with the fiber.</li>
            <li> Nice hold and no flakes like gel.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice hold and shine to hair without adding any stiffness.</li>
            <li> I ended up with 2 pea-sized dabs, one on each finger, that I would then warm with my hands and work through my hair.</li>
            <li> This holds well, smells nice and does the job.</li>
            <li> Nice hold.</li>
            <li> Nice scent to it.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice waxy cream texture.</li>
            <li> For me, that shinier look is nice if I&#x27;m going to a wedding, or dressing up...that sort of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you pull the front of your hair up (kind of like a spike) but it doesn&#x27;t give you the greasy or shiny look.</li>
            <li> I used some Davines No. 2 for Wizards from a salon for a while and liked that</li>
            <li> My review title is my honest assessment of what this feels like.</li>
            <li> Makes his hair nice without being overly gel like.</li>
            <li> Really great and unique....</li>
            <li> This stuff is great - not just because it holds your hair in place, but more important because it washes out effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Smells great and you can form your hair what ever way you want, plus when it drys your hair is soft and looks great.</li>
            <li> a strong hold which is good in this application.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but doesn&#x27;t hold strongly.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price, holds strong throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I think it smells pretty good!  </li>
            <li> Great for medium length hair, easy to use, not too sticky, comes off easy and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Finding it on Amazon for this price was great, and I bought a couple years&#x27; worth to offset the shipping cost.  </li>
            <li> This forming cream is the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li> love this prodcuct and honestly will mention its pros and cons because it does has its cons!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Forming Cream is by far the best &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective stuff I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Product works great right after I get my haircut</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband, he was almost out of last container &amp; was very happy to see I bought more!</li>
            <li> Great stuff smells great consistancy is great and makes it feel not greesy or to hard in your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> perfect for short hair men</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect for holding my hair short and spiky.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Great deal, it is the real stuff.  </li>
            <li> Outstanding product.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I have also found Fiber to hold hair in place much better while remaining pliable all day.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used to style my hair.</li>
            <li> and I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wax + spray is good when im going out and doing something more exciting</li>
            <li> /&gt;What would work better for me:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright if you want to just control unruly hair (probably better with almost nonexistant amount + some water + hair dryer though).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the L&#x27;Oreal Out of Bed texturiser that I bought.</li>
            <li> The best part is that you don&#x27;t need a lot to keep your hair in place for the entire day.</li>
            <li> I used Paul Mitchel gel for many many years...</li>
            <li> I tended to use more</li>
            <li> glad to find it online</li>
            <li> and this Forming Cream from Crew is one of the better products.  </li>
            <li> All hair products have some scent to them, I am glad that this one is not flowery or fruity</li>
            <li> Pomade leaves hair glossy looking, this is more greasy looking.  </li>
            <li> is my most favorite.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It smells even better, is easier to rub onto hands and apply to hair.</li>
            <li> Make sure you do your research on the product you need for your hair.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is quite possibly the best hair styling product I have used.</li>
            <li> I love it :)</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> American Crew nailed the formula for the perfect hold, sheen, and durability.</li>
            <li> What more can I say.</li>
            <li> I like this one better than the fiber.</li>
            <li> I was once a hair model, and have had multiple stylists as well as barbers, as well as people not in the hair industry tell me that my hair is magnificent.</li>
            <li> I just love</li>
            <li> Before I used the Axe products before it and this is way better.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump your hair together like gel, or give the greasy appearance of most gels.</li>
            <li> This product was just OK for me.  </li>
            <li> Holds all day, and doesn&#x27;t flatten out when wearing headphones most of the day.</li>
            <li> , this is probably one of the best hair products for men with short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> This works great for styling my hair, and you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li> I used wax for a bit in college, but this is so much better.  </li>
            <li> Now the pomade has much more</li>
            <li> But I think this is my favorite -</li>
            <li> Mostly fragrance</li>
            <li> Best all around hair product I have ever used over the last 25 years.</li>
            <li> After trying many types of forming creams, I like this one a lot.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll find that it gets the job done even better than this.</li>
            <li> Since it is waterbased it isn&#x27;t as permanent as the Molding Clay, which is what I moved to, but I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Some people love it</li>
            <li> RUBBER\\&quot; is so appropriate as it moves with your hair.</li>
            <li> I have medium to short hair and this product is perfect.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried alternatives (mostly in the name of saving a buck) like Suave styling paste and Tabac cream.</li>
            <li> but I am 110% satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product well over 2 years now and love it.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves this product and the price on Amazon is so much better than buying it at Floyd&#x27;s Barbershop.</li>
            <li> Reduces frizz without otherwise being able to tell it is there.</li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I prefer the AXE line of hair cream / pomade better.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a GREAT product and I will order again!</li>
            <li> American CREW is the best!  </li>
            <li> Perfect middle ground.</li>
            <li> It feels more creamier than the grooming cream which feels like greasy wax or lard.</li>
            <li> ......would buy again when I need more.</li>
            <li> and it acutally hides my thinning bald spot at the top of my head.</li>
            <li> I tried this &#x27;Forming Cream&#x27; hoping that it would be more like the Davines.  </li>
            <li> 3 0unces lasted more than 3 months.</li>
            <li> better than crew body.</li>
            <li> and I still haven’t found anything better for my hair.</li>
            <li> Authentic forming cream.  </li>
            <li> (I have about inches of hair on top of my undercut).</li>
            <li> Would hae paid more in the store for it.  </li>
            <li> If the right amount is used it will have a great hold and leave you hair with a natural look and almost no shine which is great</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this cream thickens it up and makes it so easy to style.</li>
            <li> WOW, I never thought I&#x27;d find a product that makes my hair LOOK SO GOOD!  </li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Great hair product for fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> It works best when you put it in while the hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Works best with dry hair.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, not too strong.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product but make sure to rinse your hand with water because the cream itself is really sticky</li>
            <li> It does a great job of holding hair still and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> This was very surprising to me given that American Crew Fiber is a 10/10 product.</li>
            <li> Glad you had it available.</li>
            <li> Forming Cream is the primary product I use for my hair and have been using it for many years now.</li>
            <li> Great product at far lower price than retail</li>
            <li> It does do a good job of holding the hair throughout the whole day.</li>
            <li> I love the powder fresh smell and the way it makes his hair form without hardening his hair when it is set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!</li>
            <li> easy to sculpt and use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only styling product I&#x27;ve found that has a perfectly creamy texture and moves my hair where I want it without being too powerful.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and keeps your hair in place.</li>
            <li> Easy 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I found it on Amazon and it was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is great unless you want your hair style to last more than an hour.  </li>
            <li> (it rinses out easily in the shower if that is a concern).</li>
            <li> Washing it is easy.</li>
            <li> , im sure you would be happy with the end results if YOU HAVE SHORT HAIR.</li>
            <li> Does not leave residue in your hair and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it is mostly for asians, the smell is much nicer, the hold is AMAZING for being PLIABLE.</li>
            <li> Not only does it have a light hold and keeps your hair from feeling &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;, but it also smells incredible.</li>
            <li> It washes out easily</li>
            <li> Washes out easy</li>
            <li> This cream makes it easy to style and doesn&#x27;t leave any &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; like sprays do.</li>
            <li> This stuff takes care of that, its almost the consistency of lotion and goes on easily.</li>
            <li> If I get into some strong winds or work has me scratching my head</li>
            <li> Best forming cream out there, hands down</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non greasy, doesn&#x27;t crust up or flake, has a nice masculine smell and washes out very easily.</li>
            <li> Works well on fine hair.</li>
            <li> Smell is fine too.</li>
            <li> so it works fine for me.</li>
            <li> Product is not too strong or light for hold.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the very first product I ever used before realizing there is better stuff out there.</li>
            <li> Soft hold, good scent and easy to work with</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use and gets consistent results.</li>
            <li> Light weight cream that is low sheen and great hold.  </li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve used it for several years.</li>
            <li> your a guy and have medium short hair this stuff is great</li>
            <li> styles hair great, adding just enough shine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you want to sculp hair with no obvious shine.</li>
            <li> Only product ever used works great</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this great product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great buy, and amazon always has the cheapest price over the local stores anyway.</li>
            <li> I have not found anything like this product and trust me my cabinet is filled with $20+ salon grade styling products.</li>
            <li> You might want to finish with a light hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have short, curly hair and it keeps it looking great</li>
            <li> This is great for when my hair is short and I style it in a fohawk.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years - it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and I don&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
            <li> They smell great, and they are relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Regardless of the mistake I decided to experiment and found the product worked fabulous with the style of my hair.</li>
            <li> It works great, actually.  </li>
            <li> lasts the whole day and makes my hair shiny and nice.</li>
            <li> This is great to use if you&#x27;re looking to style your hair with a &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; type hold that doesn&#x27;t harden like a lot of the white glue hair</li>
            <li> Works best if blow dried after applied.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely fantastic forming cream.</li>
            <li> This smells great, just like all the American Crew products.</li>
            <li> Clean and washes from your hands easy</li>
            <li> It seems to have good control so far though.</li>
            <li> I recently moved to using this after using Crew Pomade for years, I like this much better, though I loved the pomade as well.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is very good in comparison to other places where I&#x27;ve seen it on sale.</li>
            <li> Very, very useful, and very, very fun to use.</li>
            <li> For example, you can have your hair fairly damp with the stickier (ie high hold) products, and still be able to work it in really well.</li>
            <li> I found fiber to work best the shorter my hair was, but even then it was a super strong and stiff hold.  </li>
            <li> I have a full head of hair but my hair is fine and can sometimes be frizzy.</li>
            <li> Also - it is SUPER strong.</li>
            <li> I know that good products usually cost good money, but get a tube of groom &amp; clean on here or at the grocery store for a couple bucks</li>
            <li> smells is great love the smell, it smells so soft and natural</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t count on this to make your hair \\&quot;shiny\\&quot; but it definitely works amazing for styling!  </li>
            <li> Pretty much my favorite gel.</li>
            <li> decided to leave the rest of my original review below.</li>
            <li> I had a lot more hair, and because it&#x27;s a \\&quot;higher hold,\\</li>
            <li> I accidentially bought it instead of the original target:</li>
            <li> The only problem I ran into is that straight out of the box it smells very good but is overpowering.</li>
            <li> My fave is still Paul Mitchell Clean Cut.</li>
            <li> I can easily clean it up with a pocket comb.</li>
            <li> The tub I got smelled pleasant enough (sort of vanilla like)</li>
            <li> some might need specially</li>
            <li> For my medium-length hair, it has the best hold without getting hard like hair gel or hair spray.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But it is designed this way,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and works perfectly for my hard hair which always a pain to keep a style.</li>
            <li> I love so much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you are looking for a good hold opt for American Crew Fiber instead!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good product but can act different depending on how you use</li>
            <li> It makes my wavy fizzy hair, straight and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Nice hold without the old school shine.</li>
            <li> and it gets warm and soft?</li>
            <li> This forming cream offers a nice alternative to gel that creates a spiky look</li>
            <li> I have been using Crew Forming Cream for more that 2 years, and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> At first it was sticky and didn&#x27;t blend in easily, and it made my hands sticky</li>
            <li> It has brought me the most consistent styling so far; I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fragrance is fresh and clean too.</li>
            <li> I love the way the defining paste smells, matte looks nice, and it&#x27;s super easy to get that messy but controlled look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ordered this product and delivery was really quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different ones, but I pick this one my favorite.</li>
            <li> A quick comb and a part</li>
            <li> Top of hair style is blended to have enough to part on top.  </li>
            <li> It also has a nice medium shine and smells so much better than 99% of other hair products that you&#x27;d find on the shelves.</li>
            <li> though, quick to set the desired look, has a strong hold, and still keeps it so someone can easily run their fingers through it that can be quickly fixed with a comb.</li>
            <li> All of the American Crew hair creams are good, I&#x27;ve tried them all, but the forming cream is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s new barber recommended this and we absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I think I found my new favorite hair product.  </li>
            <li> I typically use Fiber to provide great body and style to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I can keep my hair looking dry and still maintain good hold.</li>
            <li> Funny how the process changes over time!</li>
            <li> I look so hot with this stuff in my hair!  </li>
            <li> Lucky, Amazon make it right</li>
            <li> your hair stays put, but isn&#x27;t hard or shiny looking afterwards and looks very good.</li>
            <li> Thought the American Crew Fiber was solid, smelled good too but the Forming Cream is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> Worth the price for me.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It has a good amount of shine without being too wet.</li>
            <li> Always have liked American Crew Products.</li>
            <li> Fiber is more waxy and this is soft like paste.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and does not leave flakes like most products.</li>
            <li> Just some more control over natural looking hair.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Of all the hair products I have tried so far, this is my favorite one.  </li>
            <li> Pricey but worth the cash.</li>
            <li> but this one is by far the best one, it gives your hair a sleek shiny look, whilst giving it a firm hold, basically making it possible to make any kind of hairstyle you want.</li>
            <li> far as the hold goes specifically, I tried the product for well over a week, and never was I able to keep my hair from falling over longer than 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Still a good enough hold without nearly as much shine.</li>
            <li> Experiment and have fun,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better then the axe natural look cream.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> This goop keeps my dome piece as fresh as Don Draper.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this, as I don&#x27;t like the look many other products left in my hair.</li>
            <li> - it was light, not very noticeable, and washed out very easily.  </li>
            <li> I will occasionally use Fiber for a bit more hold and a different look, but it tends to sweat out more easily than the Forming Cream</li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of gloss and hold for my medium length hair.</li>
            <li> Being water-based as well means it washes right out, even without shampooing.</li>
            <li> Seems to be just right - not too sticky, but gets the job done</li>
            <li> Hopefully my experience will point you in the right direction.</li>
            <li> For me, it did not look right at all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll leak right through the screw threads.</li>
            <li> The price was right at AMAZON too....</li>
            <li> Great natural look all day long.</li>
            <li> I have used many different products over the years (from many different salons, cheap stuff from WalMart, etc.)</li>
            <li> Apply when hair is slightly damp for best shaping and hold, only takes a dime sized dollop for medium length mens haircut.</li>
            <li> I find that it works best when applied to wet hair, although I have used it on dry hair along with a splash of water to help spread the cream through my hair.  </li>
            <li> remember: you must apply the cream on a dry hair for best results;;; won&#x27;t work if your hair is still wet....</li>
            <li> Crew Forming Cream works great, as a small amount - two pee sized drops for medium length hair</li>
            <li> First off, I rarely write a review for a product.</li>
            <li> It has a lasting effect and and I can easily wash it out when I shower!</li>
            <li> I wanted a little more spike and \\&quot;verticalness\\&quot; to my hair, so what I had to do was start drying it more.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the Forming Cream is more liquidity and is easy to apply in any weather condition</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and quick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used four different American Crew wax/pomades, and they are all great.</li>
            <li> My hair feels healthy and not dry.</li>
            <li> American Crew Forming Cream has been described as medium hold &amp; medium shine, and this is very accurate.</li>
            <li> I have very straight hair that is poofy, therfore styling can be a bit problematic at times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;HOWEVER, the smell is very much the smell of a barbershop, like the smell of talcum powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very straight, shorter hair</li>
            <li> Great hair cream that will hold your hair nice and smooth without the stiff look of hard gel.</li>
            <li> It does not make it rock hard, it&#x27;s clean, smells good etc.</li>
            <li> i will say to me is low to medium hold I need to use an extra product for hold or use hairspray to keep my hair in place because this cream kind of melts in our hair and does not give you that strong hold</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good gift for the guy who likes a little body cream.</li>
            <li> I was leaving my hair fairly damp, and putting the pomade into that didn&#x27;t give it much hold at all (though depending the style you want...like a more traditional mad men kind of look without a lot of spike, then that would be fine).</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hair gel, gives it a nice wet look and at the same time the cream is easy to manipulate</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This did exactly that.  </li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More accessable at local stores</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t exactly have</li>
            <li> Remember to check the options before you buy, there are lot more types of these for specific hair types.</li>
            <li> However it was a bit more unruly to use than on my short hair</li>
            <li> I use American Cream Forming Cream and love it of anything else out on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend checking it out at target or your local beauty store before buying on amazon to make sure you like it.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I ever purchased online.</li>
            <li> I tried many different products, especially the cheaper end ones and found most made my hair look too shinny or greasy.</li>
            <li> Says alot from this seller when i was sent 2 of the smaller cointainers that cost more instead of just saying that they are out.</li>
            <li> American Crew also makes difi distruct, which is the same product but with a better smell (imo, but I think most would agree).    </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t used to this at first.</li>
            <li> But before you give up on any one product, vary the dampness of your hair first.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well!  </li>
            <li> Overall I have used this gel now for over a year and love it.</li>
            <li> , it looks more like a matte low shine when the product dries.</li>
            <li> First look at the picture of the item I received and what is for first thought of it?</li>
            <li> These are OK but can&#x27;t rep;ace the American Crew product.</li>
            <li> Definitely will be buying more from here instead of the stores.</li>
            <li> It gave me a headache at first when I used it.</li>
            <li> It provides a consistent look day to day.</li>
            <li> expect that I will get a few months of good use out of this container.</li>
            <li> But Forming cream is really good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Keeps a good firm hold without looking too shinny.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I&#x27;ve used many other including American Crew</li>
            <li> Have tried several other products and this is the best that I have had so far.</li>
            <li> After commenting on other reviews I have te pleasure to make my own review on this item which I bought here in Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not to mention it smells so clean and professional</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my long-time stylist to add more style-ability to my short, straight hair.</li>
            <li> Really good product for both sexes, especially for short hair.</li>
            <li> the years i have tried a few other high end hair products and have been happy with some but at $30 bucks it wasn&#x27;t that much better then</li>
            <li> A lot of products have a pretty intense smell at application, but this product’s smell lingers throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and my boyfriend uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> It keeps your hair &#x27;workable&#x27; as long as you don&#x27;t go to sleep, at which point you&#x27;ll need to shower to regain control :)</li>
            <li> Also, I agree with the other commentors, you only need like two fingertips worth to get a good amount of hold.</li>
            <li> Here in NYC, finding American Crew products is easy...</li>
            <li> The 3 oz size will last me about 5-6 months easily.</li>
            <li> I am then able to dry then curl my hair into place.  </li>
            <li> Forming cream is less effective when over-worked into hair.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell and one container lasts me 8-10 months, so it is worth the little extra you pay.  </li>
            <li> I have short, fine hair and it is getting thinner.  </li>
            <li> When it comes to amount, even when my hair was very long, I didn&#x27;t need much, I would just lightly run my index and middle fingers over the top to the product.</li>
            <li> That stuff is REALLY sticky...which is fine for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kept my hair in shape for a whole day and smells nice too with little flaking.</li>
            <li> so I can reapply like ten times in the morning, and keep looking hot hot hot!</li>
            <li> It is true that this product is great in shaping hair without being too greasy, stiff, or other problems.  </li>
            <li> You only need to lightly dip one finger and spread it around your hands, this stuff gets real sticky and the smallest amounts will cover medium length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> great product that works well with my hair since I am losing my hair in the last few years.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;VERY highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Works like expected and smells much better than the competing creams.  </li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced for how much you get though.</li>
            <li> Use too much and your hair will probably end up looking greasy/wet.</li>
            <li> I love my wet hair</li>
            <li> and then I have to use too much.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It will look and feel like you haven&#x27;t applied enough, but once your hair dries it will be held lightly in place.</li>
            <li> (very &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really enjoy the smell or the texture of it and was recommended to this product by a friend who works at a local barber shop here in Columbus.</li>
            <li> However, I can’t really stand the smell at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how much I use, THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK.</li>
            <li> When your hair is damp after the shower get a finger tip amount (play around with it to see how much you like), rub it in your hands and then run all through hair.</li>
            <li> But lets be real, if you want your girl to run your hands through it....  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this daily now for a few years and simply put: this is the best.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to use much for it to work.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t think anything else does either.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the smell of the product.  </li>
            <li> I received my order in a very timely manner.  </li>
            <li> The hold becomes even MORE pronounced, but it also becomes harder to work into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need much of it</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still much cheaper than the fancier salon brands.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and product was a advertised.</li>
            <li> The product works as advertised, I was very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a side note it takes a while to get used to how much to use for your hair.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I really like the sheen of this stuff</li>
            <li> good product to help control my crazy hair a bit better</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product...been searching for a cream that would hold constantly all day long.</li>
            <li> Far superior to stiff gels.  </li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re ready to shower it washes out quickly and easily, leaving little detectable residue.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural if you put it in your hair when it&#x27;s dry and if you want more of a shiny look put it in when it&#x27;s damp.</li>
            <li> Much better than other brands.</li>
            <li> You can get the exact amount you need because its almost a compound texture but a little more creamy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used every other product under the sun, here is why you would love AC Forming</li>
            <li> - I use less than a dime&#x27;s worth for a fluffy, textured, awesome look to my short hair.</li>
            <li> A small dab works perfectly for my thick head of hair and provides the right amount of hold throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Works well, not too much shine, decent hold.</li>
            <li> I saw this sternly, and it really catches them off guard, and they usually end up telling me that I have really nice hair regardless.</li>
            <li> long worked fine...</li>
            <li> Apart from that minor detail, it smells good (in no way overwhelming) and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Any product designed to hold your hair a certain way is going to be leave a residue and make your hair stiffer than normal.  </li>
            <li> was the high shine and depending on how much used, greasy feel to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Just the right amount and is the same product as the one my room mate bought from the grocery store at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> It holds his hair in shape without the dreaded tacky shine that many other products, even high dollar products, do.  </li>
            <li> It will not dry out and get white and flaky like many products.</li>
            <li> Also I usually go to the gym at the end of the day and work up a pretty good sweat, the product doesn&#x27;t cause any discomfort and holds relatively well even though there is a lot of sweat</li>
            <li> With almost daily use, the 3 ounce jar is still 1/4 full after nine months.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is that it smells like an OLD MAN.</li>
            <li> definitely love the way it sits in my hair, doesn&#x27;t get real stiff or super shiny like a gel.</li>
            <li> I found the product to live up to the advertisement!</li>
            <li> : less is more.</li>
            <li> Again, use WAY less than you think you need, it isn&#x27;t mostly water like hair gel.</li>
            <li> of Imperial classic pomade coming &amp; hoping that works.</li>
            <li> This particular hair cream describes itself as medium hold</li>
            <li> It has a decent hold.</li>
            <li> To the multiple positive reviews of this product, let me start with, what product were you using, because it certainly wan&#x27;t this one?!  </li>
            <li> Then, to keep my hair from being as flat, I would add just a tiny bit more after my hair was dry again, that would work through just fine now that there was cream already in my hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have fine hair and are trying to give yourself a \\&quot;Mad Men\\&quot; type style but want to skip the greasiness, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t put much in my hair at all - just barely get a bit on the end of one finger - but it always seems like too much.  </li>
            <li> The cream used to be a great in between for those not wanting a complete slick back that most other pomades give, but also want some control and staying power while looking somewhat natural.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> to fast&lt;br /&gt;Turns into oil if tempeture is high</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you don&#x27;t like using gel or mousse.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t even have the high hold forming cream on the company site</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s highly adaptable.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it for any high hold styles, though.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone.  </li>
            <li> Highly recomended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> it never just stays flat or where I want it to go, mostly looks like a big puff ball.</li>
            <li> Has a great smell and isn&#x27;t too firm like other pomades or waxes that make your hair like feel like concrete.</li>
            <li> When I went a little longer that got a little intense, so on the advice of my barber I switched over to the Forming Cream and it worked great.</li>
            <li> , I just wish it had a little more stiffness to it</li>
            <li> After cutting my hair to a much shorter 3\\&quot; in length, I was able to use the cream to help form my hair into just about any style I wanted (much like Pomade) - without my hair looking shiny or feeling greasy (provided you didn&#x27;t use too much, which is easy to do when you&#x27;re still going through the learning curve).  </li>
            <li> To fix this I simply left the lid off for a couple of hours (not too long you don&#x27;t want it to dry out) and then it still had its pleasant scent without being so overpowering.</li>
            <li> All of the Crew products are great, so you can&#x27;t really go wrong with any of them.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot of it and it can hold very well with natural shine.</li>
            <li> I find the &#x27;Forming Cream&#x27; to be far too fragrant, and it feels very greasy in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use this forming cream everyday and I love it.</li>
            <li> I normally have my hair parted and bangs pushed up and over...</li>
            <li> This allowed me to kill the friz that normally plaques my hair.</li>
            <li> Efron/ Justin Bieber with it being short on the sides and long on top,</li>
            <li> It smells good, is not sticky after a few minutes, and it doen&#x27;t take long to set.</li>
            <li> smelled good enough that girls always compliment me and usually end up sniffing my hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price of it here on Amazon compared to going to the normal beauty supply or markets that charge almost $18...not including tax.  </li>
            <li> The scent is defintely not overwhelming, in fact it&#x27;s pretty mild, which is exactly what I want in a hair cream.  </li>
            <li> I am a 38 year old man and have very fine hair, and when I use mousse or gel, my hair tends to get very brittle and stiff, and doesn&#x27;t look natural.  </li>
            <li> On short hair right now.</li>
            <li> This sh!t right here is like handing a business card that simply says “I&#x27;ll call you.”</li>
            <li> Now, I blow dry my hair bone dry, and then use the defining paste (matte, and holds good with just a tiny spritz of hairspray).</li>
            <li> Obviously some funny chemical reaction going on there, and it wasn&#x27;t too noticeable (so no 4-star demotion), but probably worth mentioning for those of you who wear sunglasses with white plastic frames.</li>
            <li> they couldn&#x27;t accept a refund on a brand new, unopened item.</li>
            <li> I can live with it.</li>
            <li> I used gel for years,until a stylist put some of this stuff in my new &#x27;do.  </li>
            <li> Done are the days of cheap gel, imitation creams, and budget pomades.</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft.</li>
            <li> but I personally think the Defining Paste is awesome for matte, and forming cream if you want a little bit of shine (but it&#x27;s harder to work into your bone dry hair, and doesn&#x27;t smell as good).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I called around to our local salons, and this size container consistently runs $17-23.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair looking natural and not over-styled!</li>
            <li> I had long hair prior (6 months growth so past my ears), and this stuff worked great too at giving a Matte look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a personal preference on the smell, it&#x27;s pretty pungent.</li>
            <li> Soft to the touch and no clumps or flakes!</li>
            <li> I started trying their Fiber product on that short hair, and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> After reading all these stellar reviews I was convinced to purchase this product, American Crew Forming Cream.</li>
            <li> Significantly cheaper than Target and other stores.</li>
            <li> only thing I would caution is that I had a pair of Original Penguin sunglasses with a white plastic frame which started to turn pinkish along the stems which were in contact with my hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re still on the fence, give one of the smaller sizes a try first.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, allows for a little movement through the day and not greasy.</li>
            <li> One cool thing is: if you wear a hat, usually that would mess up your hair for the entire day while using gel or hairspray, but with Crew, you can easily fix it right to where you had it before!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for those men who still want some movement within their hair or who have light, less dense hair.</li>
            <li> I was attempting to buy American Crew Fiber, and mistakenly purchased the Forming Cream because the color on the main photo of this listing is very blueish, which is the color of the Fiber, and not green, the color of the Forming Cream.</li>
            <li> Great for guys with thick hair that tends to poof, gives weight that keeps the hair down.</li>
            <li> Holds great, but doesn&#x27;t look too slick or get too stiff.</li>
            <li> it actually took to long to get here and by that time I was actually using another product that is far better.</li>
            <li> It gives flexible control, not stiff or &amp;#34; hard&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> but it ain&#x27;t no plain jane.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I will be getting me the American Crew Grooming cream which is for high shine and high hold</li>
            <li> I have short hair and was expecting a little more shine.</li>
            <li> much lighter and easier to work with for a semi natural look with medium / short hair.</li>
            <li> (i don&#x27;t have a lot of hair), which surprised me</li>
            <li> I was dubious with reviews that say use two fingers (especially two pea size dabs, really?), but tried a couple of fingers anyway.</li>
            <li> Come to think of it, it probably would last a whole year.</li>
            <li> I think Axe does a similar job at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Im 30 years old and after showering and drying my hair</li>
            <li> Just a natural looking product that looks like you just stepped out of the hair salon.</li>
            <li> Everything appeared to be in order when I received it, however when I use it it does not hold near as well as the identical one I purchased at the Barber.</li>
            <li> People tell me I sometimes use too much gel in my hair, and I reply that I actually use a forming cream.</li>
            <li> Moderate shine, for modern hair styles.</li>
            <li> I also have some left over forming cream, and it works really well too, just gives the hair a shinier look.</li>
            <li> blow dry the hair in the front up, blow dry the rest totally dry, put some defining paste in my palm, rub my hands together vigorously and warm it up, and then work it into my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will probably have to try a couple different products until you find the one you really like.</li>
            <li> I use this along with LS&amp;B Disorder to give me the old and the shine I desire.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my absolute last resort for styling my hair.</li>
            <li> WHY WOULD ANY COMPANY MAKE A HAIR PRODUCT THAT SMELLS LIKE OLD MAN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I need to keep it professional.</li>
            <li> But I have longish hair up front (1960s style) and I want a natural looking hold.</li>
            <li> American Crew makes a few different kinds but this one is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS-AND ITS NOT MESSY</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair looking and feeling natural.  </li>
            <li> I hate gel, this is perfect</li>
            <li> good, but too expensive</li>
            <li> Even the best smell will become an annoying odor if I have to breath it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> If your hair isn&#x27;t as thick you&#x27;ll be able to throw this in and not have to worry for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, its cheaper on Amazon and works better than competing brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I move onto the Pomade, the other thing to consider is...varying the dampness of your hair prior to the product will have a HUGE effect on how it works.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty sweet, but you have to keep in mind that a very small amount of this goes a mile.</li>
            <li> You put this into your hair either dry or damp, and it will not do anything but lay there and be greasy, while making you smell like a Super Clips for the entire day.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very mild musky masculine initially, but is not noticeable after a little while; so, it works for women.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend for medium to fine hair and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have fairly thin hair and style it for a &amp;#34;business look&amp;#34; with a lot of curvature and clean lines and used to need a lot of time in the morning to fix it just right.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle, elegant fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what hair styles this product would be used for as I most likely will never use it.  </li>
            <li> my hair really short, I was using their \\&quot;classic wax,\\&quot; which they no longer make.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair short, almost like a buzz and usually let it grow longer so that I can comb it over (by longer I&#x27;m talking 4-5 inches on the top, sometimes more).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice forming cream for someone who has long or thick hair.</li>
            <li> It adds texture, and is good enough for shaping when their hair is short, but when it grows out the hold is weak and at the end of the day their hair is in greasy bed-head mode.</li>
            <li> For short hair, use the high hold products with damp hair.</li>
            <li> wanted a certain hold for my hair which didn&#x27;t look shiny or wet, and feels soft and natural.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been overpaying for too long / thanks amazon [...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the classic Palmade before: it was okay, but I was looking for something a bit less &#x27;heavy&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> If either product is shipped when it&#x27;s too hot outside or left in a hot car, the ingredients will break down and it will be ruined.</li>
            <li> &quot; my hair in the direction I want, and to get it much drier (not 100% dry, but maybe 75%).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Depending on how much you use/how often, this can dry out before you use all of</li>
            <li> Much easier to style dry hair with this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great natural smell&lt;br /&gt;Great natural low to medium shine</li>
            <li> only complaint is that is is not a glossy look, but more of a greasy look.  </li>
            <li> It allows you to play with your hair later in the day with a light shine and firm hold.</li>
            <li> I admit that I don&#x27;t know much about styling hair, so maybe I just chose the wrong product; based on the description I was expecting a better match for my needs.</li>
            <li> I swirl it around and get just the right amount to control my wily cowlick plus a little extra to give my fine hair a little texture.</li>
            <li> little dab goes a long way and it washes out easily.</li>
            <li> I wish American Crew brought back their high hold &amp; natural shine forming cream.</li>
            <li> I typically put a dime sized amount into towel dried hair and then either let it air dry or blow dry it, either way it looks great.</li>
            <li> I have gone to about 5 different local stores looking for this particular hair gel and</li>
            <li> I have to use considerably less of this than other products I&#x27;ve paid more for and gotten lesser results.</li>
            <li> For other styles you can put this in dry or wet and it will keep your hair from sticking out all over the place and gives your hair a healthy shine.</li>
            <li> I am a very high maintenance individual that spends countless hours in perfecting my overall appearance.</li>
            <li> The other positive reviews were correct.</li>
            <li> I take a dime-size amount on my finger, rub it over all my fingers and run my fingers through my hair in the general direction</li>
            <li> careful how much you use otherwise</li>
            <li> only thing my dog will try and lick my hair if he gets near my head</li>
            <li> There have been numerous times when women will ask to feel my hair and tell me how soft it is.</li>
            <li> Holds very well, but keep in mind your hair should be as dry as possible if getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff regularly with fine thick hair and it works well until hairs length gets to be beyond 3 to 4 inches</li>
            <li> I had to put it close to the AC for few hours to get it back to normal shape, it did helped but the cream is also creamy and it melts fast but still is usable</li>
            <li> All AC products are great, but it will be a waste if you buy the wrong product.</li>
            <li> One thing to keep in mind if you purchase this product is to always place the lid on after using so it does not dry out.</li>
            <li> It also will never dry, so</li>
            <li> Not too shiny, not too weak, not too strong.</li>
            <li> sent the exact same product that was in the store except there was a sticker on the lid that peeled away at half the cover when I took it</li>
            <li> Item is exactly the same as I bought in salons and department stores but for a lot less.  </li>
            <li> I just barely cover the tip of my pointer finger and that&#x27;s enough for me.</li>
            <li> reeived this item few days after paying for it and it arrived pretty melted</li>
            <li> As I aforementioned, I do have thin hair so for some people, applying more might be necessary.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and straight (thanks, Asian genetics!)</li>
            <li> You must be very careful when handeling this gel as if you use to much it will make your hair look white, sticky, spikey and unnatural.</li>
            <li> It goes in sticky but after about 30 minutes that feeling goes away, it stays soft to the touch, gives a nice firm but not too firm, medium hold, little bit of a shine, and some texture.</li>
            <li> While the product doesn’t hold my stubborn Asian hair up, it does a decent job at giving texture and a bit of fluff.</li>
            <li> cream came almost oily due to the high temp.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much near your scalp or it could dry your skin.  </li>
            <li> Try applying it when the hair is already a bit dry so you can have a natural and brighter hair.</li>
            <li> (I do this when my hair is modestly damp, after it&#x27;s mostly dry after a shower).</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy hair, not stick straight or curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick which grows really quickly.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and this stuff works to style it.</li>
            <li> If you want your hair a little more pasted down and wet looking</li>
            <li> This product gives my hair volume and holds it in place with a dry look, whereas gel causes the hair to stick together and appears thinner than it really is with a wet look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using American Crew Forming Cream for a few years now, and I love that it holds my hair in place without being clumpy or hard (like gel).  </li>
            <li> I have long hair that is thick and tends to be dry on the ends, and I use this product to smooth, give body at the crown, and put a  shine on the end.  </li>
            <li> , very short fade on the sides, a #0 to a #2, and on top I&#x27;ve got about an inch and a half of hair that is really dry and thick that i push to the side.</li>
            <li> Most products aren&#x27;t firm enough to tame it and other products are too industrial strength, making my hair look clumpy.</li>
            <li> and I’ve worn it high and tight all the way to a full-blown pompadour.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other products you can still run your hands through your hair and it is soft.</li>
            <li> It keeps the hair soft &amp; never hardens like other gels.  </li>
            <li> I think you just have to get used to it, especially if you haven&#x27;t used product much in the recent past.</li>
            <li> This product tames my hair with only a small amount of product and it holds my hair in position very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However the jars are misleading with these low medium or high shine this one is very similar to other forming creams it does produce a low shine to medium shine at times depending on if you apply it with wet hair or dry</li>
            <li> It not only does that, but it also helped keep it in place all day long.</li>
            <li> Last a long time.</li>
            <li> Short or long hair, doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> The surface of the gel should be flat</li>
            <li> It should last a long time.</li>
            <li> It provides hold whether my hair is long or short.  </li>
            <li> I decided to grow my hair out, but that decision wasn&#x27;t made long ago so it is still rather short.</li>
            <li> Only need a little each time and your hair looks natural and neat.</li>
            <li> I have thick semi curly hair and most of the things that work on me leave my hair greasy or rock hard.</li>
            <li> Can apply it to damp or dry hair and get the same effect.</li>
            <li> Less masculine fragrance</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to almost any single one of my male clients.</li>
            <li> I like a natural look with a little shine</li>
            <li> They have the fiber for high hold but that has a completely different texture, it is like a thick wax &amp; not a cream</li>
            <li> Steer clear of Tigi products as they are messy and don&#x27;t have the hold they claim to.</li>
            <li> Each container lasts me a long while as well (about 6 months on average).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i ou have medium long</li>
            <li> Use this daily as part of my morning hair routine, which lasts roughly 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I used to have long hair all through collage and decided to go for a change.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair, this product is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also behaves differently depending on if your hair is wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> noticed with wet hair tends to get a medium shine and with dry hair gets a low shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tames hair while leaving it natural looking and not at all greasy or stiff.</li>
            <li> Made my hair look like it lays like that naturally without looking stiff.  </li>
            <li> However, I was a little disappointed at the product because it wasn&#x27;t able to make my hair shiny for the whole day, it was shiny for an hour or two, then the shine went away.</li>
            <li> I work LONG shifts (12 hours at least) and this holds my style (combed and parted classic crew cut) for all of it.</li>
            <li> Walmart and Target have this sometimes but its way way more expensive!</li>
            <li> Hearing things like the cast of Mad Men (a show i love) tipped the scales for me</li>
            <li> The product feels tacky and sticky, but not overly so - and dry, not greasy.</li>
            <li> That one has a dry, talcum covered body?</li>
            <li> Needs to be used after the hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> Used on hair that is damp and almost dry,</li>
            <li> There are a few different varieties of American Crew cream</li>
            <li> (the curse of having one parent with straight red hair, and another with curly black), and really thick hair too.</li>
            <li> hair is thick, somewhat coarse, yet soft.  </li>
            <li> When my hair dried it was very greasy and stiff.</li>
            <li> every single one of them doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore.  </li>
            <li> The grooming cream is greasy and smells more unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It seems to be watered down, or mixed with some alternative product.</li>
            <li> &quot; it actually started to weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also come to know that if I sleep without showering and am in a rush in the morning, I can just comb and style without applying anymore than what was left from the previous day.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have had occasional problems with getting American Crew Forming Cream through.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair with slight tacky feeling, allows to be reshaped even hours later.  </li>
            <li> Previously I used American Crew Defining Paste.</li>
            <li> you can re adjust throughout the day if it becomes messy through walking on campus, and will last as long as you are in class.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to use too much in a single application, though.  </li>
            <li> Apply a little to damp hair and once it dries, you have instant control.</li>
            <li> So you only need to use a little.</li>
            <li> Note that the Defining Paste is a lot more solid than the Forming Cream; as a result, it is hard to apply the Defining Paste in cold weather.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He has pretty thick hair and had been using gel in his hair which made it extremely hard and crunchy and that strange \\&quot;always</li>
            <li> I live in a place where there can be some serious wind speeds, but my hair has never been affected.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I recognized the blue label and associated it with the Fiber label without paying much attention.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> , I definitely have a few hair strands in my hand that came out when I ran it through.</li>
            <li> At this price point, Forming Cream provides enough hold without being messy or oily.</li>
            <li> but it gives you control of your hair without looking like a wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have bought and used a few American Crew products.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, the container was 1/2 empty.</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Well worth the somewhat expensive price.</li>
            <li> is wet.  </li>
            <li> I have thick short asian hair.  </li>
            <li> Generic mousse from Wal-Mart has better hold, smell, and pliability than than this crap.  </li>
            <li> It holds even his thick hair and is still soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because of my thick hair, it was near impossible to work through my hair when dry - but it would work through just fine with damp hair.</li>
            <li> I am a female with medium long, Asian, thick strands which are slightly wavy.  </li>
            <li> I apply it to mostly dry hair (a little blow dry up front for volume) and then apply a dab to my hands and cover both palms with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However hold is weak this states hold is high</li>
            <li> Made my scalp very dry!</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is a 1/10; I seriously recommend avoiding it entirely and saving your money.  </li>
            <li> I have found using just a small amount (enough to just cover two fingertips), is enough to give my hair some body and hold without being too stiff.  </li>
            <li> As I have grown older, my hair has also thinned, which makes the brittle look even worse.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Even so, just use it sparingly because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so the 3oz.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> I use this and a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it has a very natural smell kinda of vanilla but not actual fake vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that it works well.</li>
            <li> I have noticed if you experience any hair loss due to aging, sometimes applying this product seems to assist in pulling out hair, meaning after I have applied it</li>
            <li> The product washes out well and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair like other waxes or gels.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband, he will not use any other product on his hair which speaks for itself.  </li>
            <li> I can slick my hair back with this</li>
            <li> I use fiber as well for parties and other occasions.</li>
            <li> product leaked out onto other purchases</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t hold my hair like their other product, known as Fiber.</li>
            <li> other product I&#x27;ve been using is the Forming Cream.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have tried other product lines from stores and online.</li>
            <li> trick I’ve learned is to put a little in damp hair and then blow dry to manage and add texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful when you&#x27;re travelling as if it this gets shifted on it&#x27;s side or upside down</li>
            <li> Other products I&#x27;ve tried have always left my hair looking wet, greasy, or hard.</li>
            <li> I dont blame the seller I blame the terrible hot weather we have in the lower states specially here in FL where temp arouses almos the 90 degrees.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s pretty expensive.  </li>
            <li> I require a cut every other week and this stuff hasn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> You use VERY little and it goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the price</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way</li>
            <li> this had a scent it would be called \\&quot;90 year old man, residing dustily in nursing home\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff will keep the curls and frizzy down and hold the shape I want.</li>
            <li> and I am beating them off with a stick due to this hair product!</li>
            <li> This product will last me forever given a small amount is all I need each time!</li>
            <li> Dry off hair with towel, get a small amount of this on my fingers, rub through hair and style, wash off hands.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this stuff, so the 3oz container usually lasts 1.5 months.</li>
            <li> a slightly GQ look I&#x27;ve been told.  </li>
            <li> Never the less, my hair is always to my liking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shaping Cream, but this was half the price.</li>
            <li> Finally i talked to my hairdresser and she recommended American Crew (I was skeptical about it as i know they get commission from each sale)</li>
            <li> If your hair is somewhat damp then apply the product, it&#x27;s leave a slight shine.  </li>
            <li> the Fiber began to work less well.</li>
            <li> My order have hidden cost, to expansive</li>
            <li> Too unpredictable and limits its holding effectiveness.</li>
            <li> ; looking but EXTREMELY lightweight, not sticky stiff or yucky to the touch)&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> I put a very small amount in my wet hands and put it in my wet hair.  </li>
            <li> but a little less shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair has a slight curl to it that typically makes using product very hard as it will continuously try to curl back, but this cream will keep hair in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the scent of the gel, it is not appealing as others I have used.</li>
            <li> The cream feels a little sticky on application but dries without being sticky.  </li>
            <li> It does not make your hair look to greasy, but it does have a little shine to it.</li>
            <li> I just add a little to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Just takes a little bit to work</li>
            <li> little spike in the front.</li>
            <li> It has a medium hold strength and provides a little shine without looking oily.</li>
            <li> Then I rub it through the hair, adding a little water if I need it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> After this, I continually take very small amounts and run it over the tips of a few fingers for minor touchups.</li>
            <li> very* thick and fairly short hair - for a woman.  </li>
            <li> I have thick Asian hair and this is one of the few products that keeps my hair in control without making it too hard or greasy looking.</li>
            <li> Firm hold, sleek finish.</li>
            <li> Use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and does what it says.</li>
            <li> Not too shiny and not to firm.</li>
            <li> Then after it dried, I would just dab my finger into the cream again apply between my finger tips, and then style as desired.</li>
            <li> Works wonders at controlling my frizzy fluffy hair.</li>
            <li> , I can have a messy fauxhawk look too.</li>
            <li> For the summer when my hair is a bit shorter, this works well for a tussled, messy look, too.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Firm hold and</li>
            <li> When it dried it made my hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> If you have a crazy thick head of hair, this is the right stuff to buy.</li>
            <li> I used to apply Fiber by American Crew and that stuff is way too thick and the hold is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Crew cream was not sticky, greasy, or stiff.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong that stuff worked well, but it was very expensive plus being more liquid</li>
            <li> Which means no strong scent and no greasy pomade look.</li>
            <li> Almost no shine, which I prefer, and has a very slight coconut smell.  </li>
            <li> My hair is a bit dry and hard to manage (thick and gray).  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m aware, but it&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t weigh hair down and lasts at least 12 hours.</li>
            <li> is that it can be too clay like and usually made my hair too stiff.  </li>
            <li> Just put a little dab in your palm and run it through your locks and bam!</li>
            <li> This cream be like if you want to make that thick italian hair like mine be on its slick as fuzzle game.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it happened</li>
            <li> recommend getting the small jars to try them out if ur not sure on which product is best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Great small jar to start with&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> I usually buy 4 at a time and we will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> When I got home, I washed it out and reapplied as usual.</li>
            <li> In the past I have alway purchased it where I was getting my hair-cut.</li>
            <li> With small application, the musky cologne smell still attack my nose nonstop.</li>
            <li> just a small amount on my finger is all I need.  </li>
            <li> It does the job well, not more can be said.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To use, take a small amount and rub it well into your hands and apply.</li>
            <li> I take a small amount (dime size) and spread into my hands then through hair.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with any American Crew product, and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any product in my hair for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> My husband and litlte boys used hair gel and it got hard and stiff.  </li>
            <li> I definitely am a fan, though I was disappointed with the Grooming Cream which was very oily and extremely difficult to style.</li>
            <li> This mix of hair means my hair is near impossible to control at any length.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> Unlike gel, the forming cream will shape your hair without leaving your hair hard.</li>
            <li> The hard part is figuring out...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years but hard to find in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> (that I do not care for) and pomade (that may be too hard to blend).  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent and the product doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling disgusting.</li>
            <li> one complaint is that it still has that \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look to it.</li>
            <li> The paste was a bit too thick and matte for me</li>
            <li> Fiber is also fairly thick (see my separate review of Fiber).  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and does whatever it feels like</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for thick rugged hair.</li>
            <li> Using this alone is not an option with how thick my hair is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, greasy, clunky and does not spread well, and does not hold well.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that gets curly.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a thick build up on your hair and</li>
            <li> I wish I discovered this a lot sooner, because I have thick hair which is stubborn for styling after taking showers.</li>
            <li> I have thick and wavy hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like other products that leaves fake gel like shiny look.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 5 years and what a difference it makes!  </li>
            <li> Gels fail by 2pm (and often flake like dandruff) while hair spray is done before lunch; neither does anything other than glue the hair in place.</li>
            <li> It smells vaguely of coconut and vanilla, but not distinctly of either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t but feel as though everyone who enjoyed product must have switched from AXE hair products or something similar because they have no clue what a terrible and worthless product this is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but slightly cheaper than retail stores.  </li>
            <li> Slight fragrance (like it, smells expensive),</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead with hair that is difficult to tame.</li>
            <li> (You can count on at least 200 uses for this product!</li>
            <li> I have medium hair and this product is simply to weak to be of any use.</li>
            <li> Not too weak.  </li>
            <li> like other American Crew products, but for my purposes this is the worst hair product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I usually muss up the part for a casual look.</li>
            <li> After cutting my hair shorter, I needed even less.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard and looking fake.</li>
            <li> I am not very interested in the smell, but it is not too bad...</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make things worse, this product does nothing</li>
            <li> My previous brand went bad</li>
            <li> It became a weird, gluey goop.</li>
            <li> It smells like cold cream to me, which was not a good thing.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel dirty and was very hard to get out.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with AC FC.</li>
            <li> The cost is a bit expensive for hair cream/gel</li>
            <li> American Crew Forming Cream is literally the worst product I have ever tried in my lifetime, which includes well over 50 products to date, ranging from gels and glue, to pomades and waxes.  </li>
            <li> You can not go wrong with this brand.</li>
            <li> It is also difficult for me to wash out.  </li>
            <li> And yet it has a weird stringyness like it has glue in it.</li>
            <li> your looking for crazy hold, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> When I was cutting my hair at finger length I was using the Grooming Cream.</li>
            <li> Mad Men style or presidential.</li>
            <li> A really bad smelling product.  </li>
            <li> If you know what it&#x27;s supposed to do, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the cheapest thing out there, but you won&#x27;t be disappointed once you&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Dries a bit hard/crusty which I hate</li>
            <li> I hate using gel and hairspray.  </li>
            <li> In correct amounts, it isn&#x27;t terrible.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible.</li>
            <li> Worst of all, it felt terrible in my hair.</li>

            <li> perfect for short hair men</li>
            <li> Killer product. Wonderful smell, not too aromatic. Firm hold, sleek finish. A little goes a long way. Worth the price for me.</li>
            <li> My teen boy loves this product. Wears his hair spiked in the front.</li>
            <li> Here in NYC, finding American Crew products is easy...practically every pharmacy sells it. The problem is that they charge about twice the amount than it&#x27;s listed as here on Amazon. All of the American Crew hair creams are good, I&#x27;ve tried them all, but the forming cream is by far my favorite. For my medium-length hair, it has the best hold without getting hard like hair gel or hair spray. It also has a nice medium shine and smells so much better than 99% of other hair products that you&#x27;d find on the shelves.</li>
            <li> Great product. If the right amount is used it will have a great hold and leave you hair with a natural look and almost no shine which is great</li>
            <li> Great for thinner hair. Won&#x27;t rip out like Fiber does.</li>
            <li> Smells a bit off. Works exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Use this product everyday. Nice hold and no flakes like gel. Well worth the money. Will definitely keep on using!!</li>
            <li> smells great and is easy to use. definitely love the way it sits in my hair, doesn&#x27;t get real stiff or super shiny like a gel.</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps your hair from going all over the place.</li>
            <li> arrived and worked as promised</li>
            <li> My stylist uses it and I use it now for a couple of year. Much better than other brands.</li>
            <li> This product is the only one I use for my hair. It has just the right amount of gloss and hold for my medium length hair.</li>
            <li> it actually took to long to get here and by that time I was actually using another product that is far better.</li>
            <li> good product to help control my crazy hair a bit better</li>
            <li> Best product on the market.  Doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard and looking fake.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  It&#x27;s expensive but slightly cheaper than retail stores.  Don&#x27;t use too much near your scalp or it could dry your skin.  Other than that it works well.</li>
            <li> Great product, and got it for a great price!</li>
            <li> best texture, best smell, best natural look.... best thing since buttered bread.  I hate gel, this is perfect</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve used it for several years. It has a good amount of shine without being too wet. Great for styling and re-styling throughout the day as it does not flake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 10 years and I can honestly say, I will never buy another! I have very fine hair and this cream thickens it up and makes it so easy to style. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> same stuff my hair salon uses.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome if you have insane cowlicks like I do. It puts the cowlicks in their place!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair cream I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;ve had some that were to greasy, sticky, and melted. This has worked wonders. On short hair right now.</li>
            <li> I have used this hair product for well over 3 years now and this is also the cheapest I have seen it. your hair stays put, but isn&#x27;t hard or shiny looking afterwards and looks very good. You use VERY little and it goes a LONG way. Can apply it to damp or dry hair and get the same effect. Great product and I will recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect for holding my hair short and spiky.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy or my scalp hurt.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have been using it for years. It gives flexible control, not stiff or &amp;#34; hard&amp;#34;. The fragrance is fresh and clean too.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product but make sure to rinse your hand with water because the cream itself is really sticky</li>
            <li> Great for medium length hair, easy to use, not too sticky, comes off easy and lasts all day. Look good while ffeling good, I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> Best forming/molding cream on the market. I use it everyday and does what it says. Perfect perfect gel. Buy this!</li>
            <li> I have thick Asian hair and this is one of the few products that keeps my hair in control without making it too hard or greasy looking.</li>
            <li> I use this forming cream everyday and I love it. A little goes a long way. This last purchase has lasted me about a year or so. Just need a dime size amount. Has a great smell and isn&#x27;t too firm like other pomades or waxes that make your hair like feel like concrete. I used to apply Fiber by American Crew and that stuff is way too thick and the hold is ridiculous. I would recommend this for those men who still want some movement within their hair or who have light, less dense hair. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> works well you dont look like a grease ball. easy to sculpt and use. careful how much you use otherwise itll be a pain in the neck to wash off</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite some time and it suits my hair well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using American Crew Forming Cream for a few years now, and I love that it holds my hair in place without being clumpy or hard (like gel).  I called around to our local salons, and this size container consistently runs $17-23.  Finding it on Amazon for this price was great, and I bought a couple years&#x27; worth to offset the shipping cost.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Works great and is a great deal!</li>
            <li> Made my scalp very dry!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great - not just because it holds your hair in place, but more important because it washes out effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Best product in its category</li>
            <li> It does the job. Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this forming cream because it allows me to manipulate and style my hair and it leaves a matte finish. It&#x27;s not like other products that leaves fake gel like shiny look. It leaves my hair looking natural and not over-styled! :) It has a lasting effect and and I can easily wash it out when I shower! The best forming cream I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This forming cream has a great light odor, nothing over powering and the product itself works great. If you apply it to slightly wet hair, yes it may have a chunky type look when it your hair dries, but just running your hand over the hair breaks it up for a natural hold. I have noticed if you experience any hair loss due to aging, sometimes applying this product seems to assist in pulling out hair, meaning after I have applied it, I definitely have a few hair strands in my hand that came out when I ran it through. Even so, just use it sparingly because a little goes a long way. Great price too!</li>
            <li> Ive been using forming cream for 8 years now. This is my second purchase of the product and i will never tsp buying it because it has a neutral smell and dries in a couple of minutes. Try applying it when the hair is already a bit dry so you can have a natural and brighter hair.</li>
            <li> This forming cream is the best I have used so far. It gives a nice hold and shine to hair without adding any stiffness. It has a subtle, elegant fragrance.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells great. It will not leave any sticky stuff on your pillow. It works best when you put it in while the hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Product keeps my hair just the way I like it! Helps me get the ladies and I am beating them off with a stick due to this hair product! One word &#x3D; amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Great deal, it is the real stuff.  When you buy the package it is almost as good as a two for one deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. It&#x27;s the only styling product I&#x27;ve found that has a perfectly creamy texture and moves my hair where I want it without being too powerful. In fact, it&#x27;s the only styling product I use! I take a dime-size amount on my finger, rub it over all my fingers and run my fingers through my hair in the general direction I want it to go. (I do this when my hair is modestly damp, after it&#x27;s mostly dry after a shower). After this, I continually take very small amounts and run it over the tips of a few fingers for minor touchups. The product washes out well and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair like other waxes or gels. Each container lasts me a long while as well (about 6 months on average).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Pretty much my favorite gel. Not too shiny and not to firm. It&#x27;s a great Goldilocks product.</li>
            <li> Works like expected and smells much better than the competing creams.  Plain and simple, its cheaper on Amazon and works better than competing brands.</li>
            <li> This works great on a mans hair.  It only takes a tiny bit to get your hair to do what you want.  It does not make it rock hard, it&#x27;s clean, smells good etc.</li>
            <li> good, but too expensive</li>
            <li> Received the product as described.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. Good hold without being too crunchy. Medium gloss isn&#x27;t too shiny and you can just brush it through to get rid of any gloss.</li>
            <li> Perfect transaction. Love the product. It works well. I would recommend this product. It holds my hair just the way I want it.</li>
            <li> Great cream for you hair cheaper than cvs, target, etc!</li>
            <li> A really bad smelling product.  I tossed it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Always have liked American Crew Products. The paste was a bit too thick and matte for me so I went with this and it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced for how much you get though.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it happened BUT I ordered this thinking it was the American Crew Fiber I love so much.  Unfortunately, I recognized the blue label and associated it with the Fiber label without paying much attention.  Since this is considered a \\&quot;personal item\\&quot;, Amazon will not let me return it.  So with that, I decided to try it out.  I typically use Fiber to provide great body and style to my hair.  Fiber has a relatively matte finish and isn&#x27;t greasy.  Fiber is also fairly thick (see my separate review of Fiber).  In contrast, the American Crew Forming Cream is like a goop of sorts.  Its finish leaves a shine to your hair vs. the matte of Fiber.  I&#x27;m not sure what hair styles this product would be used for as I most likely will never use it.  I normally have my hair parted and bangs pushed up and over...a slightly GQ look I&#x27;ve been told.  If you want your hair a little more pasted down and wet looking I would use the Forming Cream otherwise use Fiber.  I have also found Fiber to hold hair in place much better while remaining pliable all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product at 2 vastly different hair lengths (10\\&quot; and 3\\&quot;), and it behaves slightly differently at the different lengths. It also behaves differently depending on if your hair is wet or dry.  For reference, I have mix of hair (the curse of having one parent with straight red hair, and another with curly black), and really thick hair too. This mix of hair means my hair is near impossible to control at any length.  The product feels tacky and sticky, but not overly so - and dry, not greasy. Because of my thick hair, it was near impossible to work through my hair when dry - but it would work through just fine with damp hair. This allowed me to kill the friz that normally plaques my hair. Then, to keep my hair from being as flat, I would add just a tiny bit more after my hair was dry again, that would work through just fine now that there was cream already in my hair.  When my hair was longer, it helped my hair fall in pieces (rather than just being frizzy throughout). After cutting my hair to a much shorter 3\\&quot; in length, I was able to use the cream to help form my hair into just about any style I wanted (much like Pomade) - without my hair looking shiny or feeling greasy (provided you didn&#x27;t use too much, which is easy to do when you&#x27;re still going through the learning curve).  When it comes to amount, even when my hair was very long, I didn&#x27;t need much, I would just lightly run my index and middle fingers over the top to the product. I ended up with 2 pea-sized dabs, one on each finger, that I would then warm with my hands and work through my hair. Then after it dried, I would just dab my finger into the cream again apply between my finger tips, and then style as desired. After cutting my hair shorter, I needed even less.  Lesson: less is more. It does about the same job as a Pomade, but without the shine and no greasy residue.  Being water-based as well means it washes right out, even without shampooing. However, it also means the rain can also wash it out - so bring an umbrella.  I bought a 3oz jar in mid-august, and while I used it sparingly, sporadically and at varying rates (because of experimenting with styles and changes in hair length), I have only just started to run out. I have settled on a length and style, and I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I like it; lasted me five months (i don&#x27;t have a lot of hair), which surprised me</li>
            <li> Product arrive in perfect shape.  I use this daily.</li>
            <li> Really great product. I have a really short haircut, very short fade on the sides, a #0 to a #2, and on top I&#x27;ve got about an inch and a half of hair that is really dry and thick that i push to the side. It goes in sticky but after about 30 minutes that feeling goes away, it stays soft to the touch, gives a nice firm but not too firm, medium hold, little bit of a shine, and some texture. It&#x27;s great. Smells great too. I typically put a dime sized amount into towel dried hair and then either let it air dry or blow dry it, either way it looks great.</li>
            <li> Product works great right after I get my haircut but as it gets longer the performance plummets. I guess it reminds me when I need to get it cut again! Definitely recommended for shorter hair</li>
            <li> great price and service</li>
            <li> This is the best product out there!  This is the best for people with fine hair too.... Try it out!</li>
            <li> Great styling product</li>
            <li> Best guys hair product. As the girl who showed me this said &amp;#34; Its the product for guys who want to look like they don&#x27;t use product.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works great. Smells great. My husband loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. The other positive reviews were correct. This cream gives a great soft/shiny texture with medium/strong hold and the ability to reform throughout the day. Slight fragrance (like it, smells expensive), great looks. Also, I agree with the other commentors, you only need like two fingertips worth to get a good amount of hold. Use too much and your hair will probably end up looking greasy/wet.</li>
            <li> Great stuff smells great consistancy is great and makes it feel not greesy or to hard in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;If your a guy and have medium short hair this stuff is great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing my dog will try and lick my hair if he gets near my head idk if that has anything to do with the product but i dont recomend eating it lol</li>
            <li> Not too shiny, not too weak, not too strong. Works wonders at controlling my frizzy fluffy hair. It has a pleasing man scent as well.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used to style my hair.</li>
            <li> After commenting on other reviews I have te pleasure to make my own review on this item which I bought here in Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this prodcuct and honestly will mention its pros and cons because it does has its cons!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reeived this item few days after paying for it and it arrived pretty melted I dont blame the seller I blame the terrible hot weather we have in the lower states specially here in FL where temp arouses almos the 90 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream came almost oily due to the high temp. I had to put it close to the AC for few hours to get it back to normal shape, it did helped but the cream is also creamy and it melts fast but still is usable and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the jars are misleading with these low medium or high shine this one is very similar to other forming creams it does produce a low shine to medium shine at times depending on if you apply it with wet hair or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed with wet hair tends to get a medium shine and with dry hair gets a low shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smells is great love the smell, it smells so soft and natural it has a very natural smell kinda of vanilla but not actual fake vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I will be getting me the American Crew Grooming cream which is for high shine and high hold I love my wet hair look but meanwhile I use this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However hold is weak this states hold is high i will say to me is low to medium hold I need to use an extra product for hold or use hairspray to keep my hair in place because this cream kind of melts in our hair and does not give you that strong hold some might need specially i ou have medium long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are looking for a good hold opt for American Crew Fiber instead!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend getting the small jars to try them out if ur not sure on which product is best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great natural smell&lt;br /&gt;Great natural low to medium shine&lt;br /&gt;Great small jar to start with&lt;br /&gt;Great price here inAmazon of course&lt;br /&gt;Great texture none sticky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weak hold&lt;br /&gt;Melts to fast&lt;br /&gt;Turns into oil if tempeture is high</li>
            <li> Fiber is more waxy and this is soft like paste. I have both Fiber and Forming Cream. I would recommend the AC Fiber over this for everyone.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff regularly with fine thick hair and it works well until hairs length gets to be beyond 3 to 4 inches and then I have to use too much.  Then time for a hair cut.  The product holds well and is not crunchy and hair can be restyled with a bit of water if windblown or messed up during the day.</li>
            <li> Best hair product. Apply a little to damp hair and once it dries, you have instant control. Not to mention it smells so clean and professional lol.</li>
            <li> much lighter and easier to work with for a semi natural look with medium / short hair. I wasnt a fan of pomade or waxes with this hair length and the way i do it for work. Wax + spray is good when im going out and doing something more exciting but when im just trying to part my hair 3/4 and brush it over and keep it there without being shiny this product is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT a strong hold which is good in this application. It sort of keeps everything in place... I can run my hand through my hair to sort of fix it if the wind shuffles it. Doesnt harden / set.</li>
            <li> styles hair great, adding just enough shine. would recommend this product, its not too greasy and has great hold. awesome</li>
            <li> Quick and perfect. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Easy to apply and keeps your hair in place.</li>
            <li> Crew Forming Cream works great, as a small amount - two pee sized drops for medium length hair - can last you all day! One cool thing is: if you wear a hat, usually that would mess up your hair for the entire day while using gel or hairspray, but with Crew, you can easily fix it right to where you had it before! I wouldn&#x27;t count on this to make your hair \\&quot;shiny\\&quot; but it definitely works amazing for styling!  (You can count on at least 200 uses for this product! Great deal!)  I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I am a 38 year old man and have very fine hair, and when I use mousse or gel, my hair tends to get very brittle and stiff, and doesn&#x27;t look natural.  As I have grown older, my hair has also thinned, which makes the brittle look even worse.  I have been using this product for the past 5 years and what a difference it makes!  I have found using just a small amount (enough to just cover two fingertips), is enough to give my hair some body and hold without being too stiff.  It has a pleasant smell and one container lasts me 8-10 months, so it is worth the little extra you pay.  I highly recommend this product if you don&#x27;t like using gel or mousse.</li>
            <li> My husband says this works grade, if doesn&#x27;t leave his hair greasy or crunchy looking but still styles great.</li>
            <li> Tames hair while leaving it natural looking and not at all greasy or stiff. Unlike some other products you can still run your hands through your hair and it is soft. Over all a great product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Works well on fine hair. Highly recommend this product. Hard to find in the stores. Glad you had it available.</li>
            <li> Very nice cream for shine and moulding.  I have long hair that is thick and tends to be dry on the ends, and I use this product to smooth, give body at the crown, and put a  shine on the end.  It&#x27;s excellent.  The price on Amazon is very good in comparison to other places where I&#x27;ve seen it on sale.</li>
            <li> I am a female with medium long, Asian, thick strands which are slightly wavy.  I color treat my hair with Revlon hair dyes for grays.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a certain hold for my hair which didn&#x27;t look shiny or wet, and feels soft and natural.  This did exactly that.  It kept the bangs and sides of my hair out of my face and did not flatten my hair.  Made my hair look like it lays like that naturally without looking stiff.  The cream feels a little sticky on application but dries without being sticky.  The smell is very mild musky masculine initially, but is not noticeable after a little while; so, it works for women.  There was no scalp irritation, allergic reaction, acne breakouts or hair color fading.  This product is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would work better for me:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Lower price&lt;br /&gt;2.  More accessable at local stores&lt;br /&gt;3.  Less masculine fragrance&lt;br /&gt;4.  A tad stronger hold</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband, he will not use any other product on his hair which speaks for itself.  I usually buy 4 at a time and we will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best.</li>
            <li> All my son will buy. Couldn&#x27;t find it in the store but thankfully I found it online. It is great. Love it.</li>
            <li> Holds my hair in place, has a good consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a bit of water after you rub it into your hands, it softens it up a bit and makes it easier to work through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bobby Pynes</li>
            <li> There are a lot of hair products for men that create the illusion that your hair could be used as a protective device at a construction site.  I like this forming cream because it lasts forever (1 year + per container, personally) and it blends into your hair rather than making you look like a cast member from Grease.  My girlfriend likes that she can run her fingers through my hair without sustaining an injury.  Easy 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I was dubious with reviews that say use two fingers (especially two pea size dabs, really?), but tried a couple of fingers anyway. When my hair dried it was very greasy and stiff. When I got home, I washed it out and reapplied as usual. You only need to lightly dip one finger and spread it around your hands, this stuff gets real sticky and the smallest amounts will cover medium length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried AC so I had no reference for medium/high hold, but I figured this would have been the lighter of what they offer. It does a great job of holding hair still and it looks very natural. I was hoping since it&#x27;s water based that it wouldn&#x27;t be as sticky, but it is. In correct amounts, it isn&#x27;t terrible. I&#x27;ve yet to try it with a hair dryer though. My hair has a slight curl to it that typically makes using product very hard as it will continuously try to curl back, but this cream will keep hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant. It smells vaguely of coconut and vanilla, but not distinctly of either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this does a great job of sculpting hair. It&#x27;s great if you want to sculp hair with no obvious shine. It&#x27;s alright if you want to just control unruly hair (probably better with almost nonexistant amount + some water + hair dryer though). Again, use WAY less than you think you need, it isn&#x27;t mostly water like hair gel. Come to think of it, it probably would last a whole year. My previous brand went bad (clumpy/dry) before I could even use it all.</li>
            <li> This holds well, smells nice and does the job. I use hair spray overtop of it and apply the cream in towel-dried hair.</li>
            <li> Not good. I wish American Crew brought back their high hold &amp; natural shine forming cream. I can&#x27;t find it anywhere. Even the listing on Amazon has reviews saying they just received the medium hold/medium shine. The product doesn&#x27;t hold well at all. They don&#x27;t even have the high hold forming cream on the company site so I&#x27;m guessing they discontinued it. They have the fiber for high hold but that has a completely different texture, it is like a thick wax &amp; not a cream so it doesn&#x27;t work that great on longer hair. The cream used to be a great in between for those not wanting a complete slick back that most other pomades give, but also want some control and staying power while looking somewhat natural. The search continues. I got 6 oz. of Imperial classic pomade coming &amp; hoping that works.</li>
            <li> Soft hold, good scent and easy to work with</li>
            <li> American Crew Forming Cream has been described as medium hold &amp; medium shine, and this is very accurate. I have been using pomades &amp; gels from Redken, Paul Mitchell, Axe, etc., and none have given me the presentation that this product has. I have hair which reflects my nationality, with the thickness of Latino hair and the strength of Asian hair. This product holds my hair down--which, when cut short looks like fur--and actually makes my hair look textured and LIKE HAIR. The pomade and gel would provide a similar effect at the expense of making my hair look oily and crusty, respectively. This product hides the fact that you&#x27;ve used it quite well, while keeping your hair the way you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that it works best on towel-dried hair, using a finger&#x27;s worth of product (imprecise, I know--maybe a mL or two). It will look and feel like you haven&#x27;t applied enough, but once your hair dries it will be held lightly in place. It endures, though; neither wind nor the hat protecting you from that wind will prevent you from restyling your hair on the fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect that I will get a few months of good use out of this container. It has brought me the most consistent styling so far; I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using the product from purchase up until July; that&#x27;s seven months, folks! Granted, I used it perhaps four or five times a week, but it is very effective and efficient.</li>
            <li> Works well, not too much shine, decent hold. Just the right amount and is the same product as the one my room mate bought from the grocery store at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still experimenting with this. It seems to have good control so far though. It&#x27;s better than the L&#x27;Oreal Out of Bed texturiser that I bought. Still searching for the perfect holding cream for my hair. This could be it. Don&#x27;t know yet.</li>
            <li> Finally, I found this forming cream!  My boyfriend uses this and he loves it.  It is the only hair gel that he uses.  I have gone to about 5 different local stores looking for this particular hair gel and every single one of them doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore.  Finally I gave up and searched for it online.  I found it on Amazon and it was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> Not greasy. Nice hold.</li>
            <li> Only product ever used works great</li>
            <li> This cream works great for my husband. He seems to like it. I don&#x27;t hear him complaining anyway. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectations.  I think Axe does a similar job at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead with hair that is difficult to tame. It does not blow in the wind! Most products aren&#x27;t firm enough to tame it and other products are too industrial strength, making my hair look clumpy. This product tames my hair with only a small amount of product and it holds my hair in position very well. It doesn&#x27;t look oily.  It works all day and holds like glue, without feeling or looking like glue.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - I have a cowlick and it keeps it from pointing in the wrong direction. I swirl it around and get just the right amount to control my wily cowlick plus a little extra to give my fine hair a little texture. This is my second purchase of this great product. There are a few different varieties of American Crew cream and I think this is middle of the road but it ain&#x27;t no plain jane. Highly recommend for medium to fine hair and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is my number 1 hair product that I&#x27;ve ever used, and will continue to buy it in the future. Unlike gel, the forming cream will shape your hair without leaving your hair hard. There have been numerous times when women will ask to feel my hair and tell me how soft it is. The best part is that you don&#x27;t need a lot to keep your hair in place for the entire day. I live in a place where there can be some serious wind speeds, but my hair has never been affected. If I had to describe what my hair looks like, I&#x27;d say something similar to Zac Efron/ Justin Bieber with it being short on the sides and long on top, granted I don&#x27;t exactly have the movie star looks they do. Never the less, my hair is always to my liking and I ever have to do is use my fingers to style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great buy, and amazon always has the cheapest price over the local stores anyway.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. My boyfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> Forming Cream is the primary product I use for my hair and have been using it for many years now. There are cheaper products on the market, but you get what you pay for. At this price point, Forming Cream provides enough hold without being messy or oily. I have to use considerably less of this than other products I&#x27;ve paid more for and gotten lesser results. I will occasionally use Fiber for a bit more hold and a different look, but it tends to sweat out more easily than the Forming Cream does so I use the Forming Cream as my go to product for every day use. Steer clear of Tigi products as they are messy and don&#x27;t have the hold they claim to.</li>
            <li> Totally recommend it if you use gel/cream in your hair and don&#x27;t want to stink.  Does it&#x27;s job well.  Remember to check the options before you buy, there are lot more types of these for specific hair types.</li>
            <li> Holds very well, but keep in mind your hair should be as dry as possible if getting out of the shower. It doesn&#x27;t like damp hair! I can slick my hair back with this, I can have a messy fauxhawk look too. It&#x27;s highly adaptable.</li>
            <li> Im 30 years old and after showering and drying my hair it never just stays flat or where I want it to go, mostly looks like a big puff ball. I started my quest for the best hair &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is what I call it, since i was in 5th or 6th grade. I used Paul Mitchel gel for many many years...its in a shampoo type bottle and comes out in the consistency of shampoo too. Don&#x27;t get me wrong that stuff worked well, but it was very expensive plus being more liquid I tended to use more then I needed to and ran out of gel all the time. Then I found American Crew products advised by my barber. The Forming Cream is by far the best &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; I have ever used. You can get the exact amount you need because its almost a compound texture but a little more creamy. Does not leave any white streaks in your hair. It will not dry out and get white and flaky like many products. Only need to use a tiny bit on shorter hair and it last all day and even into the night when your getting in bed. Which is why before going to bed i just splash some water on my hair to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: Do not buy this in stores....Walmart and Target have this sometimes but its way way more expensive!</li>
            <li> I found the product to live up to the advertisement! Leaves hair soft and does not leave flakes like most products.</li>
            <li> Use this daily as part of my morning hair routine, which lasts roughly 2 minutes. Dry off hair with towel, get a small amount of this on my fingers, rub through hair and style, wash off hands. I am a simple guy so I don&#x27;t want to spend a bunch of time on my hair each morning. This is very easy to use and gets consistent results. Hair does not look &amp;#34;frozen&amp;#34; or greasy. Just some more control over natural looking hair. The 3 oz size will last me about 5-6 months easily.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li> great product.  glad to find it online</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used every other product under the sun, here is why you would love AC Forming Cream:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Lightweight - doesn&#x27;t feel like gel nor waxy disgustingness&lt;br /&gt;2) Smells great&lt;br /&gt;3) Creates variable levels of hold - I use less than a dime&#x27;s worth for a fluffy, textured, awesome look to my short hair. (very &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; looking but EXTREMELY lightweight, not sticky stiff or yucky to the touch)&lt;br /&gt;4) I had long hair prior (6 months growth so past my ears), and this stuff worked great too at giving a Matte look. However it was a bit more unruly to use than on my short hair&lt;br /&gt;5) No shine, no grease. Just a natural looking product that looks like you just stepped out of the hair salon. Really great and unique....I have not found anything like this product and trust me my cabinet is filled with $20+ salon grade styling products.</li>
            <li> Before I switched to this forming cream I was using Schwarzkopf&#x27;s got2b glued styling spiking glue, and it was getting the job done with a lot of product and at the downfall of my hair&#x27;s health. I didn&#x27;t really enjoy the smell or the texture of it and was recommended to this product by a friend who works at a local barber shop here in Columbus. I have fairly thin hair and style it for a &amp;#34;business look&amp;#34; with a lot of curvature and clean lines and used to need a lot of time in the morning to fix it just right. This forming cream does the trick though, quick to set the desired look, has a strong hold, and still keeps it so someone can easily run their fingers through it that can be quickly fixed with a comb. I&#x27;ve also come to know that if I sleep without showering and am in a rush in the morning, I can just comb and style without applying anymore than what was left from the previous day. That&#x27;s pretty sweet, but you have to keep in mind that a very small amount of this goes a mile. I just barely cover the tip of my pointer finger and that&#x27;s enough for me. As I aforementioned, I do have thin hair so for some people, applying more might be necessary. I enjoy the scent and the product doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling disgusting. Most of all it works wonders for me! I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use American Cream Forming Cream and love it of anything else out on the market.</li>
            <li> Chances are if you&#x27;re buying this you&#x27;ve already tried it in some form or another. Great forming cream, nice hold, not a greasy or crunchy finish. Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
            <li> It does shape and hold well. My hair is thick and does whatever it feels like but this held well with just a pinky size dab. There are multiple sellers online, mine came from CB Select and they shipped sent the exact same product that was in the store except there was a sticker on the lid that peeled away at half the cover when I took it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a personal preference on the smell, it&#x27;s pretty pungent. I&#x27;m used to Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shaping Cream, but this was half the price. I&#x27;d recommend checking it out at target or your local beauty store before buying on amazon to make sure you like it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased and used this product several times. This was the first time I ever purchased online. In the past I have alway purchased it where I was getting my hair-cut. I thought I would save some money and order online this time. Everything appeared to be in order when I received it, however when I use it it does not hold near as well as the identical one I purchased at the Barber. It seems to be watered down, or mixed with some alternative product.</li>
            <li> I have used many different products over the years (from many different salons, cheap stuff from WalMart, etc.) and this Forming Cream from Crew is one of the better products.  I don&#x27;t understand the complaints about the scent.  All hair products have some scent to them, I am glad that this one is not flowery or fruity smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that is is not a glossy look, but more of a greasy look.  Pomade leaves hair glossy looking, this is more greasy looking.  Holds up well in all weather (rain/wind/etc.) and my hair can be adjusted throughout the day without screwing up the desired \\&quot;messy\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li> While the product doesn’t hold my stubborn Asian hair up, it does a decent job at giving texture and a bit of fluff. However, I can’t really stand the smell at all. A lot of products have a pretty intense smell at application, but this product’s smell lingers throughout the day. With small application, the musky cologne smell still attack my nose nonstop. Even the best smell will become an annoying odor if I have to breath it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> If you know what it&#x27;s supposed to do, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Very, very useful, and very, very fun to use.</li>
            <li> Crew Forming Cream is the hair gel that I prefer to use. Seems to be just right - not too sticky, but gets the job done right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered this product and delivery was really quick.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my long-time stylist to add more style-ability to my short, straight hair. It not only does that, but it also helped keep it in place all day long.</li>
            <li> I like their product and the forming cream is my most favorite. It does not shine your hair but it gives you control of your hair without looking like a wet hair.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.  makes my hair look great.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Doesn&#x27;t work for thick rugged hair.</li>
            <li> Dries a bit hard/crusty which I hate</li>
            <li> This product is great unless you want your hair style to last more than an hour.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how much I use, THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Do your hair and forget about it.</li>
            <li> I have bought and used a few American Crew products. I definitely am a fan, though I was disappointed with the Grooming Cream which was very oily and extremely difficult to style. Thought the American Crew Fiber was solid, smelled good too but the Forming Cream is hands down the best. It smells even better, is easier to rub onto hands and apply to hair. It won&#x27;t weigh hair down and lasts at least 12 hours. It allows you to play with your hair later in the day with a light shine and firm hold. Find a product that works for your hair texture, length, and style. Can&#x27;t go wrong with AC FC.</li>
            <li> I have been using this almost every day for 8 months and I still haven&#x27;t finished it. It&#x27;s a really good product but can act different depending on how you use it.&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for crazy hold, this isn&#x27;t for you. If you want Medium hold/ medium shine, definitely get. If you are looking to use this to keep your hair up all day but still leave it \\&quot;touchable\\&quot;, then do this. When your hair is damp after the shower get a finger tip amount (play around with it to see how much you like), rub it in your hands and then run all through hair. Next blowdry your hair into the \\&quot;upwards\\&quot; style that you want. You might want to finish with a light hairspray. For other styles you can put this in dry or wet and it will keep your hair from sticking out all over the place and gives your hair a healthy shine. If I put in in my hair after the shower and just blowdry it into a regular \\&quot;down\\&quot; style. It makes my wavy fizzy hair, straight and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Make sure you do your research on the product you need for your hair. All AC products are great, but it will be a waste if you buy the wrong product.</li>
            <li> This particular hair cream describes itself as medium hold/shine. I have short, curly hair and it keeps it looking great all. It&#x27;s non greasy, doesn&#x27;t crust up or flake, has a nice masculine smell and washes out very easily. It&#x27;s not the cheapest hair product out there but I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells good, isn&#x27;t too sticky but isn&#x27;t like putting lotion in your hair either. Really good product for both sexes, especially for short hair.</li>
            <li> just a small amount on my finger is all I need.  This will last me for about a year!</li>
            <li> This is quite possibly the best hair styling product I have used. Although it is a bit pricey (hence the 4-star rating), I have never been dissatisfied with the results. It does not make your hair look to greasy, but it does have a little shine to it. Hold last all day without any issue. Also I usually go to the gym at the end of the day and work up a pretty good sweat, the product doesn&#x27;t cause any discomfort and holds relatively well even though there is a lot of sweat (it rinses out easily in the shower if that is a concern). One thing to keep in mind if you purchase this product is to always place the lid on after using so it does not dry out.</li>
            <li> The only thing I use for my hair!  I love it :) Soft to the touch and no clumps or flakes!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I just add a little to my hair.  This product will last me forever given a small amount is all I need each time!</li>
            <li> Excellent hold and washes off easily for me.  Nice scent to it.  Far superior to stiff gels.  But lets be real, if you want your girl to run your hands through it....  Any product designed to hold your hair a certain way is going to be leave a residue and make your hair stiffer than normal.  I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> Used a lot of product in my time. This is always a go to</li>
            <li> Item is exactly the same as I bought in salons and department stores but for a lot less.  Would definitely use this product again.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been overpaying for too long / thanks amazon [...] will buy again when I run out, target has for same price but I don&#x27;t gotta drive there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this daily now for a few years and simply put: this is the best. Done are the days of cheap gel, imitation creams, and budget pomades. American Crew nailed the formula for the perfect hold, sheen, and durability. I work LONG shifts (12 hours at least) and this holds my style (combed and parted classic crew cut) for all of it. When you&#x27;re ready to shower it washes out quickly and easily, leaving little detectable residue. A little goes a long way, so the 3oz. tub lasts me about 8-10 weeks. For the summer when my hair is a bit shorter, this works well for a tussled, messy look, too. It isn&#x27;t the cheapest thing out there, but you won&#x27;t be disappointed once you&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works great ! What more can I say. Don&#x27;t have to use much for it to work. Last a long time. Its the only hair cream Il use.</li>
            <li> First off, I rarely write a review for a product. This sh!t right here is like handing a business card that simply says “I&#x27;ll call you.” This cream be like if you want to make that thick italian hair like mine be on its slick as fuzzle game. Mad Men style or presidential.</li>
            <li> It has a decent hold. Not a lot of shine so good for work place as well. I like this one better than the fiber. I use fiber as well for parties and other occasions. But Forming cream is really good for everyday use. Washing it is easy. Also i do not have white residue or anything even if i leave it overnight. Shipping was fast and quick.</li>
            <li> The only hair product I use. Keeps a good firm hold without looking too shinny. The cost is a bit expensive for hair cream/gel but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Great for guys with thick hair that tends to poof, gives weight that keeps the hair down. also no white flakes from shaking your hair.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair and are trying to give yourself a \\&quot;Mad Men\\&quot; type style but want to skip the greasiness, this is a good product. I wouldn&#x27;t use it for any high hold styles, though. It&#x27;s not a paste. The tub I got smelled pleasant enough (sort of vanilla like) and I like that it&#x27;s water soluble. My fave is still Paul Mitchell Clean Cut.</li>
            <li> I have been told that I have the best hair in the universe. I was once a hair model, and have had multiple stylists as well as barbers, as well as people not in the hair industry tell me that my hair is magnificent. I owe all of my hair to America Crew Forming Cream. People tell me I sometimes use too much gel in my hair, and I reply that I actually use a forming cream. I saw this sternly, and it really catches them off guard, and they usually end up telling me that I have really nice hair regardless.</li>
            <li> Of all the hair products I have tried so far, this is my favorite one.  Great natural look all day long.</li>
            <li> Great hair cream that will hold your hair nice and smooth without the stiff look of hard gel. I just love</li>
            <li> I used this product as directed and it works. Pricey but worth the cash.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I&#x27;ve used many other including American Crew but this one is by far the best one, it gives your hair a sleek shiny look, whilst giving it a firm hold, basically making it possible to make any kind of hairstyle you want.</li>
            <li> product leaked out onto other purchases</li>
            <li> Just a hair cream.  Works for me. A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair in place, it smells good, and it is non-greasy. Just takes a little bit to work so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The America Crew Forming Cream is great. It was recommended to my @ Sportsclip and I have been using it ever since. Before I used the Axe products before it and this is way better. I have extremely thick which grows really quickly. This is great for when my hair is short and I style it in a fohawk. It works just as well when my hair is longer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years - it&#x27;s fantastic. Nice hold without the old school shine.</li>
            <li> My husband and litlte boys used hair gel and it got hard and stiff.  this stuff looks amazing and lasts all day!  i love it</li>
            <li> I came upon this stuff from my son.  I used to use gels that make your scalp itchy because of the alcohol in it.  This doesn&#x27;t have alcohol.  I does have carnauba wax - which gives it the smell.  I happen to like it.  I have *very* thick and fairly short hair - for a woman.  It works great. I put a very small amount in my wet hands and put it in my wet hair.  I am then able to dry then curl my hair into place.  It does an excellent job of holding curls - I use an ethnic curler.  This is the most effective stuff I&#x27;ve ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t hold up well in rain but I really don&#x27;t think anything else does either.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Works great! I use this everyday in my hair.  It holds well and is not greasy.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. Kept my hair in shape for a whole day and smells nice too with little flaking.</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this.</li>
            <li> Best forming cream out there, hands down</li>
            <li> Nice forming cream for someone who has long or thick hair. It does the job well, not more can be said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crew Forming Cream for years. It was recommended to me by a stylist at Great Clips. It doesn&#x27;t clump your hair together like gel, or give the greasy appearance of most gels. Its a good balance of hold and look.</li>
            <li> This product was just OK for me.  I didn&#x27;t really like the smell of the product.  And it didn&#x27;t hold my hair like their other product, known as Fiber.</li>
            <li> Holds all day, and doesn&#x27;t flatten out when wearing headphones most of the day. Moderate shine, for modern hair styles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the forming cream from American Crew for 2 years now. I used to have long hair all through collage and decided to go for a change. I tried many different products, especially the cheaper end ones and found most made my hair look too shinny or greasy. Finally i talked to my hairdresser and she recommended American Crew (I was skeptical about it as i know they get commission from each sale) and i have to say, this is probably one of the best hair products for men with short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years i have tried a few other high end hair products and have been happy with some but at $30 bucks it wasn&#x27;t that much better then the American crew if at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, im sure you would be happy with the end results if YOU HAVE SHORT HAIR. If you have long hair, this product is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use, take a small amount and rub it well into your hands and apply. Works best with dry hair.</li>
            <li> The best hair cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried so many different ones, but I pick this one my favorite. Only need a little each time and your hair looks natural and neat. Short or long hair, doesn&#x27;t matter. It will do the trick. Not greasy at all. Love it!</li>
            <li> I received my order in a very timely manner.  I guessing they were out of the 3 ounce cointainer so i was sent 2 of 1.75 cointainers.  Says alot from this seller when i was sent 2 of the smaller cointainers that cost more instead of just saying that they are out. Product works great and leaves a pleasant smell. Does not leave residue in your hair and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Good product. Cheaper here then in stores</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hair gel, gives it a nice wet look and at the same time the cream is easy to manipulate</li>
            <li> Been using it for years.  I have thick short asian hair.  Product is not too strong or light for hold.  If your hair is somewhat damp then apply the product, it&#x27;s leave a slight shine.  If you don&#x27;t want the shine, just comb it thru.  And no flaking.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, great product!</li>
            <li> My husband uses just a smudge of this and it keeps his hair neat without being sticky.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This works great for styling my hair, and you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li> The best quality at the best price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 years.    2 short observations:    1. American Crew also makes difi distruct, which is the same product but with a better smell (imo, but I think most would agree).    2. If either product is shipped when it&#x27;s too hot outside or left in a hot car, the ingredients will break down and it will be ruined.</li>
            <li> To the multiple positive reviews of this product, let me start with, what product were you using, because it certainly wan&#x27;t this one?!  American Crew Forming Cream is literally the worst product I have ever tried in my lifetime, which includes well over 50 products to date, ranging from gels and glue, to pomades and waxes.  This product has at best a 2/10 hold, a smell of 1/10, and a pliability of 1/10.  You put this into your hair either dry or damp, and it will not do anything but lay there and be greasy, while making you smell like a Super Clips for the entire day.  It also will never dry, so anytime you even glance your hair with your fingertips, prepare to have them covered in foul smelling grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the hold goes specifically, I tried the product for well over a week, and never was I able to keep my hair from falling over longer than 30 minutes.  Generic mousse from Wal-Mart has better hold, smell, and pliability than than this crap.  Overall, this product is a 1/10; I seriously recommend avoiding it entirely and saving your money.  This was very surprising to me given that American Crew Fiber is a 10/10 product.</li>
            <li> When I was cutting my hair at finger length I was using the Grooming Cream. When I went a little longer that got a little intense, so on the advice of my barber I switched over to the Forming Cream and it worked great. Still a good enough hold without nearly as much shine.</li>
            <li> I use this daily on my short (male) hair.  It smells fantastic and I don&#x27;t use anything else.  I hate using gel and hairspray.  I used wax for a bit in college, but this is so much better.  It has a nice waxy cream texture.</li>
            <li> This product works great and even has a nice fragrance too it. You can not go wrong with this brand.</li>
            <li> Update: Since I wrote this, I&#x27;ve changed how I do things. Now, I blow dry my hair bone dry, and then use the defining paste (matte, and holds good with just a tiny spritz of hairspray). I also have some left over forming cream, and it works really well too, just gives the hair a shinier look. For me, that shinier look is nice if I&#x27;m going to a wedding, or dressing up...that sort of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I blow dry the hair in the front up, blow dry the rest totally dry, put some defining paste in my palm, rub my hands together vigorously and warm it up, and then work it into my hair. I love the way the defining paste smells, matte looks nice, and it&#x27;s super easy to get that messy but controlled look. I have slightly wavy hair, not stick straight or curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to leave the rest of my original review below. Funny how the process changes over time! Experiment and have fun, but I personally think the Defining Paste is awesome for matte, and forming cream if you want a little bit of shine (but it&#x27;s harder to work into your bone dry hair, and doesn&#x27;t smell as good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********************************************&lt;br /&gt;Original Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I copy and pasted this from my Pomade review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used four different American Crew wax/pomades, and they are all great. They smell great, and they are relatively inexpensive. The hard part is figuring out...what product is good for what hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone from very short guy hair, to longer guy hair...and as I&#x27;ve done that, the American Crew product that I prefer has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my hair really short, I was using their \\&quot;classic wax,\\&quot; which they no longer make. I started trying their Fiber product on that short hair, and it worked pretty well. Get my hair fairly damp, work the Fiber in, and it would give me good hold...little spike in the front. Another product I was using with my short hair was TIGI Bed Head Men Matte Separation Wax. That stuff is REALLY sticky...which is fine for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I move onto the Pomade, the other thing to consider is...varying the dampness of your hair prior to the product will have a HUGE effect on how it works. For example, you can have your hair fairly damp with the stickier (ie high hold) products, and still be able to work it in really well. As your hair gets drier though, two things happen. The hold becomes even MORE pronounced, but it also becomes harder to work into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as I grew my hair out...the Fiber began to work less well. I had a lot more hair, and because it&#x27;s a \\&quot;higher hold,\\&quot; it actually started to weigh my hair down. Spiking up hair that&#x27;s only an inch or two long worked fine...but as my hair got to 3+ inches, it would start to fall over. And the Fiber is fairly sticky...so your hair needs to be fairly damp to work it in, but then it doesn&#x27;t want to stay up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I will FINALLY talk about the Pomade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to move to a \\&quot;lower hold\\&quot; product...and I wasn&#x27;t used to this at first. I was leaving my hair fairly damp, and putting the pomade into that didn&#x27;t give it much hold at all (though depending the style you want...like a more traditional mad men kind of look without a lot of spike, then that would be fine). I wanted a little more spike and \\&quot;verticalness\\&quot; to my hair, so what I had to do was start drying it more. I&#x27;ve started using a blow dryer to \\&quot;train\\&quot; my hair in the direction I want, and to get it much drier (not 100% dry, but maybe 75%). Now the pomade has much more hold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other product I&#x27;ve been using is the Forming Cream. It&#x27;s similar to the pomade...but a little less shiny. It has worked well in my longer hair, and like I said before...to get any hold, I need my hair drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will probably have to try a couple different products until you find the one you really like. But before you give up on any one product, vary the dampness of your hair first. Hopefully my experience will point you in the right direction. For short hair, use the high hold products with damp hair. For longer hair, use the low hold products with drier hair.</li>
            <li> I was attempting to buy American Crew Fiber, and mistakenly purchased the Forming Cream because the color on the main photo of this listing is very blueish, which is the color of the Fiber, and not green, the color of the Forming Cream. I attempted to return the items (I bought two), and the seller did not accept a refund. I should&#x27;ve read the text, I&#x27;m aware, but it&#x27;s too bad they couldn&#x27;t accept a refund on a brand new, unopened item.</li>
            <li> This is the same ol&#x27; stuff my husband always uses. It tames his Harry Potter hair while not making it greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way! I take a small amount (dime size) and spread into my hands then through hair. It has a medium hold strength and provides a little shine without looking oily. Smell is fine too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years.  Would recommend this entire brand and all of their products.</li>
            <li> Good product, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Smell too big. Like being in a hair salon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in styling my sons&#x27; hair.  It adds texture, and is good enough for shaping when their hair is short, but when it grows out the hold is weak and at the end of the day their hair is in greasy bed-head mode.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well!  Highly recommend to anyone.  Goes on and keeps working until you wash it off.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband, he was almost out of last container &amp; was very happy to see I bought more!</li>
            <li> All of the Crew products are great, so you can&#x27;t really go wrong with any of them. But I think this is my favorite - you don&#x27;t need much of it and it provides and awesome hold without looking like you have a ton of product in your hair.</li>
            <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- Firm hold and no shine.&lt;br /&gt;- Mostly fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Depending on how much you use/how often, this can dry out before you use all of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protip:&lt;br /&gt;This cream is TSA checkpoint compliant (I bring this with me on my carry on and have never had a problem). In the past, I have had occasional problems with getting American Crew Forming Cream through.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for about 5 years.  Good hold without leaving hair greasy or shiny. Leaves hair with slight tacky feeling, allows to be reshaped even hours later.  Forming cream is less effective when over-worked into hair.  Apply when hair is slightly damp for best shaping and hold, only takes a dime sized dollop for medium length mens haircut.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, allows for a little movement through the day and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Probably good for shorter hair, but the product did not suit me.</li>
            <li> Best all around hair product I have ever used over the last 25 years. Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I am a very high maintenance individual that spends countless hours in perfecting my overall appearance. In doing so I came across the American crew foaming cream by accident when Amazon shipped it instead of the American crew fiber gel. Regardless of the mistake I decided to experiment and found the product worked fabulous with the style of my hair. I have very straight hair that is poofy, therfore styling can be a bit problematic at times. Although I spend time doing my hair and this product is very easy to work with and gives a great result. My only complaint is the scent of the gel, it is not appealing as others I have used. You must be very careful when handeling this gel as if you use to much it will make your hair look white, sticky, spikey and unnatural. Overall I have used this gel now for over a year and love it.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this, as I don&#x27;t like the look many other products left in my hair. I can keep my hair looking dry and still maintain good hold. Other products I&#x27;ve tried have always left my hair looking wet, greasy, or hard. This stuff keeps your hair in place without looking like there is gunk in your hair.</li>
            <li> If you have a crazy thick head of hair, this is the right stuff to buy. I require a cut every other week and this stuff hasn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> LOOOVE this product!!! It works very well. My hair is very soft. Have been looking for a product that holds but doesn&#x27;t glue everything together. Have tried several other products and this is the best that I have had so far. You don&#x27;t need a lot of it and it can hold very well with natural shine.</li>
            <li> After trying many types of forming creams, I like this one a lot.  It smells good, is not sticky after a few minutes, and it doen&#x27;t take long to set.</li>
            <li> Worked great. I use this along with LS&amp;B Disorder to give me the old and the shine I desire. Using this alone is not an option with how thick my hair is. If your hair isn&#x27;t as thick you&#x27;ll be able to throw this in and not have to worry for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Bounced around on various hair creams for awhile until I found this. Think I&#x27;ve ordered about five containers in a row now. definitely my go to from now on. And you get a lot the cream for the price.</li>
            <li> Great product. Highly recomended.</li>
            <li> A small dab works perfectly for my thick head of hair and provides the right amount of hold throughout the day.  I find that it works best when applied to wet hair, although I have used it on dry hair along with a splash of water to help spread the cream through my hair.  The scent is defintely not overwhelming, in fact it&#x27;s pretty mild, which is exactly what I want in a hair cream.  With almost daily use, the 3 ounce jar is still 1/4 full after nine months.  A great deal considering the price.</li>
            <li> Amazing price for a great product.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, the container was 1/2 empty. Sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> Previously I used American Crew Defining Paste. Note that the Defining Paste is a lot more solid than the Forming Cream; as a result, it is hard to apply the Defining Paste in cold weather. On the other hand, the Forming Cream is more liquidity and is easy to apply in any weather condition (temperature-wise).&lt;br /&gt;Although the product states that it has medium shine, it looks more like a matte low shine when the product dries. If the product is applied properly, people could not tell that I used a wax or gel for my hair!</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible. It&#x27;s the very first product I ever used before realizing there is better stuff out there. It&#x27;s thick, greasy, clunky and does not spread well, and does not hold well. It made my hair feel dirty and was very hard to get out. It&#x27;s my absolute last resort for styling my hair.</li>
            <li> First look at the picture of the item I received and what is for first thought of it? For me, it did not look right at all. The surface of the gel should be flat but it wasn&#x27;t. The gel was all over the inner side of the cap/lid. You can see It was 1/3 emptied. I used this product before and I LOVE IT. However this time, my item wasn&#x27;t like what it was supposed to be. Lucky, Amazon make it right and the loss go to the third party.</li>
            <li> I recently moved to using this after using Crew Pomade for years, I like this much better, though I loved the pomade as well. Much easier to style dry hair with this one.</li>
            <li> This stuff gets the job done.  It works great, actually.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s pretty expensive.  I know that good products usually cost good money, but get a tube of groom &amp; clean on here or at the grocery store for a couple bucks and you&#x27;ll find that it gets the job done even better than this.</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than expected. I&#x27;ve used the product before so obviously I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> personally I love this! Since it is waterbased it isn&#x27;t as permanent as the Molding Clay, which is what I moved to, but I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Holds without feeling greasy</li>
            <li> The package and shipping was good. However, I was a little disappointed at the product because it wasn&#x27;t able to make my hair shiny for the whole day, it was shiny for an hour or two, then the shine went away. It does do a good job of holding the hair throughout the whole day.</li>
            <li> It is true that this product is great in shaping hair without being too greasy, stiff, or other problems.  In that regard, it seems totally ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the smell is very much the smell of a barbershop, like the smell of talcum powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happen to loathe that smell.  Some people love it I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I can&#x27;t imagine wanting to broadcast that one smells like talcum powder to the world, which is what this product does.  Is one trying to convey that one recently went to the barbershop?  That one has a dry, talcum covered body?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what everyone is talking about in these reviews. After reading all these stellar reviews I was convinced to purchase this product, American Crew Forming Cream. Hearing things like the cast of Mad Men (a show i love) tipped the scales for me and I decided to order this product. The first thing I noticed is that it smells like an OLD MAN. WHY WOULD ANY COMPANY MAKE A HAIR PRODUCT THAT SMELLS LIKE OLD MAN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this had a scent it would be called \\&quot;90 year old man, residing dustily in nursing home\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make things worse, this product does nothing... provides no volume, no shine...I have medium hair and this product is simply to weak to be of any use. I can&#x27;t but feel as though everyone who enjoyed product must have switched from AXE hair products or something similar because they have no clue what a terrible and worthless product this is. MAYBE if you have short hair, this product will MAYBE shape your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a solid hair product, especially if you have medium hair +, as in hair 2 inches or longer, you will want to try this product instead&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Mandom-Gatsby-Moving-Rubber-Shake/dp/B000V2ACHI/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1346134324&amp;sr&#x3D;8-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;gatsby&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it is mostly for asians, the smell is much nicer, the hold is AMAZING for being PLIABLE. the term \\&quot;MOVING RUBBER\\&quot; is so appropriate as it moves with your hair. you can re adjust throughout the day if it becomes messy through walking on campus, and will last as long as you are in class.</li>
            <li> Significantly cheaper than Target and other stores. Great customer service too. I accidentally ordered the wrong product and they were able to resolve my issue in a timely matter.</li>
            <li> Very good product. lasts the whole day and makes my hair shiny and nice. I have medium to short hair and this product is perfect. I am not very interested in the smell, but it is not too bad... I can live with it. remember: you must apply the cream on a dry hair for best results;;; won&#x27;t work if your hair is still wet....</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product</li>
            <li> I used gel for years,until a stylist put some of this stuff in my new &#x27;do.  It&#x27;s not so crunchy and can be re-styled simply by wetting your hands.  Holds great, but doesn&#x27;t look too slick or get too stiff.</li>
            <li> This gel is simply amazing. I have been using it for years. Not only does it have a light hold and keeps your hair from feeling &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;, but it also smells incredible. It almost has a cologne type smell to it. I assume it&#x27;s sandalwood. Regardless, this is the only gel I have ever used that did not get crunchy smelled good enough that girls always compliment me and usually end up sniffing my hair. Well worth the somewhat expensive price.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but doesn&#x27;t hold strongly.</li>
            <li> I work in an office setting and I need to keep it professional. Which means no strong scent and no greasy pomade look. But I have longish hair up front (1960s style) and I want a natural looking hold. Gels fail by 2pm (and often flake like dandruff) while hair spray is done before lunch; neither does anything other than glue the hair in place. This forming cream is just about perfect for me. I&#x27;ve tried alternatives (mostly in the name of saving a buck) like Suave styling paste and Tabac cream. These are OK but can&#x27;t rep;ace the American Crew product. I apply it to mostly dry hair (a little blow dry up front for volume) and then apply a dab to my hands and cover both palms with it. Then I rub it through the hair, adding a little water if I need it. A quick comb and a part and I&#x27;m good. I usually muss up the part for a casual look. My hair stays styled if nothing disturbs it. If I get into some strong winds or work has me scratching my head I can easily clean it up with a pocket comb. It washes out easily (I don&#x27;t use shampoo on my hair) unlike pomade. If I skip a shower one day it doesn&#x27;t combine with my hairs oils to form a greasy mat but always seems to work in-spite of it. My only complaint is the price but it&#x27;s still much cheaper than the fancier salon brands.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s new barber recommended this and we absolutely love it.  It holds his hair in shape without the dreaded tacky shine that many other products, even high dollar products, do.  Plus, it has a delicious scent to boot!</li>
            <li> Good product for the price, holds strong throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I quit using gel and hairspray about 3 months ago and have only been using American Crew products. Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey but I am 110% satisfied. My hair feels healthy and not dry. I never get dandruff but with gel or hairspray, I always use hairspray. American Crew makes a few different kinds but this one is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I would recommend this to almost any single one of my male clients. Looks very natural if you put it in your hair when it&#x27;s dry and if you want more of a shiny look put it in when it&#x27;s damp. And not to mention it smells great.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend and he is very pleased with it, and so am I!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has pretty thick hair and had been using gel in his hair which made it extremely hard and crunchy and that strange \\&quot;always wet\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got him this cream and he couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it! It holds even his thick hair and is still soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that it still has that \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look to it. But a great product and you won&#x27;t beat the Amazon price!</li>
            <li> My order have hidden cost, to expansive</li>
            <li> Great hair product for fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and product was a advertised.</li>
            <li> What can I say.  I have been using this product well over 2 years now and love it.  Can&#x27;t beat the price of it here on Amazon compared to going to the normal beauty supply or markets that charge almost $18...not including tax.  Definitely will be buying more from here instead of the stores.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product and the price on Amazon is so much better than buying it at Floyd&#x27;s Barbershop.</li>
            <li> it was recommended to me. I m very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> I like the product, I just wish it had a little more stiffness to it</li>
            <li> Great product at far lower price than retail</li>
            <li> Love the smell, not too strong. Reduces frizz without otherwise being able to tell it is there. No grease.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try out an alternative to the Aveda creme I was using, since the Aveda was waaaayyyy more expensive. This stuff worked alright, but it sat in my car (in luggage) and broke because it was exposed to heat. It became a weird, gluey goop.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I&#x27;ve used it for years but hard to find in stores anymore. I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect and it&#x27;s exactly what is says it is. I am very satisfied and my boyfriend uses it everyday. Thank you</li>
            <li> Crew forming cream is the only hair cream I use.  It gives medium shine &amp; has the strength to stand hair up.  It keeps the hair soft &amp; never hardens like other gels.  I like a natural look with a little shine, this product is one of the best.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product...been searching for a cream that would hold constantly all day long. This gives me additional body and very good hold...smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Not bad. It&#x27;s better then the axe natural look cream.</li>
            <li> Great product, but it leaks! Be careful when you&#x27;re travelling as if it this gets shifted on it&#x27;s side or upside down it&#x27;ll leak right through the screw threads.</li>
            <li> Its smell good but it won&#x27;t work that well it won&#x27;t stay along time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that gets curly.  This stuff will keep the curls and frizzy down and hold the shape I want.</li>
            <li> I look so hot with this stuff in my hair!  Makes me look like a movie star.  Washes out easy so I can reapply like ten times in the morning, and keep looking hot hot hot!</li>
            <li> Meh. Its ok. I have short hair and was expecting a little more shine. The hold is low-medium.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell very good either... it has a mildly pleasant chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I prefer the AXE line of hair cream / pomade better.</li>
            <li> This is what I have been looking for! It let&#x27;s you pull the front of your hair up (kind of like a spike) but it doesn&#x27;t give you the greasy or shiny look. I have a full head of hair but my hair is fine and can sometimes be frizzy. This helps me control it. Perfect! Also - it is SUPER strong. So you only need to use a little. It should last a long time. The only problem I ran into is that straight out of the box it smells very good but is overpowering. It gave me a headache at first when I used it. To fix this I simply left the lid off for a couple of hours (not too long you don&#x27;t want it to dry out) and then it still had its pleasant scent without being so overpowering. Overall this is a GREAT product and I will order again!</li>
            <li> I have medium length (2.5 inches) hair and this works great for styling my hair to the side. A little goes a long way with this stuff, so the 3oz container usually lasts 1.5 months.</li>
            <li> American CREW is the best!  It doesn&#x27;t leave a thick build up on your hair and yet it holds your style.  The price was right at AMAZON too....I think I saved about 5 or 6 dollars on each jar.  EXCELLENT product at an EXCELLENT PRICE!</li>
            <li> I truly llike it. It gives a perfect control to my hair. If you want something to complement this product, the grooming spray would be the ideal product for you. Stay Manly.</li>
            <li> Husband uses this all the time. I wish they were sold in bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses this daily and I decided to started buying on Amazon to save some money. His hair looks amazing and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> Great for Styling Hair and at a great price</li>
            <li> Looks good and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
            <li> this is my go to cream.  Not greasy.  Not too weak.  Not too shiny.  Perfect middle ground.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and this stuff works to style it. The only downside is that your hair feels kinda sticky.</li>
            <li> I think I found my new favorite hair product.  It provides good hold that lasts all day &amp; I think it smells pretty good!  I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman and I bought this for my boyfriend. I love the powder fresh smell and the way it makes his hair form without hardening his hair when it is set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This is the best cream I&#x27;ve found for styling my hair. Holding power is great but not as strong as the grooming cream. The grooming cream is greasy and smells more unpleasant. This one smells more like a pleasant lotion and doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;greaser&amp;#34; look to your hair, but yet it has good holding power. It feels more creamier than the grooming cream which feels like greasy wax or lard. I have medium length hair so it works fine for me. I wish I discovered this a lot sooner, because I have thick hair which is stubborn for styling after taking showers. This cream makes it easy to style and doesn&#x27;t leave any &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; like sprays do. I don&#x27;t use a lot at a time, so I get great mileage for the size you get......would buy again when I need more.</li>
            <li> My go-to hair gel. No qualms about this product.</li>
            <li> This is great to use if you&#x27;re looking to style your hair with a &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; type hold that doesn&#x27;t harden like a lot of the white glue hair gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> great product that works well with my hair since I am losing my hair in the last few years. I use this and a little bit goes a long way and it acutally hides my thinning bald spot at the top of my head. great product for control and medium shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the classic Palmade before: it was okay, but I was looking for something a bit less &#x27;heavy&#x27;.  I used some Davines No. 2 for Wizards from a salon for a while and liked that - it was light, not very noticeable, and washed out very easily.  I tried this &#x27;Forming Cream&#x27; hoping that it would be more like the Davines.  It is not.  My hair is a bit dry and hard to manage (thick and gray).  I find the &#x27;Forming Cream&#x27; to be far too fragrant, and it feels very greasy in my hair.  It is also difficult for me to wash out.  I really don&#x27;t put much in my hair at all - just barely get a bit on the end of one finger - but it always seems like too much.  I admit that I don&#x27;t know much about styling hair, so maybe I just chose the wrong product; based on the description I was expecting a better match for my needs.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. Gives a good matte finish to my hair, which I wanted to begin with. Gives good hold. Works best if blow dried after applied.</li>
            <li> My review title is my honest assessment of what this feels like. You know when you leave butter out of the fridge and it gets warm and soft? That&#x27;s about the consistency of this goop. And yet it has a weird stringyness like it has glue in it. It smells like cold cream to me, which was not a good thing. Worst of all, it felt terrible in my hair. At first it was sticky and didn&#x27;t blend in easily, and it made my hands sticky so I had to wash them. When it dried it made my hair crunchy. After I worked my fingers through it to get the crunchyness out, it felt greasy like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in ages. I guess it just doesn&#x27;t work with my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like other American Crew products, but for my purposes this is the worst hair product I&#x27;ve ever tried. I got it in a pack of two, and I&#x27;m literally planning to throw them both in the trash if my wife doesn&#x27;t want them.</li>
            <li> Holds great and makes hair look nice not crunchy like gel. It provides a consistent look day to day.</li>
            <li> Light weight cream that is low sheen and great hold.  I have very straight, shorter hair (I have my cut used with a 2 guard).  Top of hair style is blended to have enough to part on top.  This forming cream offers a nice alternative to gel that creates a spiky look (that I do not care for) and pomade (that may be too hard to blend).  Needs to be used after the hair is dry.  Not suggested to be applied with hair is wet.  Too unpredictable and limits its holding effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crew Forming Cream for more that 2 years, and I really like it.  Be careful not to use too much in a single application, though.  A small amount goes a long way</li>
            <li> Great product and much more convenient ordering it from Amazon  than waiting for my hairdresser to order it.</li>
            <li> Best hair product in the world.</li>
            <li> USED IT FOR YEARS-SWITCHED TRIED ANOTHER WELL KNOWN PRODUCT-SHOULDA STUCK WITH CREW!!! IT WORKS-AND ITS NOT MESSY</li>
            <li> Its the best try it..</li>
            <li> Crew cream was not sticky, greasy, or stiff.  It kept the style of the hair all day.  3 0unces lasted more than 3 months. better than crew body.</li>
            <li> The product works as advertised, I was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;On a side note it takes a while to get used to how much to use for your hair.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely fantastic forming cream. It keeps your hair &#x27;workable&#x27; as long as you don&#x27;t go to sleep, at which point you&#x27;ll need to shower to regain control :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would caution is that I had a pair of Original Penguin sunglasses with a white plastic frame which started to turn pinkish along the stems which were in contact with my hair. Obviously some funny chemical reaction going on there, and it wasn&#x27;t too noticeable (so no 4-star demotion), but probably worth mentioning for those of you who wear sunglasses with white plastic frames. Apart from that minor detail, it smells good (in no way overwhelming) and a little goes a long way. If you&#x27;re still on the fence, give one of the smaller sizes a try first.</li>
            <li> Styles nicely, holds GREAT. Only complaints is at the end of the day, I have to wash this stuff out of my hair, otherwise my pillow would get greasy and my forehead would break out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the American Crew Fiber and Pomade.  This product, the &amp;#34;Forming Cream&amp;#34; I would describe as the middle, the perfect balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick, somewhat coarse, yet soft.  I wear my hair short, almost like a buzz and usually let it grow longer so that I can comb it over (by longer I&#x27;m talking 4-5 inches on the top, sometimes more).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like about Fiber is that it can be too clay like and usually made my hair too stiff.  I found fiber to work best the shorter my hair was, but even then it was a super strong and stiff hold.  It was actually working as intended, but not to my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like about Pomade was the high shine and depending on how much used, greasy feel to my hair.  And once again, you buy Pomade for the shine, so working as intended but not to my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The forming cream (this product) works awesome.  It mixes well into your hands for applying.  It&#x27;s very easy to work with.  My hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy yet stays in place all day.  It keeps my hair looking and feeling natural.  It blows in the wind yet returns to place when I run my hand through my hair to fix it.  It provides hold whether my hair is long or short.  Almost no shine, which I prefer, and has a very slight coconut smell.  The amount provided in one container will easily last me about a year.  For the price, it is well worth it.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using molding crème for something like 10+ years now and I still haven’t found anything better for my hair. My hair is thick and straight (thanks, Asian genetics!) and I’ve worn it high and tight all the way to a full-blown pompadour. This stuff always works, for virtually all hair styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One trick I’ve learned is to put a little in damp hair and then blow dry to manage and add texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little dab goes a long way and it washes out easily.</li>
            <li> This smells great, just like all the American Crew products. A little goes a long way. This container will probably last me a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Great product. Not to greasy feeling for hair.</li>
            <li> Buy lots of this because it works and it&#x27;s a good gift for the guy who likes a little body cream. The price is excellent.</li>
            <li> love the hold and great scent</li>
            <li> I have tried other product lines from stores and online. Nothing compares to American Crew Forming Cream. Amazing stuff with perfect shine and holding power. Save yourself some time. Put one in your cart and look no where else.</li>
            <li> The American Crew is the one and only forming cream I use. No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> Best stuff for my husband&#x27;s and boys&#x27; hair!</li>
            <li> WOW, I never thought I&#x27;d find a product that makes my hair LOOK SO GOOD!  And the fragrance it great, too!!</li>
            <li> this is a great deal! buy it without a thought no questions asked. just buy this now and it will make your hair the best thing ever</li>
            <li> He is very happy, keeps buying it once he runs out.  After a while it hardens so you need to use it before it does.</li>
            <li> I accidentially bought it instead of the original target: Fiber but it turned out that the cream is really amazing if you use it together with the fiber.</li>
            <li> Started using this on the advice of my stylist.  I have short, fine hair and it is getting thinner.  This product gives my hair volume and holds it in place with a dry look, whereas gel causes the hair to stick together and appears thinner than it really is with a wet look.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with any American Crew product, and this is no exception.  Authentic forming cream.  Recommended.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I really like the sheen of this stuff (I have about inches of hair on top of my undercut). the hold isn&#x27;t quite I like, but this product is serviceable.</li>
            <li> This goop keeps my dome piece as fresh as Don Draper. Just put a little dab in your palm and run it through your locks and bam!</li>
            <li> Husband loves this. Makes his hair nice without being overly gel like.</li>
            <li> I have thick and wavy hair an this stuff holds great. I use it from hair lengths of 3/4 to almost 2 inches and get a great style and sustained hold. Used on hair that is damp and almost dry,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 15 years. Best hair wax ever made! Clean and washes from your hands easy</li>
            <li> Great price!  Would hae paid more in the store for it.  GREAT Great Great great great great great great price!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cream! It&#x27;s the only one he will use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any product in my hair for the past 5 years. I decided to grow my hair out, but that decision wasn&#x27;t made long ago so it is still rather short. When i use the forming cream it keeps my hair in place and doesn&#x27;t flake/get white when you scratch your head. I think you just have to get used to it, especially if you haven&#x27;t used product much in the recent past. Overall I dig it</li>
            <li> Perfect for me,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a staying cream and make your hair feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is designed this way,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and works perfectly for my hard hair which always a pain to keep a style.</li>
            <li> I have thick semi curly hair and most of the things that work on me leave my hair greasy or rock hard. This stuff takes care of that, its almost the consistency of lotion and goes on easily. Smells great and you can form your hair what ever way you want, plus when it drys your hair is soft and looks great.</li>
    </ol>
