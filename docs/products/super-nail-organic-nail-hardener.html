            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It is a fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>This product is simply the best.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many products from drugstores, Ulta, beauty shops, and nothing can compare to DeLore nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>enough said Delore has a variety of uses, nail hardener, great for cuticles and most importantly for me a great nail dryer</li>
            <li>I am systemically allergic to gluten, for sure.  </li>
            <li>My cuticles are in much better condition as well.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I tried every no-chip top coat out</li>
            <li>But using this along with Nailtique&#x27;s Formula 2 on a regular basis has greatly improved the quality of my nails!</li>
            <li>My cuticles are looking fantastic!</li>
            <li>Does an okay job of hardening nails.</li>
            <li>love it for years</li>
            <li>I remember this stuff but wasn&#x27;t too sure on the name</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Over the many years I have used DeLore Oil, I have found additional benefits.  </li>
            <li>more even texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first bottle lasted 4 months, but now that my nails are in good shape</li>
            <li>and my nails were becoming smoother.  </li>
            <li>great quality, great fast service, would do business with these folks again, may order a second one as a gift.</li>
            <li>Really good product and natural!!!</li>
            <li>Super folks !</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t think would still be available anyways.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive, and has wonderful, natural, simple ingredients.</li>
            <li>The Go\\&quot; top coat in conjunction works great and also helps your manicure dry fast.  </li>
            <li>I love this so much</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>and they are very well hydrated and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for many years and was concerned that I might not find it, but thanks to Amazon, I did.</li>
            <li>It helped tremendously to strengthen and protect my nails.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for over 6 months every day and my nails are still soft, ridged, and tear and break very easily.</li>
            <li>nails used to grow fast and strong in my teens and 20&#x27;s, but the 30&#x27;s+ have slowed them down.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>it works better than any product i&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li>I remember using this product years ago with success, so my fingers are crossed.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s also an organic, natural product.</li>
            <li>It can be effective applied shortly after polishing to speed drying.</li>
            <li>I love the fact it&#x27;s all natural and organic.</li>
            <li>The price is worth it and the vitamins help your grow nails grow strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>yeah, right.  </li>
            <li>put this all over my nails and cuticles right before I go to bed faithfully every night.</li>
            <li>Has never failed me.</li>
            <li>I would love an opportunity to weigh in at a future time.  </li>
            <li>My nails are MUCH stronger and whiter, and I have NO peeling!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost finished my first bottle.  </li>
            <li>They also seem more prone to breaking, and I have had to cut them very short.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use as a cuticle softener, nail helper and actually also helps dry polish faster..</li>
            <li>I also discovered that if I brush it over minor cuts or scabs, they heal faster with better</li>
            <li>They chip and break once they get a certain length</li>
            <li>DeLore is not only good for your nails and skin, it actually healed a callus / fissure on the palm of my hand that had developed after 4 months on crutches, and lasted for 15 years!</li>
            <li>years ago that really worked to strengthen nails but could not remember the name, but thought she would recognize the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I have NO IDEA if it works, because it gently tipped over onto my desk, and the glass busted apart spilling everywhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen much improvement.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and it dries it fast</li>
            <li>My nails are so much stronger now.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was strange because it was more like an oil than a clear polish (which is what I assumed the consistency would be.)  </li>
            <li>&quot; long, strong, bendable, none of them broke during the winter.  </li>
            <li>am online to order a second bottle but thought it worth the time to write this review first.</li>
            <li>Helps to dry nails quickly and softens and helps maintain nice-looking cuticles!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous because it works to strengthen nails, mend cuticles, and to dry polish.</li>
            <li>which is my main reason for using but also after a manicure you need moisture.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a nail hardener that I wouldn&#x27;t have to wear like polish, since I&#x27;ve used those before and while they work, I don&#x27;t like to have to polish my nails all the time since the polish peels off the tips right away, even after using those hardeners a long time, and cleaning nails with 92%alcohol first and using a binder before polish.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>This product is like a light oil to put on your nails before I use the other product.</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars only because the nail-hardening aspect is pretty temporary.</li>
            <li>and I hadn&#x27;t known before that this can be used right after painting to make the color dry faster just like quick dry drops.</li>
            <li>I apply a clear coat of top coat in the middle of the week to make my manicure last to the following Saturday.  </li>
            <li>The real struggle is winter in Minnesota, they become brittle, break, split, peel, I gave up and literally filed them down to the nail bed for the entire winter,,,only for a special occasions</li>
            <li>Dries nails immediately and keeps cuticles soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Keeps cuticles soft and nails shiny</li>
            <li>I had an old bottle of this stuff</li>
            <li>The tips of several nails are very visibly peeling in layers like an onion.</li>
            <li>I do my nails on and off and for a long time now every time I try a new quick dry</li>
            <li>You can buy it at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply now, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in drug stores for the past several years.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff, I&#x27;m on my third bottle, I am not very careful after I paint my nails</li>
            <li>, my nails go back to their normal, flexible state.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to believe it was this easy of a treatment.</li>
            <li>Leaves hands very soft especially around edges of nail and the nail bed.</li>
            <li>You can use it alone, but if used with other nail polishes either over or under, it seem to cause the other polish to come off easily.  </li>
            <li>I wear nail polish often, but since my hands are in water a lot, I do have bare nails for days at a time.  </li>
            <li>will say I think this product makes my nails grow faster, just not harder.</li>
            <li>I also love that the ingredients are not full of harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I occasionally have very small nicks on the tips, but I just lightly buff them out with a crystal</li>
            <li>As you know natural nail manicures dont last as long</li>
            <li>My nails turn up like little spoons so are very prone to catch on things.</li>

            <li> My nails turn up like little spoons so are very prone to catch on things.</li>
            <li> a bit oily and hard to paint over if not applied just right</li>
            <li> Granted, I am very hard on my nails, and they are never very long, but I feel they are usually a little more resilient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now several months later I have had long nails again, like I did prior to taking these medications.</li>
            <li> Only reason I gave it four stars is because the brush applicator is really long and flimsy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every brand there is hoping to stop my nails from splitting in half and being so soft.</li>
            <li> I always apply very generously after 4 coats of polish, 1 base, 2 color and 1 top coat</li>
            <li> My nails were not only paper thin and splitting like normal when you remove acrylic, but they were so sensitive to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I have never had any trouble with my nails peeling before, and that is exactly what has started happening the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> It definitely does dry your nail polish!</li>
            <li> You brush it on and rub it into your cuticles, don&#x27;t have to worry if you get your hands wet within a short time as it immediately adheres and soaks into your nail bed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for 25 plus years &amp; just purchased again as I am allowing my nails a break from long term acrylic use.</li>
            <li> so this is a must if you want to shorten the time it takes to wait for your nails to dry.  </li>
            <li> I never new</li>
            <li> so I thought what do I have to loose.</li>
            <li> but this woman drilled down into my actual nail bed.  </li>
            <li> It is a thick, clear liquid, almost like baby oil.  </li>
            <li> Other nail hardeners use formaldahyde which I want no part of.</li>
            <li> and then Drug Emporium closed down</li>
            <li> I hoped to cut the use down by now, but still need to use it twice a day.  </li>
            <li> It is NOT a nail hardener or dryer in the conventional way ( like OPI Nail Envy / Sally Hansen&#x27;s Tough As Nails that actually makes your nails harder upon application or any type of spray that dries nails faster ).</li>
            <li> if it helps the health of my nails, I was looking for a natural clear coat and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> What a mess and a waste.</li>
            <li> I ran across this little bugger and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky or messy almost like rubbing baby oil in but the results are incredible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought already a few and also gave them to my friends.</li>
            <li> It dried your nails and moisturized your cuticles.</li>
            <li> I almost feel like it makes it so stiff that my nails break quicker.</li>
            <li> past October I was complaining to a friend about the onset of winter and saying good-bye to what little nails I had managed to grow over the summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> My nails are weak, split and peeling due to lack of gluten, I believe.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually go for colors</li>
            <li> Not sure why Delore has a color like vegetable oil now, but it works just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a week, and I feel my nails are less weak and peeling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to apply.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 20 years - IT WORKS like nothing else you can buy anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I have used DeLore Nail Hardner and Drier for at least 30 years.</li>
            <li> I too have been using this product for at least 20 years and me too</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month though,and my results have been mostly negative.</li>
            <li> I was desperately trying to make my flimsy nails harder.</li>
            <li> First, I have terrible nails-- always have.</li>
            <li> It can be used on bare nails to condition nails and cuticles, but not as a base coat.</li>
            <li> this is a secret that should be spread.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s having thin, cracked, ridged nails.</li>
            <li> That is probably because my nails are thin though.</li>
            <li> May seem expensive; it lasts forever.  </li>
            <li> My nails constantly chipped or broke off, but the worst was the peeling--- like an onion.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this, but thought I had nothing to use.</li>
            <li> I still recommend this product to anyone who is trying to find strength in their sad looking nails</li>
            <li> Bad packaging, no idea if the product works or not.</li>
            <li> I must confess I am shocked at how well this works!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product. Never without it. Has never failed me. Dries nails immediately and keeps cuticles soft and supple. Winner</li>
            <li> this is a instant nail protector and hardener - and it&#x27;s organic. it works better than any product i&#x27;ve tried so far.  this is a secret that should be spread.</li>
            <li> This may be marketed as a nail polish drier, but I use it to moisturize my cuticles.  It is a fantastic product!  In 20 years, I have not found anything else that works as well. When my brother went mountain climbing and messed up his hands, he asked me for suggestions on what would help, and I gave him a bottle of this.  It worked!</li>
            <li> For 25 years I&#x27;ve tried to grow nails longer than 1/4\\&quot; without them breaking or splitting.  The real struggle is winter in Minnesota, they become brittle, break, split, peel, I gave up and literally filed them down to the nail bed for the entire winter,,,only for a special occasions I would buy a set of temporary nails so my fingers didn&#x27;t look like nubs, embarassing.&lt;br /&gt;My nails used to grow fast and strong in my teens and 20&#x27;s, but the 30&#x27;s+ have slowed them down.&lt;br /&gt;This past October I was complaining to a friend about the onset of winter and saying good-bye to what little nails I had managed to grow over the summer. She said her sister used a product 30+ years ago that really worked to strengthen nails but could not remember the name, but thought she would recognize the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;So she went on-line and found the DeLore nails and ordered a bottle for my birthday in November, \\&quot;happy birthday to me\\&quot;, she guaranteed it works.&lt;br /&gt;I immediately began brushing it on my nails once, sometimes twice, daily in the evening while watching TV. You brush it on and rub it into your cuticles, don&#x27;t have to worry if you get your hands wet within a short time as it immediately adheres and soaks into your nail bed.  It&#x27;s not sticky or messy almost like rubbing baby oil in but the results are incredible.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now March and my nails look like a hand model.  They are 1/2\\&quot; long, strong, bendable, none of them broke during the winter.  This product is simply the best. I have tried many, many products from drugstores, Ulta, beauty shops, and nothing can compare to DeLore nails.&lt;br /&gt;I am online to order a second bottle but thought it worth the time to write this review first. The first bottle lasted 4 months, but now that my nails are in good shape I only brush it on a couple times a week. Total believer I am, and I don&#x27;t rave about products unless they work,,, you can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 20 years - IT WORKS like nothing else you can buy anywhere.  May seem expensive; it lasts forever.  You can buy it at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply now, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in drug stores for the past several years.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Threw it out</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for over 20 years....enough said Delore has a variety of uses, nail hardener, great for cuticles and most importantly for me a great nail dryer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it helps the health of my nails, I was looking for a natural clear coat and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It is much different than anything else on the market. It revitalizes and strengthens nail.. plus it contains vitamins.. love it!</li>
            <li> I have celiac disease, therefore allergic to gluten.  This is an experiment for me that could go either way.  My nails are weak, split and peeling due to lack of gluten, I believe.  Since there is wheat oil in this product, I think this product could go either way for me.  I am systemically allergic to gluten, for sure.  I have been using the product for a week, and I feel my nails are less weak and peeling.  I would love an opportunity to weigh in at a future time.  I remember using this product years ago with success, so my fingers are crossed.</li>
            <li> THE BEST NAIL PRODUCT EVER! I have used DeLore Nail Hardner and Drier for at least 30 years. It&#x27;s fabulous because it works to strengthen nails, mend cuticles, and to dry polish. It WORKS!</li>
            <li> I had one of those nightmare experiences when I had my acrylic nails removed.  The salon technician used a drill to remove some of the stubborn pieces of acrylic.  I&#x27;ve had this done before but this woman drilled down into my actual nail bed.  Really deep on a couple of nails.  My nails were not only paper thin and splitting like normal when you remove acrylic, but they were so sensitive to the touch.  I used this product every day until the damaged nails grew out.  It helped tremendously to strengthen and protect my nails.  This product is not like nail polish.  It is a thick, clear liquid, almost like baby oil.  I have no idea if it can absorb through a layer of nail polish because I didn&#x27;t wear nail polish during this time.  The product also states it acts as a cuticle treatment and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with cuticle growth when I used it.  I kept my nails short, so I can&#x27;t attest to the ability of the product to allow someone to grow out their nails.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference in the condition of my nails.</li>
            <li> I have been using this nail hardener for 2 months.  It&#x27;s done a very good job of repairing the nail damage. I hoped to cut the use down by now, but still need to use it twice a day.  My cuticles are in much better condition as well.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> Arrived fast. Love this product. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Does what it promises. Healthy nails in 7 days!</li>
            <li> I must confess I am shocked at how well this works! First, I have terrible nails-- always have. My nails turn up like little spoons so are very prone to catch on things. My nails constantly chipped or broke off, but the worst was the peeling--- like an onion.  I tried every no-chip top coat out there- yeah, right.  Within 2-3 days the polish would peel and take layers of my nail with it! Other nail hardeners use formaldahyde which I want no part of. I was skeptical when I bought this, but thought I had nothing to use. My nails are MUCH stronger and whiter, and I have NO peeling! I occasionally have very small nicks on the tips, but I just lightly buff them out with a crystal file.&lt;br /&gt;I put this all over my nails and cuticles right before I go to bed faithfully every night. Absorbs quickly- I have not found any oil stains on my sheets or pjs.&lt;br /&gt;I finally have nails I am not ashamed of!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been (insert sarcasm) blessed  with a multitude of auto immune diseases. The medications I take for them have done a number on my hair, skin and nails. I&#x27;ve tried every brand there is hoping to stop my nails from splitting in half and being so soft. Nothing was working. Then my girlfriend told me about this polish. It was inexpensive so I thought what do I have to loose. After a month of applying it on my nails twice a day I could see the improvement. Now several months later I have had long nails again, like I did prior to taking these medications. It&#x27;s hard to believe it was this easy of a treatment. I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s having thin, cracked, ridged nails. It truly does work!</li>
            <li> I had this product for a week. I have NO IDEA if it works, because it gently tipped over onto my desk, and the glass busted apart spilling everywhere. I knocked this over with PAPERS on my desk! What a mess and a waste. Bad packaging, no idea if the product works or not.</li>
            <li> Helps to dry nails quickly and softens and helps maintain nice-looking cuticles! I love that it&#x27;s also an organic, natural product. I give it 4 stars only because the nail-hardening aspect is pretty temporary. I find after about 4-8 hours, my nails go back to their normal, flexible state. But using this along with Nailtique&#x27;s Formula 2 on a regular basis has greatly improved the quality of my nails! This should definitely be a staple for any home manicurist!</li>
            <li> Very good nail care product.  I&#x27;ve seen much improvement.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!! My nails peel and if I use this regularly they don&#x27;t! Keeps cuticles soft and nails shiny</li>
            <li> a bit oily and hard to paint over if not applied just right</li>
            <li> It is NOT a nail hardener or dryer in the conventional way ( like OPI Nail Envy / Sally Hansen&#x27;s Tough As Nails that actually makes your nails harder upon application or any type of spray that dries nails faster ). IT IS OIL , so I guess it should be called Cuticle Oil. By applying it on your cuticles your nails supposedly  become stronger...let&#x27;s hope...</li>
            <li> After reading reviews on this product purchased and received product with no problem. Upon arrival began using every night. Boom! My cuticles are looking fantastic! No dryness or flakiness like before. Leaves hands very soft especially around edges of nail and the nail bed. Thanks Super folks !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost finished my first bottle.  I have only noticed my nails peeling;&lt;br /&gt;three of which have never peeled before! This product did not&lt;br /&gt;harden my nails, either. This product did not do what it said it would do!&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy again!</li>
            <li> I was desperately trying to make my flimsy nails harder. They chip and break once they get a certain length and it has always been discouraging. I ran across this little bugger and thought I would give it a try. It definitely does dry your nail polish! Does an okay job of hardening nails. I almost feel like it makes it so stiff that my nails break quicker. That is probably because my nails are thin though. I still recommend this product to anyone who is trying to find strength in their sad looking nails</li>
            <li> This is a great nail hardener, nail conditioner and cuticle softener. Although it is applied with a brush like polish, it is an oil. I don&#x27;t believe D&#x27;lore advises putting it UNDER polish. It can be effective applied shortly after polishing to speed drying. It can be used on bare nails to condition nails and cuticles, but not as a base coat. Polish won&#x27;t adhere to it because it is oily.  I&#x27;ve used for 25 plus years &amp; just purchased again as I am allowing my nails a break from long term acrylic use. Highly recommend and I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 4 months now.  At first, I thought it was strange because it was more like an oil than a clear polish (which is what I assumed the consistency would be.)  Soon I started noticing that the deep ridges in my nails were disappearing and my nails were becoming smoother.  I also noticed my nails getting stronger.  I wear nail polish often, but since my hands are in water a lot, I do have bare nails for days at a time.  When I am without polish, I apply this product several times a week.  It&#x27;s quick and easy.  I also love that the ingredients are not full of harsh chemicals.  Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> DeLore is not only good for your nails and skin, it actually healed a callus / fissure on the palm of my hand that had developed after 4 months on crutches, and lasted for 15 years! Just a week or two of applying DeLore to that and it healed - and vanished for good. I&#x27;ve used this product for over 30 years, and cannot recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, I&#x27;m on my third bottle, I am not very careful after I paint my nails so this is a lifesavor, I would not paint my nails without it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use as a cuticle softener, nail helper and actually also helps dry polish faster..love it for years</li>
            <li> I use this along with Daby Nail Hardener.  This product is like a light oil to put on your nails before I use the other product.</li>
            <li> I love the fact it&#x27;s all natural and organic. It does the job of leaving a nice shine on my nails. I don&#x27;t usually go for colors so I don&#x27;t mind wearing it on its own. Only reason I gave it four stars is because the brush applicator is really long and flimsy. It&#x27;s hard to apply. It slips everywhere on your nails. They need to make the brush applicator shorter and softer. Just started using it so we will see about how it does with nail growth.</li>
            <li> item is great. great quality, great fast service, would do business with these folks again, may order a second one as a gift.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT nail hardener!! I bought already a few and also gave them to my friends. Really good product and natural!!! Definitely a good buy!</li>
            <li> I too have been using this product for at least 20 years and me too, it works!!  I always apply very generously after 4 coats of polish, 1 base, 2 color and 1 top coat and it dries it fast which is my main reason for using but also after a manicure you need moisture.  With any manicure use a great top and botton coat.  \\&quot;On The Go\\&quot; top coat in conjunction works great and also helps your manicure dry fast.  I polish every saturday. I apply a clear coat of top coat in the middle of the week to make my manicure last to the following Saturday.  As you know natural nail manicures dont last as long so this is a must if you want to shorten the time it takes to wait for your nails to dry.  The price is worth it and the vitamins help your grow nails grow strong.&lt;br /&gt;BTW I love this so much I have a bottle at my desk at work and two more at home!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know this was an oily based polish .. kinda makes a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M.</li>
            <li> You can use it alone, but if used with other nail polishes either over or under, it seem to cause the other polish to come off easily.  I like the fact that it is organic and no chemicals.  I just need it to harden my nails. It may take time to see results and I will check back as my nails improve.</li>
            <li> My nails are so much stronger now.I had an old bottle of this stuff and it was an amber color. Not sure why Delore has a color like vegetable oil now, but it works just as well if not better. The consistency is lighter as well and I hadn&#x27;t known before that this can be used right after painting to make the color dry faster just like quick dry drops. It works great and will NOT smear nail polish. Will definitely buy again when I run out. I grew up with this stuff and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.  Please keep making this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a lie, it&#x27;s not a nail hardener. It&#x27;s basically an oil</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product. It&#x27;s inexpensive, and has wonderful, natural, simple ingredients. I have been using it for about a month though,and my results have been mostly negative. I have never had any trouble with my nails peeling before, and that is exactly what has started happening the last few weeks. The tips of several nails are very visibly peeling in layers like an onion. They also seem more prone to breaking, and I have had to cut them very short. Granted, I am very hard on my nails, and they are never very long, but I feel they are usually a little more resilient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside my cuticles look amazing. No hang nails, and they are very well hydrated and healthy looking. As a cuticle ointment, I would give it 4 stars. I just can&#x27;t recommend it otherwise.</li>
            <li> I remember using this stuff 29 yrs ago and then Drug Emporium closed down and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I was bummed because I never used anything else. It dried your nails and moisturized your cuticles. I do my nails on and off and for a long time now every time I try a new quick dry I remember this stuff but wasn&#x27;t too sure on the name but I didn&#x27;t think would still be available anyways. Well I remembered the name and HERE IT IS!!! I just ordered it and I&#x27;m hoping the ingredient&#x27;s are still the same. I never new it was organic! Happy camper. :)</li>
            <li> This product works. It is great as a polish dryer and also a nail hardener. I have been using it for many years and was concerned that I might not find it, but thanks to Amazon, I did.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 35 years. It is absolutely the best nail polish dryer ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Over the many years I have used DeLore Oil, I have found additional benefits.  By applying  DeLore Oil between manicures, my nails became stronger, with a more even texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also discovered that if I brush it over minor cuts or scabs, they heal faster with better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always extolled the benefits of DeLore whenever the opportunity arose. I am so happy to be able to share my experiences  about this wonderful product in this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over 6 months every day and my nails are still soft, ridged, and tear and break very easily. I wanted a nail hardener that I wouldn&#x27;t have to wear like polish, since I&#x27;ve used those before and while they work, I don&#x27;t like to have to polish my nails all the time since the polish peels off the tips right away, even after using those hardeners a long time, and cleaning nails with 92%alcohol first and using a binder before polish. I may try the Malava stuff next&lt;br /&gt;I will say I think this product makes my nails grow faster, just not harder.</li>
