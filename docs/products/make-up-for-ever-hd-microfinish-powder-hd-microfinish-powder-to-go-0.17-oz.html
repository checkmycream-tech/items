            <li>I bought another kind,</li>
            <li>Super light, and provides a nearly flawless finish.</li>
            <li>but it is best for use on normal days.</li>

            <li>Love this product.....</li>
            <li>my make-up was still in place and look flawless still ( i also have to mention that i use their primer and also use Urban Decay all nighter as a mist )</li>
            <li>so all of this also come into consideration on making my make-up flawless and to last longer.</li>
            <li>You can get them at many many online stores but one of them is Coastal Scents.</li>
            <li>I mostly like this for it&#x27;s smoothing affect</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>I love this finishing powder.  </li>
            <li>this one has much better results.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>Much better price and color, more powders and easier to use.</li>
            <li>I love this powder because it gives you the matte finish without over drying or adding color.</li>
            <li>Most of it landed in the sink as flakes and crumbs.  </li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite powder I have.</li>
            <li>I wish it was in a shaker, in a larger/wider container where you could more easily swirl a brush for even application.</li>
            <li>leaves skin looking matte and natural, great for people with oily or shiny skin.</li>
            <li>Now since I found this I have no more discolored face, it gives a nice satin feel to your face, and it gives you a flawless look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fine that on my fingers it felt slippery.</li>
            <li>A finely milled powder, that goes on without looking Cakey or clown like.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t settle into my fine lines or look too Matt, either.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m honestly letting people know this because I think you guys should be informed of how much you&#x27;re paying for this cheap product.    </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic for applying over foundation.  </li>
            <li>It feels so silky &amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li>When wearing heavy concealer or foundation, it keeps it perfectly in place.</li>
            <li>SO far so good, no break out , we will see.</li>
            <li>Mine daughter love the product very much</li>
            <li>This powder is great because it has no color at all and keeps you matte for a really long time.</li>
            <li>This powder is super fine and helps my makeup stay in place all day.</li>
            <li>it gives your skin such a soft, perfect look.  </li>
            <li>and it is super light on the skin.</li>
            <li>But I thought it was going to be full sized.  </li>
            <li>Although this powder is great, it is not worth the money.</li>
            <li>It just feels professional :)</li>
            <li>But this powder does what it says it should do , my face was soooooo soft that i could not stop touching my face.    </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>I can place it right under my eyes and it keeps my eyeliner from smudging under my eye without showing wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I am just finishing up my first container of this powder.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love it.  </li>
            <li>People are willing to buy this ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SILICA POWDER just because it is from a band name, but they don&#x27;t realize how ripped off</li>
            <li>Buy the CS one, the 1oz container for only $4.75, you will save a lot more money.</li>
            <li>, it makes my pores, fine lines, and scars much less prominent.</li>
            <li>But remember: dont use too much!</li>
            <li>VERY MISLEADING!</li>
            <li>Did you know you can get a full 1 oz,6x more than what you&#x27;re getting in this container for 3x less than the price?</li>
            <li>I pretty much use it now</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.... lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li>, i had to go out with a friend at 7 and went to take a nap around 4:30 and woke at 6:20 to get ready, when i woke up from my nap</li>
            <li>It is also 100% silica powder and you can get that anywhere for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>This product was very over-rated and costly for the quality.</li>
            <li>much better effect than the other mineral similiar products.</li>
            <li>I felt that I had paid a premium price for a very small amount of this good product.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a different type of &#x27;finished&#x27; look and even though this is ultra smooth and creamy, it is super white and sort of stuck in spots in the eye area,</li>
            <li>I love this powder so much and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>This is the best little secret to have in your make up bag.</li>
            <li>I am 67 years old....not very wrinkled, but this just makes me look so much softer and younger (IMO)  </li>
            <li>I liked the makeup a lot, but it lasted only a few weeks until it cracked and then disintegrated until it was unusable.  </li>
            <li>I love this powder- the only thing it gets a bit all over the place so be careful!</li>
            <li>This is only 0.17 oz of pure silica powder and 15 bucks.</li>
            <li>It seems like it either too much on the brush or not enough because of the consistency.</li>
            <li>pleasantly surprised.   </li>
            <li>and it really reduces shine and holds your makeup in place without appearing white or chalky.</li>
            <li>the only makeup brush I have that would fit down into the jar was an eyeshadow brush.  </li>
            <li>but normally when one purchases a makeup product such as this there are some instructions or perhaps some helpful application hints and also perhaps some sort of applicator.</li>
            <li>I tried using a larger brush, one that&#x27;s the size for use on the face, but it was just too big, picked up too much powder (even after tapping)that powder went everywhere when I applied to my face.</li>
            <li>I add a couple if shakes to my loose powder everyday before application &amp; it keeps me shine free all day.</li>

            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Translucide Naturally Luminous Loose Powder.</li>
            <li> A little bit really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Its solid white just not natural on face.</li>
            <li> thats if u dont really blend it in , i use a small kabuki brush ...</li>
            <li> Actually my mother used and she is an aged woman (79),</li>
            <li> But then, I didn&#x27;t read the description closely enough, I just assumed no ethical seller would put a full-size price on a travel-size product.</li>
            <li> It creates a velvety like finish without looking dry.</li>
            <li> This powder didn&#x27;t do very much for my skin and failed at keeping oil from showing through and did not make my makeup last longer.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount so it will last for months.</li>
            <li> I have had this powder for four months and still have some left, a little is all you need.</li>
            <li> and I use it to fluff up my eyelashes while putting on mascara.</li>
            <li> And no ethical seller would.</li>
            <li> There are no instructions with this and no sponge, brush or other sort of implement for application.</li>
            <li> I use everyday, mixed with a little of my color mineral powder from mary kay.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit expensive, but worth every penny</li>
            <li> Too expensive and solid white.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the packaging - it makes a mess and gets powder everywhere!</li>
            <li> a bit expensive, but you need to use very little of the powder, so i believe it&#x27;ll last long.  </li>
            <li> On Saturday, i did my make-up around 1, went out for a few ,</li>
            <li> it makes it hard to use other powders...</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t make me look pale either</li>
            <li> Very mess when use it.</li>
            <li> I did find it hard to get out with out making a mess.</li>
            <li> The jar is so small (it&#x27;s really a small amount in a small jar)</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past year.</li>
            <li> I also apply underneath my eyeliner with a small brush to keep it &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; all day.</li>
            <li> This powder is hard to control.</li>
            <li> I found it a little expensive for the size</li>
            <li> It was not good.</li>
            <li> I mean, even the drugstore mascara products have instructions !   </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m behind the times with makeup</li>
            <li> I never understood the purpose of finishing powder but tired of dealing with shiny skin I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> What a rip-off!</li>
            <li> After applying my base (mineral  powder) and blush, etc...all except mascara....</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I use everyday, mixed with a little of my color mineral powder from mary kay. I like this product it stays on well and provides a nice finish! would recommend!</li>
            <li> Hello,    This powder is great because it has no color at all and keeps you matte for a really long time. It just feels professional :)</li>
            <li> I am just finishing up my first container of this powder.  I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love it.  After applying my base (mineral  powder) and blush, etc...all except mascara....I use this...it gives your skin such a soft, perfect look.  I am 67 years old....not very wrinkled, but this just makes me look so much softer and younger (IMO)  I am about to purchase again.  Love this product.....by the way....much better effect than the other mineral similiar products.</li>
            <li> I purchased this last thursday after reading a lot of reviews about it.   I am african american ( Ashanti&#x27;s complexion) and from a lot of reviews when you take pictures it makes you look like a ghost ( white looking )..  1 ) yes it does , but thats if u dont really blend it in , i use a small kabuki brush ...I apply it after my make up before I spray any mist.  I was going out that night, after applying it , took a picture ( test ) and notice some white spot, blended it throughly and voila, took another pic ( test II ) i looked flawless.    On Saturday, i did my make-up around 1, went out for a few , my make up looked amazing, i had to go out with a friend at 7 and went to take a nap around 4:30 and woke at 6:20 to get ready, when i woke up from my nap my make-up was still in place and look flawless still ( i also have to mention that i use their primer and also use Urban Decay all nighter as a mist ) so all of this also come into consideration on making my make-up flawless and to last longer. But this powder does what it says it should do , my face was soooooo soft that i could not stop touching my face.    SO far so good, no break out , we will see.</li>
            <li> Great product but do not buy this from Make Up Forever. People are willing to buy this ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SILICA POWDER just because it is from a band name, but they don&#x27;t realize how ripped off they&#x27;re getting. This is only 0.17 oz of pure silica powder and 15 bucks. Did you know you can get a full 1 oz,6x more than what you&#x27;re getting in this container for 3x less than the price? That&#x27;s right. You can get them at many many online stores but one of them is Coastal Scents. I&#x27;m definitely not advertising for them and I&#x27;m honestly letting people know this because I think you guys should be informed of how much you&#x27;re paying for this cheap product.    Bottom line: Although this powder is great, it is not worth the money. It is also 100% silica powder and you can get that anywhere for much cheaper. Buy the CS one, the 1oz container for only $4.75, you will save a lot more money.</li>
            <li> I have had this powder for four months and still have some left, a little is all you need. I use this as the last step after my concealer, and matte powder (both MUFE) and blush. It extends the wear of my makeup and helps with oiliness. I mostly like this for it&#x27;s smoothing affect, it makes my pores, fine lines, and scars much less prominent. I have darker skin but this blends in well. Best setting powder.</li>
            <li> I do like this finishing powder but it is best for use on normal days. If you use a flash when taking a picture of yourself while wearing this, it will show up looking like you have cocaine all over your face lol. I pretty much use it now when I know I&#x27;m not getting my picture taken and I use it to fluff up my eyelashes while putting on mascara.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m behind the times with makeup (I admit I am) but normally when one purchases a makeup product such as this there are some instructions or perhaps some helpful application hints and also perhaps some sort of applicator. I mean, even the drugstore mascara products have instructions !   There are no instructions with this and no sponge, brush or other sort of implement for application. The jar is so small (it&#x27;s really a small amount in a small jar) the only makeup brush I have that would fit down into the jar was an eyeshadow brush.  I tried using a larger brush, one that&#x27;s the size for use on the face, but it was just too big, picked up too much powder (even after tapping)that powder went everywhere when I applied to my face. So, I just can&#x27;t recommend this powder</li>
            <li> I rarely wear makeup so when I do, I want the effort to be worth it - using this powder produced a WONDERFUL look. It&#x27;s so fine that on my fingers it felt slippery.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic for applying over foundation.  It feels so silky &amp; smooth.  My clients love it, and I&#x27;m very proud to put it on their hand so they can see for themselves just how silky &amp; smooth it is!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this powder- the only thing it gets a bit all over the place so be careful! I see a difference in photos when I wear the microfinish powder and it is super light on the skin.</li>
            <li> This powder is super fine and helps my makeup stay in place all day. A little bit really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this powder so much and use it everyday. It makes me look great in daylight and in photos. The best in my book!</li>
            <li> A finely milled powder, that goes on without looking Cakey or clown like. It doesn&#x27;t settle into my fine lines or look too Matt, either. It creates a velvety like finish without looking dry.</li>
            <li> This powder is hard to control. It seems like it either too much on the brush or not enough because of the consistency.</li>
            <li> It was not good. I would have to give it no stars. It left my face looking like ghost. This would be good a Halloween type event.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  But I thought it was going to be full sized.  It was my fault for not looking at the weight.  But it is a great product.  I have been using it for the past year.</li>
            <li> I love this finishing powder.  I can place it right under my eyes and it keeps my eyeliner from smudging under my eye without showing wrinkles.  It makes pores disappear.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.... lasts me a long time. and doesn&#x27;t change color of my make-up.</li>
            <li> This is the best little secret to have in your make up bag. I add a couple if shakes to my loose powder everyday before application &amp; it keeps me shine free all day. I also apply underneath my eyeliner with a small brush to keep it &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; all day. Works great &amp; a real bargain!!</li>
            <li> I love how it hides imperfections! I think I may buy a new one, because it works perfect. It is a little bit expensive, but worth every penny</li>
            <li> pleasantly surprised.   a bit expensive, but you need to use very little of the powder, so i believe it&#x27;ll last long.  it makes it hard to use other powders... this one has much better results.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. It does what it says it will do and it really reduces shine and holds your makeup in place without appearing white or chalky. I will be continuing to buy this produce. I found it a little expensive for the size but it does an excellent job so go ahead and try it. I&#x27;m a woman of color and it worked for me.</li>
            <li> leaves skin looking matte and natural, great for people with oily or shiny skin. didn&#x27;t make me look pale either</li>
            <li> Mine daughter love the product very much so she uses it every day.  These products you do not find on the local market so it was a great buy&gt;</li>
            <li> This product is reeeeally nice! Actually my mother used and she is an aged woman (79), so.. But remember: dont use too much! It wont be good on your photos...</li>
            <li> Great product doesn&#x27;t change the color of your make up but seals it so it doesn&#x27;t move. I did find it hard to get out with out making a mess.</li>
            <li> This powder didn&#x27;t do very much for my skin and failed at keeping oil from showing through and did not make my makeup last longer. Also, it made me breakout and made my skin feel itchy and irritated all day.</li>
            <li> Too expensive and solid white. Very mess when use it. It does not stay on the brush well so you end up have to make your face leveled in order to not let the powder dropping all over the place. Its solid white just not natural on face. I returned it on local store. I bought another kind, L&#x27;Oreal Paris Translucide Naturally Luminous Loose Powder. Much better price and color, more powders and easier to use.</li>
            <li> This is a staple item for me.</li>
            <li> I have used HD micro finish powder forever and I love it! It leaves you face silky smooth,sets foundation and gives skin flawless look. You only need a small amount so it will last for months.</li>
            <li> I love this powder because it gives you the matte finish without over drying or adding color. It truly is translucent. When wearing heavy concealer or foundation, it keeps it perfectly in place.</li>
            <li> Got here quickly, some of the best finishing powder out there</li>
            <li> This product was very over-rated and costly for the quality. Too white and did not offer the finish it claimed. I would not suggest purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> I liked the makeup a lot, but it lasted only a few weeks until it cracked and then disintegrated until it was unusable.  Most of it landed in the sink as flakes and crumbs.  I felt that I had paid a premium price for a very small amount of this good product.</li>
            <li> I never understood the purpose of finishing powder but tired of dealing with shiny skin I decided to try this. I really love it. Super light, and provides a nearly flawless finish. I would definitely recommend using primer before applying foundation, and then finishing with this powder. My only complaint is the packaging - it makes a mess and gets powder everywhere! I wish it was in a shaker, in a larger/wider container where you could more easily swirl a brush for even application.</li>
            <li> WARNING! VERY MISLEADING! NOTE THE PRODUCT SIZE! If you purchase this, you are purchasing a travel-size container (0.17 oz) for about the same cost as a full-size (0.30 oz) container sells at Sephora. Imagine my surprise when I opened the package! What a rip-off! But then, I didn&#x27;t read the description closely enough, I just assumed no ethical seller would put a full-size price on a travel-size product. And no ethical seller would. AVOID!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is for me. I was hoping for a different type of &#x27;finished&#x27; look and even though this is ultra smooth and creamy, it is super white and sort of stuck in spots in the eye area, where I need/want to use to.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite powder I have. When I&#x27;m done with my foundation I used a powder to set it, before I found this stuff no matter what color powder I&#x27;d use it would always make my face look a different color. The only way I could achieve an all one color face and neck was to put foundation and powder all over my face, neck, and chest until I found this stuff at Sephora. Now since I found this I have no more discolored face, it gives a nice satin feel to your face, and it gives you a flawless look.</li>
            <li> Works very well but extremely messy.</li>
