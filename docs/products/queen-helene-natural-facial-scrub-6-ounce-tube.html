            <li>I love it, but then read the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Love this exfoliating scrub.  </li>
            <li>I love that they don&#x27;t use plastic beads</li>
            <li>In my opinion they should do some more testing on it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I am in love with this exfoliant.</li>
            <li>Will purchase again when I run out. :)</li>
            <li>I love the fact it has no parabens or any harmful stuff.....</li>
            <li>It smells really good and has been the best facial scrub/exfoliating wash I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great with natural organic ingredients....</li>
            <li>If you like a strong scrub this is it.</li>
            <li>though you may think you will need to be more aggressive in your scrubing, the oppsite is true.</li>
            <li>This is perfect to exfoliate dead winter/dry skin.</li>
            <li>Read the ingredients listed below this cheaply made &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product before purchasing.</li>
            <li>Well, as soon as I received the bottle, I realized why it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li>bought it because it was an add-on product and seemed to be a very fair price as far as a natural skin scrub.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean.</li>
            <li>This turned out to be just as good as any regular scrubs sold out there.</li>
            <li>However I used it again, with a very gentle touch and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>I will buy more of it soon and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>You see, the scrub is very micro fine texture and</li>
            <li>I deducted one star from this review because I think there should be some kind of warning/caution that should be on the back of this product.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t purchase this product if you are thinking it will be a healthy, natural skin scrub.</li>
            <li>Make sure you&#x27;re ok with Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and the other carcinogenic garbage that they somehow pass off as &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t so abrasive that you feel like you are using sandpaper, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to this product but so far I&#x27;m pretty thrilled.</li>
            <li>(probably won&#x27;t be for awhile because I get very good coverage with only a little at a time,) but will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li>Just remember to be very gentle with your face if you have senitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a product freak and use mostly natural stuff without chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;The texture and small grains of this is amazing, I also use the mint scrub, love them both.</li>
            <li>Very few face washes that call themselves &amp;#34;scrubs&amp;#34; really give the skin a good exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>It makes my faace feel so fresh and young!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this scrub for it leaves your face very soft, and is effective with dealing with rough patches of skin.</li>
            <li>not so much (grit size is too large.)  </li>
            <li>so they really get int</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>This scrub really exfoliates and cleans.  </li>
            <li>This is the most moisturizing scrub I&#x27;ve ever used, it smells fantastic and one tube lasts forever because a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>but instead something akin to coarse sand, and just the right amount.</li>
            <li>I tried it several times, and right after I put it on, my nose started to bleed.</li>
            <li>The scrub is fine enough so that it&#x27;s not tearing my skin and leaving it red.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and leaves the face feeling really new.</li>
            <li>It says it&#x27;s natural, but when you look at the ingredients list, there&#x27;s a bunch of ingredients that I consider to be unnatural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other brands but they all pretty much the same thing</li>
            <li>I am a 40 year old woman with Roscea (mild case) and dry skin due to the climate I live in.</li>
            <li>A lot of natural ingredients, and always at a low price.</li>
            <li>Not harsh but scrubs well enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural scrub on the market that wouldn&#x27;t dry my face.</li>

            <li> This is the most moisturizing scrub I&#x27;ve ever used, it smells fantastic and one tube lasts forever because a little bit goes a long way. This is perfect to exfoliate dead winter/dry skin. I love this scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of this brand of scrubs. A lot of natural ingredients, and always at a low price. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other brands but they all pretty much the same thing so why not just buy something that gets the job done for much less money. The pomegranate one smells refreshingly tangy! I have acne prone oily skin. While this scrub doesn&#x27;t promise anything fancy, it does what it&#x27;s made to do. Exfoliate. I use it daily and never had any problems with dryness or breaking me out. I like the size of the granulates, they&#x27;re small so they really get int he crevices without scratching your face up. It rinses clean.</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old woman with Roscea (mild case) and dry skin due to the climate I live in. The first time I used this product it was a little to harsh for my skin and left my face red. However I used it again, with a very gentle touch and it worked fine. I also use this product for keeping my feet soft and the rough spots on my elbows. I deducted one star from this review because I think there should be some kind of warning/caution that should be on the back of this product. You see, the scrub is very micro fine texture and though you may think you will need to be more aggressive in your scrubing, the oppsite is true. I would recommend this scrub for it leaves your face very soft, and is effective with dealing with rough patches of skin.Just remember to be very gentle with your face if you have senitive skin.</li>

            <li> Good scrub for at home facials.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the mistake that I made. Don&#x27;t purchase this product if you are thinking it will be a healthy, natural skin scrub. Read the ingredients listed below this cheaply made &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product before purchasing. Make sure you&#x27;re ok with Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and the other carcinogenic garbage that they somehow pass off as &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because it was an add-on product and seemed to be a very fair price as far as a natural skin scrub. Well, as soon as I received the bottle, I realized why it&#x27;s so cheap. This petrochemical product was a waste of my money and time.</li>
            <li> This face scrub was really bad. It made my face burn and made my nose bleed. I tried it several times, and right after I put it on, my nose started to bleed. I even tried it after I hadnt had a nose bleed in a really long time, and the same thing happened. I dont think I&#x27;m allergic to anything, and to be allergic to some face wash is ridiculous. In my opinion they should do some more testing on it.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. It smells really good and has been the best facial scrub/exfoliating wash I&#x27;ve used so far. It isn&#x27;t too harsh but really does the trick in helping my skin. Will be sad when I run out (probably won&#x27;t be for awhile because I get very good coverage with only a little at a time,) but will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product freak and use mostly natural stuff without chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;The texture and small grains of this is amazing, I also use the mint scrub, love them both.</li>
            <li> I like Queen Helene products anyway. This a nice refreshing scrub, smells good and gets the makeup off. The &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t so abrasive that you feel like you are using sandpaper, it&#x27;s just right. I love it, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> This was a good size, has a nice scent, and is invigorating.  It makes my faace feel so fresh and young!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this exfoliant. The scrub is fine enough so that it&#x27;s not tearing my skin and leaving it red. It&#x27;s getting the dead skin off my face and the scent is very pleasing, but not overbearing in any way. Very happy with this purchase. Will purchase again when I run out. :)</li>
            <li> Very few face washes that call themselves &amp;#34;scrubs&amp;#34; really give the skin a good exfoliation.  This scrub really exfoliates and cleans.  Smells good too.</li>
            <li> No skin irritation or any side effects. It&#x27;s great with natural organic ingredients.... I love the fact it has no parabens or any harmful stuff..... I will buy more of it soon and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> very good scrub at a great price, and wonderful scent. Not harsh but scrubs well enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> If you like a strong scrub this is it. Inexpensive and leaves the face feeling really new. I keep buying it.</li>
