            <li>It works great while you are using it, and my nails did grow and looked great, but when we both stopped using it</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>My nails never looked so good.</li>
            <li>As advertised, Prompt delivery, Fair price.</li>
            <li>It stays on my nails about a week and keeps my nails looking good.</li>
            <li>It was a good thing I read some of the reviews</li>
            <li>I have never had good nails till now.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great as a top coat to keep your nail polish from chipping.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing my nails grow like weeds it protects them with just a hint of color</li>
            <li>It stays nice on my nails for some time.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t give an honest rfeview until I can see some results</li>
            <li>Amazing product, I have never been able to grow nails.....</li>
            <li>Is a good product and easy to remove, the most important thing, is working.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love the way it doesn&#x27;t peel off.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Well priced item - I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I love the way this gel makes my nails look.</li>
            <li>I love, love it - been using it for 2 years.  </li>
            <li>I am a DIY&#x27;er (run power tools, restore my home, work on my cars, etc) and this protects my nails better than anything I have tried.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Maybe their also futzing with them too much, touching or bending them or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nails have been cracking, splitting and tearing for many years.</li>
            <li>When I get more nail growth, I want to start using the gels that I was talking about before.</li>
            <li>but like a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product at my local CVS as there is great reviews on many websites.</li>
            <li>keeps my nails strong and protected.</li>
            <li>In two weeks I see HUGE improvement.</li>
            <li>:) It does seem to chip off fairly easily, but applying new coats is very easy and quick.</li>
            <li>I love a seller that ships super quickly.</li>
            <li>Better still, my first application lasted 9 days without peeling or chipping.</li>
            <li>Holds up very well for many days of use.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to get any real length out of them because they always get damaged before they can grow out</li>
            <li>gave it two stars because it does look nice over my french manicures, but I do not see it enhancing my nailgrowth</li>
            <li>It says in the instructions to remove gel with nail polish remover once a week and put on fresh coats</li>
            <li>Indoors, it has more of a naturally glossy appearance.</li>
            <li>It dries pretty quick.  </li>
            <li>Never did it strenthen my nails or brighten them the only time they looked bright is when the product was on nails and any clear polish can do that!  </li>
            <li>Ordered before and like it very much</li>
            <li>I found at Bartell&#x27;s drug store there, but you have to go to the &amp;#34;As seen on TV section&amp;#34;  Most drug stores sell this, after reading that last review</li>
            <li>This products chipped off the first day, like 6 hours after I applied it.</li>
            <li>It goes on very well, dries super fast, lasts for weeks and protects my nails.  </li>
            <li>I am to be honest, there are other gels or even polishes that make my nails feel stronger and more solid.</li>
            <li>gel gives my nails a a shiny pink tint and healthy appearance.</li>
            <li>now wow!!!</li>
            <li>This product goes on as a very slight blush across the nail but leaves the fingertips white making g them look great while the product strengthens nails.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I will find a more productive habit soon and even though I am not a pack or half a pack smoker, my nails still show that</li>
            <li>Although if I do in the future, super glue should fix it.</li>
            <li>This polish has allowed my nails to grow, look 1000% better, and there&#x27;s not a hint of the yellowing discoloration that occurs with all other &#x27;clear&#x27; polish I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>but it might be from putting too many coats on making them too stiff and brittle but</li>
            <li>If you see it peeling on one nail, remove it and apply a couple new</li>
            <li>This gel is very strong and thick but no polish is going to adhere to the nail for any substantial length of time if it is repeatedly submerged in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first nail polish that I used that actually doesn&#x27;t chip or break my nails.</li>
            <li>So, maybe some of the problems with Pink Armor may be more personal, as far as, what the persons nails are used to wearing.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s misrepresented about brightening your natural nail tips and making your nailbeds pinker.</li>
            <li>It make a cute pink tint to nails looked kind of weird at night outside though.</li>
            <li>I have to buy the others to complete nail treatment.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have them, get a pair and put them near your kitchen sink and in your bathroom so that you will always be reminded to use them.</li>
            <li>They are getting pretty long.</li>
            <li>far as how they make your nails look--they look pinkish.</li>
            <li>That way, they won&#x27;t be too thick from many applications of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to agree with others that this is not a good product I used it as the instructions said until the bottle was mostly used.</li>
            <li>I normally paint my nails Sunday night and it lasts until the next Sunday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not fake looking pink</li>
            <li>Not sure if the product is worth it yet.  </li>
            <li>between the main application, apply a coat of the gel about every other day.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> between the main application, apply a coat of the gel about every other day.</li>
            <li> And I am pretty hard on my nails.</li>
            <li> but I have been doing it when their is new nail growth or when it starts to look a little \\&quot;beat up\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Pink Armor Nail Gel is clear with a pink tint to it.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> The photo shows painted nails that have a cream pink color on them, similar to a color polish .</li>
            <li> My doctor uses that gel and her nails are really long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;--Apply two to three coats allowing it to dry in between applications.</li>
            <li> It also does not live up to the strength advertised.  </li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was the gel that is used for the false tips.</li>
            <li> cosmetic saleswoman at Walgreens suggested Pink Armor.</li>
            <li> you see Pink Armour in a box with the picture of painted nails on it, I can tell you now, the photo is deceiving.</li>
            <li> However, for me personally, those make my nails feel heavy and those are the gels and polishes that chip off and make my nails break.</li>
            <li> Polishes go on well over the Pink Armor.&lt;br /&gt;- Lori</li>
            <li> Do not put hand lotion on before applying Pink Armor because it will create a coat (even if not noticeable) of oil on the nail which will cause the gel to not adhere as well.</li>
            <li> Use your hand lotion after the nails have dried from the final coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gel does make the nail harder</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t be in with the other nail products.  </li>
            <li> I am a pink armor convert for LIFE!</li>
            <li> Out in the sun, it makes your nails have a very pink tint.</li>
            <li> I have used practically every  brand of nail conditioner for my weak, soft nails to no avail.</li>
            <li> the only problemi had was that it got really thick towards the end.</li>
            <li> it is harder and thicker than ordinary nail</li>
            <li> A waste of $10.00.</li>
            <li> This product turns my nails a funny glow/ lavender color when the sunlight hits it, which is ugly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even got 3 other people hooked since the results were so dramatic.</li>
            <li> I received this product 3 weeks late and asked for a credit or return in email 2 times with no repsonse.  </li>
            <li> Not only were their tools dirty - ergo</li>
            <li> /&gt;--Apply at least four hours before bathing or submerging your hands in water.</li>
            <li> Some people have complained that when they take a shower, it peels off the nail.</li>
            <li> That caused serious nail trauma and lifting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My real nails were in very bad shape - weak, thin and brittle.</li>
            <li> They split and peel and are extremely weak.  </li>
            <li> one thin coat per day for seven days...</li>
            <li> my nails are not split or thin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want the false tips though.</li>
            <li> Anyway, when I found out it wasn&#x27;t, I was disappointed but thought I&#x27;d try this anyway since I&#x27;d spent $10 on it.</li>
            <li> This is by and far the worst product I have ever purchased through mailorder.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the first nail polish that I used that actually doesn&#x27;t chip or break my nails. Love it.</li>
            <li> This product turns my nails a funny glow/ lavender color when the sunlight hits it, which is ugly. It also does not live up to the strength advertised.  I  threw it away.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, I have never been able to grow nails.....now wow!!! Recommending to everyone.....love it!</li>
            <li> And no, it does not leave your tips whiter or nailbeds pinker.&lt;br /&gt;Each time I used it, my nail would crack!&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars because it does look nice over my french manicures, but I do not see it enhancing my nailgrowth and I think it&#x27;s misrepresented about brightening your natural nail tips and making your nailbeds pinker.</li>
            <li> I love it! keeps my nails strong and protected. My nails never looked so good.</li>
            <li> Found it stores for a while but now seems to have gone away.  Love the way it doesn&#x27;t peel off.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It stays nice on my nails for some time. And I am pretty hard on my nails.</li>
            <li> In Washington State while on vacation.  My sister and sister in law raved about it and one is a nail biter!  They both looked great.  I found at Bartell&#x27;s drug store there, but you have to go to the &amp;#34;As seen on TV section&amp;#34;  Most drug stores sell this, after reading that last review, I would just go to Walgreens or Bartell&#x27;s both seem to have these sections.  It won&#x27;t be in with the other nail products.  It took me and my iphone (googling for locations) 15 minutes to find it, since I was only in the nail section.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! My nails are finally growing!</li>
            <li> This products chipped off the first day, like 6 hours after I applied it. I did try this on several different occasions and ended up with the same results. I get gel manicures and this was nothing like it. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> As advertised, Prompt delivery, Fair price.</li>
            <li> I received this product 3 weeks late and asked for a credit or return in email 2 times with no repsonse.  DO NOT BUY, go to walgreens or walmart for the produce to try.  Not sure if the product is worth it yet.  Take a chance on the produce somewhere else.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing my nails grow like weeds it protects them with just a hint of color it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I had a &#x27;greenie&amp;#34; so I removed my acrylic nails. My real nails were in very bad shape - weak, thin and brittle. I had made the mistake of having my acrylics done at a Vietnamese salon. Not only were their tools dirty - ergo the greenie - but also they &#x27;drilled&#x27; my nails. That caused serious nail trauma and lifting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cosmetic saleswoman at Walgreens suggested Pink Armor. In two weeks I see HUGE improvement. This polish has allowed my nails to grow, look 1000% better, and there&#x27;s not a hint of the yellowing discoloration that occurs with all other &#x27;clear&#x27; polish I&#x27;ve tried. Better still, my first application lasted 9 days without peeling or chipping. I am a pink armor convert for LIFE!</li>
            <li> This is by and far the worst product I have ever purchased through mailorder.  It is comperable to a $1 bottle of nail polish.  It peals off and does not keep nails from breaking.</li>
            <li> I love a seller that ships super quickly. Well priced item - I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended this product and I think it is great.  Holds up very well for many days of use.</li>
            <li> No big difference in nails. A waste of $10.00.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve even got 3 other people hooked since the results were so dramatic.</li>
            <li> I use this every week and am very happy with the purchase. It stays on my nails about a week and keeps my nails looking good.</li>
            <li> I love the way this gel makes my nails look. Here is my personal downfall, I still smoke. I smoke 3 cigarettes a day. Hopefully I will find a more productive habit soon and even though I am not a pack or half a pack smoker, my nails still show that I smoke.&lt;br /&gt;This gel gives my nails a a shiny pink tint and healthy appearance. So imagine how well it will make nonsmoking nails look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you see Pink Armour in a box with the picture of painted nails on it, I can tell you now, the photo is deceiving. The photo shows painted nails that have a cream pink color on them, similar to a color polish . Pink Armor Nail Gel is clear with a pink tint to it.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the one and two star reviews state that the gel makes their nails break.&lt;br /&gt; I haven&#x27;t had that problem.&lt;br /&gt;If I am to be honest, there are other gels or even polishes that make my nails feel stronger and more solid. However, for me personally, those make my nails feel heavy and those are the gels and polishes that chip off and make my nails break. So, maybe some of the problems with Pink Armor may be more personal, as far as, what the persons nails are used to wearing. I don&#x27;t know, just a thought!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the one and two star reviews state that the gel peels off.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had that problem either. I hand wash my dishes (because of the lower electric and water bill cost) and still no problems! I normally paint my nails Sunday night and it lasts until the next Sunday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have not had any problems with my brush staying secured to the cap. Although if I do in the future, super glue should fix it.</li>
            <li> Have not tried All-Stains yet and the Hydrogen wasn&#x27;t been delivered yet.</li>
            <li> Ordered before and like it very much</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at my local CVS as there is great reviews on many websites. I have to agree with others that this is not a good product I used it as the instructions said until the bottle was mostly used. It make a cute pink tint to nails looked kind of weird at night outside though. Never did it strenthen my nails or brighten them the only time they looked bright is when the product was on nails and any clear polish can do that!  I must also mentioned that it flaked off my nails every couple of days and I kept having to reapply! I did not use any nail polish under it or over it! It was the only product on my nails.</li>
            <li> My mother and I have both had the same result with this polish.  It works great while you are using it, and my nails did grow and looked great, but when we both stopped using it (I was out of town for a week and forgot it) our nails were trashed. It has been 2 months and my nails hurt.  They split and peel and are extremely weak.  I did not buy this product on Amazon, I bought it at the store.</li>
            <li> I buy this at my local CVS.  I love, love it - been using it for 2 years.  It goes on very well, dries super fast, lasts for weeks and protects my nails.  I am a DIY&#x27;er (run power tools, restore my home, work on my cars, etc) and this protects my nails better than anything I have tried. Polishes go on well over the Pink Armor.&lt;br /&gt;- Lori</li>
            <li> Is a good product and easy to remove, the most important thing, is working. I have to buy the others to complete nail treatment.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It has helped my nails grow and it&#x27;s great as a top coat to keep your nail polish from chipping.</li>
            <li> Have just started using this product  Can&#x27;t give an honest rfeview until I can see some results</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle.  I love it.  Only product I have found that hides the ridges on my nails.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail polish/gel, bar none. I have used practically every  brand of nail conditioner for my weak, soft nails to no avail. This product goes on as a very slight blush across the nail but leaves the fingertips white making g them look great while the product strengthens nails.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t seen the advertisement for this product when I purchased it. I found it at Walgreen&#x27;s. At first, I thought it was the gel that is used for the false tips. I wanted to start using that to build up my nails so that they would grow. I didn&#x27;t want the false tips though. My doctor uses that gel and her nails are really long. Anyway, when I found out it wasn&#x27;t, I was disappointed but thought I&#x27;d try this anyway since I&#x27;d spent $10 on it. I came in here and found reviews that gave tips on how to use it and I thought I&#x27;d post those tips here for others who haven&#x27;t ever used it before. It was a good thing I read some of the reviews or I probably would have made  the same mistakes others have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Apply at least four hours before bathing or submerging your hands in water. I bathe in the mornings so I always put the polish on before bedtime. Some people have complained that when they take a shower, it peels off the nail. I haven&#x27;t had that happen so I&#x27;m wondering if it is because they polished their nails soon before taking their shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Clip, buff and/or file nails and push back cuticles before applying. Wash your hands and scrub under nails. Use rubbing alcohol to wipe off nails. Do not put hand lotion on before applying Pink Armor because it will create a coat (even if not noticeable) of oil on the nail which will cause the gel to not adhere as well. Use your hand lotion after the nails have dried from the final coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Apply two to three coats allowing it to dry in between applications. It dries pretty quick.  I put three coats on mine. It says in the instructions to remove gel with nail polish remover once a week and put on fresh coats but I have been doing it when their is new nail growth or when it starts to look a little \\&quot;beat up\\&quot;. Sometimes by then there are tiny areas where the gel has started to peel. For me, that&#x27;s about every five days give or take a day. Yes, it comes off with remover but it takes some doing to get it offbecause it is harder and thicker than ordinary nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--In between the main application, apply a coat of the gel about every other day. If you see it peeling on one nail, remove it and apply a couple new coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--When you are going to submerge your hands in water or in using cleaning chemicals (such as dishwashing or in cleaning the kitchen or bathrooms) ALWAYS put on rubber gloves. If you don&#x27;t have them, get a pair and put them near your kitchen sink and in your bathroom so that you will always be reminded to use them. This gel is very strong and thick but no polish is going to adhere to the nail for any substantial length of time if it is repeatedly submerged in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Some people complain that this product causes the nails to become brittle and break. I haven&#x27;t had that happen to me yet but it might be from putting too many coats on making them too stiff and brittle but I don&#x27;t know. Maybe their also futzing with them too much, touching or bending them or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails have been cracking, splitting and tearing for many years. I haven&#x27;t been able to get any real length out of them because they always get damaged before they can grow out and I&#x27;m constantly clipping them back when they break. Since I started using this gel about a month ago, I now have nail growth happening. They are getting pretty long. This product does not make them grow or even make them stronger when the polish is not on them but it does give them a fighting chance to grow out. It protects them from damage. When I get more nail growth, I want to start using the gels that I was talking about before. That way, they won&#x27;t be too thick from many applications of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how they make your nails look--they look pinkish. Not fake looking pink but like a healthy glow. They make the nail bed look healthier. I don&#x27;t know that they make the nail look whiter though. Cleaning your nails underneath well will help that part look whiter. The gel does make the nail harder and tougher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow these tips, you should have no problems.</li>
            <li> I like the color of this polish! Out in the sun, it makes your nails have a very pink tint. Indoors, it has more of a naturally glossy appearance. :) It does seem to chip off fairly easily, but applying new coats is very easy and quick.</li>
            <li> I have never had good nails till now.  The key is to use it as directed.  one thin coat per day for seven days...and then you take it all off with nail polish remove and repeat the process. my nails are not split or thin. i amso impresssed. the only problemi had was that it got really thick towards the end.</li>
