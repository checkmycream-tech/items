            <li>It required a lot of cleaning before being able to use the rest of the palette but the colors themselves are great in and of themselves.</li>
            <li>I am going to buy the more neutral palette for myself!</li>
            <li>Love this palette!</li>
            <li>From what I could tell, I think I will love the product if they can get it to me in one piece!  </li>

            <li>I think they are great for all occasions and look fantastic on my skin.</li>
            <li>The price is amazing for the selection of colours</li>
            <li>Nice palette.&lt;br /&gt;Colors are pigmented and as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Colors are a bit powdery and therefore there is a lot of fallout and breakage in the pan.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>

            <li>The pigment is great and best itll last all day</li>
            <li>Love the many colors to work with!</li>
            <li>Love it every shadow came perfect no broken ones :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok not all that honestly</li>
            <li>Great price and well worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;E.L.F. is pretty reliable in terms of creating products that are affordable and that are great for makeup beginners.</li>
            <li>Packaged Nicely &amp; Came Quickly!</li>
            <li>Oh my God, this thing is huge!</li>
            <li>It Was My Favorite.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I find Maybelline and Rimmel to be much better drugstore brands for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>but so many of these colors just don&#x27;t show up at all.</li>
            <li>I love the options of mattes and shimmers.</li>
            <li>So many colors.</li>
            <li>One thing for sure is you need a primer</li>
            <li>Wish the colors stood out more against my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love all the colors.</li>
            <li>So It gets just and OK from me.</li>
            <li>will purchase more from ELF</li>
            <li>I wish a lot of the colors were better pigmented.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more after this run out.</li>
            <li>and I am beyond satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>(: Love ELF products.</li>
            <li>The rest of the colors have brilliant payoff, are soft to work with, and the shades are stunning.</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased for the price.</li>
            <li>would recommend to all who love makeup</li>
            <li>This is my favorite makeup.</li>
            <li>Colors are bright and vibrant!</li>
            <li>and definitely recommend these shadows for beginners and the more experienced alike.</li>
            <li>The lid came with a huge crack across it, but that wasn&#x27;t a huge issue for me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to be huge</li>
            <li>But Its Perfect No Cracks Or Missing Eye Shadows.</li>
            <li>Such a great palette of colors some with sheens and some mattes.  </li>
            <li>This palette would be great for someone learning how to do eye make-up, but for those of us who need make-up to last, I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>My teen daughter was so happy to get this.</li>
            <li>I have experienced the same con of the product.</li>
            <li>Colors are great especially with primer.</li>
            <li>which is great, the colors are just what all I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li>I really want to like this more</li>
            <li>I got lucky</li>
            <li>Luckily, my palette came unbroken, so it&#x27;s held together well.</li>
            <li>I still had been able to use the colors however most of the colors i loved were finished or broken.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and easily blendable.</li>
            <li>My sister and I fell in love with the vivid colors.</li>
            <li>These eye shadows really look and feel cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>This item was well worth the $12.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taken a few tries to figure out how to get the brighter colors to pop the best for photoshoots, but for the range of colors available for the price, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I originally ordered from Elf a few years ago and was very pleased with the product until it broke which was my fault.</li>
            <li>it only takes a dab, you get the true color of the pallet,I went back and bought several more to use as gift for my friends, the price is great</li>
            <li>The reason for the 5 stars is that the item though broken was highly pigmented and  customer service tried their best to replace it...</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and find it to be very versatile and a lot of fun.</li>
            <li>And there&#x27;s so many colors to choose from, I think this will be the the last eyeshadow palette I&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
            <li>Some are good and others seem a bit dull and/or fade quickly.</li>
            <li>And I am a african american woman and the color pigment shows up good on my complexion would recommend this for any beginner in make up like myself.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is pretty good so far for the price.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that by lunch time the color is pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>The application of the color is pretty good, but not spectacular.</li>
            <li>Out of 144 shadows I feel like 5 duds is pretty decent.</li>
            <li>I really really like e.l.f.</li>
            <li>The pigments in this pallet don&#x27;t really show up on my skin.</li>
            <li>Intense pigment.</li>
            <li>it came very well packaged and protected with bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>You need to apply an eye primer for these shadows because they are very powderery.</li>
            <li>Shipping was way fast</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care that much to go through exchanging it</li>
            <li>(thanks</li>
            <li>Other than that fantastic!</li>
            <li>However my palette did not hold the colors well and the glue came lose and a lot of the colors got tossed around and the glue got stuck on top of other colors.</li>
            <li>other than that I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I find all the shadows to be highly pigmented and very blendable.</li>
            <li>Nice Variety Of Colors &amp; Its Actually An Eye Shadow That Lasts All Day Long!</li>
            <li>And all the case full of powder in the outside..</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re obviously not the color intensity you&#x27;d find in say Lancome or Mac, but perfect the casual makeup wearer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really good when put to use for halloween - applying cream foundation on then using a blush brush to brush on greens and blues makes a pretty convincing undead base.</li>
            <li>The colors don&#x27;t have great pay off with out a base or white cream eyeliner beneath them, but work great for beginners such as myself.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you are looking for high end eye shadows that will be used on runways or for photo shoots.</li>
            <li>this is a wonder product, highly pigmented colors if you have the correct brushes (eye shadow)</li>
            <li>My item arrived broken twice.. that said the palette looks good and highly pigmented..</li>
            <li>I rarely wear makeup, and I travel a LOT, so packing an entire bag of assorted odds and ends didn&#x27;t make sense to me.</li>
            <li>With a good base these gorgeous colors will last all day.</li>
            <li>I just received my new palette</li>
            <li>I submitted a request for a refund and was contacted by the seller stating that they would overnight a new one and for me to keep or donate the damaged item as an apology.</li>
            <li>Definitely going to be more careful with this one</li>
            <li>far as the pallet itself, they aren&#x27;t extremely pigmented seeing as how cheap it is</li>
            <li>This was broken upon arrival, I&#x27;m sure I would write a higher review</li>
            <li>the colors apply easily enough however use primer to really make them pop.and save yourself heaps of layering.</li>
            <li>I really like that it has a mix of matte and metallic colors and that it includes neutral tones for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips</li>
            <li>The shipping was incredibly fast (ordered it on a Thursday, received it the following Tuesday) and was well packaged (no damage to the product).</li>
            <li>but if you tap the brush before applying that issue is almost completely eliminated.</li>
            <li>Love if, use it everyday and all my friends want one!!</li>
            <li>E.l.f. makes fantastic brush sets and other products, but this was the second set of eye shadows I bought from them</li>
            <li>When I was doing my research on this product prior to ordering it, I read in the reviews that the colors tend to not be as vibrant.</li>
            <li>Two stars because it&#x27;s a good deal for $15 but overall very poor quality eye shadow.</li>
            <li>There are a variety of colors to choose from, and as stated before, as long as you use a primer - the shadows will be as vibrant as they look within the palette when transferred to your face.</li>
            <li>My 12 yr old asked for this as a Christmas present.</li>
            <li>Sent this to my friend as an early Christmas present and she loves it!</li>
            <li>Came in, Nothing broken, LOVE THE QUALITY.  </li>
            <li>No colors were broken when I got it:)</li>
            <li>The only thing is about two colours was broken &amp; was over most of the colours, dusted it out.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Colors are great especially with primer.</li>
            <li> which is great, the colors are just what all I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> I really want to like this more</li>
            <li> I got lucky</li>
            <li> Luckily, my palette came unbroken, so it&#x27;s held together well.</li>
            <li> I still had been able to use the colors however most of the colors i loved were finished or broken.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and easily blendable.</li>
            <li> My sister and I fell in love with the vivid colors.</li>
            <li> These eye shadows really look and feel cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This item was well worth the $12.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken a few tries to figure out how to get the brighter colors to pop the best for photoshoots, but for the range of colors available for the price, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered from Elf a few years ago and was very pleased with the product until it broke which was my fault.</li>
            <li> it only takes a dab, you get the true color of the pallet,I went back and bought several more to use as gift for my friends, the price is great</li>
            <li> The reason for the 5 stars is that the item though broken was highly pigmented and  customer service tried their best to replace it...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and find it to be very versatile and a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> And there&#x27;s so many colors to choose from, I think this will be the the last eyeshadow palette I&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
            <li> Some are good and others seem a bit dull and/or fade quickly.</li>
            <li> And I am a african american woman and the color pigment shows up good on my complexion would recommend this for any beginner in make up like myself.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is pretty good so far for the price.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that by lunch time the color is pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> The application of the color is pretty good, but not spectacular.</li>
            <li> Out of 144 shadows I feel like 5 duds is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I really really like e.l.f.</li>
            <li> The pigments in this pallet don&#x27;t really show up on my skin.</li>
            <li> Intense pigment.</li>
            <li> it came very well packaged and protected with bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> You need to apply an eye primer for these shadows because they are very powderery.</li>
            <li> Shipping was way fast</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care that much to go through exchanging it</li>
            <li> (thanks</li>
            <li> Other than that fantastic!</li>
            <li> However my palette did not hold the colors well and the glue came lose and a lot of the colors got tossed around and the glue got stuck on top of other colors.</li>
            <li> other than that I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I find all the shadows to be highly pigmented and very blendable.</li>
            <li> Nice Variety Of Colors &amp; Its Actually An Eye Shadow That Lasts All Day Long!</li>
            <li> And all the case full of powder in the outside..</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re obviously not the color intensity you&#x27;d find in say Lancome or Mac, but perfect the casual makeup wearer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really good when put to use for halloween - applying cream foundation on then using a blush brush to brush on greens and blues makes a pretty convincing undead base.</li>
            <li> The colors don&#x27;t have great pay off with out a base or white cream eyeliner beneath them, but work great for beginners such as myself.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you are looking for high end eye shadows that will be used on runways or for photo shoots.</li>
            <li> this is a wonder product, highly pigmented colors if you have the correct brushes (eye shadow)</li>
            <li> My item arrived broken twice.. that said the palette looks good and highly pigmented..</li>
            <li> I rarely wear makeup, and I travel a LOT, so packing an entire bag of assorted odds and ends didn&#x27;t make sense to me.</li>
            <li> With a good base these gorgeous colors will last all day.</li>
            <li> I just received my new palette</li>
            <li> I submitted a request for a refund and was contacted by the seller stating that they would overnight a new one and for me to keep or donate the damaged item as an apology.</li>
            <li> Definitely going to be more careful with this one</li>
            <li> far as the pallet itself, they aren&#x27;t extremely pigmented seeing as how cheap it is</li>
            <li> This was broken upon arrival, I&#x27;m sure I would write a higher review</li>
            <li> the colors apply easily enough however use primer to really make them pop.and save yourself heaps of layering.</li>
            <li> I really like that it has a mix of matte and metallic colors and that it includes neutral tones for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips</li>
            <li> The shipping was incredibly fast (ordered it on a Thursday, received it the following Tuesday) and was well packaged (no damage to the product).</li>
            <li> but if you tap the brush before applying that issue is almost completely eliminated.</li>
            <li> Love if, use it everyday and all my friends want one!!</li>
            <li> E.l.f. makes fantastic brush sets and other products, but this was the second set of eye shadows I bought from them</li>
            <li> When I was doing my research on this product prior to ordering it, I read in the reviews that the colors tend to not be as vibrant.</li>
            <li> Two stars because it&#x27;s a good deal for $15 but overall very poor quality eye shadow.</li>
            <li> There are a variety of colors to choose from, and as stated before, as long as you use a primer - the shadows will be as vibrant as they look within the palette when transferred to your face.</li>
            <li> My 12 yr old asked for this as a Christmas present.</li>
            <li> Sent this to my friend as an early Christmas present and she loves it!</li>
            <li> Came in, Nothing broken, LOVE THE QUALITY.  </li>
            <li> No colors were broken when I got it:)</li>
            <li> The only thing is about two colours was broken &amp; was over most of the colours, dusted it out.</li>
            <li> which by the way, sticks very well even without primer, but is deeper and creamier with primer), and also pinch my blush brush and run it vertically up and down the strip of pink and purple colors to get blush from it.</li>
            <li> otherwise the staying power doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be abe to use the blue, purple, pink and red shades.</li>
            <li> Love the colors but it came broken with the green EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> it stayed for long time.....</li>
            <li> Stay on long with primer and setting spray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because I&#x27;ve purchased other pallets from this brand and the pigment levels were simply worlds apart.</li>
            <li> They do blend well when applied dry over a primer.</li>
            <li> This palette is I guess worth $15, but I returned it because it was really useless.</li>
            <li> You cannot use these wet either.</li>
            <li> Other reviews mention a few shades having poor color payoff and being hard to work with, this was true of maybe 5 of my shades.</li>
            <li> I love the color selection, but am a little disappointed at the staying power.</li>
            <li> and they are just not worth getting.</li>
            <li> They do not apply easy(caky) and definitely not worth the price</li>
            <li> As long as you use a primer and base, the colors are very vibrant and last well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about half a year now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not that dark, my skin is usually latte colored (except in the winter</li>
            <li> Just not extremely smooth and bendable.</li>
            <li> All the eyeshadoes now have a green tinge to them.</li>
            <li> Well, like a lot of others, several of the eyeshadows were broken when I received it.  </li>
            <li> When I received my order one of the colors had broken and made a mess inside the package.</li>
            <li> Sofa got dirty when i open a pallette at a time.</li>
            <li> I have found very few duds in this palette (if any!)</li>
            <li> You can create practically any look imaginable from neutral and subtle to showstopping.</li>
            <li> It Would Come Broken</li>
            <li> The product come broken. ...</li>
            <li> I use Urban Decay&#x27;s eye shadow primer as a base and the combo will stay on 10+ hours.</li>
            <li> However, a way to avoid this is to use an eyeshadow primer (either neutral base like a urban decay primer portion or</li>
            <li> I could see that when I was cleaning the broken pieces up..</li>
            <li> I like this palette one of my colors was broken when it arrived and all over the others</li>
            <li> Not Happy.</li>
            <li> ordered two 144 Piece Eyeshadow and the were broken eyeshadow everywhere my clothes</li>
            <li> Unfortunately My Son Got To It</li>
            <li> All the colors were in tact and none came broken!</li>
            <li> you can not go wrong..........</li>
            <li> A girl can never go wrong with all these colors.</li>
            <li> the Shipping package was terrible, there was no bubble wrap or foam to reduce the product being bounced around and the powder coming loose, also when i contacted amazon about my refund, i haven&#x27;t got a reply from them as of yet, very unhappy that the product is damaged and i am still without the product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too bad though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just disappointed is all...</li>
            <li> Disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> So Disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will need to have a base when you use this palette.</li>
            <li> in enthusiasm I applied eyeshadow over the NYX eye shadow base as soon as I received my packet.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great colors. Great product. Came in a timely fashion!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE, will purchase again in another color pallet</li>
            <li> I Had The 100 Count Elf Palette It Was My Favorite. Unfortunately My Son Got To It So I Ordered This Palette. I LOVE IT. Nice Variety Of Colors &amp; Its Actually An Eye Shadow That Lasts All Day Long! I Was Nervous It Would Come Broken Because Of Some Reviews But Its Perfect No Cracks Or Missing Eye Shadows. Packaged Nicely &amp; Came Quickly! I RECCOMEND This Palette</li>
            <li> I really really like e.l.f. for their quality and how affordable they are, but their eye shadows have not worked for me at all. They are just so un-pigmented. I put on like six layers of purple over UD primer and my boyfriend asked me if I was going to put on any make up before we went to dinner. This palette is I guess worth $15, but I returned it because it was really useless. I find Maybelline and Rimmel to be much better drugstore brands for eyeshadow. E.l.f. makes fantastic brush sets and other products, but this was the second set of eye shadows I bought from them and they are just not worth getting. Two stars because it&#x27;s a good deal for $15 but overall very poor quality eye shadow.</li>
            <li> The pigments in this pallet don&#x27;t really show up on my skin. I&#x27;m not that dark, my skin is usually latte colored (except in the winter when I&#x27;m​ a shade or two lighter) but so many of these colors just don&#x27;t show up at all. It&#x27;s a shame because I&#x27;ve purchased other pallets from this brand and the pigment levels were simply worlds apart. I&#x27;m just disappointed is all...</li>
            <li> An amazing range of shades. I love the options of mattes and shimmers. Just not extremely smooth and bendable. The lid came with a huge crack across it, but that wasn&#x27;t a huge issue for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Just awesome. So many colors. Intense pigment. Exactly what I was looking for. I use it for salsa and samba performances and the eye shadow stays in place and doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> Such a great palette of colors some with sheens and some mattes.  Just beautiful pigments.  One thing for sure is you need a primer otherwise the staying power doesn&#x27;t last long. Other than that fantastic!</li>
            <li> Wish the colors stood out more against my skin. You will need to have a base when you use this palette.</li>
            <li> Nice palette.&lt;br /&gt;Colors are pigmented and as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Colors are a bit powdery and therefore there is a lot of fallout and breakage in the pan.&lt;br /&gt;For the price it&#x27;s not too bad though.</li>
            <li> Bought two e.l.f. eye shadow kits.&lt;br /&gt; My sister and I fell in love with the vivid colors. very good buy the eye shadow stay on all day and night.</li>
            <li> the Shipping package was terrible, there was no bubble wrap or foam to reduce the product being bounced around and the powder coming loose, also when i contacted amazon about my refund, i haven&#x27;t got a reply from them as of yet, very unhappy that the product is damaged and i am still without the product</li>
            <li> I got the palette and 3 eyeshadow pans popped out the lid has a crack and the lid came off but the palette is awesome</li>
            <li> Boughtt his for my wife! She simply loves it! Great range of colours. The only thing is about two colours was broken &amp; was over most of the colours, dusted it out. Couldnt save the two colours, but still gave them 5 stars. e.l.f has great pigments &amp; quality stuff!</li>
            <li> My 12 yr old asked for this as a Christmas present. She is experimenting with makeup and loves the bright colors to play with. I am going to buy the more neutral palette for myself! They&#x27;re obviously not the color intensity you&#x27;d find in say Lancome or Mac, but perfect the casual makeup wearer.</li>
            <li> I love the color selection, but am a little disappointed at the staying power. I do use a eyelid primer and I&#x27;ve noticed that by lunch time the color is pretty much gone. This palette would be great for someone learning how to do eye make-up, but for those of us who need make-up to last, I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I love this palette. I use it every day and find it to be very versatile and a lot of fun. You can create practically any look imaginable from neutral and subtle to showstopping. I find all the shadows to be highly pigmented and very blendable. With a good base these gorgeous colors will last all day. I have found very few duds in this palette (if any!) and definitely recommend these shadows for beginners and the more experienced alike. You will get a great value for your money and if you are like me, it will spark a love affair with all of elf&#x27;s awesome products!</li>
            <li> It came in perfect condition. I got lucky I guess. But I use it all the time loving it</li>
            <li> Item descriptions says it includes the palette, an aplicator and a mirror. I only received the palette. The colors are great, yes. However my palette did not hold the colors well and the glue came lose and a lot of the colors got tossed around and the glue got stuck on top of other colors. I won&#x27;t be abe to use the blue, purple, pink and red shades.</li>
            <li> The colors don&#x27;t have great pay off with out a base or white cream eyeliner beneath them, but work great for beginners such as myself.</li>
            <li> Love it every shadow came perfect no broken ones :)</li>
            <li> Mine came on time and was in bubble wrap. So none of mine were broken.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the pallet itself, they aren&#x27;t extremely pigmented seeing as how cheap it is but they get the job done for home use, wouldn&#x27;t use on clients.</li>
            <li> Love the colors but it came broken with the green EVERYWHERE. All the eyeshadoes now have a green tinge to them. Disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> Love it. It came on time and it&#x27;s an exceptional product. I recommend that every girl that loves makeup should buy this pallette!</li>
            <li> Very nice colors very smooth comes with  bright and neutral colors. I would have rated this 5 stars but.. I felt that because it says eyes lips face please understand that this is only for the eye area and they should have made that specific for people that thought otherwise.</li>
            <li> lots of good colors to choose from and the package works well to see them all at once.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my second 144 palette...I originally ordered from Elf a few years ago and was very pleased with the product until it broke which was my fault. I still had been able to use the colors however most of the colors i loved were finished or broken. I just received my new palette and I&#x27;m sooo estatic! it came very well packaged and protected with bubble wrap. All the colors were in tact and none came broken! Definitely going to be more careful with this one and i am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Being as inexpensive as it is this palette is wonderful! I&#x27;ve had it for about half a year now and it has served me well. I&#x27;ve used it to create different smokey eyes as well as for several costumes I&#x27;ve put together. As long as you use a primer and base, the colors are very vibrant and last well. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Oh my God, this thing is huge! I was expecting something so much smaller for some reason. And there&#x27;s so many colors to choose from, I think this will be the the last eyeshadow palette I&#x27;ll ever need. All the colors arrived intact and neat. the colors apply easily enough however use primer to really make them pop.and save yourself heaps of layering. I have no complaints here and am totally happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I rarely wear makeup, and I travel a LOT, so packing an entire bag of assorted odds and ends didn&#x27;t make sense to me. This palette is a good collection of colors for a variety of looks. I use individual colors for eyeshadow (which by the way, sticks very well even without primer, but is deeper and creamier with primer), and also pinch my blush brush and run it vertically up and down the strip of pink and purple colors to get blush from it. It&#x27;s also really good when put to use for halloween - applying cream foundation on then using a blush brush to brush on greens and blues makes a pretty convincing undead base. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> These eye shadows really look and feel cheaply made. They do not apply easy(caky) and definitely not worth the price</li>
            <li> The product come broken. ...</li>
            <li> This was broken upon arrival, I&#x27;m sure I would write a higher review had that not occured.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette cause my sister in law had it and I used it. I love all the colors. The pigment is great and best itll last all day and i didnt even have to use primer!!!</li>
            <li> I got this for the salon I worked at and I loved all the colors I was getting. When I went to go try it on a client, mind you, I used a primer, but didn&#x27;t get the vibrancy I was looking for. So It gets just and OK from me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok not all that honestly</li>
            <li> Today received my elf palette , very happy with the colors, all colors are amazing. in enthusiasm I applied eyeshadow over the NYX eye shadow base as soon as I received my packet. it stayed for long time.....will purchase more from ELF</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful palette! Colors are bright and vibrant! The application of the color is pretty good, but not spectacular. Luckily, my palette came unbroken, so it&#x27;s held together well.</li>
            <li> Came in, Nothing broken, LOVE THE QUALITY.  Shipping was great!</li>
            <li> bought this for my HS daughter - she had a lot of formals to attend this year. We were very pleased with the price ($15) and the rapid shipping! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this and i like it. Some of the colors aren&#x27;t as pigminted as others but it is very good. No colors were broken when I got it:)</li>
            <li> I wish a lot of the colors were better pigmented. Some are good and others seem a bit dull and/or fade quickly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be huge which is great, the colors are just what all I wanted and expected. I will be ordering more after this run out.</li>
            <li> I really want to like this more but I don&#x27;t. You need to apply an eye primer for these shadows because they are very powderery. You cannot use these wet either. They must be an oil based eyeshadow. They do blend well when applied dry over a primer.</li>
            <li> Sent this to my friend as an early Christmas present and she loves it! Shipping was way fast and I am beyond satisfied with my purchase. Will be purchasing again (: Love ELF products.</li>
            <li> Love this palette! It&#x27;s taken a few tries to figure out how to get the brighter colors to pop the best for photoshoots, but for the range of colors available for the price, definitely worth it. I really like that it has a mix of matte and metallic colors and that it includes neutral tones for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for best color: use a brush eye shadow applicator rather than a foam one. Load the brush with about 4-5 strokes and press the powder on your lids, don&#x27;t wipe or you&#x27;ll just keep pulling powder off. Repeat as necessary. I use Urban Decay&#x27;s eye shadow primer as a base and the combo will stay on 10+ hours.</li>
            <li> When I received my order one of the colors had broken and made a mess inside the package. I submitted a request for a refund and was contacted by the seller stating that they would overnight a new one and for me to keep or donate the damaged item as an apology. Talk about top notch customer service!! The second one arrived in pristine condition. The eye shadows have every color imaginable and last all day. I think they are great for all occasions and look fantastic on my skin. I plan to order the neutral palette as well.</li>
            <li> Well, like a lot of others, several of the eyeshadows were broken when I received it.  Nothing like purple eyeshadow strewn across the rest of the colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve asked for a replacement, so we&#x27;ll see what shape it is in when I get it.  From what I could tell, I think I will love the product if they can get it to me in one piece!  If the replacement is also damaged, I am going to ask for a refund.</li>
            <li> I regret not buying this product earlier in life and saving loads of money on every color you can think of. the quality is very good too, when I wear the eyeshadow it lasts all day</li>
            <li> Love the many colors to work with!</li>
            <li> The case arrived with the eyeshadows about six of them completely pulverizad and its división completely empty. And all the case full of powder in the outside..</li>
            <li> My teen daughter was so happy to get this. She says the elf primer works well to bring out the pigment and keep it on longer.</li>
            <li> - I always do my research on products before buying them (that goes for online or within a store) -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty impressed with the e.l.f. 144 piece eyeshadow palette. When I was doing my research on this product prior to ordering it, I read in the reviews that the colors tend to not be as vibrant. I have experienced the same con of the product. However, a way to avoid this is to use an eyeshadow primer (either neutral base like a urban decay primer portion or what I found to work well is NYX&#x27;s jumbo eye pencil in milk). This helps the colors keep their color and stay on longer. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you are looking for high end eye shadows that will be used on runways or for photo shoots. I would recommend this product to those just starting off in makeup and want to play with how to mix colors and utilize shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product. The shipping was incredibly fast (ordered it on a Thursday, received it the following Tuesday) and was well packaged (no damage to the product). Also, great price for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E.L.F. is pretty reliable in terms of creating products that are affordable and that are great for makeup beginners. There are a variety of colors to choose from, and as stated before, as long as you use a primer - the shadows will be as vibrant as they look within the palette when transferred to your face.</li>
            <li> This item was well worth the $12. Other reviews mention a few shades having poor color payoff and being hard to work with, this was true of maybe 5 of my shades. Out of 144 shadows I feel like 5 duds is pretty decent. The rest of the colors have brilliant payoff, are soft to work with, and the shades are stunning. There are so many gorgeous colors I have no idea where to begin! There is some fall out but if you tap the brush before applying that issue is almost completely eliminated. The product came in perfect condition, too. I could not be more pleased for the price.</li>
            <li> My item arrived broken twice.. that said the palette looks good and highly pigmented..I could see that when I was cleaning the broken pieces up.. Company have great customer service too... The reason for the 5 stars is that the item though broken was highly pigmented and  customer service tried their best to replace it...</li>
            <li> The price is amazing for the selection of colours and I was specifically looking for greens. However, there was no protection for the palette and it got cracked. I don&#x27;t really care that much to go through exchanging it so I&#x27;m keeping it. Other than that it is pretty good so far for the price.</li>
            <li> My daughter got this for her eyes and when I saw it I ordered one for myself for &amp;#34;chalking&amp;#34; on my paper crafts.</li>
            <li> this is a wonder product, highly pigmented colors if you have the correct brushes (eye shadow) it only takes a dab, you get the true color of the pallet,I went back and bought several more to use as gift for my friends, the price is great,I couldn&#x27;t pass it up..this is a wonderful product...you can not go wrong..........</li>
            <li> In the shipping process, several of the colors broke and crumbled along the case.  It required a lot of cleaning before being able to use the rest of the palette but the colors themselves are great in and of themselves.</li>
            <li> buildable color palette&lt;br /&gt;vivid colors&lt;br /&gt;great saturation&lt;br /&gt;long lasting color&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to all who love makeup&lt;br /&gt;great value</li>
            <li> Very good palette and set of colors! I love it!</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and easily blendable. This is my favorite makeup.</li>
            <li> Overwhelmingly awesome!! Trying to use different colors each day... It&#x27;s gonna take years...(thanks for that)</li>
            <li> DId not realize how big this palette was! Its amazing!</li>
            <li> I like this palette one of my colors was broken when it arrived and all over the others so I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it but other than that I love this thing. A girl can never go wrong with all these colors. And I am a african american woman and the color pigment shows up good on my complexion would recommend this for any beginner in make up like myself.</li>
            <li> Great colors, all were in tact and happy with this purchase. Stay on long with primer and setting spray. Great price and well worth it.</li>
            <li> Love if, use it everyday and all my friends want one!! It&#x27;s the perfect look for Any style!</li>
            <li> Colors are great especially with primer. Lasts my entire 12 hour shift.</li>
            <li> Not Happy. Very disappointed. Will never order eyeshadow again.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two 144 Piece Eyeshadow and the were broken eyeshadow everywhere my clothes Sofa got dirty when i open a pallette at a time. So Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Giving it 5 stars as it is a great pallette for this price. I received my order in a perfect condition. Colors stay on all day.</li>
            <li> So many colors to choose from!!!</li>
