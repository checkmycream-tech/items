            <li>Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was great, but Costco has better deals if you are buying two.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, I love how it has improved my dental health.  </li>
            <li>Appears to work perfectly, and to have been a bit better made than my original unit, which lasted four years.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get better than a sonicare!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>great replacement for the original</li>
            <li>Excellent, looks and works like new.</li>
            <li>But so far so good!!</li>
            <li>Works like a charm fits my old flex care perfect</li>
            <li>Balk package not as good quality as original and there is no warranty.</li>
            <li>My gums are feeling much better.  </li>
            <li>Love that I could buy only what I needed and great price!</li>
            <li>but this one is so much better.</li>
            <li>so glad I could get this by itself and didn&#x27;t have to order charger with it.  </li>
            <li>Found a better price at Sam&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>better than the one b4&lt;br /&gt;thanx</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try and find another handle that cleans better, even if it costs much more.</li>
            <li>Unless you have a soldering iron, extremely good vision and are adept in these types of things plan on buying a new unit every two years or have sokeone replace this 20 dollar battery for you.</li>
            <li>Work great and saved me from buying an all new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>There is nothing like a Sonic clean !</li>
            <li>Works great with my old charger and toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li>other than the change function button getting tapped while brushing which changes the vibration - excellent handle.  </li>
            <li>Strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The handle seems to work just fine, but the item came wrapped in a plastic bag with no packing slip, no manual or brochure.  </li>
            <li>Works Fine  </li>
            <li>Cheaper than price from Philips and worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Love my new handle and got such wonderful service with Amazon too!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an engineer and consider myself somewhat mechanically adept but certainly changing the battery was beyond the scope for me.</li>
            <li>We ordered two genuine part replacements (as pictured).  </li>
            <li>Now my teeth are fresh and clean :)</li>
            <li>Also, my brush head (that fit perfectly on my original sonicare flex+) doesn&#x27;t stay on and wiggles off during brushing.</li>
            <li>It holds the charge and functions like the original.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace my original one I had for years.</li>
            <li>Looks identical to the original</li>
            <li>Matches my original.</li>
            <li>Nice to be able to replace only the battery portion of the unit rather than buying the full package( chargers</li>
            <li>Arrived in great condition and works just as expected.</li>
            <li>My Sonicare handle was a wise choice as opposed to purchasing the entire kit.  </li>
            <li>I have had it for more than a month now and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Works great so far saved me $65 from buying a brand new set up</li>
            <li>The handle is not as powerful as the original toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>We ordered and received two brushes that are even better than our older model brushes.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and Kept me on my brushing schedule.</li>
            <li>Instead of buying a whole new set, I was able to get this handle only for a great deal.  </li>
            <li>It is the OEM exact match for what I originally bought.  </li>
            <li>Excellent replacement for our broken flexcare.</li>
            <li>Get price and arrived right away.</li>
            <li>Replacement for handle thar wasn&#x27;t working right.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, it looks good, and it works like my old one did when it was brand new.</li>
            <li>Needed a replacement, great to find only what I needed instead of a whole new system</li>
            <li>My husband has an older model that is still operating perfectly but this one just didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I didn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new system.</li>
            <li>Also, &#x27;bar&#x27; style battery indicator is much better than a &#x27;single&#x27; light indicator.</li>
            <li>This was a good price, works just like my other one, it&#x27;s not the newest model but does the job!</li>
            <li>Glad to get an economical replacement method with very same OEM hardware!</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Fit&#x27;s and charges on my original charger like it was purchased in the same package.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Still going on first charge.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll shop more next time.</li>
            <li>My previous Sonicare handle was stolen and I was very happy to replace it by itself without having to buy an entire new brush.</li>
            <li>Being able to buy the handle alone was awesome since I already had the charging base.  </li>
            <li>I watched two videos and pretty much break mine apart to get the batery out rendering it destroyed.</li>
            <li>Worked perfectly out of the box, was an exact replacement for one that was broken; fits on the charging stand exactly the same.</li>
            <li>good quality, quick shipping, although the package is a little too simple...</li>
            <li>I like this toothbrush so much that I bought three of them.</li>
            <li>Despite that, I like the toothbrush so much</li>
            <li>I like that they sell the unit without forcing me to buy the whole set since this is a replacement for a handle that no longer works.</li>
            <li>and I would have appreciated a manual or something explaining what some of the settings were for.</li>
            <li>Since I have been using the Sonicare, my dental appointments have been much easier.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for saving me the cost of purchasing a lot of items I did not need such as charging stations and brushes by making the handle available as a stand-alone item.</li>
            <li>Works just like it should and cheaper than buying the whole unit.</li>
            <li>Showed up extremley fast, even though it was not a Prime product.</li>
            <li>- this is more like an electric toothbrush rather than an actual Sonicare - and my teeth aren&#x27;t getting cleaned nearly like a Sonicare.</li>
            <li>What was NOT mentioned to me was that when the lithium battery eventually goes dead you need to own a soldering iron and have electrical tech skills to change the battery.</li>
            <li>I dont know if these are quality control rejects or refurbed handles, as it looks new, but the wiggle and shake of the handle isn&#x27;t nearly as powerful as a new sonicare handle</li>
            <li>My old sonic are lasted 7 years so if this only Lasts a year it won&#x27;t be worth it!!</li>
            <li>Love that I could buy the replacement handle for less then having to buy a whole package.</li>
            <li>Exact replacement for the old one.</li>
            <li>Saved me a lot of money by not having to buy a whole new unit.</li>
            <li>Same charger and heads fit from old Hx67XX models.</li>
            <li>My own analysis is that the up-and-down movement of the brush has the same frequency, but is lower in amplitude (the degree of movement from the center position).</li>
            <li>A replacement for an older brush handle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>It works the same, is just as powerful</li>
            <li>Glad it came with the information pamphlet, too, as this model is slightly newer than my old one.</li>
            <li>New handle is way cheaper than new unit, and it worked for me.</li>
            <li>But product was new.</li>
            <li>It came with bulk packaging, but the plastic film is still on the button area, so I believe this is brand new.  </li>
            <li>bought Sonicare, as this one, even brand new, doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>They want you to buy a new unit instead.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted only one year.</li>
            <li>This replacement handle (except for a slight color difference) is exactly the same model and OEM brand that came with my original system.  </li>
            <li>You absolutely must dry the whole thing after every use.</li>
            <li>several months later still easily holding a charge for several weeks at twice a day</li>
            <li>I was afraid that the battery would not hold a charge, but I&#x27;ve had it for more than 30 days and it works fine with my old charger sets.  </li>
            <li>Just what I needed, didn&#x27;t want to buy the whole system again and my old one finally bit the dust.</li>
            <li>My old Sonicare Flexcare+ handle broke, but I still had brush heads and the recharging stand.</li>
            <li>Interior electronics were completely corroded from water intrusion.  </li>
            <li>Delivered early.  </li>
            <li>My old toothbrush&#x27;s battery decided to stop charging on me.  </li>
            <li>Surprised throw away products like ths are given such high reviews and receommended by dentists.</li>
            <li>I recommend this brush and seller to anyone/everyone who already has a charger and simply needs a new handle.</li>
            <li>Big savings over replacing my Sonicare with a brand new retail item.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy these again.</li>
            <li>Replaced my old one that finally wore out after 5 years</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this, but sadly it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li>Similar to other lower than average reviews, the action of this replacement handle is less vigorous than my original, which broke after about 4 years of daily use.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s both the good news and the bad news.  </li>

            <li> Replacement for handle thar wasn&#x27;t working right.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, it looks good, and it works like my old one did when it was brand new.</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement, great to find only what I needed instead of a whole new system</li>
            <li> My husband has an older model that is still operating perfectly but this one just didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I didn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new system.</li>
            <li> Also, &#x27;bar&#x27; style battery indicator is much better than a &#x27;single&#x27; light indicator.</li>
            <li> This was a good price, works just like my other one, it&#x27;s not the newest model but does the job!</li>
            <li> Glad to get an economical replacement method with very same OEM hardware!</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Fit&#x27;s and charges on my original charger like it was purchased in the same package.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Still going on first charge.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll shop more next time.</li>
            <li> My previous Sonicare handle was stolen and I was very happy to replace it by itself without having to buy an entire new brush.</li>
            <li> Being able to buy the handle alone was awesome since I already had the charging base.  </li>
            <li> I watched two videos and pretty much break mine apart to get the batery out rendering it destroyed.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly out of the box, was an exact replacement for one that was broken; fits on the charging stand exactly the same.</li>
            <li> good quality, quick shipping, although the package is a little too simple...</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush so much that I bought three of them.</li>
            <li> Despite that, I like the toothbrush so much</li>
            <li> I like that they sell the unit without forcing me to buy the whole set since this is a replacement for a handle that no longer works.</li>
            <li> and I would have appreciated a manual or something explaining what some of the settings were for.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using the Sonicare, my dental appointments have been much easier.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for saving me the cost of purchasing a lot of items I did not need such as charging stations and brushes by making the handle available as a stand-alone item.</li>
            <li> Works just like it should and cheaper than buying the whole unit.</li>
            <li> Showed up extremley fast, even though it was not a Prime product.</li>
            <li> - this is more like an electric toothbrush rather than an actual Sonicare - and my teeth aren&#x27;t getting cleaned nearly like a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> What was NOT mentioned to me was that when the lithium battery eventually goes dead you need to own a soldering iron and have electrical tech skills to change the battery.</li>
            <li> I dont know if these are quality control rejects or refurbed handles, as it looks new, but the wiggle and shake of the handle isn&#x27;t nearly as powerful as a new sonicare handle</li>
            <li> My old sonic are lasted 7 years so if this only Lasts a year it won&#x27;t be worth it!!</li>
            <li> Love that I could buy the replacement handle for less then having to buy a whole package.</li>
            <li> Exact replacement for the old one.</li>
            <li> Saved me a lot of money by not having to buy a whole new unit.</li>
            <li> Same charger and heads fit from old Hx67XX models.</li>
            <li> My own analysis is that the up-and-down movement of the brush has the same frequency, but is lower in amplitude (the degree of movement from the center position).</li>
            <li> A replacement for an older brush handle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> It works the same, is just as powerful</li>
            <li> Glad it came with the information pamphlet, too, as this model is slightly newer than my old one.</li>
            <li> New handle is way cheaper than new unit, and it worked for me.</li>
            <li> But product was new.</li>
            <li> It came with bulk packaging, but the plastic film is still on the button area, so I believe this is brand new.  </li>
            <li> bought Sonicare, as this one, even brand new, doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> They want you to buy a new unit instead.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted only one year.</li>
            <li> This replacement handle (except for a slight color difference) is exactly the same model and OEM brand that came with my original system.  </li>
            <li> You absolutely must dry the whole thing after every use.</li>
            <li> several months later still easily holding a charge for several weeks at twice a day</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the battery would not hold a charge, but I&#x27;ve had it for more than 30 days and it works fine with my old charger sets.  </li>
            <li> Just what I needed, didn&#x27;t want to buy the whole system again and my old one finally bit the dust.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare Flexcare+ handle broke, but I still had brush heads and the recharging stand.</li>
            <li> Interior electronics were completely corroded from water intrusion.  </li>
            <li> Delivered early.  </li>
            <li> My old toothbrush&#x27;s battery decided to stop charging on me.  </li>
            <li> Surprised throw away products like ths are given such high reviews and receommended by dentists.</li>
            <li> I recommend this brush and seller to anyone/everyone who already has a charger and simply needs a new handle.</li>
            <li> Big savings over replacing my Sonicare with a brand new retail item.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> Replaced my old one that finally wore out after 5 years</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this, but sadly it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Similar to other lower than average reviews, the action of this replacement handle is less vigorous than my original, which broke after about 4 years of daily use.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s both the good news and the bad news.  </li>
            <li> My other brush I guess just wore out was 5 years old  </li>
            <li> Works like new and doesn&#x27;t appear to have any damage / wear due to long time storage.</li>
            <li> The price is a little high.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting battery.  </li>
            <li> My old one died after a few years.  </li>
            <li> I ordered two but one of them will not hold a charge long.</li>
            <li> long</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> the first toothbrush failed, I took it to my workbench and cut it apart to see what was going on.</li>
            <li> Rather than buying a different model, I chose to buy this as a direct replacement for what failed for me due to age.  </li>
            <li> Hard to believe other consumers are not having this same problem.</li>
            <li> If this one doesn&#x27;t last at least two years, I&#x27;ll be finished with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> shaft wore out on previous one so had to buy a replacement</li>
            <li> I plan to soon cut apart the second failed toothbrush to see if I find the same defect.  </li>
            <li> No original box or package.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  Received it in just a few days😁</li>
            <li> but I have owned this for a few years and it has helped to reduce the cleaning visits to the dentist.</li>
            <li> If you want a brush that cleans your teeth well and don&#x27;t mind dealing with a handle that will become disgusting to hold after a while, you will be satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I just paid 20 bucks for three replacement brush heads last week and now I have a totally destroyed throw away unit and three worthless brush heads.</li>
            <li> holds a charge for at least 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I had to buy this part as my original one got a nasty case of mold inside the flexible plastic.  </li>
            <li> Poor longevity.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need the base only the handle went berserk.</li>
            <li> Broken after 9 months.</li>
            <li> We just put it on the base we already had, and it works like a charm!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> shaft wore out on previous one so had to buy a replacement</li>
            <li> Arrived in great condition and works just as expected. My previous Sonicare handle was stolen and I was very happy to replace it by itself without having to buy an entire new brush. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. I recommend this brush and seller to anyone/everyone who already has a charger and simply needs a new handle. Now my teeth are fresh and clean :)</li>
            <li> this is a great prodauct&lt;br /&gt;got it on time and use it twice a day</li>
            <li> New handle is way cheaper than new unit, and it worked for me.</li>
            <li> Great product and received in a timely manner</li>
            <li> Appears to work perfectly, and to have been a bit better made than my original unit, which lasted four years.</li>
            <li> Long lasting battery.  Cleans well.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement handle. Get price and arrived right away.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the replacement handle. It holds the charge and functions like the original.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare handle was a wise choice as opposed to purchasing the entire kit.  I have had it for more than a month now and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Great product. works awesome. No original box or package. But product was new.</li>
            <li> Received what I bought.</li>
            <li> This was a good price, works just like my other one, it&#x27;s not the newest model but does the job!</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare Flexcare+ handle broke, but I still had brush heads and the recharging stand. I bought this handle, and it is a perfect replacement. Shipping was fast, it looks good, and it works like my old one did when it was brand new. Glad it came with the information pamphlet, too, as this model is slightly newer than my old one.</li>
            <li> other than the change function button getting tapped while brushing which changes the vibration - excellent handle.  several months later still easily holding a charge for several weeks at twice a day</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  Poor longevity.  I like this toothbrush so much that I bought three of them. That&#x27;s both the good news and the bad news.  The toothbrush works great. The best I have ever had. The first one lasted only one year. The second one lasted only seven months. Despite that, I like the toothbrush so much I just bought a third one. If this one doesn&#x27;t last at least two years, I&#x27;ll be finished with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the first toothbrush failed, I took it to my workbench and cut it apart to see what was going on. Interior electronics were completely corroded from water intrusion.  My conclusion is there is a manufacturing defect in sealing the electronics in the toothbrush handle. I plan to soon cut apart the second failed toothbrush to see if I find the same defect.  I love this toothbrush – but these things are not cheap – and if this third one doesn&#x27;t last at least two years this will be my last purchase.  Hard to believe other consumers are not having this same problem.</li>
            <li> Delivered early.  Operates flawlessly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect. I didn&#x27;t need the base only the handle went berserk. This handle fits and functions. It was a lot cheaper to just get the handle</li>
            <li> I think this is an excellent product for helping to maintain good oral health.  I personally use this toothbrush and recommend it to my patients.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the battery would not hold a charge, but I&#x27;ve had it for more than 30 days and it works fine with my old charger sets.  I like that they sell the unit without forcing me to buy the whole set since this is a replacement for a handle that no longer works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this device.  But I can tell the difference in using it.  My gums are feeling much better.  It was recommended by my Dentist.  The price is a little high.  But it will save you in seeing the Dentist.  Also, keep money in your pockets</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. The handle is not as powerful as the original toothbrush. No warranty information provided. Returning it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love that I could buy the replacement handle for less then having to buy a whole package. After going through 3 packages, I have plenty of charges laying around and didn&#x27;t need another.</li>
            <li> Have owned it for about 18 months and it has died.  Won&#x27;t hold a charge.  My husband has an older model that is still operating perfectly but this one just didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> The switch on my original Sonicare toothbrush died, and this works as a perfect replacement</li>
            <li> Great deal on a replacement handle.  My old toothbrush&#x27;s battery decided to stop charging on me.  Instead of buying a whole new set, I was able to get this handle only for a great deal.  It came with bulk packaging, but the plastic film is still on the button area, so I believe this is brand new.  Works great with my old charger and toothbrush head.  Great choice for someone looking for a replacement handle!</li>
            <li> good quality, quick shipping, although the package is a little too simple...</li>
            <li> The handle seems to work just fine, but the item came wrapped in a plastic bag with no packing slip, no manual or brochure.  It&#x27;s a bit different from my prior handle and I would have appreciated a manual or something explaining what some of the settings were for.</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement, great to find only what I needed instead of a whole new system</li>
            <li> Love that I could buy only what I needed and great price!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, didn&#x27;t want to buy the whole system again and my old one finally bit the dust. Works perfect!</li>
            <li> My old one died after a few years.  The chargers, heads, and all accessories were still plentiful.  Rather than buying a different model, I chose to buy this as a direct replacement for what failed for me due to age.  I am VERY pleased.  It is the OEM exact match for what I originally bought.  I expect to get another good run of years.  The performance of this model is awesome and I have used and loved it for years!  Glad to get an economical replacement method with very same OEM hardware!</li>
            <li> I had one of these for about 7 years but the battery eventually gave out.  Being able to buy the handle alone was awesome since I already had the charging base.  Since I have been using the Sonicare, my dental appointments have been much easier.  I used to have to get deep scaling done but I no longer have to.  I attribute that to this product.  I used to use another brand but this one is so much better.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. Fit&#x27;s and charges on my original charger like it was purchased in the same package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and this one is a replacement.  Works great, no problems.</li>
            <li> Works great I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Replaced my old one that finally wore out after 5 years</li>
            <li> I ordered two but one of them will not hold a charge long. Hoping for a response form supplier.</li>
            <li> This replacement handle (except for a slight color difference) is exactly the same model and OEM brand that came with my original system.  It works the same, is just as powerful and I am so glad I didn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new system.</li>
            <li> Worked well for me. Big savings over replacing my Sonicare with a brand new retail item.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get better than a sonicare!</li>
            <li> There is nothing like a Sonic clean !</li>
            <li> Works Fine  so glad I could get this by itself and didn&#x27;t have to order charger with it.  My other brush I guess just wore out was 5 years old  Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great. I bought it to replace my original one I had for years. I thought the price was great, but Costco has better deals if you are buying two.If you are a member check there before buying this one.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly out of the box, was an exact replacement for one that was broken; fits on the charging stand exactly the same. Saved me a lot of money by not having to buy a whole new unit.</li>
            <li> Nice to be able to replace only the battery portion of the unit rather than buying the full package( chargers etc)&lt;br /&gt;  Received it in just a few days😁</li>
            <li> We ordered two genuine part replacements (as pictured).  Two arrived.  Only one worked.</li>
            <li> Just as promised, good deal.</li>
            <li> Shippimg was fast and efficient, and I have had this for a few weeks now. I dont know if these are quality control rejects or refurbed handles, as it looks new, but the wiggle and shake of the handle isn&#x27;t nearly as powerful as a new sonicare handle - this is more like an electric toothbrush rather than an actual Sonicare - and my teeth aren&#x27;t getting cleaned nearly like a Sonicare. Also, my brush head (that fit perfectly on my original sonicare flex+) doesn&#x27;t stay on and wiggles off during brushing. I had high hopes for this, but sadly it&#x27;s not worth the money. I have gone back to using my husband&#x27;s store bought Sonicare, as this one, even brand new, doesn&#x27;t cut it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> Love my new handle and got such wonderful service with Amazon too!!</li>
            <li> Replacement for handle thar wasn&#x27;t working right.  Works well....just what I needed.</li>
            <li> It works great.  I only problem is my brush doesn&#x27;t stay on all the time but it is a generic brush so that could be the reason.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! Works like new and doesn&#x27;t appear to have any damage / wear due to long time storage. We ordered and received two brushes that are even better than our older model brushes. Same charger and heads fit from old Hx67XX models. Price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than price from Philips and worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Still going on first charge. Excellent.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Work great and saved me from buying an all new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Got to my house very quickly (2 days!!!).  Was packaged well.  Works perfectly.  No complaints</li>
            <li> Works well but the rubber surface, especially the on/off button, deteriorates over time. After a while it develops a surface similar to a rubber eraser, i.e.  it absorbs surface dirt and can not be cleaned because the dirt actually blends into the rubber, and to remove the dirt, you need to scrape off some of the rubber.  If you want a brush that cleans your teeth well and don&#x27;t mind dealing with a handle that will become disgusting to hold after a while, you will be satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Came quickly and Kept me on my brushing schedule.</li>
            <li> Great price, in perfect shape!  Also it came in record time.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe I found what I needed,I Love Amazon!!!! My sonicare is excellent!!!</li>
            <li> Already had the charger and brush heads so was a great replacement at a great price!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush and have longer battery life</li>
            <li> Looks identical to the original</li>
            <li> great replacement for the original</li>
            <li> Expectations were met with a great quality product. Very happy camper</li>
            <li> bought 2 refurbished , already 1 went out on me.</li>
            <li> Broken after 9 months. Balk package not as good quality as original and there is no warranty.</li>
            <li> Great replacement price as described!</li>
            <li> very happy with the flexcare  hx6932  holds a charge for at least 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Thank you for saving me the cost of purchasing a lot of items I did not need such as charging stations and brushes by making the handle available as a stand-alone item.</li>
            <li> Came timely and was what I needed.</li>
            <li> Found a better price at Sam&#x27;s.  This one works great but I&#x27;ll shop more next time.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, I love how it has improved my dental health.  I had to buy this part as my original one got a nasty case of mold inside the flexible plastic.  You absolutely must dry the whole thing after every use.</li>
            <li> Works just like it should and cheaper than buying the whole unit.</li>
            <li> delivered as xpected. better than the one b4&lt;br /&gt;thanx</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement for our broken flexcare. We just put it on the base we already had, and it works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Sonicare is an excellent dental care brush. I just needed handle replaced but I have owned this for a few years and it has helped to reduce the cleaning visits to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Surprised throw away products like ths are given such high reviews and receommended by dentists. What was NOT mentioned to me was that when the lithium battery eventually goes dead you need to own a soldering iron and have electrical tech skills to change the battery. I watched two videos and pretty much break mine apart to get the batery out rendering it destroyed. I still can&#x27;t see where the battery connectors were soldered into the the circuit board or how the battery could have been taken out without someone showing me in person. I&#x27;m an engineer and consider myself somewhat mechanically adept but certainly changing the battery was beyond the scope for me. Unless you have a soldering iron, extremely good vision and are adept in these types of things plan on buying a new unit every two years or have sokeone replace this 20 dollar battery for you. I just paid 20 bucks for three replacement brush heads last week and now I have a totally destroyed throw away unit and three worthless brush heads. All this because the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t want you to replace the battery. They want you to buy a new unit instead. I am taking this piece of junk back to the dentist that sold it to me and ask why no disclaimer on the battery replacement.</li>
            <li> The best model among Philips Sonicare i have used. Being a senior, the massage feature is great. Also, &#x27;bar&#x27; style battery indicator is much better than a &#x27;single&#x27; light indicator. Strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. I decided to stick with Sonicare, because My last Sonicare&#x27;s Battery lasted 5+ Years... How can You complain about that??? With Zero Cavities</li>
            <li> Similar to other lower than average reviews, the action of this replacement handle is less vigorous than my original, which broke after about 4 years of daily use. My own analysis is that the up-and-down movement of the brush has the same frequency, but is lower in amplitude (the degree of movement from the center position). I&#x27;m going to try and find another handle that cleans better, even if it costs much more.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery. Product arrived as described. Great price!</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised.  A replacement for an older brush handle.</li>
            <li> Showed up extremley fast, even though it was not a Prime product. This was a replacement handle since I broke my last one. Works perfectly, just needs to fully charged upon receiving the product. Just so you do know, this handle does not include a brushhead.</li>
            <li> Exact replacement for the old one. Perfect</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Excellent, looks and works like new. Matches my original. I have Used it for about 2 weeks. Did not come with any warranty info.</li>
            <li> The best toothbrushing experience you&#x27;ll ever have!!!! 😁</li>
            <li> Works great so far saved me $65 from buying a brand new set up, I was reading it didn&#x27;t last that long so we will see. My old sonic are lasted 7 years so if this only Lasts a year it won&#x27;t be worth it!! But so far so good!! Works like a charm fits my old flex care perfect</li>
