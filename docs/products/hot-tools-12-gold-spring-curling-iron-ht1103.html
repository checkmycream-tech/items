            <li>This item looks strong, I am amateur in hair styling</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t go wrong with this amazing product.</li>
            <li>Not to sure how long my curling iron will last due to that, but other then that, product is alright.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Produces fantastic curls. Used for Seussical, &amp;#34;Thing 1&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Bird Girl&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> works well. stays on - have to remember to shut it off, but thats okay cause it drives me nuts sometimes when the auto shutoff activates while I&#x27;m still using it. I have a long hair so I need it to stay on longer. Works really well with any length.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Works great. As with all heat on your hair be careful, but this works like my old $200 one and much better (and safer) than the $20 walmart one I borrowed.</li>
            <li> Curling iron heats up quickly. Good quality iron.</li>
            <li> Love the distribution of heat in the curling iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;&#x27;ve used these for years. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase any other kind.</li>
            <li> Great for little girls hair</li>
            <li> It gets hot enough but just doesn&#x27;t grip my hair like I would like it to. All in all though good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for me. Works great.</li>
            <li> Part the opens the curling iron is too far away (not for small hands) from the curling iron and handle is to slippery...no grip.</li>
            <li> This item looks strong, I am amateur in hair styling and I had hard time using this tool on my hair. I have dry hair and after two weeks using this item my hair almost burned! So my advice is to know your hair before using any electric heating device.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Hot Tools curling iron (I have two other different sizes), and they are the BEST!  The heat control is really a temperature control, and makes this curling iron superior to all others I have tried.  No matter what size you want, always buy Hot Tools.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Heats up fast and creates super tight curls. Be warned it is very thin about the thickness of a pinkie finger.</li>

            <li> Love this curling iron.  Heats up fast and has a strong spring.</li>

            <li> I ordered the wrong size of rod on this one. I have decided to keep&lt;br /&gt;it, although it was a mistake.</li>
            <li> This curing iron works like a charm. From the first time I pushed the on button, it fired up so fast and has been so reliable ever since. you won&#x27;t go wrong with this amazing product. I had a similar one before, but it didn&#x27;t heat up unless I jiggled the cord.</li>
            <li> Heats fast, never had problem with it.</li>
            <li> A perfect tool for curling short hair.</li>

            <li> My daughter loves it.  The high heat is the key to a good curling iron.</li>
            <li> This curling iron holds onto your hair, unlike cheaper ones that allows the hair to slip thru at times, especially if you have short hair.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! It gets so hot and curls my daughters hair perfect! And the curls hold!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.,  The only one I will use.</li>

            <li> This was a gift to my daughter.  She tells me it gets really hot and works really well.  Was packaged well and shipped promptly.  A+!</li>
            <li> It curls ok, but the clamp tends to bend at the finger presser when unclamping fairly easy. Not to sure how long my curling iron will last due to that, but other then that, product is alright.</li>
            <li> Finally found the right size.</li>
            <li> I love it and have always bought this brand for long time.</li>
            <li> the curling iron is great I should have ordered the 3/4 inch it is a bit small for the length of my hair but I am going to keep it anyway</li>
