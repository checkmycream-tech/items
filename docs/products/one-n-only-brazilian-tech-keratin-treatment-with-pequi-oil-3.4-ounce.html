            <li>Great light moisturizer</li>
            <li>I have to give an amazing review for this product.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Smells awesome and my hair feels so soft, I just love it !</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, makes your hair feel so healthy and shiny but not greasy</li>
            <li>product is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>absolutely love tuis oil.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended it to many friends.  </li>
            <li>I got some free samples from Sally Beauty supply and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>I had tried most oils before and nothing worked like this one.</li>
            <li>I loved this product so much I decided to order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>and it provides a lot of moisture to my hair and makes my curls look great and easier to style in general.</li>
            <li>but once it calms down its perfect.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new hair oil product and saw good reviews for this</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly have nothing to say about this product.</li>
            <li>The scent is way too strong though, way too much but until I fid another product with pequi oil</li>
            <li>It really helps condition the hair, keeps the frizz to a minimum, and the best thing of all, it quickly gets absorbed by the hair so the oil doesn&#x27;t sit on top of your hair and make it look greasy but actually sinks into the strands and is dry, soft, and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works to make your dry, damaged hair feel healthy!</li>
            <li>It was brittle and would break very very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was as if I had never used a hot tool or color on my hair.</li>
            <li>It was a bit oily at first</li>
            <li>it helps with the blow drying process so much!</li>
            <li>I have fine, bleached hair that is in pretty good shape, but it definitely isn&#x27;t as shiny as it once was, and all the chemicals have given it a little more frizziness if I don&#x27;t immediately blow dry and straight iron.</li>
            <li>The shine really stays - even after the first washing.</li>
            <li>The best product for my freezing, dry , hard to stright crunchy hair .</li>
            <li>Very well packaged, the product was intact.</li>
            <li>I could pull a brush straight through with no snags.</li>
            <li>It absolutely works for me.</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the whole coconut oil deal in the hair and though that wasn&#x27;t trrible</li>
            <li>it really didn&#x27;t quite do it for me.</li>
            <li>With the pequi oil, it&#x27;s really nourished it without making it greasy.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so soft and healthy, even after I blow dry, straighten, or curl!</li>
            <li>My hair went through a lot since I dyed it black for many years</li>
            <li>I have used too much and it left my hair looking greasy, right after washing.</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s pretty good though it&#x27;s a little heavy</li>
            <li>Makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It just made it so manageble and soft.</li>
            <li>type 1A (Straight with no natural body)&lt;br /&gt;Ethnicity</li>
            <li>so you have to be careful about how much you use</li>
            <li>I really does strengthen my hair and I notice less breakage after use.</li>

            <li> then let it air dry until it&#x27;s just barely damp anymore</li>
            <li> then flat iron.</li>
            <li> I received a few samples from sallys and it made my hair feel brand new again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black with long hair and this product makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive and pretty much the same result</li>
            <li> I have really long hair as well (Over two feet)</li>
            <li> I have only used this twice; however, I have thick, coarse hair and today it was extremely humid and my hair did not frizz as it normally would.  </li>
            <li> condition dry, brittle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was as dry as hay before I used this product.</li>
            <li> I towel dry my hair</li>
            <li> I  wash, put this on, and let it air dry...</li>
            <li> After getting a sample from Sally&#x27;s, I used it on my color treated dry hair.</li>
            <li> Pour just a small amount in your hand, which is hard to do because the opening on the bottle is rather large, rub your palms together and work from the tips of your hair to the middle.</li>
            <li> I use it on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick course brown hair and this made it shiny and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Initially, it does seem a little oily, but unlike other things I&#x27;ve tried, any oiliness dissipates after a couple hours.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> and I can assure you a little of this stuff goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Just...be careful when using it as you only need a small amount!  </li>
            <li> It cuts down the time by 60% please don&#x27;t ever stop making it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it adds a TON of shine.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the only product out of all I have used over the years that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and make me look greasy all day (and I have tried a TON - all the way up to the high-end salon products).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I received a couple sample pouches from Sally&#x27;s a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> and then I put a small amount (about a quarter size) and work it through my hair.</li>
            <li> but it was a complete disappointment.</li>
            <li> Usually, any shine product I add to my hair just starts me on a downward slope of looking greasier and greasier as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got thick bushy hair like me, use this!!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great for my wavy hair. Very well packaged, the product was intact.</li>
            <li> No problem with the product.</li>
            <li> Thank you for selling this on Amazon ! The best product for my freezing, dry , hard to stright crunchy hair . It cuts down the time by 60% please don&#x27;t ever stop making it</li>
            <li> I received a few samples from sallys and it made my hair feel brand new again. It was as if I had never used a hot tool or color on my hair. I could pull a brush straight through with no snags. It was a bit oily at first but once it calms down its perfect.</li>
            <li> Great light moisturizer</li>
            <li> User profile:&lt;br /&gt;Age 22&lt;br /&gt;Hair type 1A (Straight with no natural body)&lt;br /&gt;Ethnicity Asian&lt;br /&gt;Hair condition dry, brittle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product! It works to make your dry, damaged hair feel healthy! It really helps condition the hair, keeps the frizz to a minimum, and the best thing of all, it quickly gets absorbed by the hair so the oil doesn&#x27;t sit on top of your hair and make it look greasy but actually sinks into the strands and is dry, soft, and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hair that has been through several trials of dyes, color stripping, bleaching, and heated styling. My hair was as dry as hay before I used this product. It was brittle and would break very very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is phenomenal. I use it when it&#x27;s hair washing day. I towel dry my hair then let it air dry until it&#x27;s just barely damp anymore and then I put a small amount (about a quarter size) and work it through my hair. I have really long hair as well (Over two feet) and I can assure you a little of this stuff goes a long way! I also brush my hair after applying this oil to help distribute the product evenly and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my comb. This makes combing hair a breeze! A plus is that it smells great, and if you don&#x27;t like the smell, it does away very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly have nothing to say about this product. It absolutely works for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I use it on wet or dry hair. Makes it soft and manageable. It also smells great.</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  I really does strengthen my hair and I notice less breakage after use.</li>
            <li> I was using a very good product with pequi oil that I couldn&#x27;t find anymore so I tried this and I am very happy with it! Much less expensive and pretty much the same result so I am happy with it. The scent is way too strong though, way too much but until I fid another product with pequi oil this is it.</li>
            <li> We are happy with the product</li>
            <li> absolutely love tuis oil.  I have recommended it to many friends.  I will order definitely order it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black with long hair and this product makes my hair soft and manageable. Don&#x27;t go buy weaves just use this product .it also grows and nourishes  the hair . It&#x27;s excellent</li>
            <li> I have only used this twice; however, I have thick, coarse hair and today it was extremely humid and my hair did not frizz as it normally would.  Just...be careful when using it as you only need a small amount!  Just enough to coat your hair.  I  wash, put this on, and let it air dry...then flat iron.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing for my hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I bought it based on the great reviews but it was a complete disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have used this on my clients with great success.&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it on myself.  I have ear length pre-lightened Hair. No problematic.no Hair loss or anything.  On myself I processed it for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I received a couple sample pouches from Sally&#x27;s a few weeks ago. This stuff is amazing! The shine really stays - even after the first washing. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it adds a TON of shine. Initially, it does seem a little oily, but unlike other things I&#x27;ve tried, any oiliness dissipates after a couple hours. Usually, any shine product I add to my hair just starts me on a downward slope of looking greasier and greasier as the day goes on. I have fine, bleached hair that is in pretty good shape, but it definitely isn&#x27;t as shiny as it once was, and all the chemicals have given it a little more frizziness if I don&#x27;t immediately blow dry and straight iron. This is seriously the only product out of all I have used over the years that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and make me look greasy all day (and I have tried a TON - all the way up to the high-end salon products). I used it once a Saturday, and two days (and two washings) later, my mom was asking me what I was doing to make my hair so shiny. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have to give an amazing review for this product. I&#x27;ve tried the whole coconut oil deal in the hair and though that wasn&#x27;t trrible it really didn&#x27;t quite do it for me. THIS stuff was amazing! I got some free samples from Sally Beauty supply and it was amazing. I have thick course brown hair and this made it shiny and soft to the touch. I&#x27;m recovering from dying my hair red and going back to it&#x27;s natural brunette, and my hair has had it rough. With the pequi oil, it&#x27;s really nourished it without making it greasy. This is an amazing product. If you&#x27;ve got thick bushy hair like me, use this!!!!</li>
            <li> Makes hair shiney but not useful on dry end, using too much makes hair greasy looking.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all on my hair</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, makes your hair feel so healthy and shiny but not greasy it helps with the blow drying process so much!</li>
            <li> Best product for frizzy damaged hair! I had tried most oils before and nothing worked like this one. My hair went through a lot since I dyed it black for many years then decided to go lighter.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery! Great product! Makes my hair feel so soft and healthy, even after I blow dry, straighten, or curl!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and my hair feels so soft, I just love it !</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new hair oil product and saw good reviews for this, I think it&#x27;s pretty good though it&#x27;s a little heavy so you have to be careful about how much you use but overall I like it and it provides a lot of moisture to my hair and makes my curls look great and easier to style in general.</li>
            <li> After getting a sample from Sally&#x27;s, I used it on my color treated dry hair. It just made it so manageble and soft. It was as if I didn&#x27;t have over processed hair. I loved this product so much I decided to order it from Amazon. And my hair looks incredible with it also</li>
            <li> I love this product! Smells so good, leaves my hair shiny and it smells so good! A little goes a long ways. Pour just a small amount in your hand, which is hard to do because the opening on the bottle is rather large, rub your palms together and work from the tips of your hair to the middle. I would avoid the roots, you may get a greasy look. I have used too much and it left my hair looking greasy, right after washing. But that&#x27;s not the products fault!</li>
