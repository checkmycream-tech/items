            <li>I Like this cream to use in summer, it gives you a refreshing look.</li>

            <li>Smells just like roses but the scent fades quickly.</li>
            <li>I guess I expected better results with the Rose Hip ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I mixed this cream with hyaluronic acid serum, though I don&#x27;t doubt on its own it would be just as fantastic.</li>
            <li>lol I see myself buying several more jars in the future!!!</li>
            <li>the skin face is more soft, clean.  </li>
            <li>It is a delicate rose scent and a lovely light texture which is easily absorbed and there is no greasy feeling on the skin.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth buying.</li>
            <li>Maybe I have to use for long term to see amazing results...</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something light and fast absorbing</li>
            <li>It smells good but is a little thinner than I thought.</li>
            <li>, I tried this stuff, which has a main component of Rose HIP oil (which is an essential oil in the healing process of stretchmarks).</li>
            <li>it was not expensive.</li>
            <li>The texture of the cream is nice, but I threw it away due to it</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin too, so for the price and results, I highly recommend this product!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not all-natural - JFYI.  I now use as hand cream rather than on my face. Not very hydrating but non-greasy which is a plus.</li>
            <li> A little heavy but for this price it is the best facial cream for the money on the market.excellent shipping practices</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the best face creams I have ever bought.  It is a delicate rose scent and a lovely light texture which is easily absorbed and there is no greasy feeling on the skin.  I have noticed a marked improvement in my skin texture in just 10 days of use.  The price is very reasonable and this cream has given me much better results than more expensive products I have tried in the past.  I will definitely be buying it again and plan to make it my regular face cream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the scent and I get no results from using it/////glad it was not expensive. I am glad it was not expensive. I READ ON THE INTERNET ABOUT THE MANY VALUES OF USING ROSE HIP OIL SO THIS MUST HAVE NOT BEEN THE REAL THING.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and I can see the results &#x3D;) I love it, it really work.</li>
            <li> i used this product for a few day and thing is good  with this product you can see the different between  before and after.  the skin face is more soft, clean.  after that the cream smell good but  you cannot used every day, just 3 o 4time a week.  if you have oil skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  This is the best face cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Arrived to my home with a broken seal. Contacted customer service and could understand a word. They sent me to a voicemail, I left my message, and contact info and no one ever got back to me. The texture of the cream is nice, but I threw it away due to it bring open. I contacted them again with same outcome.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this helps greatly.  I also had a problem with my skin that dried very bad.  this was great.  I heard about this in Marocco when I went in April and was very happy with the cream.  but i went crazy trying to find it.  thank you for this I will be getting more when I run out.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT CREAM. MY HUSBAND AND I WE HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR OVER A MONTH AND WE CAN SEE THE RESULTS. IT SMELLS GOOD AND OUR SKIN IS RADIANT AND THE LINES ARE SOFT. WE USE IT TWICE A DAY.</li>
            <li> I love the tart rose scent, but I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a cream; more a lotion-gel. It&#x27;s just not very emollient or moisturizing. My hands still feel a little dry right after using it. I keep it by my bedside &amp; use it as a light eye cream &amp; or over the top of my richer moisturizing night oil.</li>
            <li> Smells very good but this is a very cheap cream. If you put it at night, in the morning you will be washing the film off your face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. You can feel your pores tightening after you put it n and the cream starts to finish soaking in. Smells just like roses but the scent fades quickly. Light feeling cream, non greasy. Will be buying more and more.</li>
            <li> I just bought this cream because I was looking for a light base cream to add other active ingredients to  address my personal needs, (however I used it as is-nothing added) and this one was perfect. very light and smooth not at all greasy and it absorbs readily into skin.  It smells of roses, pleasant to me.  Very generous size, the price is perfect.  I will update once I have used it longer.  If you are looking for something light and fast absorbing this is it.  Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin , so I don&#x27;t think this cream is good for my face  ..it has rosehip  oil in it .. It does smell great though, and I can use it on hands and elbows</li>
            <li> This cream is so smooth, smells nice! I don&#x27;t know yet if it will take away some face&#x27;s spots, because I just bought. I used it every two days only in face.</li>
            <li> love this item ,.. smells very good. arrived in time and before the estimated date. Will buy other products in the future...</li>
            <li> I guess I expected better results with the Rose Hip ingredients.  However it does seem to tighten my skin somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;My jar in now empty and I guess I have experienced what it does and does not do.</li>
            <li> not worked as designed and promoted</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a rigorous skincare regimen lately. Through researching I found that I could benefit from vitamin E and rose hip oil. Originally I was going to order vitamin E oil and rose hip oil separately until I accidentally discovered this cream. I&#x27;m so happy I did! This cream made my skin unbelievably soft! It absorbs wonderfully and I feel confident my face is really hydrated and moisturized. I mixed this cream with hyaluronic acid serum, though I don&#x27;t doubt on its own it would be just as fantastic.

            <li> This lotion smells great and goes on smoothly. My skin drinks it up. It is not greasy, I will definitely order it again ... if I ever run out, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It worked good, not amazing but it worked. Maybe I have to use for long term to see amazing results... anyway I was pleased with the product &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Was a gift really like the lotion will be purchasing some more for myself and my family members.  Very pleased</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product contains parabens which I could not tell from the product description. I hope this helps someone else avoid the sames mistake I made.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It makes you face feel so baby soft.  I also like how fragrance of the product.  It is well worth buying.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference...so I stopped after a short time</li>
            <li> The product feels soothing to my skin and it smells like roses.  I use it for face cream before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> It smells good but is a little thinner than I thought.</li>
            <li> Item as described and delivered promptly</li>
            <li> I use rose hip oil to remove my make-up, and I use this cream throughout the day to moisturize. It works great and smells even better. A little goes a long way so this is still in my drawer.</li>
            <li> I Like this cream to use in summer, it gives you a refreshing look.</li>
            <li> Im a young africian-americian girl who has stretch marks on my butt and thighs. After trying mederma for 3 months (which did help a bit), and palmers coca butter formula for stretchmark&#x27;s (barley did a thing- high don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone!), I tried this stuff, which has a main component of Rose HIP oil (which is an essential oil in the healing process of stretchmarks). After two months of using this every day religiously, I felt my skin irritated in the form of being itchy, but I didn&#x27;t break out at all and only see the marks fading so I think you can actrually feel the healing (: I have super sensitive skin too, so for the price and results, I highly recommend this product!</li>
