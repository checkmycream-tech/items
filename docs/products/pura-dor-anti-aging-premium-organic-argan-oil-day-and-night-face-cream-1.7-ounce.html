            <li>What I like best about the Pura d&#x27;or argan oil cream is its absorption into the skin.  </li>

            <li>Fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li>love it but did not expect the price it being the deal of the day and all .  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that my face does not feel &#x27;sticky&amp;#34; after I have applied it and after about a minute I can put my head on my pillow at night-time without worrying about  leaving a residue on the sheets.</li>
            <li>It is a nice scent, light.</li>
            <li>I though that the Anti-aging Face Cream would be ok for me.</li>
            <li>My skins feels better and looks better.</li>
            <li>Love the way it feels once applied.</li>
            <li>And the word &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; in its name makes me feel even better :).</li>
            <li>I have used so many skin care products and none of them work until now.  </li>
            <li>Just love the way my skin feels after applying and</li>
            <li>For most of them I have skin allergy and irritation.</li>
            <li>Lately I&#x27;ve loved my skin so much, I&#x27;ve been skipping foundation all together!</li>
            <li>My face looks much better and the cream itself is very soft and smooth!!!</li>
            <li>I am always hesitant to try a new cream - but in this case I am sooo happy I did try it.</li>
            <li>It is without scent, which is great for me, because I have a very sensitive sense of smell.</li>
            <li>I apply it in the morning and in the evening  on top of Sisley ecological compound.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love this so much I&#x27;m ordering more before I run out!</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it keeps my face nice and smooth and gives it a fresh look.  </li>
            <li>It is rich and creamy - and fully absorbs into my skin, no greasy feeling on the top of my skin.</li>
            <li>It is also a great present for mothers :)</li>
            <li>This one is very mild.  </li>
            <li>The price is well worth the results that are obtained by this amazing cream, it’s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>For a woman who was a blonde beauty when I married her and admired today for her excellent complexion, that is a honored position.</li>
            <li>This cream goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and gives my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>and it has made a huge difference in my all over smooth skin.</li>
            <li>At my time of life, I am compelled to consider price as one of primary issues.</li>
            <li>It provides amazing moisturizer and really clears and smooths the skin.  </li>
            <li>Super clean ingredients, lovely whipped feel, easily absorbed, helps my makeup glide on &amp; look even better.</li>
            <li>The argan oil component of the lotion diminishes blemish scars and leaves my skin feeling and looking dewey, smooth, and radiant.</li>
            <li>and it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>My face skin is smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>With that being said, I’ve really fallen for this amazing product.</li>
            <li>As for the cream itself, it goes on smooth and creamy and it leaves my skin feeling like silk and taunt.</li>
            <li>So, this product has good quality, natural ingredients like aloe and argan oil.</li>
            <li>So far my skin feels good, smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>my face feels clean and smooth all the time.</li>
            <li>I have been an avid Mary Kay fan for many years.  </li>
            <li>and I, It&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin..hydrates your skin..</li>
            <li>The cream is getting absorbed very quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used almost the full jar and can see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li>Love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, but still feels super moisturizing .  </li>
            <li>I will be a loyal customer from here on out.</li>
            <li>She commented that it absorbs quickly, leaving no oily or greasy residue, while making the skin feel softer and smoother to the touch.</li>
            <li>This product has helped my skin become smoother and it has almost entirely gotten rid off any fine lines around my eyes!!</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t sound off much</li>
            <li>I love natural ingredients, which is of course what attracted me to this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my skin and on how young I look.</li>
            <li>If needed I can apply the makeup right away - no need to wait until the cream will be absorbed.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve honestly seen only positive results.</li>
            <li>n&#x27; center every day, and I can definitely appreciate a product that&#x27;s good for you, not costing an arm &amp; a leg that makes my skin glow &amp; makes me feel better about myself.</li>
            <li>, I found this jar of cream inside the shipping box without a product brand box or any protection,and the jar got a little scratch,  and to me, I am scared, and it looks to me some kind of cheap product just throw into the shipping box, and I paid $99.99 for it.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to strong scents.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and smooth...</li>
            <li>I love the consistency of the cream, and it goes on easily and absorbs quickly, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>My skin in so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Naturally, the primary reason to use organic moisturizers, is to avoid applying harmful skin care chemicals on your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different face creams.</li>
            <li>I have combination and sensitive skin and it feels smooth and luxurious when I apply it on my face.</li>
            <li>As good as some of the more expensive face creams.</li>
            <li>Have been using this cream for a few weeks and love how it feels on my skin!</li>
            <li>Recommend highly!  </li>
            <li>This is really a soft, delicate cream and reminds me a lot of Dr. Hauschka rose day cream light (without the fragrance).  </li>
            <li>It really is wondrous stuff.</li>
            <li>I really like that it is no fragrance cream that increses my faith that there are NO chemicals used.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
            <li>After six months l still have some and still doing a fabulous job not only on wrinkles but age spots as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like that this cream is made from organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I was very worried, I had tried some creams and lotions but nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I found it to be very hydrating and nourishing for my skin.</li>
            <li>The cream is gentle and I have not had any sensitivity or reactions to it.</li>
            <li>I have spent so much money at beauty stores such as sephora to find one that complements my normal to dry combination skin, none of which has really impressed me.</li>
            <li>The price of this product is a small one to pay to get these kind of results.</li>
            <li>I have been using PURA D &#x27;OR for about 3 weeks now &amp; can honestly say that it  feels like velvet when I apply it to my face and the small wrinkles around my eyes are disappearing.</li>
            <li>My face looks and feels more smooth, firm, and has this radiant glow that makes me look so much younger.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is a little pricey but some other creams like top name brands don&#x27;t perform as well and are even more money.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something organic and with ingredients that work for my forehead and mouth area as I get older.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin,and I am in my 40&#x27;s ,and always looking for a natural anti-aging face cream, and I read the reviews on this product, and every one gives it a 5 stars rating, and so, I decide to give  it a try even the price is pretty expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will be continuing to purchase.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it...</li>
            <li>Little more gratefruit for me than tree bark.</li>
            <li>I really believe that fine  lines are not so noticeable anymore and the deeper lines are less noticeable, too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having such a laugh.</li>
            <li>I swim daily and spend a lot of time in the sun and this product prevents dry skin and absolutely makes me excited each morning to look in the mirror and see what new results happened overnight.</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin loves it!</li>
            <li>I want to keep my skin looking and feeling young!  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful face cream;  you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li>Although first 3-4 days there wasn&#x27;t any difference in my skin but for last 3 days I am observing a clear and glowing skin.</li>
            <li>am the person that don&#x27;t like to return what I orders, and so, I tried it, so far, it has been about 2 weeks I tried, and I don&#x27;t see the result</li>
            <li>My skin feels baby soft and so hydrated.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how velvety soft it felt upon application.</li>
            <li>It makes my face so soft and it lasts, when I put it on before bed</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old</li>
            <li>This cream by far has exceeded all the creams I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Not only does it leave my face feeling very hydrated in the morning</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it has all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It really works, I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Silky soft texture leaves skin plump and baby soft.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need more than a minute amount to do the job, anything more is useless and not absorbed.</li>
            <li>I might add that there is a healthy subtle glow.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend It, especially in combination with the serum!</li>
            <li>Normally I have to constantly re-apply moisturizer in the winter to keep my skin moisturized, but this cream keep my face and neck plump, supple and hydrated for hours after applying.</li>
            <li>This is a new staple in my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I have used 2 major luxury brands creams ( SK2 and Estee Lauder).</li>
            <li>Last year during recovery from surgery, I had felt to do research on natural skin care products when I came across pura d&#x27;ors face cream.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this organic face cream and will continue to do so even though I would love to keep it a secret.</li>
            <li>I have really dry skin and in just a short time I can tell so much difference in the feel and look of my skin.  </li>
            <li>my wife just loves it, after using olay and other creams for years coming across this product was absolute discovery.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this product and not to waste your money on any other products out there.</li>
            <li>A little of this cream goes a very long way, so it&#x27;s well worth the investment for your youth.</li>

            <li> I love the fact that my face does not feel &#x27;sticky&amp;#34; after I have applied it and after about a minute I can put my head on my pillow at night-time without worrying about  leaving a residue on the sheets.</li>
            <li> It is a nice scent, light.</li>
            <li> I though that the Anti-aging Face Cream would be ok for me.</li>

            <li> Love the way it feels once applied.</li>
            <li> And the word &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; in its name makes me feel even better :).</li>
            <li> I have used so many skin care products and none of them work until now.  </li>
            <li> Just love the way my skin feels after applying and</li>
            <li> For most of them I have skin allergy and irritation.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve loved my skin so much, I&#x27;ve been skipping foundation all together!</li>
            <li> My face looks much better and the cream itself is very soft and smooth!!!</li>
            <li> I am always hesitant to try a new cream - but in this case I am sooo happy I did try it.</li>
            <li> It is without scent, which is great for me, because I have a very sensitive sense of smell.</li>
            <li> I apply it in the morning and in the evening  on top of Sisley ecological compound.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love this so much I&#x27;m ordering more before I run out!</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it keeps my face nice and smooth and gives it a fresh look.  </li>
            <li> It is rich and creamy - and fully absorbs into my skin, no greasy feeling on the top of my skin.</li>
            <li> It is also a great present for mothers :)</li>
            <li> This one is very mild.  </li>
            <li> The price is well worth the results that are obtained by this amazing cream, it’s worth every penny!</li>

            <li> and it has made a huge difference in my all over smooth skin.</li>
            <li> At my time of life, I am compelled to consider price as one of primary issues.</li>

            <li> Super clean ingredients, lovely whipped feel, easily absorbed, helps my makeup glide on &amp; look even better.</li>

            <li> So far my skin feels good, smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> my face feels clean and smooth all the time.</li>
            <li> I have been an avid Mary Kay fan for many years.  </li>
            <li> and I, It&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin..hydrates your skin..</li>
            <li> The cream is getting absorbed very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost the full jar and can see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, but still feels super moisturizing .  </li>
            <li> I will be a loyal customer from here on out.</li>
            <li> She commented that it absorbs quickly, leaving no oily or greasy residue, while making the skin feel softer and smoother to the touch.</li>
            <li> This product has helped my skin become smoother and it has almost entirely gotten rid off any fine lines around my eyes!!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t sound off much</li>
            <li> I love natural ingredients, which is of course what attracted me to this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my skin and on how young I look.</li>
            <li> If needed I can apply the makeup right away - no need to wait until the cream will be absorbed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve honestly seen only positive results.</li>
            <li> n&#x27; center every day, and I can definitely appreciate a product that&#x27;s good for you, not costing an arm &amp; a leg that makes my skin glow &amp; makes me feel better about myself.</li>
            <li> , I found this jar of cream inside the shipping box without a product brand box or any protection,and the jar got a little scratch,  and to me, I am scared, and it looks to me some kind of cheap product just throw into the shipping box, and I paid $99.99 for it.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to strong scents.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and smooth...</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of the cream, and it goes on easily and absorbs quickly, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> My skin in so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Naturally, the primary reason to use organic moisturizers, is to avoid applying harmful skin care chemicals on your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different face creams.</li>
            <li> I have combination and sensitive skin and it feels smooth and luxurious when I apply it on my face.</li>
            <li> As good as some of the more expensive face creams.</li>
            <li> Have been using this cream for a few weeks and love how it feels on my skin!</li>
            <li> Recommend highly!  </li>
            <li> This is really a soft, delicate cream and reminds me a lot of Dr. Hauschka rose day cream light (without the fragrance).  </li>
            <li> It really is wondrous stuff.</li>
            <li> I really like that it is no fragrance cream that increses my faith that there are NO chemicals used.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Pura d&#x27;or.</li>
            <li> After six months l still have some and still doing a fabulous job not only on wrinkles but age spots as well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like that this cream is made from organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I was very worried, I had tried some creams and lotions but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I found it to be very hydrating and nourishing for my skin.</li>
            <li> The cream is gentle and I have not had any sensitivity or reactions to it.</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money at beauty stores such as sephora to find one that complements my normal to dry combination skin, none of which has really impressed me.</li>
            <li> The price of this product is a small one to pay to get these kind of results.</li>
            <li> I have been using PURA D &#x27;OR for about 3 weeks now &amp; can honestly say that it  feels like velvet when I apply it to my face and the small wrinkles around my eyes are disappearing.</li>
            <li> My face looks and feels more smooth, firm, and has this radiant glow that makes me look so much younger.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little pricey but some other creams like top name brands don&#x27;t perform as well and are even more money.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something organic and with ingredients that work for my forehead and mouth area as I get older.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin,and I am in my 40&#x27;s ,and always looking for a natural anti-aging face cream, and I read the reviews on this product, and every one gives it a 5 stars rating, and so, I decide to give  it a try even the price is pretty expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and will be continuing to purchase.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it...</li>
            <li> Little more gratefruit for me than tree bark.</li>
            <li> I really believe that fine  lines are not so noticeable anymore and the deeper lines are less noticeable, too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having such a laugh.</li>
            <li> I swim daily and spend a lot of time in the sun and this product prevents dry skin and absolutely makes me excited each morning to look in the mirror and see what new results happened overnight.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin loves it!</li>
            <li> I want to keep my skin looking and feeling young!  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful face cream;  you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Although first 3-4 days there wasn&#x27;t any difference in my skin but for last 3 days I am observing a clear and glowing skin.</li>
            <li> am the person that don&#x27;t like to return what I orders, and so, I tried it, so far, it has been about 2 weeks I tried, and I don&#x27;t see the result</li>
            <li> My skin feels baby soft and so hydrated.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how velvety soft it felt upon application.</li>
            <li> It makes my face so soft and it lasts, when I put it on before bed</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old</li>
            <li> This cream by far has exceeded all the creams I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Not only does it leave my face feeling very hydrated in the morning</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It really works, I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Silky soft texture leaves skin plump and baby soft.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need more than a minute amount to do the job, anything more is useless and not absorbed.</li>
            <li> I might add that there is a healthy subtle glow.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive?</li>
            <li> I highly recommend It, especially in combination with the serum!</li>
            <li> Normally I have to constantly re-apply moisturizer in the winter to keep my skin moisturized, but this cream keep my face and neck plump, supple and hydrated for hours after applying.</li>
            <li> This is a new staple in my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I have used 2 major luxury brands creams ( SK2 and Estee Lauder).</li>
            <li> Last year during recovery from surgery, I had felt to do research on natural skin care products when I came across pura d&#x27;ors face cream.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this organic face cream and will continue to do so even though I would love to keep it a secret.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and in just a short time I can tell so much difference in the feel and look of my skin.  </li>
            <li> my wife just loves it, after using olay and other creams for years coming across this product was absolute discovery.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this product and not to waste your money on any other products out there.</li>
            <li> A little of this cream goes a very long way, so it&#x27;s well worth the investment for your youth.</li>
            <li> I used to waste so much money at the department stores on moisturizers--I wish I had known about the miracle of organic skin care long ago.</li>
            <li> She keeps complaining it doesn&#x27;t last her as long as she thought.</li>
            <li> The product goes a &amp;#34;very&amp;#34; long way.  </li>
            <li> First 2-3 days after opening it I had some trouble with the lotion sticking to the cap of the  bottle, which made hard to open it.  </li>
            <li> I had dark circles and some laxity under my eyes, and shortly after using Purador&#x27;s face cream, these are no longer an issue.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Unlike some of my other face creams that become thin or watery, this product remains consistent in texture.</li>
            <li> it lasts a long time you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> I use it while my skin is still wet</li>
            <li> I only wish it didn&#x27;t give my forehead an oily sheen, but that&#x27;s due to my mixed skin type (part oily, part dry) and not due to anything wrong with the product.  </li>
            <li> There is not an oily or heavy residue compared to other facial moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using Pura D&#x27;or products for over 3 years and in comparison to other brands, i have noticed a dramatic positive difference in my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I had a damaged skin due to sun and some cosmetics.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only small complain is the design of the bottle.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have to be very careful with lotions, creams and cosmetics I buy.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not as I had expected, I had intentions of using this as my night cream but after one application dried my face out.</li>
            <li> I thank God for making a way for me to get this cream and after the price had gone down too.</li>
            <li> I will not repurchase this product unless the price was to be cut in half...or less.</li>
            <li> This cream puts the finishing touch on the serum which is a little sticky.  </li>
            <li> Chemicals, animal products, and unhealthy preservatives can damage our skin, and possibly bodies, in the long-term.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like heavy perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Purador Organic Face Cream for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I never liked using all those chemicals found in other creams.</li>
            <li> And I was only applying very little at each time!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Puda dor Aragan oil for the past three years.</li>
            <li> Took care of small wrinkles with in days.</li>
            <li> but I have also noticed a reduction in the dark circles that have formed in the past few years (which expensive eye creams wouldn&#x27;t even get rid of).</li>
            <li> I decided to try less expensive and less steps.</li>
            <li> I do put a little avocado oil on before when it is bitter cold</li>
            <li> What I like least is the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At least 2 close friends also observed that</li>
            <li> The price is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this for my wife and she loves it; but the secret is that I also use it about 1 hour after I shave.</li>
            <li> and I can see a dramatic change in my hair and skin.  </li>
            <li> and I can already notice a dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li> not impressive .I</li>
            <li> the others reviews got.&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed shopper.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> got my order, and when I opened the shipping box, and I was very disappointed</li>

            <li> I have very sensitive skin,and I am in my 40&#x27;s ,and always looking for a natural anti-aging face cream, and I read the reviews on this product, and every one gives it a 5 stars rating, and so, I decide to give  it a try even the price is pretty expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I got my order, and when I opened the shipping box, and I was very disappointed, I found this jar of cream inside the shipping box without a product brand box or any protection,and the jar got a little scratch,  and to me, I am scared, and it looks to me some kind of cheap product just throw into the shipping box, and I paid $99.99 for it. not impressive .I expect more for that price.&lt;br /&gt;I am the person that don&#x27;t like to return what I orders, and so, I tried it, so far, it has been about 2 weeks I tried, and I don&#x27;t see the result the others reviews got.&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed shopper.</li>
            <li> Love this cream! Finally something I can afford to stick with! My skin feels baby soft and so hydrated. I have very dry skin so I mix my foundation with moisturizer for a dewy look. Lately I&#x27;ve loved my skin so much, I&#x27;ve been skipping foundation all together! The perfect complexion and compliments will have me coming back for more!</li>
            <li> This cream goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and gives my skin a healthy glow. It is without scent, which is great for me, because I have a very sensitive sense of smell. Best of all is that it is chemical free and contains organic ingredients. I can actually understand the list of ingredients...</li>
            <li> I have used Puda dor Aragan oil for the past three years. It has been incredibly moisturizing. I use it on my  hands, arms, legs and feet twice daily and it has made a huge difference in my all over smooth skin. I recently received this Pura dor organic face cream as a gift. I couldn&#x27;t believe how velvety soft it felt upon application. Instantaneously my face had a glow, each time I have used it I look more youthful. I have received compliments and inquiries on what I have done and where they can get it. I swim daily and spend a lot of time in the sun and this product prevents dry skin and absolutely makes me excited each morning to look in the mirror and see what new results happened overnight. I have recommended this organic face cream and will continue to do so even though I would love to keep it a secret.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 2 months now and love it! It makes my face so soft and it lasts, when I put it on before bed my face has held in that moisture still in the morning. Highly recommend and will be continuing to purchase.</li>
            <li> been using this for about 2 years now and very happy with it</li>
            <li> Absolutely lovely! I am using in conjuction with the Pura d&#x27; or serum.  What a fabulous combination!  I have been an avid Mary Kay fan for many years.  I am 50 years old so the MK anti aging products are getting pricey with a LOT of steps. I decided to try less expensive and less steps. This is a perfect solution.  (Pun intended. ..ha!) This cream puts the finishing touch on the serum which is a little sticky.  I am thrilled by how it feels. The application is so nice and creamy without leaving a greasy feeling. No need to worry about getting it on my pillow at night. It absorbs quickly, but still feels super moisturizing .  This is a new staple in my daily routine. I highly recommend It, especially in combination with the serum!</li>
            <li> Argan is, of course, wonderful for the skin.  What I like best about the Pura d&#x27;or argan oil cream is its absorption into the skin.  What I like least is the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Jose Moran argan oil and liked it. . . . so I was in the market for an argan oil product with even better absorption.  Pura d&#x27;ora provides the best absorption that I have found so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results?  For one thing, it is increasing the rate at which my pores become smaller &amp; my skin becomes smoother.  The product goes a &amp;#34;very&amp;#34; long way.  But I&#x27;ve decided to add an emulsifier to my Jose Moran product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, goes on smooth and smells great.  I will be a loyal customer from here on out.</li>
            <li> My wife of 50 years asserts that this is the best face cream that she has found. For a woman who was a blonde beauty when I married her and admired today for her excellent complexion, that is a honored position. She commented that it absorbs quickly, leaving no oily or greasy residue, while making the skin feel softer and smoother to the touch. I might add that there is a healthy subtle glow.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive? Sure it is. At my time of life, I am compelled to consider price as one of primary issues. However, my wife loves it and that makes the cost affordable. Moreover, the product does not require globs; it uses at a good effective (cost appropriate) ratio.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is now an essential in our expenses.</li>
            <li> very happy with product, I do notice a difference</li>
            <li> Mild and wonderful!  Recommend highly!  My sensitive skin loves it!</li>
            <li> So, this product has good quality, natural ingredients like aloe and argan oil. It does moisturize my face although I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in wrinkles. The price is ridiculous.  You can buy some aloe and argan oil for a fraction on the cost of this cream. I will not repurchase this product unless the price was to be cut in half...or less. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is really a soft, delicate cream and reminds me a lot of Dr. Hauschka rose day cream light (without the fragrance).  It provides amazing moisturizer and really clears and smooths the skin.  A little goes a long way and it goes on so smooth!  It really is wondrous stuff.</li>
            <li> I wanted something organic and with ingredients that work for my forehead and mouth area as I get older.  I want to keep my skin looking and feeling young!  Found this on Amazon and after reading the ingredients decided to give it a try.  I love the consistency of the cream, and it goes on easily and absorbs quickly, not greasy.  My skin has never looked better; radiant and healthy!  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this face cream!  I have really dry skin and in just a short time I can tell so much difference in the feel and look of my skin.  I really believe that fine  lines are not so noticeable anymore and the deeper lines are less noticeable, too.  My skin in so smooth and soft.  Thank you for selling such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Have only used it twice and already the change texture, look &amp; feel of my skin is noticeable. Pretty impressive. Here I&#x27;ve been literally spending thousands of dollars (don&#x27;t tell my hubby) on skin care regimens that didn&#x27;t have this effect after months of use. The price of this product is a small one to pay to get these kind of results. Super clean ingredients, lovely whipped feel, easily absorbed, helps my makeup glide on &amp; look even better. Now is this a miracle cream that will take 10 years off my age, not so sure, but I do know, one&#x27;s face &amp; complexion is front n&#x27; center every day, and I can definitely appreciate a product that&#x27;s good for you, not costing an arm &amp; a leg that makes my skin glow &amp; makes me feel better about myself.</li>
            <li> This is amazing ,I just love how my face feel,so smooth and radiant.My face become brighter and look younger.</li>
            <li> Totally love it. A friend of mine bought a jar for me to try. I&#x27;ve used almost the full jar and can see and feel the difference. My face is smoother and there is no oily feeling after applying it. Also love the fact that it is 100% organic. I never liked using all those chemicals found in other creams. Now that I have found it on Amazon I;ll never use another face cream again. Ordering more now.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good face cream that I could use for day/night cream as well as under my makeup. I have spent so much money at beauty stores such as sephora to find one that complements my normal to dry combination skin, none of which has really impressed me. This cream by far has exceeded all the creams I have ever tried. Not only does it leave my face feeling very hydrated in the morning but I have also noticed a reduction in the dark circles that have formed in the past few years (which expensive eye creams wouldn&#x27;t even get rid of). The argan oil component of the lotion diminishes blemish scars and leaves my skin feeling and looking dewey, smooth, and radiant. Love this product and highly recommend it! It is also a great present for mothers :)</li>
            <li> I have purchased this for my wife and she loves it; but the secret is that I also use it about 1 hour after I shave. Unreal results. She keeps complaining it doesn&#x27;t last her as long as she thought. I&#x27;m having such a laugh.</li>
            <li> I loved it! My face looks much better and the cream itself is very soft and smooth!!! The only problem is that the cream only lasts for about a month if you use it every night as I did! And I was only applying very little at each time!!!</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this Anti-aging Face Cream and I&#x27;ve honestly seen only positive results. I plan on buying one of these for my girlfriend and I, It&#x27;s well worth the price! A little of this cream goes a very long way, so it&#x27;s well worth the investment for your youth.</li>
            <li> Have been using this cream for a few weeks and love how it feels on my skin!</li>
            <li> I have used 2 major luxury brands creams ( SK2 and Estee Lauder). While SK2 was good Estee Lauder didn&#x27;t do any good for me. While reviewing some of the best products for skin I cam across Pura d&#x27;or products. The reason it caught my eyes was because it has all organic plant based ingredients. I received the order in 5-6 business days which was great. I also ordered their organic face serum. I have been using serum and face cream for last one week now. Although first 3-4 days there wasn&#x27;t any difference in my skin but for last 3 days I am observing a clear and glowing skin. At least 2 close friends also observed that and they asked what I was using.  I really like that it is no fragrance cream that increses my faith that there are NO chemicals used. Thanks to Pura d&#x27;or. I am loving it and do not see switching from it anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Great product and it lasts a long time you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin..hydrates your skin..perfect face moisturizer</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need more than a minute amount to do the job, anything more is useless and not absorbed. After six months l still have some and still doing a fabulous job not only on wrinkles but age spots as well. I normally don&#x27;t sound off much but this product really impressed me.</li>
            <li> One of the best products ive ever used. Pura d&#x27;or, it beyond the best brand. I will never use another brand. my face feels clean and smooth all the time.</li>
            <li> This product is unlike most others.  Yes, it is a little pricey but some other creams like top name brands don&#x27;t perform as well and are even more money.  Argan oil is great for the skin.  This product has helped my skin become smoother and it has almost entirely gotten rid off any fine lines around my eyes!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product. Took care of small wrinkles with in days. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey but it works so I am planning on buying it again. I like the fact that it has all natural ingredients.  It would be nice if it had some fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great but too pricey!</li>
            <li> Naturally, the primary reason to use organic moisturizers, is to avoid applying harmful skin care chemicals on your face. Chemicals, animal products, and unhealthy preservatives can damage our skin, and possibly bodies, in the long-term. Well, a friend of mine suggest this product to me about 9 months ago and it definitely meet all standards for quality and desirability. I&#x27;m amazed at how great my skin looks and feels. I used to waste so much money at the department stores on moisturizers--I wish I had known about the miracle of organic skin care long ago. I just finish one jar and just ordered another one....Great Product!</li>
            <li> love it but did not expect the price it being the deal of the day and all .  Trina 928 848 4494</li>
            <li> I have been using PURA D &#x27;OR for about 3 weeks now &amp; can honestly say that it  feels like velvet when I apply it to my face and the small wrinkles around my eyes are disappearing. Unlike some of my other face creams that become thin or watery, this product remains consistent in texture. I apply it to my face and neck twice a day, sometimes after toning, sometimes after just  cleansing with Cetaphil which a dermatologist recommended to me years age. I love the fact that my face does not feel &#x27;sticky&amp;#34; after I have applied it and after about a minute I can put my head on my pillow at night-time without worrying about  leaving a residue on the sheets. This is a wonderful face cream;  you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like this cream nice to my skin goes on really nice aswell and a smooth feeling .good cream</li>
            <li> I love this so much I&#x27;m ordering more before I run out! It really is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used on my face.  I use it along with the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I really like that this cream is made from organic ingredients.  It has a pleasant scent, though not my favorite.  Most importantly, it keeps my face nice and smooth and gives it a fresh look.  I only wish it didn&#x27;t give my forehead an oily sheen, but that&#x27;s due to my mixed skin type (part oily, part dry) and not due to anything wrong with the product.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Purador Organic Face Cream for a month now, and I use it with the serum every night. My skin feels very soft and smooth... I&#x27;m quite happy with the results and will continue to use the cream.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Moisturizes but does not leave your skin greasy.  Does not take a lot to put on your skin.  I use it while my skin is still wet and it goes on smoothly.  Does not smell like heavy perfume. It is a nice scent, light.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Cream for a month and I love it! I have skin allergies against some chemicals. I have to be very careful with lotions, creams and cosmetics I buy. I had a damaged skin due to sun and some cosmetics. So, the skin around my eyelids became wrinkled. I was very worried, I had tried some creams and lotions but nothing worked. A friend of me gave an Pura do&#x27;r Organic Argan Oil for my hair and it worked great. I though that the Anti-aging Face Cream would be ok for me. I bought it and I am impressed. My skin is recovering from the damaged. My face skin is smooth and silky. I am very happy!</li>
            <li> my wife just loves it, after using olay and other creams for years coming across this product was absolute discovery. the only regret is that we didn&#x27;t know it sooner.</li>
            <li> I totally am in love with this face cream!  My skin feels firmer and no breakouts what so ever!  Definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> The wrinkles on my face and the overall dullness is my skin has vanished! Eversense I began using this product I’ve only seen positives. With that being said, I’ve really fallen for this amazing product. The price is well worth the results that are obtained by this amazing cream, it’s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> good texture and no smell which is good for my sensitive skin, will use hopefully with good continued results.</li>
            <li> Not as I had expected, I had intentions of using this as my night cream but after one application dried my face out.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using Pura D&#x27;Or face cream....I and my friends can see the improvement of my skin I highly recommend it...Very Happy!</li>
            <li> I really loved this product! It really works, I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this creme is perfect for it. It leaves my skin nourished but not oily. I love natural ingredients, which is of course what attracted me to this product. Now I only wish Pura d&#x27;or would make an eye cream!</li>
            <li> I have only used the cream for several days. My skins feels better and looks better.</li>
            <li> I started using this because it is organic and they do not test on animals. As good as some of the more expensive face creams.</li>
            <li> Last year during recovery from surgery, I had felt to do research on natural skin care products when I came across pura d&#x27;ors face cream. I thank God for making a way for me to get this cream and after the price had gone down too. The Lord provides even for beauty products😊. As for the cream itself, it goes on smooth and creamy and it leaves my skin feeling like silk and taunt. I do put a little avocado oil on before when it is bitter cold but otherwise just the cream. I am very satisfied and plan on continuing to use this cream. The only improvement could be in the smell. It smells like trees, the ocean and gratefruit. Little more gratefruit for me than tree bark. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. My skin looks great. Try their face serum which great too.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Love the way it feels once applied.</li>
            <li> I have been using this face cream for about a month. I apply it in the morning and in the evening  on top of Sisley ecological compound. So far my skin feels good, smooth and silky. The cream is getting absorbed very quickly. If needed I can apply the makeup right away - no need to wait until the cream will be absorbed. And the word &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; in its name makes me feel even better :). I am thinking  about ordering another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The only small complain is the design of the bottle. First 2-3 days after opening it I had some trouble with the lotion sticking to the cap of the  bottle, which made hard to open it.  But this has nothing to do with the quality of the Cream itself. That&#x27;s why 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have used so many skin care products and none of them work until now.  I love this face cream!  I am using the serum, hair products and the face cream and I can see a dramatic change in my hair and skin.  I have only been using the products for about a week and I will never use anything else.  This stuff is a miracle in a jar!</li>
            <li> I have been using Pura D&#x27;or products for over 3 years and in comparison to other brands, i have noticed a dramatic positive difference in my skin and hair. I have spend a lot of money in creams and hair products that after the first week, i am not satisfied and they just accumulate in my cabinet. Pura D&#x27;or is by far, the best!</li>
            <li> Best face cream I have ever used.  Wonderful fresh scent.  Silky soft texture leaves skin plump and baby soft.</li>
            <li> I am always hesitant to try a new cream - but in this case I am sooo happy I did try it. This is an exceptional cream. I found it to be very hydrating and nourishing for my skin. Normally I have to constantly re-apply moisturizer in the winter to keep my skin moisturized, but this cream keep my face and neck plump, supple and hydrated for hours after applying. It is rich and creamy - and fully absorbs into my skin, no greasy feeling on the top of my skin. Just love the way my skin feels after applying and the fact that it is 100% organic, try it and I&#x27;m sure you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different face creams. For most of them I have skin allergy and irritation. Not with this cream. My skin feels smooth and refreshing. No allergy at all! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Purador Organic Face Cream for a few weeks now and I can already notice a dramatic improvement. I have combination and sensitive skin and it feels smooth and luxurious when I apply it on my face. There is not an oily or heavy residue compared to other facial moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried. My face looks and feels more smooth, firm, and has this radiant glow that makes me look so much younger. It has also helped balance my complexion. It&#x27;s worked wonderfully under my eyes. I had dark circles and some laxity under my eyes, and shortly after using Purador&#x27;s face cream, these are no longer an issue. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my skin and on how young I look. The cream is gentle and I have not had any sensitivity or reactions to it. I would strongly recommend this product and not to waste your money on any other products out there. This one is the best by far! Love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried different face creams. .  I am sensitive to strong scents.  This one is very mild.  This is my favorite!  Plus it spreads very easily!</li>
