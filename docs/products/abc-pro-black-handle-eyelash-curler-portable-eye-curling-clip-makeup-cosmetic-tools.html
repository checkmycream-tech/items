            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>you get what you pay for, but in general this is a good product!</li>
            <li>it still works fine ...</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li>threw it away, cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It is a great eyelash curler, and i suppose its my fault, but BE CAREFUL.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good; it&#x27;s a bit too big for my makeup bag</li>
            <li>loved so much ordered two more, cheap and effective, nice spring action and the pad is very squishy rather then a hard plastic.</li>
            <li>It curls my lashes really quick</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the wait from overseas.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I pinched my the skin under my eye.  </li>
            <li>It fits my eye shape very well</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s probably because I already have so much makeup inside &amp;</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who is contemplating buying it.  </li>
            <li>Very user friendly and actually curls lashes instead of just crimping them.  </li>
            <li>With the price being so cheap I had honestly expected a cheaper product than this is!</li>
            <li>live and learn.</li>
            <li>Like many previous viewers wrote, if you&#x27;re not careful, they cut the you-know</li>
            <li>i hadn&#x27;t used curlers in a while..years i believe; and i alctually used them last night after i hot out of the shower, and my lashes were flared all night and day.</li>
            <li>We went to a very big, well known, oh heck it was ULTA &amp; bought a curler EXACTLY like this one.</li>
            <li>Came broken and very cheap</li>
            <li>I love the little black grippy handles.</li>
            <li>It took me a little bit to figure out what exactly to do, &#x27;cuz</li>

            <li> I have very thin eyelashes &amp; I recommend to women who also have thin lashes TO NOT BUY THIS ! It pinches my eyelids. Don&#x27;t waist the money</li>

            <li> Best eye lash curler I ever used</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous eyelash curler.  I was skeptical about purchasing because of the low price, however, I completely love this curler.  It curls every single lash with no pinching.  Very user friendly and actually curls lashes instead of just crimping them.  I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who is contemplating buying it.  Don&#x27;t let the low price discourage you from trying it.</li>
            <li> it arrived broken .. will one of the handles arrived broken ... it still works fine ... I like it</li>
            <li> loved so much ordered two more, cheap and effective, nice spring action and the pad is very squishy rather then a hard plastic.</li>
            <li> I love these. It took me a little bit to figure out what exactly to do, &#x27;cuz i hadn&#x27;t used curlers in a while..years i believe; and i alctually used them last night after i hot out of the shower, and my lashes were flared all night and day.</li>
            <li> Like many previous viewers wrote, if you&#x27;re not careful, they cut the you-know-what outta you eyelashes!! Buyer beware!!!</li>
            <li> I love the little black grippy handles.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter broke her eyelash curler and I ordered this one. She couldn&#x27;t wait another day without one (teenager). We went to a very big, well known, oh heck it was ULTA &amp; bought a curler EXACTLY like this one. It was $16. Look at the price of this one!  This is a excellent item!</li>
            <li> Curls the lashes nicely</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the wait from overseas.  It really only took under 2 weeks.  Actually made by &amp;#34;Nutriga&amp;#34;...an overseas cosmetics company.  Does not pinch your eyelids at all.  It&#x27;s the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve owned.  Good job.</li>
            <li> Its a very good curler . BUT I had to wait 3 or 4 weeks to get it. And when I was curling them it CUT like 3 of my lashes in half!! It cut them not pulled cut! Be careful! If u do get be careful !</li>
            <li> It is a great eyelash curler, and i suppose its my fault, but BE CAREFUL. I had a hand spasm while using this and pulled out 10 eyelashes. It isn&#x27;t noticeable but be careful while using this product.</li>
            <li> Great for quick curling</li>
            <li> threw it away, cheaply made. live and learn.</li>
            <li> it cut off my eyelashes and i wasnt even squeezing hard</li>
