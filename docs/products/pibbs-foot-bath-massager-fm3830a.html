            <li>Handy footbath!  </li>
            <li>The water stays nice and warm and the massage function is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.ook</li>
            <li>So if u want a good sturdy tub</li>
            <li>The massage and vibrating functions are good too.</li>
            <li>Good at heating water.  </li>
            <li>good Massager Mode -</li>
            <li>Works perry good.</li>
            <li>not that good as we want</li>
            <li>Not so good.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this foot bath to anyone that is looking for a good product.  </li>
            <li>eighty five year father loves it.&lt;br /&gt;He says his feet havn,t felt this good in years.</li>
            <li>and it works as good as the day I got it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While the vibration is fairly good ,  the water jet is just a joke.</li>
            <li>I almost burned myself and imagine if someone is diabetic or don&#x27;t have good sensation in the feet there&#x27;s a good chance that they will suffer severe burns.</li>
            <li>Make good choices...</li>
            <li>It felt good on my feer when using it</li>
            <li>The water was nice and warm, and the massage felt great.  </li>
            <li>It fits his size 13 feet, and it&#x27;s great to be able to control the temperature.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with this foot spa.</li>
            <li>Works great, love it.</li>
            <li>I do wish it bubbled more, but the vibrating massage feels great.</li>
            <li>This is something I will be more than happy to use over and over.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Aww, it works perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect hot soaking tub.</li>
            <li>My fiance and I have both tried it and we love it!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>I am so very satisfied with this footbath as it heats and keeps the water quite warm.  </li>
            <li>My wattmeter shows that the heater is about 400 watts, a respectable amount!  </li>
            <li>Reading so many reviews!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The water gets hot (if you want it to, there is an option to just use the vibration), the vibrations are like heaven and the nubbins on the bottom and the rolly thing are wonderful.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This was purchased as a gift, the receiver is enjoying it!</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my wife and now I love it!</li>
            <li>I am glad I did!</li>
            <li>love them!  </li>
            <li>great, easy to use foot bath.  </li>
            <li>Heats up extremely fast!!!!!</li>
            <li>Massage also refers to vibration, which is amazing.  </li>
            <li>and she was so happy and its not one of those cheap ones from wally world.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>The directions were non existent, but the heating element heats the water so warm</li>
            <li>The water jets are a nice feature too.</li>
            <li>Nice sturdy tub the massager not existent.</li>
            <li>i followed the instruction step by step, pulled in warm water then plugged in.</li>
            <li>so the snap on massaging accessories are kind of frivolous.</li>
            <li>The vibrate massage is nice.  </li>
            <li>It will warm water from cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The massager is also quite nice.</li>
            <li>Quite honestly, the product looks used.</li>
            <li>You have to manually turn it off when it gets warm</li>
            <li>Heats water, not just keeps warm.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;it keep warm the water.  </li>
            <li>But it heated  the water to exceed warm  it could  burn</li>
            <li>The heat was a nice option</li>
            <li>I decided to return it and order Brookstone footbath once it becomes to warm</li>
            <li>there is a nice jets option.</li>
            <li>I like something else going on for that kind of money.  </li>
            <li>Nice purchase..</li>
            <li>/&gt;So - again, the PIBBS Foot Massager FM3830A does &amp;#34;EXACTLY&amp;#34; what it says it will do, my wife and my own expectations were not met because we are looking for something this &amp;#34;good deal&amp;#34; does not do or deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It shakes the water up and it does heat up nicely.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t it just feels like warm water on your feet nothing else</li>
            <li>I have arthritis in my knee and a good foot soak always makes my knee feel better, as well.  </li>
            <li>I m pleased with it because it seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li>I tried It with her and just put warm water in it</li>
            <li>and when they warm up they start itching...</li>
            <li>The water did get quite warm when I had it on setting 3</li>
            <li>The vibrate feature is pleasant and not too strong.</li>
            <li>looks normal ~ but works great !</li>
            <li>Good quality, did the job well, easy set up, my son loves it after being on his feet 10 hours a day.</li>
            <li>The heat element gets the water very warm, I found I had to put cool water in and let it heat</li>
            <li>she was sitting on the patio, overlooking the ocean, enjoying a nice late-afternoon soak with the help of a glass of wine.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper to fill a bucket with warm water from the tap and add some epsom salts.</li>
            <li>and it did not maintain warm water but for 5 minutes at the most.</li>
            <li>However, I love the Pibbs unit, it maintains warm water.</li>
            <li>This has a great heater that quickly returns water to appropriate soaking temperature.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect for my osteoarthritis for for my feet and the only machine that keeps the water warm.</li>
            <li>Great product for my first try.</li>
            <li>This is great and it does get hot.  </li>
            <li>This one had very secure reviews, and we choose it.</li>
            <li>Made of nice quality plastic, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;The leather loop, I&#x27;m guessing, is meant to keep your knees together for better comfort and relaxation.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Pure joy to soak my feet in this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily I was able to return mine.</li>
            <li>LOVE it for the heat.</li>
            <li>I used it to hold up the edge of the towel I placed underneath to hold it at the top edges.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This product does that and more.</li>
            <li>am so glad that I bought this unit.  </li>
            <li>OK what&#x27;s Amazon got?  </li>
            <li>I would love to try this product again because it heated the water so well</li>
            <li>Love this foot bath ...</li>
            <li>For the money, you can&#x27;t get better.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a happy wife.</li>
            <li>I have purchased so many Foot Spas and had to return them because they stated with heat.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>WARNING: costs twice as more reliable, better functioning NAME-brands</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this foot spa.</li>
            <li>I wanted to find a foot spa that actually heats the water and this unit works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Make sure you check them as soon as you buy them.</li>
            <li>, the massage part is ok ..</li>
            <li>I got this as a Christmas gift and have enjoyed using it 3-4 times a week ever since.</li>
            <li>Love this,  </li>
            <li>but she is pleased with it as she is on her feet a lot in her profession</li>
            <li>glad I bought this foot bath.</li>
            <li>She is not thankful enough for this wonderful Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>but nonetheless i love it.</li>
            <li>and we both love it.</li>
            <li>Love this foot bath.  </li>
            <li>Most concern for these tubs is they will not hold the heat.</li>
            <li>I think the vendor just threw them into the box to make it look like it comes with many options.  </li>
            <li>it will heat the water unlike most that i have tried.</li>
            <li>I just took it out of the box and filled it with warm water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li>After travelling for work for more than a month, I&lt;br /&gt;once again contacted  Amazon.com and on line chatted with someone in India.</li>
            <li>The Pibbs Footbath Massager is WONDERFUL!!It massages &amp; keeps the water heated!!We are totally pleased with this product,&amp; wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product again.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li>Totally want to get one for my diabetic father so that he can soak his feet in this wonderful thing.</li>
            <li>it felt even better.</li>
            <li>I contacted CS and asked for a replacement as the one they sent me WAS NOT as depicted on the website figuring that was a better model of the one they sent me.  </li>
            <li>Basically satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I emailed and called many times, but no answer at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will get</li>
            <li>I personally love more than inches covering my feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you will love this foot bath.</li>
            <li>You will love this model also if your feet are hurting.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The foot bath was able to maintain between 104 degrees and 105.5 degrees for the two hours</li>
            <li>I chose this one based on the reviews, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>The heating feature on the foot bath is awesome, it might be the only one on the market that heats the water this well.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This bath massager is all I wanted--cannot imagine how great it is, so soothing, so gentle, so easy to use.</li>
            <li>make water really hot  which is good .</li>
            <li>kind of guessed how full to fill it.</li>
            <li>Heats water quickly and massage nice.</li>
            <li>It heated up quickly, maintained heat, has a nice size reservoir and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li>This thing gets very hot and the vibration is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>The massager isn&#x27;t that great, but it&#x27;s big and makes a great hot soaker.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s more important is the heater, even if you put ice water inside, it turns hot in a matter of minute and after 5-10 minutes good luck keeping your feet inside.</li>
            <li>The heat and massage functions work very nicely, and he really enjoyed giving his feet a nice, long soak!</li>
            <li>so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It would be great if they would, but I can image the machine would be more likely to break or cost $500 if it had that many moving parts.</li>
            <li>Ever since I had a Dr. Scholl&#x27;s foot massager many years ago, I enjoy use foot massager at night.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Heats the water great, stays warm for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, keeps water nicely warm as long as needed.</li>
            <li>Vibration and jet isn&#x27;t significant but better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The heater easily kept the temperature up.  </li>
            <li>It cleans easily, deeper than others I have seen</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cord can be wrapped around the rubber feet for easy storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>Easy to set up and use.  </li>
            <li>an easily falls off.  </li>
            <li>Strongly recommended if you are in the market.  </li>
            <li>What is strong is the heat and the vibration.</li>
            <li>and I like strong stimulation</li>
            <li>Also described as having a \\&quot;strong bubbling effect\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Strong plastic odor, but otherwise a sturdy unit.  </li>
            <li>its nice to know that the water gets hot</li>
            <li>Heats up nicely and keeps it hot.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best foot bath on the market</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise the product is fine.</li>
            <li>which is good because the hot water is really what makes your feet feel better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to clean and keeps the water nice n hot</li>
            <li>The vibration feels good and the bath maintains the water at exactly the right temperature.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this item, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift from my husband, and this is certainly in the top 3 of my favorite gifts from him, ever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It made a huge difference for me, in reducing the swelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have had this foot bath for a few months now and it still works great, I like how the machine heats the water on its own.</li>
            <li>It would be great if the heat was adjustable, so this switching back and forth stuff could be avoided.  </li>
            <li>easy to clean, say&#x27;s you can use oil and salts.</li>
            <li>Doesnt sound too obnoxious</li>
            <li>Great product, multiple settings work well: heat-wave-massage.</li>
            <li>really enjoy it</li>
            <li>Otherwise this is a great machine and bending over occasionally is not a problem for me.</li>
            <li>I filled it up and...</li>
            <li>it really keeps the water warm.</li>
            <li>This unit cost $50 more than the Conair, but it&#x27;s worth it if you plan to soak your feet for 15-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>very* well and the massage function is nice.</li>
            <li>But going back and forth between warm &amp; massage to just massage and back again as needed keeps the water at a perfect temp.</li>
            <li>Best if you start with warm water, as it can take a while to warm up if you start with cold.</li>
            <li>Size 12 men&#x27;s is a comfortable fit.</li>
            <li>Not noisy at all, you can watch TV with just one sound point up.</li>
            <li>Got it in the mail- filled up with water- leaked about a gallon out two holes in bottom-</li>
            <li>and I see it is no longer available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Could not ask for a better Foot Bath  at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Good value; performance so far vs price.</li>
            <li>This is a nice quiet foot bath that truly heats up nicely.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed in a massager!!  </li>
            <li>110 is a pretty warm hot tub temperature!  </li>
            <li>110 is a pretty warm hot tub temperature!  </li>
            <li>There is so much competition that it could be cheaper very easily.</li>
            <li>Keeps water hot, easy to clean!</li>
            <li>Love my new foot bath even though it could have more vibration</li>
            <li>We love this so much!</li>
            <li>Worth every cent!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li>My original 4 star review is below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my feet feel great after a long week.</li>
            <li>So just know, the cord is not dog proof, but it makes your feet feel great after a long day at work.</li>
            <li>Finally found a foot bath that keeps the water warm!</li>
            <li>I love how hot it gets-</li>
            <li>too hot, have to switch heat on and off to avoid getting burned, but that &#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I had the original Clairol Foot Fixer from the 1980&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>feet feel so much better after soaking in hot, vibrating water!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>That says a lot, especially, coming from him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best purchases I have made, so far.</li>
            <li>Be sure to only fill it with luke-warm to warm water</li>
            <li>Directions also did not say how to clean unit, so I went by others&#x27; reviews.  </li>
            <li>It has many different settings for keeping your feet warm, massaged and just overall feeling good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I trusted the other good reviews and ordered this.</li>
            <li>It took me forever to choose the right one!</li>
            <li>When the foot massager arrived I was super excited.</li>
            <li>When the water starts to cool, turn on setting 2.  </li>
            <li>The foot bath vibrations are quite intense, so if you have neuropathy you may not be able to tolerate it.  </li>
            <li>Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Water heats up pretty fast and maintain a good hot temperature.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Obviously, it would be ideal that it would not get unreasonably hot, but I&#x27;ve yet to find another foot spa that actually keeps water warm, let alone increases the temperature.</li>
            <li>Do need to let water cool off after awhile as the heater keeps on heating.  </li>
            <li>and I put it on setting 1 to cool off, but still massage.</li>
            <li>Although, I must say, he was very impressed with the immediate improvement on the swelling going down in my feet, so fast.  </li>
            <li>The water heats very quickly and stays hot.</li>
            <li>Honestly, if you want a nice little tub to soak your feet in with a heater, this works.</li>
            <li>and it heats water quickly.</li>
            <li>Quickly shipped.</li>
            <li>Heats water quickly.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I purchased through Amazo.</li>
            <li>It helps his feet tremendously.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The more water you use, the more likely you are to need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i got the product today and was excited to give it try right way.</li>
            <li>Christmas 2012 which was a challenge considering a huge or several huge Winter Weather systems which cancelled many flights in the Midwest and Northeast affecting shipments for the Holidays.  </li>
            <li>water got very  hot, needs some sort of control to adjust the heating element.</li>
            <li>This foot bath keeps the water very hot</li>
            <li>My wife loves this thing except it needs a bit more vibration and it does get too hot too fast other than that it is great</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
            <li>He says the water stays very hot.</li>
            <li>First use, there was a slurping/gurgling sound...</li>
            <li>very very HOT</li>
            <li>Really good for relaxing after a long day&#x27;s work on your feet and then just soak your feet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is plenty big for a man with size 11.5 feet, and the heater won&#x27;t just keep water lukewarm, it gets is really quite warm!</li>
            <li>gets nice and hot, but no bubble action, for the price I would expect bubbly goodness</li>
            <li>Im sure, but when you are trying to wind down and relax, its kind of a pain.</li>
            <li>It will keep water hot!</li>
            <li>Yes, gets and stays hot!  </li>
            <li>my only gripe of sorts is that while easy to figure out how to use, better instructions are needed.</li>
            <li>Most other brands (in fine print) will state that adding supplements to the water is NOT  recommended (which kind of defeats the purpose of owning a Foot Spa - you normally would want to add at a minimum Epsom Salt).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has nice massaging action and keeps the water toasty warm - actually, it can get too toasty warm if you keep the heating setting on for too long.</li>
            <li>The devise also comes with two rubber insoles that you are supposed to put them inside and rest your feet on, however, these pads don&#x27;t fit really well and keep blocking those holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>assuredly well worth the price.</li>
            <li>this unit is worth every cent.</li>
            <li>All that is necessary is for it to keep the water warm, and circulating.</li>
            <li>It is worth it.</li>
            <li>so well worth it.</li>
            <li>The water does get quite hot, so I have to turn it off to let it cool for a bit every once in a while.</li>
            <li>This footbath is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s commercial grade and works great so far.</li>
            <li>This foot bath is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I just feel the water constantly, and ask my clients to let me know if it gets too warm.</li>
            <li>My suggestion buy this its worth it.</li>
            <li>They attach to a groove above the water level so you can rub your feet on them, but they don&#x27;t rub you, on their own, in the water.  </li>
            <li>Thus far so far so good.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful for tired achy feet and it works to relieve arthritis, too.  </li>
            <li>Either way it made a useful gift as a heated foot spa.</li>
            <li>so i have to keep alternating back to the massage and no heat setting when the water is too warm.</li>
            <li>and it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>Perfect for soaking your tired feet while reading a book or watching television.  </li>
            <li>but this by far was her favorite.</li>
            <li>, I know quality because I&#x27;m never afraid to pay for it.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money (under $100 with S&amp;H).</li>
            <li>Works great but it heats up too much so you have to take a break every so often to let the water cool down.</li>
            <li>The water gets super hot and the variations of vibrate and heat are on point.  </li>
            <li>Water gets hot quickly.  </li>
            <li>have to go to &amp;#34;massage only&amp;#34; pretty quick.</li>
            <li>Gets super hot.  </li>
            <li>other wise i like it</li>
            <li>The water really does stay hot, and that was very important to me because I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the aggravation of having to pour in more hot water after ten minutes.</li>
            <li>All in all I am happy I bought it as too hot is better for me than not hot enough.</li>
            <li>Should be able to enjoy this for a long time.</li>
            <li>Water gets hot hot!</li>
            <li>I was honestly embarrassed that I&#x27;d given this as a present when we were having so much difficulty putting it together.</li>
            <li>This Massager costs about $30 more than the HomeMedics, but is well worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>problem is we, consumers - were hoping it did what we have encountered personally, like the Foot Massage that comes with the Pedicure Chairs at the local Spa which have WATER JETS that exfoliates your feet (lol)....</li>
            <li>But overall - we are KEEPING IT as I had noted above, it does what it says and we are happy with just that - since we are not going pay a thousand plus for the Pedicure Chairs with Foot/Body massage.  </li>
            <li>The foot spa is not as relaxing as having a pedicure at a professional spa, but it&#x27;s great to use at home and is a whole lot cheaper in the long run.</li>
            <li>My doctor actually suggested that I use full strength bleach for about a week and then use strong over the counter fungal preparations.  </li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I have to write a review on this product as I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>I finally got to use this after getting it for a Christmas present and it was very nice.</li>
            <li>This thing I was worried about because it was so cheap and there were other things out there that looked better.</li>
            <li>It works great with Epsom salt, heating element is very strong - can heat a cold water.</li>
            <li>This machine will take water to 115 degrees and higher</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to flash the massager with a fresh water for a few minutes after using it with Epsom salt (I just fill out the unit with warm fresh water and run it for 3 minutes at the highest switch set mode: bubbles/heater/massage).</li>
            <li>The tub needs to a littler higher to catch splashes.</li>
            <li>So this foot bath does get water hot (sometimes too hot for my</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>too hot?</li>
            <li>This thing gets so hot</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>one thing I do not like is that there is no way to set a temperature, so if you want heated water, eventually it is going to get way too hot</li>
            <li>He says it gets so hot that he feels like his feet are going to burn off.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s get hot</li>
            <li>With heater it can get too hot.</li>
            <li>Just need to keep switching the heater part off so the water will not get too hot.  </li>
            <li>as I saw posted before, that they clogged theirs up on the first run.  </li>
            <li>if you let the salts dissolve in the hot water &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; turning on the circulation pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t believe I found it!</li>
            <li>as they have to so that you don&#x27;t get hot spots).  </li>
            <li>I started the test with hot tap water (107 deg).  </li>
            <li>It says you should start with hot water because it won&#x27;t heat the water. . .</li>
            <li>When it starts feeling too hot</li>
            <li>When it starts feeling too hot</li>
            <li>Keeps hot, vibrates and bubbles.</li>
            <li>Too hot, way too hot.  </li>
            <li>Bubbles stopped working first season.</li>
            <li>this will get as hot as you want it to, i find myself having to cycle the heat off every now and then.  </li>
            <li>but it does get hot..........</li>
            <li>It got hot.  </li>
            <li>The water will become hotter when the massage begin, so don&#x27;t put too hot water at the beginning</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a foot spa that heats water and keeps it hot</li>
            <li>This is like the 3 bears, this one gets too hot.</li>
            <li>First time purchasing this type of product.</li>
            <li>but I like the fact that it keeps the water hot.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Most just circulate hot water, but they won&#x27;t actually keep it hot.</li>
            <li>Water does get hot</li>
            <li>this is the key factor for my purchase decision on this product, so satisfied on this</li>
            <li>It is as described, no failed expectations.  </li>
            <li>Water can stay HOT.</li>
            <li>You must know, that the unit gets HOT.</li>
            <li>Frankly, I&#x27;m so pleased to find a spa that actually heats, that I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall - if you are reading this, please note that it does EXACTLY what the product description says just not at the STRENGTH or DESIRE we want.  </li>
            <li>I mix the boiling water with double its amount in cold water and end up with perfect warm water.</li>
            <li>It does get hot and you have to keep turning it off</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the water gets hot.</li>
            <li>Really hot.</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>the water never felt to the touch of my hand to be that hot.  </li>
            <li>Water stays hot all the time.</li>
            <li>My area got hit with record rains and the city&#x27;s storm system backed up for the first time ever.  </li>
            <li>This was the only item I was able to salvage</li>
            <li>Love the different switch settings and the vibrations and the nodes.</li>
            <li>It get room temperature water hot in 10-15 mins which I don&#x27;t mind waiting.  </li>
            <li>( 112 F, to be exact).</li>
            <li>After 15 minutes on setting 3, it became too hot</li>
            <li>I used it for many years until it finally, recently gave way!  </li>
            <li>Foot Bath Massager is exactly the replacement I needed.  </li>
            <li>Turned it on to the first setting(massage).</li>
            <li>and it got the water hot</li>
            <li>and it stayed hot.</li>
            <li>But if you like a hot foot bath, this is AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The water stays hot forever.</li>
            <li>And let me tell you something, it gets HOT...</li>
            <li>It did exactly what I wanted it to do</li>
            <li>You just keep pushing your feet in many different directions hoping to stop the motor noise.</li>
            <li>I just love having hot water the entire time I am using the foot bath.</li>
            <li>Hot water, after all, is what helps my feet relax.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After one hour on level 3, and no perceptible heating of the water, I gave up and dumped the water out and replaced it with hot water from the bathtub.</li>
            <li>/pump on/off every few minutes to keep at a good temperature.</li>
            <li>Glad I spent a little more than the cheap ones!</li>
            <li>But this really speaks to Amazon and the infrastructure they&#x27;ve built - PRETTY EFFICIENT, actually, the MOST EFFICIENT of any Online Retailer.  </li>
            <li>Vibration mode is strong enough to be pleasant, yet not annoyingly strong.</li>
            <li>With the FM3830A I usually start off with a little warm water and the water gets a comfortable warm and remains at that temperature.  </li>
            <li>Certainly keeps water hot.  </li>
            <li>I bought this based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>After using it for over an hour the water is still hot and the vibrations and bubbles are really relaxing, just what I need after a 12 hour day on my feet.</li>
            <li>It is very relaxing and the water does get hot.  </li>
            <li>i have had a few different kinds in the past,but this is by far the best for the $$$$.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it gets hot FAST</li>
            <li>you pretty much won&#x27;t feel anything.</li>
            <li>Not sure why no one can make a good foot spa.</li>
            <li>This got old quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars because I got my money back- easy return process.</li>
            <li>Simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I was a little irritated at first because it took about 10 minutes to heat the water up (lolprincess) when I really could have just put warm water in from the start.</li>
            <li>The large rubberband is for retaining the power cord wrapped around the &#x27;feet&#x27;.</li>
            <li>This is great for late nights after shooting a wedding!</li>
            <li>Quiet, keeps water warm, don&#x27;t start out with really hot water ... not necessary.  </li>
            <li>nice mess- returning</li>
            <li>I wish the top was attached as it is kinda loose</li>
            <li>My main reason for choosing this product was that it purported to keep the water hot, and it does that, which is why I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would complain is that though a lot of reviewers said it can heat up the water pretty quick and hot, it not the case for mine.</li>
            <li>I am suprised by how nice this little guy is.</li>
            <li>Definitely heats the water, had to let it cool a couple of times, only downfall is that the unit pictured is not the same color as the one shipped, other that this, it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li>As others said, cycle the heat off and on, but I just lift my feet up for a few seconds, then put them back in and that works great for me.  </li>
            <li>I like that my big feet are comfortable and fully coverd in the bath.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li>after doing some research on all the footbaths that are available on amazon, I finally decided to go with this one.</li>
            <li>It seems cheap for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li>This really heats the water, so fill it will tepid or lukewarm water to begin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really seem to help.</li>
            <li>Works very well for my purpose.  </li>
            <li>heat of the water and the salts really helped me, a lot.  </li>
            <li>so I could see what &amp; if it could really heat.</li>
            <li>They include a pair of foot-shaped rubbery pads with points that are much softer.&lt;br /&gt;Heat</li>
            <li>But there isn&#x27;t much freeboard, so using it on a waterproof floor is a plus.  </li>
            <li>The whole unit seems durably constructed.  </li>
            <li>But there isn&#x27;t much freeboard, so using it on a waterproof floor is a plus.  </li>
            <li>The whole unit seems durably constructed.  </li>
            <li>Cost was too much to return it</li>
            <li>Really helps his circulation.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this thing.  </li>
            <li>Vibration, heat and bubbles work very well.</li>
            <li>you will really like it</li>
            <li>the unit vibrates providing a very soothing experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no fill line which would take the guessing out of how much water to put in.</li>
            <li>The nubs in the bottom are very pronounced, I covered with the liner that was included, but it continually slides out of place.  </li>
            <li>She is on her feet all day and this foot spa really helps sooth her achy feet.</li>
            <li>It DOES heat the water and that&#x27;s really all I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I thought I had put too much in, but all the water drained not just a portion.</li>
            <li>I give 4 stars because the manul  doesn&#x27;t really do its job.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very comfortable&lt;</li>
            <li>Thanks to Pibbs for the foot bath.</li>
            <li>it hold the heat very well and</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I lost absolutely everything, except for this footbath.  </li>
            <li>and she stated that she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>There are several attachments included, but some of them either don&#x27;t fit or don&#x27;t have a function.  </li>
            <li>Feet are very sore at end of day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I highly reccommed this product!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product as a gift and spent more for it after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>product seems very well made.</li>
            <li>It does however fit around the outside of the unit</li>
            <li>Really massages and warms your feet.</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable considering what it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If the water gets too warm, either remove your feet for a few minutes or turn the knob to &amp;#34;0&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It does get a bit hot, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for Grandma if she has diabetes and/or poor circulation, but with the toe touch controls you can easily flip the heat on and off to keep it more temperate.  </li>
            <li>This new model runs too hot.  </li>
            <li>Stays nice and hot and very relaxing after a hard day.</li>
            <li>I have used other foot massagers, but this one feels better.</li>
            <li>my sister, has had more than a few, I let her try this unit, and she ordered one for herself immediately, complaining the others just didn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>I wanted a foot massager that would stay warm or hot for at least 30 minutes at at time this winter.</li>
            <li>It feels like it is well-made, not cheap plastic junk, and I think I will be using it happily for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it heats the water, does get alittle to hot but changing the settings for a few minutes fixes that.</li>
            <li>in all, the devise is ok , I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth a price.</li>
            <li>It is easy to carry, dump, rinse and pat dry.</li>
            <li>very easy cleaning and not too heavy.</li>
            <li>There are a couple attachments I haven&#x27;t really used, but I don&#x27;t think they were part of the high price tag anyway.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t hate it and will probably use it more, but in the future, I think spending more on a really good one is the plan.</li>
            <li>The water massage is a bit weak, but again pleasant.</li>
            <li>The foot bath will comfortably accommodate a foot that measures 11 3/8 inches long.</li>
            <li>Bought some Epsom salt at Walmart and dissolved some in hot tap water in an old Sterilite storage box.  </li>
            <li>It is well made and designed, very easy to work with, has a long cord and is also quiet.  </li>
            <li>sure adding a remote or a thermostat would really drive the price up, but at least a wired remote would be a great addition to this product.</li>
            <li>Feet do feel better after a half hour .</li>
            <li>Love it and use it every week without any problems for the last 12 months with various Dr.</li>
            <li>wife)--that is the main reason I purchased it--and it does vibrate and produce a jet.</li>
            <li>Can anyone recommend a decent product that is under ~$100.</li>
            <li>It has lived up to the description, the unit heats up (unlike others that are lukewarm) and stays heated for a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li>turn it back on, and it heats again quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall very relaxing and worth it.</li>
            <li>and when I took my feet out the suddenly became super itchy, sort of like when you&#x27;re a kid</li>
            <li>I used this footbath to soak my tired feet, and it worked great for about 5 times, and then the motor started making a loud rattling sound, loud enough so that it makes any relaxation go out the window.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot research before picking is particular product.</li>
            <li>That option is not only very noisy but pretty much nauseating.</li>
            <li>Forget the Bells and Whistles of the high end competitors.</li>
            <li>then I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The massager does heat the water, it provides me with high quality massage.</li>
            <li>I have a high tolerance to heat-</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>requirements are simple; compac in size, light in weight, produce heat and not loud when motor is on.&lt;br /&gt;I have been visit stores and made research on line, the PIBBS seams right for my need.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews for cheaper products, I decided to pass and spend a little more on the Pibbs fm3830a.</li>
            <li>Guess it doesn&#x27;t matter how full you make it though when mine was pretty full it&#x27;d make the loud vibrations due to the extra water weight.  </li>
            <li>You do need to pour in warm water to begin with, but that isn&#x27;t too hard.</li>
            <li>Having used it for almost 5 months now, I have to concur that all the previous positive reviews are accurate.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I work 12 hour shifts and standing all the time on concrete flooring.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that the massager does absolutely everything it guarantees.</li>
            <li>very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Is quieter than my old Dr Scholls foot bath</li>
            <li>The extra money was well worth it</li>
            <li>Nails are normal looking.</li>
            <li>Was worth the price and has held up well for the last 2 months.</li>
            <li>Well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I was very optimistic about this purchase but during the first use, it began to cease vibrating and the water leaked from the control button the entire time.</li>
            <li>Its definitely worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>Return window is closed - pretty convenient that it stops working right when you can no longer return it.</li>
            <li>The water pours right back out!</li>
            <li>My pregnant wife loves it after a long day on her feet</li>
            <li>Like some reviews state it can get a little too hot but it takes no effort to turn the heat off for a minute to let the water cool.</li>
            <li>Bought this one because reviews of other massagers said the water never stayed warm very long.</li>
            <li>She took her new foot bath massager with us, of course, and I brought an extension cord.  </li>
            <li>Described as having a \\&quot;Newly designed rotating node\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s time to buy a new model with to-day&#x27;s tech.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In other words, if you went by the \\&quot;diagram,\\&quot; many people would actually have trouble getting their feet to fit in the unit!</li>
            <li>I wanted one to keep the water warm, simple massage and a few inches deeper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with 3 attachments that fit in the middle of the bath to give an individual foot</li>
            <li>We wanted to love this unit, but unfortunately, people need to be aware of what can happen to the most careful of users.</li>
            <li>If it hold up for a year that&#x27;s all I care about I would buy a new one every year with no complaints for the price, First one I every bought big upgrade from the pan.</li>
            <li>After extensive research into footbaths, I purchased this one because the reviews said it&#x27;s a bit deeper than others, and the water stays hot.  </li>
            <li>The reason I decided to purchase this was because a posting stated his brow was starting to get hot.  </li>
            <li>Although I would of kept it even though it gets too hot, I will definitely be returning it now.</li>
            <li>I am often (haven&#x27;t timed it) bending over to turn it to the first setting which is massage only without heat, in order to keep my feet from feeling a burn.</li>
            <li>Gets plenty hot in a short time.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a foot bath that would keep the water hot because a lot of reviews on different foot bath massagers said that they didn&#x27;t hold the heat.</li>
            <li>The product came packaged ONLY in the original product box, with no extra outer box.  </li>
            <li>They were red for about an hour, then they SWELLED up like balloons for a whole DAY!  </li>
            <li>The only issue I have found with it is that after a while the water is too hot for my comfort</li>
            <li>They filed a claim and then advised that the seller is not willing to refund because their policy says the product has to be in the original packing and not used.</li>
            <li>It will actually get too hot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;PRO&#x27;s - Water stays hot and actually gets hotter over time requiring switching it off</li>
            <li>This foot spa IS professional grade!</li>
            <li>The price is higher in the market.&lt;br /&gt;However,  there are no instructions, only two pages of home made recommended times, and it is out dated.  </li>
            <li>They not only do not heat water but do not keep the water hot.</li>
            <li>The only thing i&#x27;d like is if it were a few inches deeper, the top of the tub is about level with my ankles, i&#x27;d like to have my feet a little more &amp;#34;in&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Two rubbery gray foot pads are provided which can be used nubs up or down, providing softer nubs or a smooth surface.</li>
            <li>After searching for numerous products online, I finally chose this one, and it turns out that my choice is right!</li>
            <li>It comes with a black band that is supposed to wrap around the power cord when stored but doesn&#x27;t seem to fit well.  </li>
            <li>I just have to be careful not to burn myself because the water can get very hot.  </li>
            <li>My first one had a leaking issue but they replaced it in no time flat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Operation of the spa is fairly easy (which is good because the included instruction manual is worthless).</li>
            <li>Actually, this was a little gift for my girlfriend, who is very attentive to her feet and likes to soak them to soften up and then remove calluses.  </li>
            <li>I soak my feet in Epsom salt water almost everyday (for 2 months now) and it is still working fine.</li>
            <li>so well I would like to see future models equipped with a built in large dial temp gauge.</li>
            <li>The massage part is a little bit on the loud side but ok overall.</li>
            <li>Feels amazing to soak sore, tired feet while the machine rumbles</li>
            <li>Its great for cold nights, and warms me up.</li>
            <li>This product was awesome until my fiancée&#x27;s stupid f***ing dog chewed up the cord.</li>
            <li>It was a great massager for about a week, and then started making the most horrible noise, as if an aircraft was taking off.</li>
            <li>Stay clear of the HOMEMEDICS Foot Spa, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>Amazon bundled this with the tea tree salts when clearly the manufacturer does not recommend using any additives in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>on the box (see link for what unit actually looks like) but feels rather cheap with no real instructions or even a fill line.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s deeper, but the water definately stays hot ... too hot sometimes, but better hot than cold!  </li>
            <li>This is a simple product that just works very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too loud, so we use it while watching movies sometimes.</li>
            <li>The Pibb was moderately endorsed as having real heating capability, so I ordered one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Several ways to alleviate to much heat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have too much heat then not enough.</li>
            <li>After a long day, soaking my feet in hot water feels like heaven.</li>
            <li>loud if you leave the massage feature on.</li>
            <li>, the drawback is that it cannot be controlled, damn near boils my feet.</li>
            <li>The wave action feature does hum a lot, but not to interfere with TV watching, etc.  </li>
            <li>I have a rubber mat and insoles, but the only thing that really works is this bath.  </li>
            <li>and I am ready for the next shift.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as the service from Amazon</li>
            <li>Then my footbath keeps it hot as long as I want.</li>
            <li>This thing is far from a massage device.</li>
            <li>The machine will heat lukewarm water to nearly scalding within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>The box it is packed in states &amp;#34;for professional use only&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I filled with water,my husband put his feet in and it was not deep enough to even cover his entire foot.</li>
            <li>The spa made a loud noise and then a humming noise but not anything else.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ready for the next use</li>
            <li>It is not too loud.  </li>
            <li>remember to fill with luke warm water or even cold water because the heat is powerful</li>
            <li>I placed a large plastic lid under the unit so it wasn&#x27;t on the carpet and that significantly improved it to where the noise was almost non-existent unless I pressed on it too hard.  </li>
            <li>I know people have complained about how quickly it heats and that it gets to hot.  </li>
            <li>I expected better heat and massage Based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li>So I am able to enjoy relaxing my feet longer and without having to worry about the water getting cold or having to empty the water and then refill with hot water again.  </li>
            <li>The basin is deep enough for a high level of water whether or not you are using the gentle bubbles and vibrations.</li>
            <li>The third setting was heat,which was the main reason I choose this one,but didn&#x27;t get that far.</li>
            <li>When it gets too hot to handle, I switch to the non-heat setting until it cools down, and then back to the heat setting until it gets too hot.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice size, not too bad to handle, even full of water.</li>
            <li>you really don&#x27;t need it, but the first few times I wanted to see if there was any water spilt while using.</li>
            <li>Showed up today in typical Amazon quick style.  </li>
            <li>It does tend to get too hot, but I just turn the heat off for a few minutes when it gets too much.  </li>
            <li>This one replaces an older one that only massaged and said it would maintain heat, but never did.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the heat setting makes it really hot really fast, so you can&#x27;t enjoy the jets setting for very long, as it is tied to the heat setting.</li>
            <li>However, the craftsmanship seems a bit shoddy to me -- the splash guard doesn&#x27;t fit tightly on the unit - it&#x27;ll fall right off if you so much as poke it with your finger; there are no assembly instructions, so I had to read other reviews to figure out what the black band that comes with the unit is for (wrapping the cord up); and the foot pads, which don&#x27;t fit anywhere nicely, but rather just lie awkwardly on top of the little spikes at the bottom of the unit, seem to be completely useless.</li>
            <li>As it is, you have to be careful not to let the water get too hot.</li>
            <li>In less than 5 minutes, the water was HOT!</li>
            <li>My needs required water temps above 104 degrees for certain periods of time as a medical treatment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product was delivered right on schedule, and several days before we left for an extended weekend on California&#x27;s central coast.  </li>
            <li>My size 12s make it hard to put in enough water to cover the top of my feet.  </li>
            <li>The control dial was on the side closest to the person using it, and the splash guard would only fit properly on the other side.</li>
            <li>I left my feet too long in it the first time I used it</li>
            <li>it really does heat the water, sometimes it actually gets a little too hot.</li>
            <li>It is very relaxing, the water stays hot and like someone else said, I actually had to turn it to the mode without heat for a little while.</li>
            <li>SO well that you will likely have to turn it off at some point to let it cool down, and even THAT</li>
            <li>This definitely keeps the water hot, in fact it&#x27;s usually too hot.</li>
            <li>I earned major brownie points for getting this for my wife for her birthday.</li>
            <li>and sometimes the water gets a little too hot!</li>
            <li>My other one leaked, never heated the water, had too many gadgets on it and was not comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>little pricey, but worth it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Listen, if you want phony respect, go to a car dealership--at least you get to test drive a car for FREE.  </li>
            <li>The sound is noticeable, especially with the massage function on, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It has only used it once so far.  </li>
            <li>Barely there bubbles, but who needs bubbles.</li>
            <li>No issues with it thus far, well then again, it was only used once.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but it was heaven when I used it.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it twice so far</li>
            <li>Came fast and just as expected.</li>
            <li>Read directions front to back, completely.  </li>
            <li>and they are located on the side very close to the center of the devise.</li>
            <li>The illustrations didn&#x27;t match up with the bassakward bath I got, and the instructions were repetitive, full of grammar and spelling mistakes, and incomprehensible at times.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even this one has too many unnecessary features.</li>
            <li>Come on folks, lean over and turn the heat off when it gets hot, I mean really.  </li>
            <li>bubbling action is pretty weak, but I don&#x27;t really like tons of bubbles.</li>
            <li>I looked at the reviews of other foot spas, and many of them commented on the size being too small for men&#x27;s feet, and that any &amp;#34;heating&amp;#34; features will get the water lukewarm, at best.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but when it gets to hot the only other option is the massage which means vibrates.</li>
            <li>Main complaint was that even those that claimed to keep water hot, didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>We admittedly overfilled it the first time we used it, the water got very hot very fast (not all bad) but flooded my living room floor.</li>
            <li>Can get a little to hot.  </li>
            <li>A little noisy; no temperature control, if it gets too hot you go to the lower level, but it serves the purpose.</li>
            <li>(I thought if I spent more, I&#x27;d get more!); unit gets TOO HOT immediately; add-on doo-dads are ridiculous and useless--an inexplicably poorly designed product; instructions are absurdly inadequate (indeed, there ARE NO instructions on how or how much to fill the unit</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the water heater gets too hot and one must switch to another mode to allow it to cool down.</li>
            <li>It actually heats the water so no more foot dipping in quickly cooled water.</li>
            <li>(total used it less then 50 times in last 3 years), other modes are working fine.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; attachments (three of them) were pretty ridiculous, and the only one I found remotely stimulating or worth using is the roller</li>
            <li>turn off the heat, and it cools down fast.</li>
            <li>The heater is amazingly hot,  only can keep it on for less than 5 min befor turning off and switch to vibrate only.</li>
            <li>I dumped the hot water and filled it with cold tap water (72 deg).</li>
            <li>When I switch the control nob to 2, it doesn&#x27;t heat much while just keeping the water from becoming cold.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relieved that the hot water and massage functions were enjoyable to him, but I know I could&#x27;ve found another foot bath with the same functions at a less expensive price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a social salsa dancer, so I got this for myself as a birthday present to soothe my sore feet every week.</li>
            <li>I use salts, and after rinsing, I run it for a few minutes with clean water, and just wipe it down.</li>
            <li>I loved it, if you&#x27;re having doubts because of the bad reviews, just get it and see for yourself.</li>

            <li> The water stays very warm.</li>

            <li> , impeccable as always.</li>
            <li> The best of the many I have tried.</li>
            <li> Handy footbath!  </li>
            <li> The water stays nice and warm and the massage function is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.ook</li>
            <li> So if u want a good sturdy tub</li>
            <li> The massage and vibrating functions are good too.</li>
            <li> Good at heating water.  </li>
            <li> good Massager Mode -</li>
            <li> Works perry good.</li>
            <li> not that good as we want</li>
            <li> Not so good.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this foot bath to anyone that is looking for a good product.  </li>
            <li> eighty five year father loves it.&lt;br /&gt;He says his feet havn,t felt this good in years.</li>
            <li> and it works as good as the day I got it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While the vibration is fairly good ,  the water jet is just a joke.</li>
            <li> I almost burned myself and imagine if someone is diabetic or don&#x27;t have good sensation in the feet there&#x27;s a good chance that they will suffer severe burns.</li>
            <li> Make good choices...</li>
            <li> It felt good on my feer when using it</li>
            <li> The water was nice and warm, and the massage felt great.  </li>
            <li> It fits his size 13 feet, and it&#x27;s great to be able to control the temperature.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this foot spa.</li>
            <li> Works great, love it.</li>
            <li> I do wish it bubbled more, but the vibrating massage feels great.</li>
            <li> This is something I will be more than happy to use over and over.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Aww, it works perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect hot soaking tub.</li>
            <li> My fiance and I have both tried it and we love it!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> I am so very satisfied with this footbath as it heats and keeps the water quite warm.  </li>
            <li> My wattmeter shows that the heater is about 400 watts, a respectable amount!  </li>
            <li> Reading so many reviews!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> The water gets hot (if you want it to, there is an option to just use the vibration), the vibrations are like heaven and the nubbins on the bottom and the rolly thing are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift, the receiver is enjoying it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife and now I love it!</li>
            <li> I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> love them!  </li>
            <li> great, easy to use foot bath.  </li>
            <li> Heats up extremely fast!!!!!</li>
            <li> Massage also refers to vibration, which is amazing.  </li>
            <li> and she was so happy and its not one of those cheap ones from wally world.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> The directions were non existent, but the heating element heats the water so warm</li>
            <li> The water jets are a nice feature too.</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy tub the massager not existent.</li>
            <li> i followed the instruction step by step, pulled in warm water then plugged in.</li>
            <li> so the snap on massaging accessories are kind of frivolous.</li>
            <li> The vibrate massage is nice.  </li>
            <li> It will warm water from cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The massager is also quite nice.</li>
            <li> Quite honestly, the product looks used.</li>
            <li> You have to manually turn it off when it gets warm</li>
            <li> Heats water, not just keeps warm.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;it keep warm the water.  </li>
            <li> But it heated  the water to exceed warm  it could  burn</li>
            <li> The heat was a nice option</li>
            <li> I decided to return it and order Brookstone footbath once it becomes to warm</li>
            <li> there is a nice jets option.</li>
            <li> I like something else going on for that kind of money.  </li>
            <li> Nice purchase..</li>
            <li> /&gt;So - again, the PIBBS Foot Massager FM3830A does &amp;#34;EXACTLY&amp;#34; what it says it will do, my wife and my own expectations were not met because we are looking for something this &amp;#34;good deal&amp;#34; does not do or deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It shakes the water up and it does heat up nicely.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t it just feels like warm water on your feet nothing else</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my knee and a good foot soak always makes my knee feel better, as well.  </li>
            <li> I m pleased with it because it seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> I tried It with her and just put warm water in it</li>
            <li> and when they warm up they start itching...</li>
            <li> The water did get quite warm when I had it on setting 3</li>
            <li> The vibrate feature is pleasant and not too strong.</li>
            <li> looks normal ~ but works great !</li>
            <li> Good quality, did the job well, easy set up, my son loves it after being on his feet 10 hours a day.</li>
            <li> The heat element gets the water very warm, I found I had to put cool water in and let it heat</li>
            <li> she was sitting on the patio, overlooking the ocean, enjoying a nice late-afternoon soak with the help of a glass of wine.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper to fill a bucket with warm water from the tap and add some epsom salts.</li>
            <li> and it did not maintain warm water but for 5 minutes at the most.</li>
            <li> However, I love the Pibbs unit, it maintains warm water.</li>
            <li> This has a great heater that quickly returns water to appropriate soaking temperature.  </li>
            <li> This is perfect for my osteoarthritis for for my feet and the only machine that keeps the water warm.</li>
            <li> Great product for my first try.</li>
            <li> This is great and it does get hot.  </li>
            <li> This one had very secure reviews, and we choose it.</li>
            <li> Made of nice quality plastic, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;The leather loop, I&#x27;m guessing, is meant to keep your knees together for better comfort and relaxation.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Pure joy to soak my feet in this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily I was able to return mine.</li>
            <li> LOVE it for the heat.</li>
            <li> I used it to hold up the edge of the towel I placed underneath to hold it at the top edges.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This product does that and more.</li>
            <li> am so glad that I bought this unit.  </li>
            <li> OK what&#x27;s Amazon got?  </li>
            <li> I would love to try this product again because it heated the water so well</li>
            <li> Love this foot bath ...</li>
            <li> For the money, you can&#x27;t get better.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a happy wife.</li>
            <li> I have purchased so many Foot Spas and had to return them because they stated with heat.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> WARNING: costs twice as more reliable, better functioning NAME-brands</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this foot spa.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a foot spa that actually heats the water and this unit works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Make sure you check them as soon as you buy them.</li>
            <li> , the massage part is ok ..</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift and have enjoyed using it 3-4 times a week ever since.</li>
            <li> Love this,  </li>
            <li> but she is pleased with it as she is on her feet a lot in her profession</li>
            <li> glad I bought this foot bath.</li>
            <li> She is not thankful enough for this wonderful Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> but nonetheless i love it.</li>
            <li> and we both love it.</li>
            <li> Love this foot bath.  </li>
            <li> Most concern for these tubs is they will not hold the heat.</li>
            <li> I think the vendor just threw them into the box to make it look like it comes with many options.  </li>
            <li> it will heat the water unlike most that i have tried.</li>
            <li> I just took it out of the box and filled it with warm water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li> After travelling for work for more than a month, I&lt;br /&gt;once again contacted  Amazon.com and on line chatted with someone in India.</li>
            <li> The Pibbs Footbath Massager is WONDERFUL!!It massages &amp; keeps the water heated!!We are totally pleased with this product,&amp; wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li> Totally want to get one for my diabetic father so that he can soak his feet in this wonderful thing.</li>
            <li> it felt even better.</li>
            <li> I contacted CS and asked for a replacement as the one they sent me WAS NOT as depicted on the website figuring that was a better model of the one they sent me.  </li>
            <li> Basically satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I emailed and called many times, but no answer at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will get</li>
            <li> I personally love more than inches covering my feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you will love this foot bath.</li>
            <li> You will love this model also if your feet are hurting.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The foot bath was able to maintain between 104 degrees and 105.5 degrees for the two hours</li>
            <li> I chose this one based on the reviews, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> The heating feature on the foot bath is awesome, it might be the only one on the market that heats the water this well.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This bath massager is all I wanted--cannot imagine how great it is, so soothing, so gentle, so easy to use.</li>
            <li> make water really hot  which is good .</li>
            <li> kind of guessed how full to fill it.</li>
            <li> Heats water quickly and massage nice.</li>
            <li> It heated up quickly, maintained heat, has a nice size reservoir and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> This thing gets very hot and the vibration is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> The massager isn&#x27;t that great, but it&#x27;s big and makes a great hot soaker.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s more important is the heater, even if you put ice water inside, it turns hot in a matter of minute and after 5-10 minutes good luck keeping your feet inside.</li>
            <li> The heat and massage functions work very nicely, and he really enjoyed giving his feet a nice, long soak!</li>
            <li> so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> It would be great if they would, but I can image the machine would be more likely to break or cost $500 if it had that many moving parts.</li>
            <li> Ever since I had a Dr. Scholl&#x27;s foot massager many years ago, I enjoy use foot massager at night.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Heats the water great, stays warm for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Very nice, keeps water nicely warm as long as needed.</li>
            <li> Vibration and jet isn&#x27;t significant but better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The heater easily kept the temperature up.  </li>
            <li> It cleans easily, deeper than others I have seen</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cord can be wrapped around the rubber feet for easy storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> Easy to set up and use.  </li>
            <li> an easily falls off.  </li>
            <li> Strongly recommended if you are in the market.  </li>
            <li> What is strong is the heat and the vibration.</li>
            <li> and I like strong stimulation</li>
            <li> Also described as having a \\&quot;strong bubbling effect\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Strong plastic odor, but otherwise a sturdy unit.  </li>
            <li> its nice to know that the water gets hot</li>
            <li> Heats up nicely and keeps it hot.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best foot bath on the market</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise the product is fine.</li>
            <li> which is good because the hot water is really what makes your feet feel better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to clean and keeps the water nice n hot</li>
            <li> The vibration feels good and the bath maintains the water at exactly the right temperature.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this item, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from my husband, and this is certainly in the top 3 of my favorite gifts from him, ever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It made a huge difference for me, in reducing the swelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have had this foot bath for a few months now and it still works great, I like how the machine heats the water on its own.</li>
            <li> It would be great if the heat was adjustable, so this switching back and forth stuff could be avoided.  </li>
            <li> easy to clean, say&#x27;s you can use oil and salts.</li>
            <li> Doesnt sound too obnoxious</li>
            <li> Great product, multiple settings work well: heat-wave-massage.</li>
            <li> really enjoy it</li>
            <li> Otherwise this is a great machine and bending over occasionally is not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> I filled it up and...</li>
            <li> it really keeps the water warm.</li>
            <li> This unit cost $50 more than the Conair, but it&#x27;s worth it if you plan to soak your feet for 15-30 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> very* well and the massage function is nice.</li>
            <li> But going back and forth between warm &amp; massage to just massage and back again as needed keeps the water at a perfect temp.</li>
            <li> Best if you start with warm water, as it can take a while to warm up if you start with cold.</li>
            <li> Size 12 men&#x27;s is a comfortable fit.</li>
            <li> Not noisy at all, you can watch TV with just one sound point up.</li>
            <li> Got it in the mail- filled up with water- leaked about a gallon out two holes in bottom-</li>
            <li> and I see it is no longer available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Could not ask for a better Foot Bath  at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Good value; performance so far vs price.</li>
            <li> This is a nice quiet foot bath that truly heats up nicely.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed in a massager!!  </li>
            <li> 110 is a pretty warm hot tub temperature!  </li>
            <li> 110 is a pretty warm hot tub temperature!  </li>
            <li> There is so much competition that it could be cheaper very easily.</li>
            <li> Keeps water hot, easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Love my new foot bath even though it could have more vibration</li>
            <li> We love this so much!</li>
            <li> Worth every cent!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> My original 4 star review is below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my feet feel great after a long week.</li>
            <li> So just know, the cord is not dog proof, but it makes your feet feel great after a long day at work.</li>
            <li> Finally found a foot bath that keeps the water warm!</li>
            <li> I love how hot it gets-</li>
            <li> too hot, have to switch heat on and off to avoid getting burned, but that &#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I had the original Clairol Foot Fixer from the 1980&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> feet feel so much better after soaking in hot, vibrating water!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> That says a lot, especially, coming from him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best purchases I have made, so far.</li>
            <li> Be sure to only fill it with luke-warm to warm water</li>
            <li> Directions also did not say how to clean unit, so I went by others&#x27; reviews.  </li>
            <li> It has many different settings for keeping your feet warm, massaged and just overall feeling good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I trusted the other good reviews and ordered this.</li>
            <li> It took me forever to choose the right one!</li>
            <li> When the foot massager arrived I was super excited.</li>
            <li> When the water starts to cool, turn on setting 2.  </li>
            <li> The foot bath vibrations are quite intense, so if you have neuropathy you may not be able to tolerate it.  </li>
            <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Water heats up pretty fast and maintain a good hot temperature.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Obviously, it would be ideal that it would not get unreasonably hot, but I&#x27;ve yet to find another foot spa that actually keeps water warm, let alone increases the temperature.</li>
            <li> Do need to let water cool off after awhile as the heater keeps on heating.  </li>
            <li> and I put it on setting 1 to cool off, but still massage.</li>
            <li> Although, I must say, he was very impressed with the immediate improvement on the swelling going down in my feet, so fast.  </li>
            <li> The water heats very quickly and stays hot.</li>
            <li> Honestly, if you want a nice little tub to soak your feet in with a heater, this works.</li>
            <li> and it heats water quickly.</li>
            <li> Quickly shipped.</li>
            <li> Heats water quickly.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I purchased through Amazo.</li>
            <li> It helps his feet tremendously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The more water you use, the more likely you are to need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i got the product today and was excited to give it try right way.</li>
            <li> Christmas 2012 which was a challenge considering a huge or several huge Winter Weather systems which cancelled many flights in the Midwest and Northeast affecting shipments for the Holidays.  </li>
            <li> water got very  hot, needs some sort of control to adjust the heating element.</li>
            <li> This foot bath keeps the water very hot</li>
            <li> My wife loves this thing except it needs a bit more vibration and it does get too hot too fast other than that it is great</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
            <li> He says the water stays very hot.</li>
            <li> First use, there was a slurping/gurgling sound...</li>
            <li> very very HOT</li>
            <li> Really good for relaxing after a long day&#x27;s work on your feet and then just soak your feet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is plenty big for a man with size 11.5 feet, and the heater won&#x27;t just keep water lukewarm, it gets is really quite warm!</li>
            <li> gets nice and hot, but no bubble action, for the price I would expect bubbly goodness</li>
            <li> Im sure, but when you are trying to wind down and relax, its kind of a pain.</li>
            <li> It will keep water hot!</li>
            <li> Yes, gets and stays hot!  </li>
            <li> my only gripe of sorts is that while easy to figure out how to use, better instructions are needed.</li>
            <li> Most other brands (in fine print) will state that adding supplements to the water is NOT  recommended (which kind of defeats the purpose of owning a Foot Spa - you normally would want to add at a minimum Epsom Salt).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has nice massaging action and keeps the water toasty warm - actually, it can get too toasty warm if you keep the heating setting on for too long.</li>
            <li> The devise also comes with two rubber insoles that you are supposed to put them inside and rest your feet on, however, these pads don&#x27;t fit really well and keep blocking those holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> assuredly well worth the price.</li>
            <li> this unit is worth every cent.</li>
            <li> All that is necessary is for it to keep the water warm, and circulating.</li>
            <li> It is worth it.</li>
            <li> so well worth it.</li>
            <li> The water does get quite hot, so I have to turn it off to let it cool for a bit every once in a while.</li>
            <li> This footbath is worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s commercial grade and works great so far.</li>
            <li> This foot bath is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I just feel the water constantly, and ask my clients to let me know if it gets too warm.</li>
            <li> My suggestion buy this its worth it.</li>
            <li> They attach to a groove above the water level so you can rub your feet on them, but they don&#x27;t rub you, on their own, in the water.  </li>
            <li> Thus far so far so good.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for tired achy feet and it works to relieve arthritis, too.  </li>
            <li> Either way it made a useful gift as a heated foot spa.</li>
            <li> so i have to keep alternating back to the massage and no heat setting when the water is too warm.</li>
            <li> and it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Perfect for soaking your tired feet while reading a book or watching television.  </li>
            <li> but this by far was her favorite.</li>
            <li> , I know quality because I&#x27;m never afraid to pay for it.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money (under $100 with S&amp;H).</li>
            <li> Works great but it heats up too much so you have to take a break every so often to let the water cool down.</li>
            <li> The water gets super hot and the variations of vibrate and heat are on point.  </li>
            <li> Water gets hot quickly.  </li>
            <li> have to go to &amp;#34;massage only&amp;#34; pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Gets super hot.  </li>
            <li> other wise i like it</li>
            <li> The water really does stay hot, and that was very important to me because I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the aggravation of having to pour in more hot water after ten minutes.</li>
            <li> All in all I am happy I bought it as too hot is better for me than not hot enough.</li>
            <li> Should be able to enjoy this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Water gets hot hot!</li>
            <li> I was honestly embarrassed that I&#x27;d given this as a present when we were having so much difficulty putting it together.</li>
            <li> This Massager costs about $30 more than the HomeMedics, but is well worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> problem is we, consumers - were hoping it did what we have encountered personally, like the Foot Massage that comes with the Pedicure Chairs at the local Spa which have WATER JETS that exfoliates your feet (lol)....</li>
            <li> But overall - we are KEEPING IT as I had noted above, it does what it says and we are happy with just that - since we are not going pay a thousand plus for the Pedicure Chairs with Foot/Body massage.  </li>
            <li> The foot spa is not as relaxing as having a pedicure at a professional spa, but it&#x27;s great to use at home and is a whole lot cheaper in the long run.</li>
            <li> My doctor actually suggested that I use full strength bleach for about a week and then use strong over the counter fungal preparations.  </li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have to write a review on this product as I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> I finally got to use this after getting it for a Christmas present and it was very nice.</li>
            <li> This thing I was worried about because it was so cheap and there were other things out there that looked better.</li>
            <li> It works great with Epsom salt, heating element is very strong - can heat a cold water.</li>
            <li> This machine will take water to 115 degrees and higher</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to flash the massager with a fresh water for a few minutes after using it with Epsom salt (I just fill out the unit with warm fresh water and run it for 3 minutes at the highest switch set mode: bubbles/heater/massage).</li>
            <li> The tub needs to a littler higher to catch splashes.</li>
            <li> So this foot bath does get water hot (sometimes too hot for my</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> too hot?</li>
            <li> This thing gets so hot</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> one thing I do not like is that there is no way to set a temperature, so if you want heated water, eventually it is going to get way too hot</li>
            <li> He says it gets so hot that he feels like his feet are going to burn off.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s get hot</li>
            <li> With heater it can get too hot.</li>
            <li> Just need to keep switching the heater part off so the water will not get too hot.  </li>
            <li> as I saw posted before, that they clogged theirs up on the first run.  </li>
            <li> if you let the salts dissolve in the hot water &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; turning on the circulation pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t believe I found it!</li>
            <li> as they have to so that you don&#x27;t get hot spots).  </li>
            <li> I started the test with hot tap water (107 deg).  </li>
            <li> It says you should start with hot water because it won&#x27;t heat the water. . .</li>
            <li> When it starts feeling too hot</li>
            <li> When it starts feeling too hot</li>
            <li> Keeps hot, vibrates and bubbles.</li>
            <li> Too hot, way too hot.  </li>
            <li> Bubbles stopped working first season.</li>
            <li> this will get as hot as you want it to, i find myself having to cycle the heat off every now and then.  </li>
            <li> but it does get hot..........</li>
            <li> It got hot.  </li>
            <li> The water will become hotter when the massage begin, so don&#x27;t put too hot water at the beginning</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a foot spa that heats water and keeps it hot</li>
            <li> This is like the 3 bears, this one gets too hot.</li>
            <li> First time purchasing this type of product.</li>
            <li> but I like the fact that it keeps the water hot.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Most just circulate hot water, but they won&#x27;t actually keep it hot.</li>
            <li> Water does get hot</li>
            <li> this is the key factor for my purchase decision on this product, so satisfied on this</li>
            <li> It is as described, no failed expectations.  </li>
            <li> Water can stay HOT.</li>
            <li> You must know, that the unit gets HOT.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I&#x27;m so pleased to find a spa that actually heats, that I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall - if you are reading this, please note that it does EXACTLY what the product description says just not at the STRENGTH or DESIRE we want.  </li>
            <li> I mix the boiling water with double its amount in cold water and end up with perfect warm water.</li>
            <li> It does get hot and you have to keep turning it off</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the water gets hot.</li>
            <li> Really hot.</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> the water never felt to the touch of my hand to be that hot.  </li>
            <li> Water stays hot all the time.</li>
            <li> My area got hit with record rains and the city&#x27;s storm system backed up for the first time ever.  </li>
            <li> This was the only item I was able to salvage</li>
            <li> Love the different switch settings and the vibrations and the nodes.</li>
            <li> It get room temperature water hot in 10-15 mins which I don&#x27;t mind waiting.  </li>
            <li> ( 112 F, to be exact).</li>
            <li> After 15 minutes on setting 3, it became too hot</li>
            <li> I used it for many years until it finally, recently gave way!  </li>
            <li> Foot Bath Massager is exactly the replacement I needed.  </li>
            <li> Turned it on to the first setting(massage).</li>
            <li> and it got the water hot</li>
            <li> and it stayed hot.</li>
            <li> But if you like a hot foot bath, this is AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The water stays hot forever.</li>
            <li> And let me tell you something, it gets HOT...</li>
            <li> It did exactly what I wanted it to do</li>
            <li> You just keep pushing your feet in many different directions hoping to stop the motor noise.</li>
            <li> I just love having hot water the entire time I am using the foot bath.</li>
            <li> Hot water, after all, is what helps my feet relax.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After one hour on level 3, and no perceptible heating of the water, I gave up and dumped the water out and replaced it with hot water from the bathtub.</li>
            <li> /pump on/off every few minutes to keep at a good temperature.</li>
            <li> Glad I spent a little more than the cheap ones!</li>
            <li> But this really speaks to Amazon and the infrastructure they&#x27;ve built - PRETTY EFFICIENT, actually, the MOST EFFICIENT of any Online Retailer.  </li>
            <li> Vibration mode is strong enough to be pleasant, yet not annoyingly strong.</li>
            <li> With the FM3830A I usually start off with a little warm water and the water gets a comfortable warm and remains at that temperature.  </li>
            <li> Certainly keeps water hot.  </li>
            <li> I bought this based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> After using it for over an hour the water is still hot and the vibrations and bubbles are really relaxing, just what I need after a 12 hour day on my feet.</li>
            <li> It is very relaxing and the water does get hot.  </li>
            <li> i have had a few different kinds in the past,but this is by far the best for the $$$$.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it gets hot FAST</li>
            <li> you pretty much won&#x27;t feel anything.</li>
            <li> Not sure why no one can make a good foot spa.</li>
            <li> This got old quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars because I got my money back- easy return process.</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I was a little irritated at first because it took about 10 minutes to heat the water up (lolprincess) when I really could have just put warm water in from the start.</li>
            <li> The large rubberband is for retaining the power cord wrapped around the &#x27;feet&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This is great for late nights after shooting a wedding!</li>
            <li> Quiet, keeps water warm, don&#x27;t start out with really hot water ... not necessary.  </li>
            <li> nice mess- returning</li>
            <li> I wish the top was attached as it is kinda loose</li>
            <li> My main reason for choosing this product was that it purported to keep the water hot, and it does that, which is why I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would complain is that though a lot of reviewers said it can heat up the water pretty quick and hot, it not the case for mine.</li>
            <li> I am suprised by how nice this little guy is.</li>
            <li> Definitely heats the water, had to let it cool a couple of times, only downfall is that the unit pictured is not the same color as the one shipped, other that this, it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li> As others said, cycle the heat off and on, but I just lift my feet up for a few seconds, then put them back in and that works great for me.  </li>
            <li> I like that my big feet are comfortable and fully coverd in the bath.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> after doing some research on all the footbaths that are available on amazon, I finally decided to go with this one.</li>
            <li> It seems cheap for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li> This really heats the water, so fill it will tepid or lukewarm water to begin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t really seem to help.</li>
            <li> Works very well for my purpose.  </li>
            <li> heat of the water and the salts really helped me, a lot.  </li>
            <li> so I could see what &amp; if it could really heat.</li>
            <li> They include a pair of foot-shaped rubbery pads with points that are much softer.&lt;br /&gt;Heat</li>
            <li> But there isn&#x27;t much freeboard, so using it on a waterproof floor is a plus.  </li>
            <li> The whole unit seems durably constructed.  </li>
            <li> But there isn&#x27;t much freeboard, so using it on a waterproof floor is a plus.  </li>
            <li> The whole unit seems durably constructed.  </li>
            <li> Cost was too much to return it</li>
            <li> Really helps his circulation.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this thing.  </li>
            <li> Vibration, heat and bubbles work very well.</li>
            <li> you will really like it</li>
            <li> the unit vibrates providing a very soothing experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no fill line which would take the guessing out of how much water to put in.</li>
            <li> The nubs in the bottom are very pronounced, I covered with the liner that was included, but it continually slides out of place.  </li>
            <li> She is on her feet all day and this foot spa really helps sooth her achy feet.</li>
            <li> It DOES heat the water and that&#x27;s really all I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I thought I had put too much in, but all the water drained not just a portion.</li>
            <li> I give 4 stars because the manul  doesn&#x27;t really do its job.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very comfortable&lt;</li>
            <li> Thanks to Pibbs for the foot bath.</li>
            <li> it hold the heat very well and</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I lost absolutely everything, except for this footbath.  </li>
            <li> and she stated that she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> There are several attachments included, but some of them either don&#x27;t fit or don&#x27;t have a function.  </li>
            <li> Feet are very sore at end of day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I highly reccommed this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a gift and spent more for it after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> product seems very well made.</li>
            <li> It does however fit around the outside of the unit</li>
            <li> Really massages and warms your feet.</li>
            <li> Price is reasonable considering what it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If the water gets too warm, either remove your feet for a few minutes or turn the knob to &amp;#34;0&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It does get a bit hot, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for Grandma if she has diabetes and/or poor circulation, but with the toe touch controls you can easily flip the heat on and off to keep it more temperate.  </li>
            <li> This new model runs too hot.  </li>
            <li> Stays nice and hot and very relaxing after a hard day.</li>
            <li> I have used other foot massagers, but this one feels better.</li>
            <li> my sister, has had more than a few, I let her try this unit, and she ordered one for herself immediately, complaining the others just didn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> I wanted a foot massager that would stay warm or hot for at least 30 minutes at at time this winter.</li>
            <li> It feels like it is well-made, not cheap plastic junk, and I think I will be using it happily for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it heats the water, does get alittle to hot but changing the settings for a few minutes fixes that.</li>
            <li> in all, the devise is ok , I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth a price.</li>
            <li> It is easy to carry, dump, rinse and pat dry.</li>
            <li> very easy cleaning and not too heavy.</li>
            <li> There are a couple attachments I haven&#x27;t really used, but I don&#x27;t think they were part of the high price tag anyway.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it and will probably use it more, but in the future, I think spending more on a really good one is the plan.</li>
            <li> The water massage is a bit weak, but again pleasant.</li>
            <li> The foot bath will comfortably accommodate a foot that measures 11 3/8 inches long.</li>
            <li> Bought some Epsom salt at Walmart and dissolved some in hot tap water in an old Sterilite storage box.  </li>
            <li> It is well made and designed, very easy to work with, has a long cord and is also quiet.  </li>
            <li> sure adding a remote or a thermostat would really drive the price up, but at least a wired remote would be a great addition to this product.</li>
            <li> Feet do feel better after a half hour .</li>
            <li> Love it and use it every week without any problems for the last 12 months with various Dr.</li>
            <li> wife)--that is the main reason I purchased it--and it does vibrate and produce a jet.</li>
            <li> Can anyone recommend a decent product that is under ~$100.</li>
            <li> It has lived up to the description, the unit heats up (unlike others that are lukewarm) and stays heated for a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li> turn it back on, and it heats again quickly.</li>
            <li> Overall very relaxing and worth it.</li>
            <li> and when I took my feet out the suddenly became super itchy, sort of like when you&#x27;re a kid</li>
            <li> I used this footbath to soak my tired feet, and it worked great for about 5 times, and then the motor started making a loud rattling sound, loud enough so that it makes any relaxation go out the window.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot research before picking is particular product.</li>
            <li> That option is not only very noisy but pretty much nauseating.</li>
            <li> Forget the Bells and Whistles of the high end competitors.</li>
            <li> then I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The massager does heat the water, it provides me with high quality massage.</li>
            <li> I have a high tolerance to heat-</li>
            <li> i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> requirements are simple; compac in size, light in weight, produce heat and not loud when motor is on.&lt;br /&gt;I have been visit stores and made research on line, the PIBBS seams right for my need.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews for cheaper products, I decided to pass and spend a little more on the Pibbs fm3830a.</li>
            <li> Guess it doesn&#x27;t matter how full you make it though when mine was pretty full it&#x27;d make the loud vibrations due to the extra water weight.  </li>
            <li> You do need to pour in warm water to begin with, but that isn&#x27;t too hard.</li>
            <li> Having used it for almost 5 months now, I have to concur that all the previous positive reviews are accurate.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I work 12 hour shifts and standing all the time on concrete flooring.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that the massager does absolutely everything it guarantees.</li>
            <li> very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Is quieter than my old Dr Scholls foot bath</li>
            <li> The extra money was well worth it</li>
            <li> Nails are normal looking.</li>
            <li> Was worth the price and has held up well for the last 2 months.</li>
            <li> Well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I was very optimistic about this purchase but during the first use, it began to cease vibrating and the water leaked from the control button the entire time.</li>
            <li> Its definitely worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> Return window is closed - pretty convenient that it stops working right when you can no longer return it.</li>
            <li> The water pours right back out!</li>
            <li> My pregnant wife loves it after a long day on her feet</li>
            <li> Like some reviews state it can get a little too hot but it takes no effort to turn the heat off for a minute to let the water cool.</li>
            <li> Bought this one because reviews of other massagers said the water never stayed warm very long.</li>
            <li> She took her new foot bath massager with us, of course, and I brought an extension cord.  </li>
            <li> Described as having a \\&quot;Newly designed rotating node\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s time to buy a new model with to-day&#x27;s tech.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In other words, if you went by the \\&quot;diagram,\\&quot; many people would actually have trouble getting their feet to fit in the unit!</li>
            <li> I wanted one to keep the water warm, simple massage and a few inches deeper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with 3 attachments that fit in the middle of the bath to give an individual foot</li>
            <li> We wanted to love this unit, but unfortunately, people need to be aware of what can happen to the most careful of users.</li>
            <li> If it hold up for a year that&#x27;s all I care about I would buy a new one every year with no complaints for the price, First one I every bought big upgrade from the pan.</li>
            <li> After extensive research into footbaths, I purchased this one because the reviews said it&#x27;s a bit deeper than others, and the water stays hot.  </li>
            <li> The reason I decided to purchase this was because a posting stated his brow was starting to get hot.  </li>
            <li> Although I would of kept it even though it gets too hot, I will definitely be returning it now.</li>
            <li> I am often (haven&#x27;t timed it) bending over to turn it to the first setting which is massage only without heat, in order to keep my feet from feeling a burn.</li>
            <li> Gets plenty hot in a short time.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a foot bath that would keep the water hot because a lot of reviews on different foot bath massagers said that they didn&#x27;t hold the heat.</li>
            <li> The product came packaged ONLY in the original product box, with no extra outer box.  </li>
            <li> They were red for about an hour, then they SWELLED up like balloons for a whole DAY!  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have found with it is that after a while the water is too hot for my comfort</li>
            <li> They filed a claim and then advised that the seller is not willing to refund because their policy says the product has to be in the original packing and not used.</li>
            <li> It will actually get too hot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;PRO&#x27;s - Water stays hot and actually gets hotter over time requiring switching it off</li>
            <li> This foot spa IS professional grade!</li>
            <li> The price is higher in the market.&lt;br /&gt;However,  there are no instructions, only two pages of home made recommended times, and it is out dated.  </li>
            <li> They not only do not heat water but do not keep the water hot.</li>
            <li> The only thing i&#x27;d like is if it were a few inches deeper, the top of the tub is about level with my ankles, i&#x27;d like to have my feet a little more &amp;#34;in&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Two rubbery gray foot pads are provided which can be used nubs up or down, providing softer nubs or a smooth surface.</li>
            <li> After searching for numerous products online, I finally chose this one, and it turns out that my choice is right!</li>
            <li> It comes with a black band that is supposed to wrap around the power cord when stored but doesn&#x27;t seem to fit well.  </li>
            <li> I just have to be careful not to burn myself because the water can get very hot.  </li>
            <li> My first one had a leaking issue but they replaced it in no time flat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Operation of the spa is fairly easy (which is good because the included instruction manual is worthless).</li>
            <li> Actually, this was a little gift for my girlfriend, who is very attentive to her feet and likes to soak them to soften up and then remove calluses.  </li>
            <li> I soak my feet in Epsom salt water almost everyday (for 2 months now) and it is still working fine.</li>
            <li> so well I would like to see future models equipped with a built in large dial temp gauge.</li>
            <li> The massage part is a little bit on the loud side but ok overall.</li>
            <li> Feels amazing to soak sore, tired feet while the machine rumbles</li>
            <li> Its great for cold nights, and warms me up.</li>
            <li> This product was awesome until my fiancée&#x27;s stupid f***ing dog chewed up the cord.</li>
            <li> It was a great massager for about a week, and then started making the most horrible noise, as if an aircraft was taking off.</li>
            <li> Stay clear of the HOMEMEDICS Foot Spa, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Amazon bundled this with the tea tree salts when clearly the manufacturer does not recommend using any additives in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> on the box (see link for what unit actually looks like) but feels rather cheap with no real instructions or even a fill line.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s deeper, but the water definately stays hot ... too hot sometimes, but better hot than cold!  </li>
            <li> This is a simple product that just works very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too loud, so we use it while watching movies sometimes.</li>
            <li> The Pibb was moderately endorsed as having real heating capability, so I ordered one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Several ways to alleviate to much heat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have too much heat then not enough.</li>
            <li> After a long day, soaking my feet in hot water feels like heaven.</li>
            <li> loud if you leave the massage feature on.</li>
            <li> , the drawback is that it cannot be controlled, damn near boils my feet.</li>
            <li> The wave action feature does hum a lot, but not to interfere with TV watching, etc.  </li>
            <li> I have a rubber mat and insoles, but the only thing that really works is this bath.  </li>
            <li> and I am ready for the next shift.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as the service from Amazon</li>
            <li> Then my footbath keeps it hot as long as I want.</li>
            <li> This thing is far from a massage device.</li>
            <li> The machine will heat lukewarm water to nearly scalding within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> The box it is packed in states &amp;#34;for professional use only&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I filled with water,my husband put his feet in and it was not deep enough to even cover his entire foot.</li>
            <li> The spa made a loud noise and then a humming noise but not anything else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ready for the next use</li>
            <li> It is not too loud.  </li>
            <li> remember to fill with luke warm water or even cold water because the heat is powerful</li>
            <li> I placed a large plastic lid under the unit so it wasn&#x27;t on the carpet and that significantly improved it to where the noise was almost non-existent unless I pressed on it too hard.  </li>
            <li> I know people have complained about how quickly it heats and that it gets to hot.  </li>
            <li> I expected better heat and massage Based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> So I am able to enjoy relaxing my feet longer and without having to worry about the water getting cold or having to empty the water and then refill with hot water again.  </li>
            <li> The basin is deep enough for a high level of water whether or not you are using the gentle bubbles and vibrations.</li>
            <li> The third setting was heat,which was the main reason I choose this one,but didn&#x27;t get that far.</li>
            <li> When it gets too hot to handle, I switch to the non-heat setting until it cools down, and then back to the heat setting until it gets too hot.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice size, not too bad to handle, even full of water.</li>
            <li> you really don&#x27;t need it, but the first few times I wanted to see if there was any water spilt while using.</li>
            <li> Showed up today in typical Amazon quick style.  </li>
            <li> It does tend to get too hot, but I just turn the heat off for a few minutes when it gets too much.  </li>
            <li> This one replaces an older one that only massaged and said it would maintain heat, but never did.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the heat setting makes it really hot really fast, so you can&#x27;t enjoy the jets setting for very long, as it is tied to the heat setting.</li>
            <li> However, the craftsmanship seems a bit shoddy to me -- the splash guard doesn&#x27;t fit tightly on the unit - it&#x27;ll fall right off if you so much as poke it with your finger; there are no assembly instructions, so I had to read other reviews to figure out what the black band that comes with the unit is for (wrapping the cord up); and the foot pads, which don&#x27;t fit anywhere nicely, but rather just lie awkwardly on top of the little spikes at the bottom of the unit, seem to be completely useless.</li>
            <li> As it is, you have to be careful not to let the water get too hot.</li>
            <li> In less than 5 minutes, the water was HOT!</li>
            <li> My needs required water temps above 104 degrees for certain periods of time as a medical treatment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product was delivered right on schedule, and several days before we left for an extended weekend on California&#x27;s central coast.  </li>
            <li> My size 12s make it hard to put in enough water to cover the top of my feet.  </li>
            <li> The control dial was on the side closest to the person using it, and the splash guard would only fit properly on the other side.</li>
            <li> I left my feet too long in it the first time I used it</li>
            <li> it really does heat the water, sometimes it actually gets a little too hot.</li>
            <li> It is very relaxing, the water stays hot and like someone else said, I actually had to turn it to the mode without heat for a little while.</li>
            <li> SO well that you will likely have to turn it off at some point to let it cool down, and even THAT</li>
            <li> This definitely keeps the water hot, in fact it&#x27;s usually too hot.</li>
            <li> I earned major brownie points for getting this for my wife for her birthday.</li>
            <li> and sometimes the water gets a little too hot!</li>
            <li> My other one leaked, never heated the water, had too many gadgets on it and was not comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> little pricey, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Listen, if you want phony respect, go to a car dealership--at least you get to test drive a car for FREE.  </li>
            <li> The sound is noticeable, especially with the massage function on, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It has only used it once so far.  </li>
            <li> Barely there bubbles, but who needs bubbles.</li>
            <li> No issues with it thus far, well then again, it was only used once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but it was heaven when I used it.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it twice so far</li>
            <li> Came fast and just as expected.</li>
            <li> Read directions front to back, completely.  </li>
            <li> and they are located on the side very close to the center of the devise.</li>
            <li> The illustrations didn&#x27;t match up with the bassakward bath I got, and the instructions were repetitive, full of grammar and spelling mistakes, and incomprehensible at times.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even this one has too many unnecessary features.</li>
            <li> Come on folks, lean over and turn the heat off when it gets hot, I mean really.  </li>
            <li> bubbling action is pretty weak, but I don&#x27;t really like tons of bubbles.</li>
            <li> I looked at the reviews of other foot spas, and many of them commented on the size being too small for men&#x27;s feet, and that any &amp;#34;heating&amp;#34; features will get the water lukewarm, at best.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when it gets to hot the only other option is the massage which means vibrates.</li>
            <li> Main complaint was that even those that claimed to keep water hot, didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> We admittedly overfilled it the first time we used it, the water got very hot very fast (not all bad) but flooded my living room floor.</li>
            <li> Can get a little to hot.  </li>
            <li> A little noisy; no temperature control, if it gets too hot you go to the lower level, but it serves the purpose.</li>
            <li> (I thought if I spent more, I&#x27;d get more!); unit gets TOO HOT immediately; add-on doo-dads are ridiculous and useless--an inexplicably poorly designed product; instructions are absurdly inadequate (indeed, there ARE NO instructions on how or how much to fill the unit</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the water heater gets too hot and one must switch to another mode to allow it to cool down.</li>
            <li> It actually heats the water so no more foot dipping in quickly cooled water.</li>
            <li> (total used it less then 50 times in last 3 years), other modes are working fine.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; attachments (three of them) were pretty ridiculous, and the only one I found remotely stimulating or worth using is the roller</li>
            <li> turn off the heat, and it cools down fast.</li>
            <li> The heater is amazingly hot,  only can keep it on for less than 5 min befor turning off and switch to vibrate only.</li>
            <li> I dumped the hot water and filled it with cold tap water (72 deg).</li>
            <li> When I switch the control nob to 2, it doesn&#x27;t heat much while just keeping the water from becoming cold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relieved that the hot water and massage functions were enjoyable to him, but I know I could&#x27;ve found another foot bath with the same functions at a less expensive price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a social salsa dancer, so I got this for myself as a birthday present to soothe my sore feet every week.</li>
            <li> I use salts, and after rinsing, I run it for a few minutes with clean water, and just wipe it down.</li>
            <li> I loved it, if you&#x27;re having doubts because of the bad reviews, just get it and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also kinda loud, but if you rest your feet fully on the bottom, it does mute it quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much more expensive than other spas</li>
            <li> May send it back due to loud vibration for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Also, the vibration setting is sometimes very loud, and other times not very loud.</li>
            <li> I filled it with cold water and in less than a minute, the water turned hot!</li>
            <li> The wave is a waste sure wish the blue line of bubbles was real and included but that was the only disappointment.</li>
            <li> When we received it I took it out of its box to find the cheaply made very shallow spa.</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars when I first bought it, but now give it 1 because it&#x27;s built so shoddily that the motor keeps hitting something in the housing.  </li>
            <li> The excitement did not last long.</li>
            <li> and you play outside too long and feet and hands</li>
            <li> Not bad but not great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;CON&#x27;s - When on Vibrate, makes a loud noise when pressing down with feet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The foot beds are knobbed with short hard nibs or you can use the included knobby inserts which are much softer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; hardpoints on the base, but I use the rubber pads smooth side up, and no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Enclosed rubber pads help when sensitive feet want less disturbance from plastic needles.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a few weeks its started to rattle loudly where it sounds like the motor is located.</li>
            <li> Although there were only a handful of reviews, I took a gamble and spent the extra $ 30 bucks.</li>
            <li> lastly, the few little gizmos that you can plug into the middle really don&#x27;t do anything, unless you have an itch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deep enough to hold plenty of water compared to other models that held just a couple inches of water before they overflowed during use.</li>
            <li> It stays warm and doesnt get cold like other ones that I used.</li>
            <li> a little loud but works well</li>
            <li> It really does help relieve the stress in your feet and the heat does wonders for doing your pedicure, also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next test case, my husband, who is a hard critic on any and everything.  </li>
            <li> If you have had a hard day where you are always on your feet this foot bath really does the trick.  </li>
            <li> Not very safe for use in a professional spa environment.</li>
            <li> the cheap ones didnt seem to work well and the ones that worked well seemd really expensive.</li>
            <li> Definitely a thumbs up and delivery was sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave the heater on too long or you will burn your feet.  </li>
            <li> It heats the water and massages my feet for a long as I want.</li>
            <li> I spent 87dollars for this spa plus $15 to ship to me and$15 to ship it back to them.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t take long at all.</li>
            <li> And there is an oblong blue piece that sticks up in the center, at the end of the tub that your toes are at.</li>
            <li> Very expensive for what it is but willing to pay to get something that  heats the water HOT and massages feet.  </li>
            <li> After reading numerous reviews on other foot bath / massage machines I chose this one.</li>
            <li> One is a round smooth thing that, unlike the other two, has a shorter stem so doesn&#x27;t stay securely in place making it worthless.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend getting one of these, even if you just want to relax at the end of a hard day on your feet.  </li>
            <li> Dry.  </li>
            <li> Mine had no bubbling on the left side and very weak bubbling on the right side.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it is a bit shallow to get a full ankle soak.</li>
            <li> I normally do not write reviews</li>
            <li> Not sure if something is loose inside the unit causing the loud noise sometimes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this foot bath unit, with the Epsom salts for the feet, the very next morning, my swelling had gone down by 75%.  </li>
            <li> It actually got so toasty that I turned it down for awhile.&lt;br</li>
            <li> occasionally I have to turn it down</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Bubble mode is pretty pathetic, however, the Massager Mode is what you&#x27;ll be using the most of any ways.&lt;br /&gt;-Wish</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a bath massager locally but without a heater</li>
            <li> Other reviews helped me determine that this was a production defect and other&#x27; s who replaced theirs did not have the same problem.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased a different company&#x27;s product for half the price with twice the massage effect.</li>
            <li> Its also quiet and does not make a mess like others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some reviews that say it&#x27;s a tight squeeze for those with larger feet.</li>
            <li> As stated in other reviews &amp;#34;it does get hot&amp;#34; but no problem to turn it down or back up as it cools.</li>
            <li> product looked a little different than the box but delivered within the max days</li>
            <li> This foot bath not only will heat cold water but keeps it piping hot until you turn it off (1 hour, 2 hours-does not matter how long).</li>
            <li> AND they&#x27;ll try to cheat you out of the money you spent to have the item delivered to your house</li>
            <li> Unclear what the center attachments are for</li>
            <li> I am careful to not overfill it</li>
            <li> few weeks ago I thought maybe my occasionally sore dogs needed some TLC.  </li>
            <li> Be careful about overfilling so</li>
            <li> I unpacked it carefully, fully expecting to return it.  </li>
            <li> Be careful about overfilling so</li>
            <li> I unpacked it carefully, fully expecting to return it.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend this foot bath experience to anyone with sore, tired and/or achy feet.</li>
            <li> and I believe the rubber foot pads are in case the plastic basin is too rough for you.</li>
            <li> Anyway a total waste.</li>
            <li> The instructions are not very helpful and are written in &#x27;Engrish&#x27;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The massage attachments attach to the center of the spa and you can run your feet over them to work on any problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A crushed box corner was a concern, but unit was undamaged.  </li>
            <li> However, after only a few weeks of use, it began to leak.</li>
            <li> There are 3 tools that can be used one at a time to put in the center and rub your feet on them.  </li>
            <li> This is not what I expected before I made the purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ...so be careful.</li>
            <li> I was ready to return it for false advertisement but reviews made me try it anyway.  </li>
            <li> It is very frustrating to deal with a customer service rep who does not answer your questions directly or when you ask three questions, you get one answer and have to constantly ask the same thing over and over.</li>
            <li> Its got little plastic massage nubs on the bottom of the tub which are hard, smaller rubberized ones can be inserted which are softer, or you can flip the inserts upside down to have no little nubs at all.</li>
            <li> Main complaint is you have to keep turning the heat off every few minutes to keep from burning your feet.</li>
            <li> but overall is a decent buy but too expensive in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The unit can only run for 5 minutes before the water is heated too hot and you have to add cold water.  </li>
            <li> Dealing directly with this company is a lesson in PATIENCE and will enable you to handle unnecessary STRESS over a long time</li>
            <li> but I just turned it down to 1 for a few and then turned it back up when the water got cooler.</li>
            <li> Although my doctor wanted me to try Bleach - I should thank him for not prescribing anti fungals that can cause other issues.  </li>
            <li> My niece has had a year, medically, that thankfully not many people have to endure.  </li>
            <li> instructions are pretty useless (no surprise).  </li>
            <li> The other reviews convinced me and after using this once, they are correct.  </li>
            <li> Believe me, I have tried with other product.  </li>
            <li> Not hot</li>
            <li> My other concern was adding epsom salts or oils to the water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, what you get:&lt;br /&gt;The spa itself, a blue splash guard, a pair of small knobbed massage inserts, three massage attachments, instruction booklet and a wrap around drip</li>
            <li> Other foot spas run around the 30-40 dollar range.</li>
            <li> On the second setting some bubbles came out of a small hole under each foot arch.</li>
            <li> and I bought her jewelry and other stuff</li>
            <li> It takes quite a while to cool down, so this isn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;There a few silly \\&quot;attachments\\</li>
            <li> It takes quite a while to cool down, so this isn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;There a few silly \\&quot;attachments\\</li>
            <li> A little research dug up the fact that this spa was one of a few that would actually heat the water - and that is something I can attest to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Convinced myself it was beneficial but the water got cold quickly.  </li>
            <li> &quot; (as a potential customer, you might not believe this, but these \\&quot;illustrations\\&quot; are so poorly executed they are actually show the \\&quot;feet\\&quot; positioning UPSIDE-DOWN!</li>
            <li> Bottom line, I would totally recommend this to any poor sole who works on there feet all day.</li>
            <li> I only use the heater for a few minutes when I feel that the water is getting cold, cause the heater heats the water and gets too hot.</li>
            <li> Three people from church told me theirs broke down too, so I requested a gift card to buy SOME OTHER  MODEL.</li>
            <li> this foot bath provides a huge relief on a bad day.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it didn&#x27;t come with any directions.</li>
            <li> Water gets very hot; massage attachments are useless; instructions non-existent internet or in the box!</li>
            <li> Not worth the effort of using it.</li>
            <li> Directions failed to specify how much water to use with unit, so we judged.  </li>
            <li> This item is not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> This was not worth $125.</li>
            <li> Not sure what kind of crap policy this is, but beware of UglyNBeauty as I&#x27;ve never had a problem returning items with Amazon.</li>
            <li> The rotating node with attachments is unnecessary as far as I am concerned, but some may like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I now can set and read the newspaper or look at TV without getting up and down to re-heat my water.  </li>
            <li> As it cools down I switch to Massage &amp; Heat.  </li>
            <li> As it cools down I switch to Massage &amp; Heat.  </li>
            <li> Just to give an idea about durability, I had a finished basement, plus tons of stuff stored down there.  </li>
            <li> , what the knob settings represent, where several of the accessory pieces go, how to turn off the heat after it gets insanely hot within seconds, etc. etc.); there is no actual \\&quot;DRAIN\\&quot; outlet, though there is a plastic piece on the unit and reference to a \\&quot;DRAIN\\&quot; in one of the ridiculous and crude hand-drawn \\&quot;illustrations\\</li>
            <li> I use it half to one hour at a time and there are times I will turn the heat component down.  </li>
            <li> No massage was apparent unless they are referring to the weak \\&quot;vibrations\\&quot; and slight wave movement.  </li>
            <li> I had a previous foot bath that didn&#x27;t heat up</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does come with some odd attachments.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased [[ASIN:B0043494XS</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot less noisy than the Conair foot bath.</li>
            <li> If the price were half what I paid, then perhaps.</li>
            <li> Had to scoop out a quart of cold and dump in a quart of hot.</li>
            <li> tried using cold tap water first.</li>
            <li> She was previously using a little bucket...</li>
            <li> Probably just defective, but I&#x27;m pretty disappointed as I shopped around a long time before settling on this foot bath.</li>
            <li> Plug in and decide to feel the water temp before turning it on and receive a little shock.</li>
            <li> + just to have a little vibration?</li>
            <li> , I think these little extras we can use to baby ourselves make all the difference.</li>
            <li> And a little too well.</li>
            <li> think the price could be a little lower.</li>
            <li> It has all these little holes in it, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> The diabetic in my household says hisbfeet are softer and less stiff.</li>
            <li> A little messy, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> These can be a little harsh.  </li>
            <li> It is less expensive than some of the other models on here, so I was worried I wasn&#x27;t paying enough for the quality I wanted.</li>
            <li> I always have to turn it off after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> When I have my spells of swelling, my feet literally go round, just like a latex glove that is blown up like a balloon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have trouble bending over in a chair to tie your shoes you might not like this one.</li>
            <li> Just a warning that it&#x27;s slightly heavy</li>
            <li> Received this product a few hours ago.</li>
            <li> I hope everyone reads this so they won&#x27;t waste their money.</li>
            <li> It work much worse than a $ 30.00 similar item I had a while ago.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste  your money.</li>
            <li> Had to pay shipping back that didn&#x27;t get refunded- not happy at all.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not strong, so there&#x27;s no splashing.</li>
            <li> Put some water in which immediately disappeared via a few small holes in the bottom of the tub.</li>
            <li> I am not sure either what the round strap thing is for, that was in the attachment bag.</li>
            <li> I have had 3 other foot baths all returned because they were way too shallow.</li>
            <li> Previously had a HomeMedics Brand Foot Spa, which was a complete waste of money - owning a HomeMedics brand is akin to owning a very expensive bucket.</li>
            <li> live in Minnesota and in a cold house...</li>
            <li> The foot bath vibrates a little and thats it!</li>
            <li> There is very little if any splash on floor even though I fill water to ankle level.</li>
            <li> I have in the past would heat my water and re-heat</li>
            <li> Two days after having used the unit and salts, I have no more swelling</li>
            <li> The bubble is not diffuse bubbles but one big bubble, it merely circulates the water, no spa effect.</li>
            <li> and I can tell that I am dealing with no cheap foot spa when I am using this!</li>
            <li> Larger feet may be difficult.</li>
            <li> I put a small dab of dish soap in and washed it out with a rag then rinsed it.</li>
            <li> Even though it says not to go past the fill line, I couldn&#x27;t see one.</li>
            <li> It has two small holes in the bottom of each foot section that provide bubbles.</li>
            <li> They are typical of Chinese made products-spelling errors and awkward sentences.</li>
            <li> But i was very disappointed it was dead on alive within less than 10 sec.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not great coming home to after a long day at work is a broken foot bath.</li>
            <li> Had ours on carpet rather than hard surface.  </li>
            <li> Then when it gets too cold, manually turn the heat back on.</li>
            <li> at least two to three times each time I do a soaking.  </li>
            <li> Another reviewers complaint that theirs is noisy may be one of the attachments, a removable wheel to roll your feet on that without weight on it will rattle.</li>
            <li> I recently developed fairly painful extensor tendonitis and a friend recommended using a foot spa to augment the ice therapy I was using to manage it.</li>
            <li> and I use it at least 20 -60 minutes a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just slow and couscous about my purchases.</li>
            <li> but the thick callous skin literally rubbed off with ease.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!)</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned in reviews, the directions are almost comically ridiculous.</li>
            <li> If this was an improvement then I&#x27;d hate to see the old rotating node.</li>
            <li> I quite like this foot bath, and like the other reviews I have found that it keeps the temperature up and even heats up cold water.</li>
            <li> The heating capacity is so weak that you don&#x27;t need to spend $68 plus another $15 shipping for it.</li>
            <li> instead of using the bungee type cord holder, (the cord actually wraps around the base)</li>
            <li> Worked for approximately three seconds on powerup before the vibrating function ceased to function.</li>
            <li> After she gets home from work, she puts her feet into the water and lets it heat up as it massages her tired toes.  </li>
            <li> for-instructions were poor</li>
            <li> Even the illustrations in the poorly written instructions do not match the product.  </li>
            <li> poor quality-</li>
            <li> you have tired, aching feet</li>
            <li> I need to use a foot bath quite often due to surgery gone bad.  </li>
            <li> and I usually keep a pitcher of cold water on hand to manage the temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried other cheaper foot baths and have been disappointed.</li>
            <li> The massage function doesn&#x27;t work at all, and the laughable instructions seem to be written for some other device, and badly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad, because otherwise the massager works well, but I&#x27;m going to have to toss it because the sound is so annoying, and it&#x27;s a really bad performance defect.</li>
            <li> I may have a bad unit where the vibrator is not securely installed??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The water pressure is very weak and considering the position of the holes</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not take any pictures before doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally got my money after needless emails and phone calls to Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> &quot; that are mostly useless.  </li>
            <li> &quot; that are mostly useless.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what the heck to do with the rubber gasket (instructions poor) but figured out to put it around the foot bath to grip while picking up!</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Mediocre at massaging vibration or water circulation.  </li>
            <li> The water jets and attachments are useless on both foot baths.</li>
            <li> It did have attachments as described, but they are completely useless.</li>
            <li> manual is useless.  </li>
            <li> accessories are useless, but the foot spa works well.</li>
            <li> The user manual is useless.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how difficult it would be to find one.</li>
            <li> The directions were vague.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry if you order this brand.  </li>
            <li> and I was quite disappointed to say the least when the water drained out onto the floor.  </li>
            <li> There are some useless attachments and the instructions are vague but the product is a HIT !</li>
            <li> looking forward to using out on the deck with cold water as well.</li>
            <li> ...unless your life is so boring, you want to deal with unavailable customer service people, you want a product that is missing parts</li>
            <li> then getting cold.  </li>
            <li> and I was unhappy with the item and returned it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t worry about the water getting cold on my clients anymore.</li>
            <li> It says this unit does not heat up the water, however, the heater will heat up cold water (not recommended).</li>

            <li> I was disappointed indeed for the price.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It was a great massager for about a week, and then started making the most horrible noise, as if an aircraft was taking off. I&#x27;m assuming that something in the motor is rubbing against another part in the massager. It&#x27;s too bad, because otherwise the massager works well, but I&#x27;m going to have to toss it because the sound is so annoying, and it&#x27;s a really bad performance defect.</li>
            <li> After reading numerous reviews on other foot bath / massage machines I chose this one. The extra money was well worth it and it heats water quickly. It is well constructed and the massage feature delivers a perfect level of vibration. My needs required water temps above 104 degrees for certain periods of time as a medical treatment. This machine will take water to 115 degrees and higher so you have to switch off the heat feature occasionally, however you can still massage while the water cools. Since the water heater works so well I would like to see future models equipped with a built in large dial temp gauge.</li>
            <li> Purchased in June 2013. It works great with Epsom salt, heating element is very strong - can heat a cold water. Love it and use it every week without any problems for the last 12 months with various Dr.Teal&#x27;s Epsom salt products. Bought a second massager last week and send it as a gift to my sister - she was very happy! Great quality product! Don&#x27;t forget to flash the massager with a fresh water for a few minutes after using it with Epsom salt (I just fill out the unit with warm fresh water and run it for 3 minutes at the highest switch set mode: bubbles/heater/massage). This will prevent cloaking the pump and heating element by the salt particles. Product update in May 2016: massager mode stop working after 3 year (total used it less then 50 times in last 3 years), other modes are working fine.</li>
            <li> The directions were non existent, but the heating element heats the water so warm I have turned it off and then back on again to rewarm the water.  I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> After extensive research into footbaths, I purchased this one because the reviews said it&#x27;s a bit deeper than others, and the water stays hot.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s deeper, but the water definately stays hot ... too hot sometimes, but better hot than cold!  You can just turn the heat off, and keep the massage part going.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this item, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> water got very  hot, needs some sort of control to adjust the heating element. The tub needs to a littler higher to catch splashes.</li>
            <li> I like that my big feet are comfortable and fully coverd in the bath.&lt;br /&gt;Most assuredly well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am using this to help rehab my hand since my physical therapy insurance has ended.  When it gets too hot to handle, I switch to the non-heat setting until it cools down, and then back to the heat setting until it gets too hot.  It would be great if the heat was adjustable, so this switching back and forth stuff could be avoided.  Otherwise, I like the unit.</li>
            <li> works great gets warm water even hotter!</li>
            <li> after doing some research on all the footbaths that are available on amazon, I finally decided to go with this one. It is the only footbath that will actually heat the water. After using it for over an hour the water is still hot and the vibrations and bubbles are really relaxing, just what I need after a 12 hour day on my feet.</li>
            <li> This definitely keeps the water hot, in fact it&#x27;s usually too hot. I have to turn the heater/pump on/off every few minutes to keep at a good temperature. Also, the vibration setting is sometimes very loud, and other times not very loud. Not sure if something is loose inside the unit causing the loud noise sometimes.</li>
            <li> Wonderful.  Feet feel awesome.</li>
            <li> This thing is a powerhouse. It&#x27;s not just a flimsy piece of plastic you pour water in, it&#x27;s a tank. The water jets are a nice feature too. This is the way to go when you need to treat yourself to a relaxing foot bath!</li>
            <li> was not for me but for my fiancee who is from China. They use these a lot over there for all kinds of ailments. There is a school of thought that believes that the foot is the pathway to all of the body&#x27;s organs , nerves and ills</li>
            <li> So this foot bath does get water hot (sometimes too hot for my wife)--that is the main reason I purchased it--and it does vibrate and produce a jet. My complaints with the product come from the quality. It seems cheap for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. According to the instructions, picture on amazon, and the picture on the box, the bath we received was built backwards. The control dial was on the side closest to the person using it, and the splash guard would only fit properly on the other side. In addition, the shape of the foot beds were opposite as well, rendering the splash guard unusable.&lt;br /&gt;2. The &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; attachments (three of them) were pretty ridiculous, and the only one I found remotely stimulating or worth using is the roller pin.&lt;br /&gt;3. You can&#x27;t use the bath with heat and vibration. That&#x27;s just not an option on the dial.&lt;br /&gt;4. There were strings of plastic from the molding still attached to the bottom of the foot beds.&lt;br /&gt;5. As others have mentioned in reviews, the directions are almost comically ridiculous. The illustrations didn&#x27;t match up with the bassakward bath I got, and the instructions were repetitive, full of grammar and spelling mistakes, and incomprehensible at times.&lt;br /&gt;6. I believe if you left the heat on the water would eventually boil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I was able to return mine. Unfortunately I did not take any pictures before doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all this being said, I&#x27;d still like to have a foot bath for my wife who is on her feet a lot for work. Can anyone recommend a decent product that is under ~$100. Every one I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon has very mixed reviews. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a birthday present for my fiance. The heat and massage functions work very nicely, and he really enjoyed giving his feet a nice, long soak! However, the craftsmanship seems a bit shoddy to me -- the splash guard doesn&#x27;t fit tightly on the unit - it&#x27;ll fall right off if you so much as poke it with your finger; there are no assembly instructions, so I had to read other reviews to figure out what the black band that comes with the unit is for (wrapping the cord up); and the foot pads, which don&#x27;t fit anywhere nicely, but rather just lie awkwardly on top of the little spikes at the bottom of the unit, seem to be completely useless. I was honestly embarrassed that I&#x27;d given this as a present when we were having so much difficulty putting it together. I&#x27;m relieved that the hot water and massage functions were enjoyable to him, but I know I could&#x27;ve found another foot bath with the same functions at a less expensive price.</li>
            <li> This is what I have been looking for and it does help. Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> This bath massager is all I wanted--cannot imagine how great it is, so soothing, so gentle, so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It has only used it once so far.  It has lived up to the description, the unit heats up (unlike others that are lukewarm) and stays heated for a decent amount of time.  The unit also has the capacity for men&#x27;s size feet.</li>
            <li> great item, good price! LOVE it for the heat. too hot? turn off the heat, and it cools down fast. turn it back on, and it heats again quickly. this unit is worth every cent. a very good buy! my sister, has had more than a few, I let her try this unit, and she ordered one for herself immediately, complaining the others just didn&#x27;t get hot. I have size 11.5 feet, and it will handle size 12 no problem. instead of using the bungee type cord holder, (the cord actually wraps around the base) I used it to hold up the edge of the towel I placed underneath to hold it at the top edges. you really don&#x27;t need it, but the first few times I wanted to see if there was any water spilt while using. there is none. looking forward to using out on the deck with cold water as well. easy to clean, say&#x27;s you can use oil and salts. I use salts, and after rinsing, I run it for a few minutes with clean water, and just wipe it down. it has a front cover to prevent splashing, but I don&#x27;t use it, it doesn&#x27;t splash, and gives easier access. lastly, the few little gizmos that you can plug into the middle really don&#x27;t do anything, unless you have an itch. amazon service?, impeccable as always.</li>
            <li> This thing gets so hot I always have to turn it off after a few minutes. I love it. Barely there bubbles, but who needs bubbles. It&#x27;s a perfect hot soaking tub. Period.</li>
            <li> Great product! Holds heat for hours. Could not ask for a better Foot Bath  at a more reasonable price. Forget the Bells and Whistles of the high end competitors.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a foot tub that maintained the heat. This product does that and more.This one actually heats up.</li>
            <li> Quickly shipped. Item was exactly as described. Very fair price.</li>
            <li> Actually, this was a little gift for my girlfriend, who is very attentive to her feet and likes to soak them to soften up and then remove calluses.  She was previously using a little bucket...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was delivered right on schedule, and several days before we left for an extended weekend on California&#x27;s central coast.  She took her new foot bath massager with us, of course, and I brought an extension cord.  Within an hour of our arrival and check-in she was sitting on the patio, overlooking the ocean, enjoying a nice late-afternoon soak with the help of a glass of wine.  She thought she was in Heaven...</li>
            <li> The footbath works great, keeps water heated and the massage modes work great.  It&#x27;s deep enough to hold plenty of water compared to other models that held just a couple inches of water before they overflowed during use.</li>
            <li> This is a simple product that just works very well.</li>
            <li> This is great for late nights after shooting a wedding! Feels amazing to soak sore, tired feet while the machine rumbles lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I do not like is that there is no way to set a temperature, so if you want heated water, eventually it is going to get way too hot and you will need to manually switch the heat off. Then when it gets too cold, manually turn the heat back on. Doesnt sound too obnoxious Im sure, but when you are trying to wind down and relax, its kind of a pain. Im sure adding a remote or a thermostat would really drive the price up, but at least a wired remote would be a great addition to this product.</li>
            <li> Does not look like the picture on Amazon but the model number is the same.  There is no blue strip with bubbles AT ALL.  There is one hole in the middle of each foot that they refer to as &amp;#34;waving&amp;#34; no bubble massage just moves water around.  Massage also refers to vibration, which is amazing.  The box and very pathetic manual does not use the word bubbles or vibration as description in Amazon.  I was ready to return it for false advertisement but reviews made me try it anyway.  The heater is amazingly hot,  only can keep it on for less than 5 min befor turning off and switch to vibrate only. The wave is a waste sure wish the blue line of bubbles was real and included but that was the only disappointment.</li>
            <li> Great value. The water stays nice and warm and the massage function is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This foot bath massager is just what I wanted. Delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li> This really heats the water, so fill it will tepid or lukewarm water to begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very effective and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my hubby to soften up those crusty feet!! lol.  He used it once.  I guess he likes it. He says it gets so hot that he feels like his feet are going to burn off.  But maybe some people like that. No issues with it thus far, well then again, it was only used once.</li>
            <li> ...unless your life is so boring, you want to deal with unavailable customer service people, you want a product that is missing parts AND they&#x27;ll try to cheat you out of the money you spent to have the item delivered to your house plus you have to pay return postage and then, if that&#x27;s NOT enough, they want to only give you $19.00 of your $94.00 back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen, if you want phony respect, go to a car dealership--at least you get to test drive a car for FREE.  Dealing directly with this company is a lesson in PATIENCE and will enable you to handle unnecessary STRESS over a long time period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally got my money after needless emails and phone calls to Amazon.  NEVER AGAIN will I deal with this company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer Beware</li>
            <li> It works as advertised.  It has multiple settings, and can heat water for you.  I am not crazy about the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; hardpoints on the base, but I use the rubber pads smooth side up, and no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with the tea -tree foot powder, having contracted a particularly nasty and stubborn foot fungus in Brazil.  My doctor actually suggested that I use full strength bleach for about a week and then use strong over the counter fungal preparations.  I tried bleach but it didn&#x27;t really seem to help. My doctor did not want me to use prescription medication, because it can be harmful to the liver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this and I find that a 30 minute soak daily softens the nails, and allows me to scrape out the thickend sections allowing the following day&#x27;s treatment to get deeper.  I have not solved the problem yet, but  my nails are noticeably thinner, and easier to manage.  I figure this will take a couple of months before it resolves itself...and by then, it&#x27;s back to Brazil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there are any deficiencies, you have to pour the water in and out - the front under the blue cover is a spout for pouring water out.  A little messy, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been 18 months now...and Tea Tree salt and foot bath have solved my problem.  Nails are normal looking. Although my doctor wanted me to try Bleach - I should thank him for not prescribing anti fungals that can cause other issues.  It just takes some persistance to get it done.</li>
            <li> Great product for my first try. Will update if any problems occur. Very fast delivery. Overall very relaxing and worth it. very easy cleaning and not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Water gets hot hot! Nice sturdy tub the massager not existent. So if u want a good sturdy tub that&#x27;s get hot this the one for you.</li>
            <li> My niece has had a year, medically, that thankfully not many people have to endure.  Because of where her brain tumor was, after the surgery it has affected her hormones and has had weight gain which has made her feet sore.  This was perfect and works well to relieve her aching feet. To help relieve one issue is a good thing!</li>
            <li> i got the product today and was excited to give it try right way. i followed the instruction step by step, pulled in warm water then plugged in. But i was very disappointed it was dead on alive within less than 10 sec.</li>
            <li> This foot bath keeps the water very hot and that&#x27;s a great thing.  The massage and vibrating functions are good too. I had a previous foot bath that didn&#x27;t heat up and it stunk. This one is great.</li>
            <li> Use it for ingrown toenail pain and nerve issues. Works very good with Epsom Salts. With heater it can get too hot. Main complaint is you have to keep turning the heat off every few minutes to keep from burning your feet. Bought this one because reviews of other massagers said the water never stayed warm very long.</li>
            <li> The Pibbs Foot Bath Massager has been wonderful.  I have a foot problem and soak them every third day.  I have in the past would heat my water and re-heat at least two to three times each time I do a soaking.  With the FM3830A I usually start off with a little warm water and the water gets a comfortable warm and remains at that temperature.  I now can set and read the newspaper or look at TV without getting up and down to re-heat my water.  It is a time saver for me and the massager is great.  I now have Happy Feet.</li>
            <li> product looked a little different than the box but delivered within the max days it said it would send.</li>
            <li> Received yesterday, used once, works well.  Unclear what the center attachments are for -- they are not controlled by the mechanism of the massager, so they just sit there and arent used.</li>
            <li> Happy with it.  I bought it for a foot soak so the snap on massaging accessories are kind of frivolous.</li>
            <li> Works very well for my purpose.  Just need to keep switching the heater part off so the water will not get too hot.  I am careful to not overfill it so there is no splashing to get water on the floor.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the results I got, when working with this one.  I have some issues with edema and especially in my feet, swelling, after working at my desk for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had gotten this one, because of the temperature setting, at it&#x27;s highest, is 110 degrees.  I also used some Teatree oil epsom salt bath, putting the salts in the water and letting them dissolve, before turning on the circulation pump.  No clogs and no issues, as I saw posted before, that they clogged theirs up on the first run.  Not an issue at all, if you let the salts dissolve in the hot water &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; turning on the circulation pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat of the water and the salts really helped me, a lot.  When I have my spells of swelling, my feet literally go round, just like a latex glove that is blown up like a balloon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this foot bath unit, with the Epsom salts for the feet, the very next morning, my swelling had gone down by 75%.  Two days after having used the unit and salts, I have no more swelling and I haven&#x27;t adjusted anything in my diet or my time working at my desk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made a huge difference for me, in reducing the swelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I bought this unit.  It is well made and designed, very easy to work with, has a long cord and is also quiet.  I put it to use, just sitting in my living room, watching a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend getting one of these, even if you just want to relax at the end of a hard day on your feet.  It really does help relieve the stress in your feet and the heat does wonders for doing your pedicure, also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next test case, my husband, who is a hard critic on any and everything.  Although, I must say, he was very impressed with the immediate improvement on the swelling going down in my feet, so fast.  That says a lot, especially, coming from him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best purchases I have made, so far.</li>
            <li> I filled it with cold water and in less than a minute, the water turned hot! Very impressive! Lover it!</li>
            <li> Awesome! We love this so much! Stays nice and hot and very relaxing after a hard day. My only complaint is that it didn&#x27;t come with any directions. I contacted the seller and they said they would contact the manufacturer to get me one but I still haven&#x27;t seen it. This would be not a big deal but it came with several components that I can&#x27;t find where or how to use them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a social salsa dancer, so I got this for myself as a birthday present to soothe my sore feet every week. My fiance and I have both tried it and we love it! It fits his size 13 feet, and it&#x27;s great to be able to control the temperature. My only complaint is that the heat setting makes it really hot really fast, so you can&#x27;t enjoy the jets setting for very long, as it is tied to the heat setting. But, you can choose vibration with or without heat, so it&#x27;s not a big deal. I guess the jets are just for circulating the heated water anyway. They&#x27;re not strong, so there&#x27;s no splashing. It&#x27;s not too loud, so we use it while watching movies sometimes.</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love! The directions say not ment to heat water, no it heats the water! Boy does it heat the water! I found it cheaper then on amazon. Worth every cent!</li>
            <li> I need to use a foot bath quite often due to surgery gone bad.  I am so very satisfied with this footbath as it heats and keeps the water quite warm.  I really can&#x27;t believe I found it!</li>
            <li> The best of the many I have tried. Even this one has too many unnecessary features. All that is necessary is for it to keep the water warm, and circulating. A tad pricey.</li>
            <li> Return-Path: blueflash@comcast.net&lt;br /&gt;Subject: Footbath&lt;br /&gt;From: Don Pomplun&lt;br /&gt;To: Don Pomplun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago I thought maybe my occasionally sore dogs needed some TLC.  Bought some Epsom salt at Walmart and dissolved some in hot tap water in an old Sterilite storage box.  Convinced myself it was beneficial but the water got cold quickly.  Had to scoop out a quart of cold and dump in a quart of hot. This got old quickly.  OK what&#x27;s Amazon got?  Read the comments on a number of footbaths. Main complaint was that even those that claimed to keep water hot, didn&#x27;t.  The Pibb was moderately endorsed as having real heating capability, so I ordered one.  Showed up today in typical Amazon quick style.  I was skeptical so I unpacked the bath and set it up on the kitchen counter for testing.  I connected it to a watt meter so I could see what &amp; if it could really heat. Here&#x27;s the results . . .&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are pretty useless (no surprise).  There is a 4 position switch: off; vibrating massage only; heat with water circulation only; and massage and water circulation heat.  The vibrate massage is nice.  The floor of the bath is rigid plastic points.  These can be a little harsh.  They include a pair of foot-shaped rubbery pads with points that are much softer.&lt;br /&gt;Heat &amp; water pump circulation always go together (as they have to so that you don&#x27;t get hot spots).  The sheet talks about Heat, Wave &amp; Massage. \\&quot;Wave\\&quot; is just water circulation.  My wattmeter shows that the heater is about 400 watts, a respectable amount!  I started the test with hot tap water (107 deg).  The heater easily kept the temperature up.  For Geeks who understand it, it uses a proportional controller for the heater.  It says you should start with hot water because it won&#x27;t heat the water. . . YES it will!  I dumped the hot water and filled it with cold tap water (72 deg). It took 25 minutes to get up to 110 deg before it shut off.  Note that you can&#x27;t adjust the temperature (I took it all apart expecting some adjustment on the circuit board, but there isn&#x27;t any).  110 is a pretty warm hot tub temperature!  Later when I started soaking in this, I was working up a sweat just sitting there.  So here I sit writing this, soaking with heat &amp; vibrate (and 1/4 cup of Epsom salts).

            <li> After 10 years of another brand, I finally found a footbath that I believed would work.  My other one leaked, never heated the water, had too many gadgets on it and was not comfortable to use.  I wanted one to keep the water warm, simple massage and a few inches deeper. Well this was the answer.  The other reviews convinced me and after using this once, they are correct.  When the water starts to cool, turn on setting 2.  There are only three setting but I only need what they have.  It cleans easily, deeper than others I have seen and it fits my size 12 feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing else to ask for out this.  I did not like the price but for footbaths, you do get what you pay for.  It is worth it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Great price! Keeps hot, vibrates and bubbles. No problem with water spilling. I use it in my living room on carpet. I just lay a towel out just in case. I&#x27;m also using additives like epsom salt and tea tree oil. I&#x27;ve only had it a week, so far it&#x27;s great. It does everything I wanted&lt;br /&gt;at a price I wanted.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Heats up extremely fast!!!!!</li>
            <li> You may see my questions listed on this board also but I got this product as a gift. We admittedly overfilled it the first time we used it, the water got very hot very fast (not all bad) but flooded my living room floor. We thought that we obviously had overfilled it, no big deal. emptied all the water put in the recommended two quarts (with a towel under this time) and I am not kidding water just leaked from this thing like it was meant to. There are holes where the feet are that leaked water and there are three holes in the middle of the tub that also leaked water. I would love to try this product again because it heated the water so well but I can&#x27;t wrap my head around a foot BATH that won&#x27;t hold even a cup of water.</li>
            <li> Definitely heats the water, had to let it cool a couple of times, only downfall is that the unit pictured is not the same color as the one shipped, other that this, it&#x27;s the best I come ac</li>
            <li> Quiet, keeps water warm, don&#x27;t start out with really hot water ... not necessary.  Love this foot bath ... little pricey, but worth it.  Didn&#x27;t know what the heck to do with the rubber gasket (instructions poor) but figured out to put it around the foot bath to grip while picking up!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who works on his feet up to 12-14 hours/day. I looked at the reviews of other foot spas, and many of them commented on the size being too small for men&#x27;s feet, and that any &amp;#34;heating&amp;#34; features will get the water lukewarm, at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither of those is a problem with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is plenty big for a man with size 11.5 feet, and the heater won&#x27;t just keep water lukewarm, it gets is really quite warm! It will warm water from cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The massager is also quite nice. It&#x27;s also kinda loud, but if you rest your feet fully on the bottom, it does mute it quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much more expensive than other spas I looked at, but so well worth it.</li>
            <li> My main reason for choosing this product was that it purported to keep the water hot, and it does that, which is why I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one. The massage function doesn&#x27;t work at all, and the laughable instructions seem to be written for some other device, and badly.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Package came unboxed with no closure tape. It also included a faux leather band which I have no idea what it&#x27;s purpose is. Quite honestly, the product looks used.</li>
            <li> Too hot, way too hot.  You have to manually turn it off when it gets warm or it burns you.  Then you have to turn it on when the water cools.  I don&#x27;t know if it has a thermostat, but if it does, it doesn&#x27;t work.  Cost was too much to return it so I have it to charity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a lot of foot baths and this product is great. It actually heats the water so no more foot dipping in quickly cooled water. If the water gets too warm, either remove your feet for a few minutes or turn the knob to &amp;#34;0&amp;#34;. My feet felt great after using this product. I really recommend this foot bath experience to anyone with sore, tired and/or achy feet.</li>
            <li> Good at heating water.  Mediocre at massaging vibration or water circulation.  Not sure why no one can make a good foot spa.</li>
            <li> Bubbles stopped working first season.</li>
            <li> It took me forever to choose the right one! Reading so many reviews! This one is a winner. It will keep water hot! Great vibration and swirl to water. The diabetic in my household says hisbfeet are softer and less stiff. Really helps his circulation. You may not know the brand name but go for it. It&#x27;s so worth it!😊</li>
            <li> Great product, multiple settings work well: heat-wave-massage. Good value; performance so far vs price. Heats water quickly and massage nice.</li>
            <li> No need to look any further, this is the one! Heats water, not just keeps warm. Very happy.</li>
            <li> this will get as hot as you want it to, i find myself having to cycle the heat off every now and then.  freaking LEGIT</li>
            <li> Another birthday gift for my wife.  She absolutely loves this thing.  I know people have complained about how quickly it heats and that it gets to hot.  Come on folks, lean over and turn the heat off when it gets hot, I mean really.  For the money, you can&#x27;t get better.  Believe me, I have tried with other product.  Thanks for a happy wife.</li>
            <li> Works great but it heats up too much so you have to take a break every so often to let the water cool down.</li>
            <li> works great. warms/heats up the water. a little loud but works well</li>
            <li> Yes, gets and stays hot!  Several ways to alleviate to much heat.  As others said, cycle the heat off and on, but I just lift my feet up for a few seconds, then put them back in and that works great for me.  I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> keeps water hot....if you put it in initially hot....works as advertised</li>
            <li> I have purchased so many Foot Spas and had to return them because they stated with heat.  No heat did I ever experience until this one.  I actually used it twice tonight.  The reason I decided to purchase this was because a posting stated his brow was starting to get hot.  Folks I could not believe it but it does get hot..........which is good because the hot water is really what makes your feet feel better.  Not hot then getting cold.  After using my feet bars after the soak, put them back in and turned it on again.  It got hot.  Then I turned off and put Coconut Oil on my feet.........I have finally found the item that does what it says.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but it was heaven when I used it.  The water was nice and warm, and the massage felt great.  I also didn&#x27;t have to worry about water splashing outside of the tub.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Vibration, heat and bubbles work very well. Feet do feel better after a half hour .</li>
            <li> This foot bath is awesome. The massage part is a little bit on the loud side but ok overall. Really good for relaxing after a long day&#x27;s work on your feet and then just soak your feet. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> this is great and heats up the water just perfect. you will really like it so try it. really enjoy it</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed in a massager!!  Keeps water hot, easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Good quality, did the job well, easy set up, my son loves it after being on his feet 10 hours a day.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent Foot Bath Massager! Previously had a HomeMedics Brand Foot Spa, which was a complete waste of money - owning a HomeMedics brand is akin to owning a very expensive bucket. This Massager costs about $30 more than the HomeMedics, but is well worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The Heater actually heats the water (unlike the HomeMedics models) - The heater works so well, you&#x27;ll have to turn it off because the water will get too hot!&lt;br /&gt;-Very good Massager Mode - the unit vibrates providing a very soothing experience.&lt;br /&gt;-Yes, you can add foot oil (i.e. Magnesium Oil), Epsom Salt, and whatever into the water. Most other brands (in fine print) will state that adding supplements to the water is NOT  recommended (which kind of defeats the purpose of owning a Foot Spa - you normally would want to add at a minimum Epsom Salt).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Pathetic instruction manual.&lt;br /&gt;-Bubble mode is pretty pathetic, however, the Massager Mode is what you&#x27;ll be using the most of any ways.&lt;br /&gt;-Wish it came with a handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an excellent Foot Bath Massager. Strongly recommended if you are in the market.  Stay clear of the HOMEMEDICS Foot Spa, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> One of the best foot massagers I have found. Like the jets feature and the different attachments to soothe the soles of the feet.</li>
            <li> Works perry good. My family loves it! The water will become hotter when the massage begin, so don&#x27;t put too hot water at the beginning or u may get burned.</li>
            <li> WARNING: costs twice as more reliable, better functioning NAME-brands (I thought if I spent more, I&#x27;d get more!); unit gets TOO HOT immediately; add-on doo-dads are ridiculous and useless--an inexplicably poorly designed product; instructions are absurdly inadequate (indeed, there ARE NO instructions on how or how much to fill the unit, what the knob settings represent, where several of the accessory pieces go, how to turn off the heat after it gets insanely hot within seconds, etc. etc.); there is no actual \\&quot;DRAIN\\&quot; outlet, though there is a plastic piece on the unit and reference to a \\&quot;DRAIN\\&quot; in one of the ridiculous and crude hand-drawn \\&quot;illustrations\\&quot; (as a potential customer, you might not believe this, but these \\&quot;illustrations\\&quot; are so poorly executed they are actually show the \\&quot;feet\\&quot; positioning UPSIDE-DOWN! In other words, if you went by the \\&quot;diagram,\\&quot; many people would actually have trouble getting their feet to fit in the unit! Unbelievable!)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this foot spa. I wanted to find a foot spa that actually heats the water and this unit works wonderfully. Like some reviews state it can get a little too hot but it takes no effort to turn the heat off for a minute to let the water cool. I&#x27;d rather have too much heat then not enough. The massager and water stream don&#x27;t work that well but I didn&#x27;t buy it for those features...I bought it for HEAT. If you&#x27;re looking for a foot spa that heats water and keeps it hot then I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a few weeks its started to rattle loudly where it sounds like the motor is located. Although I would of kept it even though it gets too hot, I will definitely be returning it now. Not looking froward to the task of a return at all. My original 4 star review is below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Minnesota and in a cold house... brrrr. I wanted a foot massager that would stay warm or hot for at least 30 minutes at at time this winter. This is like the 3 bears, this one gets too hot. If you have trouble bending over in a chair to tie your shoes you might not like this one. I am often (haven&#x27;t timed it) bending over to turn it to the first setting which is massage only without heat, in order to keep my feet from feeling a burn. I hope to get used to it or the heater to suffer with some aging but I am also concerned this could effect the durability of the motors. Otherwise this is a great machine and bending over occasionally is not a problem for me. But since it isn&#x27;t perfection therefore the 4 stars. Another reviewers complaint that theirs is noisy may be one of the attachments, a removable wheel to roll your feet on that without weight on it will rattle. I like the provided attachments and I believe the rubber foot pads are in case the plastic basin is too rough for you. I don&#x27;t have a clue what the rubber loop strap is for though? All in all I am happy I bought it as too hot is better for me than not hot enough.</li>
            <li> When the foot massager arrived I was super excited. I filled it up and... The water pours right back out! I checked the instructions, no mentionof putting anything together. Could not use it all. Then I had to return it. Amazon, I&#x27;m dissatisfied! It would have been great to have a replacement. I ordered it because I wanted it! Anyway a total waste.</li>
            <li> First time purchasing this type of product. Worked for approximately three seconds on powerup before the vibrating function ceased to function. Make sure you check them as soon as you buy them. I bought it for my girlfriend, and not thinking, stashed it for a week before giving it to her (reducing my return window) and obviously it didn&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;m giving it two stars because I got my money back- easy return process. Otherwise, my EXPERIENCE with this product would permit one star.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a bath massager locally but without a heater and I was unhappy with the item and returned it.  I researched and read the reviews for this bath massager and opted to give this item a try.  I have only used it twice so far but I like the fact that it keeps the water hot.  So I am able to enjoy relaxing my feet longer and without having to worry about the water getting cold or having to empty the water and then refill with hot water again.  I just have to be careful not to burn myself because the water can get very hot.  Several attachments were included but I do not see a need for these.</li>
            <li> i like it !&lt;br /&gt;it keep warm the water.  but u need to turn off the swtich often otherwise ur feet gonna get burn. \&lt;br /&gt;2nd of all, the massage part is ok .. not that good as we want .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but still,  if u want ur feet relax ... get it</li>
            <li> My wife loves this thing except it needs a bit more vibration and it does get too hot too fast other than that it is great</li>
            <li> Very nice  size. But it heated  the water to exceed warm  it could  burn</li>
            <li> Use this all the time! My first one had a leaking issue but they replaced it in no time flat. Makes my feet feel great after a long week.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Heats water quickly.  Heat can be turned on / off as needed.  Instructions do not provide an expanation for the &amp;#34;black cord&amp;#34; that comes with the unit.  It is to hold the electrical cord in place when  product is not in use &amp; cord is wrapped for storage on the base of the unit.</li>
            <li> The heater is great, almost too great it really keeps the water warm. Sometimes have to turn heat off, or add an ice cube or 2.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift and have enjoyed using it 3-4 times a week ever since. After a long day, soaking my feet in hot water feels like heaven. Its great for cold nights, and warms me up. This was the only foot bath I could find that actually heats the water, in addition to circulating it and massaging. Most just circulate hot water, but they won&#x27;t actually keep it hot. The water does get quite hot, so I have to turn it off to let it cool for a bit every once in a while. Was worth the price and has held up well for the last 2 months.</li>
            <li> Gets plenty hot in a short time. I&#x27;ve used it 10+ times now. I cycle it between 3 (Heat and Massage) and 1 (Massage) to keep the temperature where I want it. No complaints. I don&#x27;t find the &#x27;attachments&#x27; to be very handy. The large rubberband is for retaining the power cord wrapped around the &#x27;feet&#x27;. I use it with epsom salt every time, no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Vibrates and jets circulates the water. Feet feel rejuvinated after using it. There is no fill line which would take the guessing out of how much water to put in. Water does get hot but I just turn it to the vibrate only function. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tub!  Truly heats the water.  I had to turn off the heat at one point because it works so well!  Love it!</li>
            <li> The foot bath vibrations are quite intense, so if you have neuropathy you may not be able to tolerate it.  The nubs in the bottom are very pronounced, I covered with the liner that was included, but it continually slides out of place.  The bubble is not diffuse bubbles but one big bubble, it merely circulates the water, no spa effect. The heat element gets the water very warm, I found I had to put cool water in and let it heat up.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> This footbath is worth the money. I do not like to a lot of money on items like this, but my husband works on his feet al day and deserved something to alleviate his foot pain. The water gets hot (if you want it to, there is an option to just use the vibration), the vibrations are like heaven and the nubbins on the bottom and the rolly thing are wonderful. There are a couple attachments I haven&#x27;t really used, but I don&#x27;t think they were part of the high price tag anyway. I put it under our computer desk and it soothes my feet as I work or play. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is probably the BEST foot bath for the money. It&#x27;s commercial grade and works great so far. I earned major brownie points for getting this for my wife for her birthday. She is on her feet all day and this foot spa really helps sooth her achy feet. Loosed a star for the following reasons; A:It&#x27;s made in China. B: The instructions are not very helpful and are written in &#x27;Engrish&#x27;. C: Amazon bundled this with the tea tree salts when clearly the manufacturer does not recommend using any additives in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than those points this is a definite buy!</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom&#x27;s birthday present! I was looking for a foot bath that would keep the water hot because a lot of reviews on different foot bath massagers said that they didn&#x27;t hold the heat. this one does just that and sometimes the water gets a little too hot! Great product I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this foot bath over others because of the reviews. They were correct. This is a nice quiet foot bath that truly heats up nicely. There are some useless attachments and the instructions are vague but the product is a HIT !</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she loves it.  It DOES heat the water and that&#x27;s really all I wanted.  It&#x27;s a nice size, not too bad to handle, even full of water.</li>
            <li> The heat was a nice option but when it gets to hot the only other option is the massage which means vibrates.That option is not only very noisy but pretty much nauseating. I decided to return it and order Brookstone footbath once it becomes to warm there is a nice jets option.</li>
            <li> great, easy to use foot bath.  The water heats very quickly and stays hot.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband, he loves it.  Heats the water great, stays warm for a long time.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have lots of foot problems - achilles tendon transfer surgery and plantars fasciitis.  After 15 minutes with the foot massager my feet feel great.</li>
            <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Water heats up pretty fast and maintain a good hot temperature.&lt;br /&gt;And this is the key factor for my purchase decision on this product, so satisfied on this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Very loud if you leave the massage feature on.</li>
            <li> Very nice, keeps water nicely warm as long as needed. The water massage is so relaxing.  Just a warning that it&#x27;s slightly heavy, I&#x27;m elderly, but manageable for me.</li>
            <li> Received this product a few hours ago. Put some water in which immediately disappeared via a few small holes in the bottom of the tub. I thought I had put too much in, but all the water drained not just a portion. Whatever, duct tape will fix this and it did. Plug in and decide to feel the water temp before turning it on and receive a little shock. Probably just defective, but I&#x27;m pretty disappointed as I shopped around a long time before settling on this foot bath. Hopefully the return process isn&#x27;t too painful.</li>
            <li> Not so good.  Returned item</li>
            <li> Love this,  It stays warm and doesnt get cold like other ones that I used.</li>
            <li> I have the worst feet ever.  Gross.  Callused.  Dry.  Yucky.  This foot bath is heavenly.  It is as described, no failed expectations.  It does get a bit hot, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for Grandma if she has diabetes and/or poor circulation, but with the toe touch controls you can easily flip the heat on and off to keep it more temperate.  This is the best if you are on your feet all the time like I am, but anyone would appreciate the luxury of having something like this!</li>
            <li> After searching for numerous products online, I finally chose this one, and it turns out that my choice is right! The massager does heat the water, it provides me with high quality massage. i LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> I have to write a review on this product as I like this product very much. I have been using it for a month now. I use it almost every day. Water can stay HOT. Just what I was looking for. I give 4 stars because the manul  doesn&#x27;t really do its job. It doesn&#x27;t tell me how I can install these accessaries.</li>
            <li> This new model runs too hot.  The unit can only run for 5 minutes before the water is heated too hot and you have to add cold water.  Not very safe for use in a professional spa environment.</li>
            <li> This product was awesome until my fiancée&#x27;s stupid f***ing dog chewed up the cord. So just know, the cord is not dog proof, but it makes your feet feel great after a long day at work. What&#x27;s not great coming home to after a long day at work is a broken foot bath.</li>
            <li> crap!!!. its nice to know that the water gets hot, the drawback is that it cannot be controlled, damn near boils my feet.</li>
            <li> This foot bath is worth every penny.  It is very relaxing and the water does get hot.  The wave action feature does hum a lot, but not to interfere with TV watching, etc.  I would recommend this foot bath to anyone that is looking for a good product.  The only downside is the instruction booklet is not informative.  All in all I give it a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife and she is extremely happy with the foot bath. It does heat the water and it works as described. Shipping was excellent and it arrived in perfect condition. Thank you for a great product and service</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying out this product and I was quite disappointed to say the least when the water drained out onto the floor.  Other reviews helped me determine that this was a production defect and other&#x27; s who replaced theirs did not have the same problem.  The ease of returning the item to Amazon lessened my frustration.  Not dure yet if I will order another one.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter in law in USA so I haven&#x27;t seen it but she is pleased with it as she is on her feet a lot in her profession</li>
            <li> Water gets very hot; massage attachments are useless; instructions non-existent internet or in the box!</li>
            <li> Foot massager was a gift for my son-in-law. Uses it all the time.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> Finally found a foot bath that keeps the water warm!</li>
            <li> This has a great heater that quickly returns water to appropriate soaking temperature.  Only complaint is that it is a bit shallow to get a full ankle soak.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the positive reviews.  I do not know what everyone is happy about. The foot bath vibrates a little and thats it! $80+ just to have a little vibration? I like something else going on for that kind of money.  The vendor I purchased this from will not take it back for ANY reason. I have purchased a different company&#x27;s product for half the price with twice the massage effect. Thank you Pibbs company and UglyNBeauty for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;4/23/13 Update.  My foot bath just sits in the garage collecting dust. Not worth the effort of using it. I cant even give it away! I hope everyone reads this so they won&#x27;t waste their money.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife for Xmas. She used it twice I think. Didn&#x27;t get very hot. Sitting in my closet collecting dust. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend get a spa day instead.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I work 12 hour shifts and standing all the time on concrete flooring.  I have a rubber mat and insoles, but the only thing that really works is this bath.  The water gets super hot and the variations of vibrate and heat are on point.  I put soothing rock salts in mine and relax until my feet prune and I am ready for the next shift.  Bottom line, I would totally recommend this to any poor sole who works on there feet all day.</li>
            <li> Nice purchase.. i have had a few different kinds in the past,but this is by far the best for the $$$$.&lt;br /&gt;One of my concerns was the water staying warm.(it does) My other concern was adding epsom salts or oils to the water. I have used both several times,and have had no problems with the unit...i would buy again!!!!!</li>
            <li> I returned this item after only one-time use. The heating capacity is so weak that you don&#x27;t need to spend $68 plus another $15 shipping for it. And, according to amazon.com policy, you have to pay 20% re-stocking fee. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS ITEM!!</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this foot spa. I am a licensed nail tech, and use it for my at home clients. You must know, that the unit gets HOT. Frankly, I&#x27;m so pleased to find a spa that actually heats, that I don&#x27;t mind. I just feel the water constantly, and ask my clients to let me know if it gets too warm. Obviously, it would be ideal that it would not get unreasonably hot, but I&#x27;ve yet to find another foot spa that actually keeps water warm, let alone increases the temperature. I don&#x27;t worry about the water getting cold on my clients anymore.</li>
            <li> This product did everything it said (in the description) that it would do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Keeps water warm,&lt;br /&gt;2) Vibrates/massages,&lt;br /&gt;3) Create Bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is we, consumers - were hoping it did what we have encountered personally, like the Foot Massage that comes with the Pedicure Chairs at the local Spa which have WATER JETS that exfoliates your feet (lol)....but I looked up the price of those and they are in the thousand dollar range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - again, the PIBBS Foot Massager FM3830A does &amp;#34;EXACTLY&amp;#34; what it says it will do, my wife and my own expectations were not met because we are looking for something this &amp;#34;good deal&amp;#34; does not do or deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - if you are reading this, please note that it does EXACTLY what the product description says just not at the STRENGTH or DESIRE we want.  But overall - we are KEEPING IT as I had noted above, it does what it says and we are happy with just that - since we are not going pay a thousand plus for the Pedicure Chairs with Foot/Body massage.  Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the service from Amazon and it&#x27;s vendors, well - we are VERY VERY happy with the SERVICE - arrived &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; Christmas 2012 which was a challenge considering a huge or several huge Winter Weather systems which cancelled many flights in the Midwest and Northeast affecting shipments for the Holidays.  But this really speaks to Amazon and the infrastructure they&#x27;ve built - PRETTY EFFICIENT, actually, the MOST EFFICIENT of any Online Retailer.  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Truly a piece of junk. Save your money. Nothing with the exception of its ability to heat water works as described. The &#x27;bubbles&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;vibration&amp;#34; are a joke. You&#x27;re better off and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper to fill a bucket with warm water from the tap and add some epsom salts.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my osteoarthritis for for my feet and the only machine that keeps the water warm. Well worth the extra money. However, the splash guard broke when it fell on the floor.  How can I get a replacement?</li>
            <li> works great for the price. I am suprised by how nice this little guy is. Do not expect a spa quality foot bath however for the price and size i feel it delivers big comfort</li>
            <li> This thing gets very hot and the vibration is a nice feature. My pregnant wife loves it after a long day on her feet</li>
            <li> If you have had a hard day where you are always on your feet this foot bath really does the trick.  It has many different settings for keeping your feet warm, massaged and just overall feeling good.  My suggestion buy this its worth it.</li>
            <li> I only used it twice but it&#x27;s very comfortable&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to clean and keeps the water nice n hot</li>
            <li> Soooo relaxing. I&#x27;m glad I trusted the other good reviews and ordered this. The water really does stay hot, and that was very important to me because I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the aggravation of having to pour in more hot water after ten minutes. You do need to pour in warm water to begin with, but that isn&#x27;t too hard. I have an electric kettle that boils water in 2 minutes. I mix the boiling water with double its amount in cold water and end up with perfect warm water. Then my footbath keeps it hot as long as I want. It actually got so toasty that I turned it down for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bubbling action is pretty weak, but I don&#x27;t really like tons of bubbles. What is strong is the heat and the vibration. Couple those with the foot stimulating nodes and vibration, and I&#x27;m a happy customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with removable rubber foot pads but since I&#x27;m the only one who will be using it and I like strong stimulation, I&#x27;m not using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does come with some odd attachments. They attach to a groove above the water level so you can rub your feet on them, but they don&#x27;t rub you, on their own, in the water.  It would be great if they would, but I can image the machine would be more likely to break or cost $500 if it had that many moving parts. That said, one of the attachments is a nubby wheel you can rub your feet on that is LOVELY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought this foot bath. It feels like it is well-made, not cheap plastic junk, and I think I will be using it happily for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life can be so stressful, I think these little extras we can use to baby ourselves make all the difference.</li>
            <li> looks normal ~ but works great ! make water really hot  which is good .</li>
            <li> Came fast and just as expected.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased [[ASIN:B0043494XS Conair Fb52 Hydrotherapy Massaging Foot Spa]] and it did not maintain warm water but for 5 minutes at the most. Best thing about that unit is it&#x27;s price $36. However, I love the Pibbs unit, it maintains warm water. It says this unit does not heat up the water, however, the heater will heat up cold water (not recommended). This foot bath has a deeper tub than the Conair. I only use the heater for a few minutes when I feel that the water is getting cold, cause the heater heats the water and gets too hot. So I adjust the control to vibrate only. It&#x27;s a lot less noisy than the Conair foot bath. The water jets and attachments are useless on both foot baths. This unit cost $50 more than the Conair, but it&#x27;s worth it if you plan to soak your feet for 15-30 minutes. I would recommend this foot bath to a friend.</li>
            <li> I was very optimistic about this purchase but during the first use, it began to cease vibrating and the water leaked from the control button the entire time. I was disappointed indeed for the price. It does get hot and you have to keep turning it off so it doesn&#x27;t get too hot. The water coming from the controls made me feel unsafe. I did not send it back, I never send anything back. I&#x27;m just slow and couscous about my purchases. This one was a mistake for me.</li>
            <li> gets nice and hot, but no bubble action, for the price I would expect bubbly goodness</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product.  After she gets home from work, she puts her feet into the water and lets it heat up as it massages her tired toes.  She is not thankful enough for this wonderful Christmas gift.  Thanks to Pibbs for the foot bath.</li>
            <li> Love my new foot bath even though it could have more vibration it hold the heat very well and almost too well cause occasionally I have to turn it down but that&#x27;s okay. I wish the top was attached as it is kinda loose but overall is a decent buy but too expensive in my opinion. There is so much competition that it could be cheaper very easily. I would reccomend it though.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from my husband, and this is certainly in the top 3 of my favorite gifts from him, ever. I love how hot it gets- I have a high tolerance to heat- and it is a wonderful relief after standing and walking literally all day. I don&#x27;t think I have ever relaxed this well uninebriated! I use Avon footworks foot soak with it, and I just switch it to vibrate occasionally (or seek assistance from a bypassing husband).</li>
            <li> I recently developed fairly painful extensor tendonitis and a friend recommended using a foot spa to augment the ice therapy I was using to manage it. A little research dug up the fact that this spa was one of a few that would actually heat the water - and that is something I can attest to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, what you get:&lt;br /&gt;The spa itself, a blue splash guard, a pair of small knobbed massage inserts, three massage attachments, instruction booklet and a wrap around drip guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operation of the spa is fairly easy (which is good because the included instruction manual is worthless). There are four settings: Off, vibrate with heat, water massage with heat, and all three. The vibrate feature is pleasant and not too strong. The water massage is a bit weak, but again pleasant. When it comes to heating the water, this thing rocks! Be sure to only fill it with luke-warm to warm water and I usually keep a pitcher of cold water on hand to manage the temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The massage attachments attach to the center of the spa and you can run your feet over them to work on any problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foot beds are knobbed with short hard nibs or you can use the included knobby inserts which are much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord can be wrapped around the rubber feet for easy storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last word: If this foot spa didn&#x27;t heat the water so well, I&#x27;d rate it at 4 stars. As it is, you have to be careful not to let the water get too hot.</li>
            <li> Would give this item a zero rating if I could.  This product did not do what it said it would do. Described as having a \\&quot;Newly designed rotating node\\&quot;. If this was an improvement then I&#x27;d hate to see the old rotating node. Described as a \\&quot;footbath massager\\&quot;. Well it was a footbath, but a \\&quot;massager\\&quot;? No massage was apparent unless they are referring to the weak \\&quot;vibrations\\&quot; and slight wave movement.  Also described as having a \\&quot;strong bubbling effect\\&quot;. Mine had no bubbling on the left side and very weak bubbling on the right side. Don&#x27;t know if the heater actually worked as the water only stayed at room temperature. It did have attachments as described, but they are completely useless. Luckily I purchased through Amazo.</li>
            <li> Very nice foot bath.  Certainly keeps water hot.  Do need to let water cool off after awhile as the heater keeps on heating.  Instructions are worthless.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up and use.  Just watch the water temp.  Can get a little to hot.  I put Epson salts in the water.</li>
            <li> Honestly, if you want a nice little tub to soak your feet in with a heater, this works. I would not buy it again. If the price were half what I paid, then perhaps. The instructions are pathetic and the image showing the control knob looks nothing like what I received. There is an oversized rubber loop that came with it. I had no idea what it was for but on reading these reviews discovered it is for the cord. I wanted something to massage my feet. This thing is far from a massage device. It shakes the water up and it does heat up nicely. Great foot bath. Massager .... uh, no. By the way, the picture of the unit as shown here ... it does not include the control knob. Oh, and the water gets hot. Really hot. My foot is a 10 1/2. I think 12 is the max on this unit and perhaps 11 1/2 at best.</li>
            <li> it gets hot FAST so we have to turn the heat off and on lol i wish it would have the ability to do vibration and bubbles without heat. but nonetheless i love it. i got one for my husband and myself and we both love it. remember to fill with luke warm water or even cold water because the heat is powerful haha.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it heats the water, does get alittle to hot but changing the settings for a few minutes fixes that.Works very well!</li>
            <li> the item came as advertised. my only gripe of sorts is that while easy to figure out how to use, better instructions are needed. I have , what I think is to to be used as some sort of drip guard? there is a rope?, could be a gasket?</li>
            <li> Return policy is a joke.  Don&#x27;t buy this unless you know 100% that you&#x27;ll like it.  I didn&#x27;t it just feels like warm water on your feet nothing else, if you want an actual massage then don&#x27;t get this from them or you&#x27;ll end up with unit collecting dust.  Also in the box they have a return policy that says you can return it, but then you try and they say it can&#x27;t be returned even if it wasn&#x27;t used.  Not sure what kind of crap policy this is, but beware of UglyNBeauty as I&#x27;ve never had a problem returning items with Amazon.</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift for my daughter.  I read ALL the reviews prior to purchase, and did a thorough product search before purchasing this PIBBS Foot Bath Massager.  The product came packaged ONLY in the original product box, with no extra outer box.  A crushed box corner was a concern, but unit was undamaged.  Strong plastic odor, but otherwise a sturdy unit.  Read directions front to back, completely.  Directions failed to specify how much water to use with unit, so we judged.  Directions also did not say how to clean unit, so I went by others&#x27; reviews.  We used lukewarm water to start, and kept a close watch on the temp.  When the water started feeling &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;, we turned the knob to massage mode only.  This unit BURNED my daughter&#x27;s feet!  They were red for about an hour, then they SWELLED up like balloons for a whole DAY!  My daughter has no health problems to factor in, so it could only be from the unit....the water never felt to the touch of my hand to be that hot.  We wanted to love this unit, but unfortunately, people need to be aware of what can happen to the most careful of users.</li>
            <li> This foot bath massager does everything advertised.&lt;br /&gt;My eighty five year father loves it.&lt;br /&gt;He says his feet havn,t felt this good in years.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift, the receiver is enjoying it! I am not the one using it so I don&#x27;t have a specific comment about the product.</li>
            <li> Bought this a group gift for our friend, who loves it. She says it keeps it&#x27;s temperature and that&#x27;s what she wanted.</li>
            <li> Love this foot bath.  Water stays hot all the time.</li>
            <li> box was damaged when it arrived-unit works decently but there is a black piece of tubing? and instructions do not say what it is for-instructions were poor</li>
            <li> manual is useless.  accessories are useless, but the foot spa works well.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic.  It does tend to get too hot, but I just turn the heat off for a few minutes when it gets too much.  I use epsom salts in it.  I have had this for about 9 months.  Just to give an idea about durability, I had a finished basement, plus tons of stuff stored down there.  My area got hit with record rains and the city&#x27;s storm system backed up for the first time ever.  I had 3 feet of water in my basement.  I lost absolutely everything, except for this footbath.  This was the only item I was able to salvage and it works as good as the day I got it.  I was very impressed.</li>
            <li> This is great and it does get hot.  I&#x27;m using it several days a week with epsom salts and my restless leg syndrom has vanished.  The user manual is useless.</li>
            <li> Loves it. Using it a lot. Most concern for these tubs is they will not hold the heat. This one does. And a little too well. I have to turn the heat on from time to time to avoid overheating...</li>
            <li> Finally, a foot spa that actually heats the water. It&#x27;ll heat up cold water. You willl probably need to turn off the heater from time to time or you&#x27;ll burn yourself. The massager isn&#x27;t that great, but it&#x27;s big and makes a great hot soaker.</li>
            <li> Great foot bath.  Simple and easy to use.  Love the different switch settings and the vibrations and the nodes. It get room temperature water hot in 10-15 mins which I don&#x27;t mind waiting.  I soak my feet in Epsom salt water almost everyday (for 2 months now) and it is still working fine. The removable cover is not even needed, since the water doesn&#x27;t splash at all.  Definitely recommend this foot bath, especially to people with foot pain with tendonitis like mine.</li>
            <li> after reading all the reviews i was worreid about getting a footbath on Amazon. the cheap ones didnt seem to work well and the ones that worked well seemd really expensive. Then i stumbled on this one. Which is about in the middle of the price range. The heating coil works *very* well and the massage function is nice. Its got little plastic massage nubs on the bottom of the tub which are hard, smaller rubberized ones can be inserted which are softer, or you can flip the inserts upside down to have no little nubs at all. Seriously a great investment. i highly recommend it. The only thing i&#x27;d like is if it were a few inches deeper, the top of the tub is about level with my ankles, i&#x27;d like to have my feet a little more &amp;#34;in&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom, while she has only used it once, she loves it.  I showed how use it and I came back 2 hours later and she was still using it, and didn&#x27;t want to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked her, how did she want me to rate the machine and she stated that she absolutely loves it.  If anything should change I will keep you posted.  Thus far so far so good.</li>
            <li> Feels like I am at a spa. I purchased this for my wife and now I love it!</li>
            <li> I have used other foot massagers, but this one feels better. Not as noisy as my last one. Definitely a thumbs up and delivery was sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> I have had cheaper foot spas before and I can tell that I am dealing with no cheap foot spa when I am using this! I know that it is expensive-but you won&#x27;t regret it. Every part of this foot bath is relaxing, works, and is non-annoying.  Serious-get one!</li>
            <li> Pure joy to soak my feet in this. It has nice massaging action and keeps the water toasty warm - actually, it can get too toasty warm if you keep the heating setting on for too long. But going back and forth between warm &amp; massage to just massage and back again as needed keeps the water at a perfect temp. Best if you start with warm water, as it can take a while to warm up if you start with cold. I&#x27;ve seen some reviews that say it&#x27;s a tight squeeze for those with larger feet. I can&#x27;t say, as I have plenty of room. But then, my feet are a size 6. I also have plantar fasciitis and this foot bath provides a huge relief on a bad day. Absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This product has 3 settings that can be adjusted with one knob which is located in the front of the devise.&lt;br /&gt;when you put it on setting 1, it only vibrates and doesn&#x27;t heat up the water.&lt;br /&gt;setting 2, the water jet and the heater turn on.&lt;br /&gt;setting 3 , all three functions, vibration, water jet and heater work simultaneously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the vibration is fairly good ,  the water jet is just a joke. there are two holes ,one for each foot and they are located on the side very close to the center of the devise. The water pressure is very weak and considering the position of the holes you pretty much won&#x27;t feel anything. The devise also comes with two rubber insoles that you are supposed to put them inside and rest your feet on, however, these pads don&#x27;t fit really well and keep blocking those holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more important is the heater, even if you put ice water inside, it turns hot in a matter of minute and after 5-10 minutes good luck keeping your feet inside. I almost burned myself and imagine if someone is diabetic or don&#x27;t have good sensation in the feet there&#x27;s a good chance that they will suffer severe burns. There is no temperature control and all you can do is switching back and and forth to setting 1 in order to maintain the water temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the devise is ok , I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth a price.</li>
            <li> ... the one pictured is not the one I received.  When you get the box, the picture on it is not the same as the unit inside.  Even the illustrations in the poorly written instructions do not match the product.  The footbath massager itself works great.  Water gets hot quickly.  Don&#x27;t leave the heater on too long or you will burn your feet.  There are several attachments included, but some of them either don&#x27;t fit or don&#x27;t have a function.  I think the vendor just threw them into the box to make it look like it comes with many options.  For the price, I cannot complain since it works the way it&#x27;s supposed to.  But it&#x27;s definitely not one model as shown.</li>
            <li> Works great, love it. It heats the water and massages my feet for a long as I want. This one replaces an older one that only massaged and said it would maintain heat, but never did.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and as described</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for tired achy feet and it works to relieve arthritis, too.  I have arthritis in my knee and a good foot soak always makes my knee feel better, as well.  Excellent quality material and well made.  Should be able to enjoy this for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is what I was looking for.  It stays heated for a Therapeutic experience and you can add salts to it.  I didn&#x27;t know how difficult it would be to find one.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my father for his birthday. He loves it. It helps his feet tremendously. He says the water stays very hot.</li>
            <li> I walk several miles daily for work in dress shoes. Feet are very sore at end of day. This massage foot bath is perfect to restore my size 12 feet after a Eight hour shift. The machine will heat lukewarm water to nearly scalding within 5 minutes. The sound is noticeable, especially with the massage function on, but not overwhelming. There is very little if any splash on floor even though I fill water to ankle level. Size 12 men&#x27;s is a comfortable fit. Larger feet may be difficult. The box it is packed in states &amp;#34;for professional use only&amp;#34; This machine definitely fits that description. It does work as advertised. I am very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Instructions did not include how to assemble attachments or even what the attachments are for. Either way it made a useful gift as a heated foot spa.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best foot bath on the market it will heat the water unlike most that i have tried. Its also quiet and does not make a mess like others. Its definitely worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I am a teacher on my feet, running around my classroom all day. I&#x27;ve been in the market for a foot bath that heats and massages well. After reading reviews for cheaper products, I decided to pass and spend a little more on the Pibbs fm3830a. Although there were only a handful of reviews, I took a gamble and spent the extra $ 30 bucks. I am glad I did! I just took it out of the box and filled it with warm water. In less than 5 minutes, the water was HOT! ( 112 F, to be exact). It had 3 settings- 1&#x3D;massage only, 2&#x3D; heat and waves and 3&#x3D; heat, waves and massage. After 15 minutes on setting 3, it became too hot and I put it on setting 1 to cool off, but still massage. I love it!! I just got it, so I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up over time, but it seems durable. I also have size 10 feet and I have plenty of room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 3 attachments that fit in the middle of the bath to give an individual foot a massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the instructions, the product is made in china. They are typical of Chinese made products-spelling errors and awkward sentences. However, one shouldn&#x27;t need instructions to figure out what goes where. The rope/ gasket thing another reviewer mentioned seems to be a faux leather drip guard that wraps around the perimeter of the bath, in the event that water splashes on the edge. Probably not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly reccommed this product!</li>
            <li> I quite like this foot bath, and like the other reviews I have found that it keeps the temperature up and even heats up cold water. The only issue I have found with it is that after a while the water is too hot for my comfort so i have to keep alternating back to the massage and no heat setting when the water is too warm. That being said overall I&#x27;m glad I bought it and it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to receiving this product. The excitement did not last long. After unpacking and trying it out, I was very disappointed with the product. It work much worse than a $ 30.00 similar item I had a while ago. I contacted Amazon.com about not being happy about the product and received no response from them at all. After travelling for work for more than a month, I&lt;br /&gt;once again contacted  Amazon.com and on line chatted with someone in India. It is very frustrating to deal with a customer service rep who does not answer your questions directly or when you ask three questions, you get one answer and have to constantly ask the same thing over and over. They filed a claim and then advised that the seller is not willing to refund because their policy says the product has to be in the original packing and not used. Well how can you tell if you have a bogus product if you dont use it. Am very disappointed with the product and the service of Amazon.com Do yourself a favor, buy a different product and then go to another website and buy it.</li>
            <li> I expected better heat and massage Based on other reviews.  Not bad but not great.  Also, it should be deeper.  My size 12s make it hard to put in enough water to cover the top of my feet.  I don&#x27;t hate it and will probably use it more, but in the future, I think spending more on a really good one is the plan.</li>
            <li> We did research on the different footbath models.This one had very secure reviews, and we choose it.The Pibbs Footbath Massager is WONDERFUL!!It massages &amp; keeps the water heated!!We are totally pleased with this product,&amp; wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This foot bath works perfectly.  The vibration feels good and the bath maintains the water at exactly the right temperature.  Perfect for soaking your tired feet while reading a book or watching television.  A nice glass of wine is the perfect optional enhancement.  The rotating node with attachments is unnecessary as far as I am concerned, but some may like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Purchased after looking at several models both in store and on-line.  It had all the features I was looking for and the wife loves it as well.</li>
            <li> Works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gets too hot, have to switch heat on and off to avoid getting burned, but that &#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> It is less expensive than some of the other models on here, so I was worried I wasn&#x27;t paying enough for the quality I wanted. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the massager does absolutely everything it guarantees. It heats up the water rapidly, and the massaging points on the foot pads feel wonderful. It heats up the water SO well that you will likely have to turn it off at some point to let it cool down, and even THAT (i.e. just soaking your feet in the tub) feels great! I use it almost every night and hope I will not wear it out! Great product!</li>
            <li> I had the original Clairol Foot Fixer from the 1980&#x27;s.  I used it for many years until it finally, recently gave way!  Now I was faced with shopping anew, but with the added luxury of shopping online and reading reviews.  My selection of the PIBBS  Foot Bath Massager is exactly the replacement I needed.  It not only maintains heat, but generates it to the point that I turn it on and off again for extended soaking times.  The basin is deep enough for a high level of water whether or not you are using the gentle bubbles and vibrations. I also used some scented and colored bath salts with no adverse affects.  Bravo!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a gift and spent more for it after reading the reviews. Other foot spas run around the 30-40 dollar range. I spent 87dollars for this spa plus $15 to ship to me and$15 to ship it back to them.When we received it I took it out of its box to find the cheaply made very shallow spa.And scratches on the bottom.The directions were vague. I filled with water,my husband put his feet in and it was not deep enough to even cover his entire foot. Turned it on to the first setting(massage). The spa made a loud noise and then a humming noise but not anything else. On the second setting some bubbles came out of a small hole under each foot arch.The third setting was heat,which was the main reason I choose this one,but didn&#x27;t get that far.I called the number on the flier inside the box,a guy answered, obviously on a cell phone and told me he&#x27;d have someone at the office call me back. The lady &amp;#34;Doris&amp;#34;called me as I explained my issues she had a answer for everything and wanted to send me another one,no matter what I said. I returned it through Amazon had to pay shipping and then the company only refunded me $65 of my $97 that I had paid. I had to contact Amazon again to get my money.Ultimately I only got my $87back. I paid $30 shipping for nothing,I could have bought a spa from Walmart for that. Make good choices...this is not one.</li>
            <li> Handy footbath!  I m pleased with it because it seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend and she was so happy and its not one of those cheap ones from wally world. I tried It with her and just put warm water in it and it got the water hot and it stayed hot. I turned the bubbles on and she about died and went to heaven. I was going to get on for my mom too but I did notice that it said not to use if you are diabetic and have all that going on with your feet so keep that in mind. I do think this is the best gift I ever got someone just from my girls reaction and I bought her jewelry and other stuff but this by far was her favorite.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing. I spend about $68 a month getting pedicures, when I can afford it. That&#x27;s $68 for one pedicure, yes, I know. Anyway, this thing is amazing. I know what a very expensive pedicure feels like, I know what the tub feels like, I know quality because I&#x27;m never afraid to pay for it. This thing I was worried about because it was so cheap and there were other things out there that looked better. I was a little irritated at first because it took about 10 minutes to heat the water up (lolprincess) when I really could have just put warm water in from the start. I loved it, if you&#x27;re having doubts because of the bad reviews, just get it and see for yourself. It&#x27;s a great product for such a reasonable price. Totally want to get one for my diabetic father so that he can soak his feet in this wonderful thing. Also, works great with bath salts, no problems there.</li>
            <li> It worked well for 1st month only</li>
            <li> A little noisy; no temperature control, if it gets too hot you go to the lower level, but it serves the purpose.</li>
            <li> So far so good. The water stays very warm. It felt good on my feer when using it but the best part was afterwards it felt even better.</li>
            <li> This item is not worth the price.  The vibration effect does not provide relief to aching feet.  The water jets do not act like those is a jacuzzi.&lt;br /&gt;And because of my dissatifaction w/ the unit, I can not return it to get my&lt;br /&gt;hard earned money back.  Go and see a massage therapist.</li>
            <li> This foot bath does what it says it will do. It will actually get too hot. You will have to switch between heat and no heat. But I would rather have that than for one that cannot heat the water enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the price could be a little lower.</li>
            <li> The negatives first:&lt;br /&gt;The heater works TOO well. have to go to &amp;#34;massage only&amp;#34; pretty quick. But if you like a hot foot bath, this is AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are really bad, and you have to figure some things out on your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;heats water very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Is quieter than my old Dr Scholls foot bath&lt;br /&gt;Provides a tub that can cover your feet to the ankle.&lt;br /&gt;Works for big feet (me&#x3D; Mens 12)&lt;br /&gt;Easy to fill and empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seems very well made.</li>
            <li> If we could give this zero stars, we would. Started out great. Heats up nicely and keeps it hot. Bubbles and massages are great settings. My wife was using this every night. However, after only a few weeks of use, it began to leak. Now, if we put water in, it POURS out of two holes in the bottom. Return window is closed - pretty convenient that it stops working right when you can no longer return it.</li>
            <li> Excellent foot bath massager.  The water stays hot forever. I use it half to one hour at a time and there are times I will turn the heat component down.  I tend to use the gray foot pads....love them!  You will not be sorry if you order this brand.  Very, very simple to use.</li>
            <li> Here is a link to a photo of the unit being sent out..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B004RZS6DM?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;action&#x3D;setImg&amp;currentImageID&#x3D;mo1SJQ4KETO0O5Z&amp;currentImagePage&#x3D;0&amp;currentImagePageOffset&#x3D;1&amp;isremote&#x3D;0&amp;page&#x3D;0&amp;pageSize&#x3D;10&amp;sort&#x3D;rating&amp;totalImages&#x3D;10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;s - Water stays hot and actually gets hotter over time requiring switching it off which also turns off the jet.  Vibration and jet isn&#x27;t significant but better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;s - When on Vibrate, makes a loud noise when pressing down with feet.  Had ours on carpet rather than hard surface.  I placed a large plastic lid under the unit so it wasn&#x27;t on the carpet and that significantly improved it to where the noise was almost non-existent unless I pressed on it too hard.  I may have a bad unit where the vibrator is not securely installed??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts:  Says &amp;#34;Professional Model&amp;#34; on the box (see link for what unit actually looks like) but feels rather cheap with no real instructions or even a fill line.  Guess it doesn&#x27;t matter how full you make it though when mine was pretty full it&#x27;d make the loud vibrations due to the extra water weight.  The front blue guard doesn&#x27;t snap in place an easily falls off.  There are 3 tools that can be used one at a time to put in the center and rub your feet on them.  One is a round smooth thing that, unlike the other two, has a shorter stem so doesn&#x27;t stay securely in place making it worthless.  It comes with a black band that is supposed to wrap around the power cord when stored but doesn&#x27;t seem to fit well.  It does however fit around the outside of the unit so I put it there just for a place to hold it.  May send it back due to loud vibration for a replacement.</li>
            <li> The Pibbs foot spa is a wonderful experience for your foot! it really does heat the water, sometimes it actually gets a little too hot. We solve that problem by alternating between setting 1 and 3. I don&#x27;t notice it removing my calluses, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect them to disappear without using a callus remover. The foot spa is not as relaxing as having a pedicure at a professional spa, but it&#x27;s great to use at home and is a whole lot cheaper in the long run. Also, it is big enough that my husband can use it and he wears an 11 1/2 to 12 size shoe.</li>
            <li> I take care of my stuff so when I got this foot spa, I used DISTILLED water to ensure there would be no problem on my end.  First use, there was a slurping/gurgling sound...then the second use, it didn&#x27;t work on any setting!  I contacted CS and asked for a replacement as the one they sent me WAS NOT as depicted on the website figuring that was a better model of the one they sent me.  Three people from church told me theirs broke down too, so I requested a gift card to buy SOME OTHER  MODEL. Anyone have any recommendations?</li>
            <li> Basically satisfied with this product. The only thing I would complain is that though a lot of reviewers said it can heat up the water pretty quick and hot, it not the case for mine. When I switch the control nob to 2, it doesn&#x27;t heat much while just keeping the water from becoming cold. This is not what I expected before I made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise the product is fine. Sturdy and functional.</li>
            <li> Deep enough for water to cover my ankle bones. Enclosed rubber pads help when sensitive feet want less disturbance from plastic needles. Vibration mode is strong enough to be pleasant, yet not annoyingly strong. Water heats up almost in no time. Not noisy at all, you can watch TV with just one sound point up. Made of nice quality plastic, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;The leather loop, I&#x27;m guessing, is meant to keep your knees together for better comfort and relaxation.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with my purchase. Totally worth the money (under $100 with S&amp;H).</li>
            <li> Gets super hot.  I just turn it done for a while.</li>
            <li> This foot spa IS professional grade! And let me tell you something, it gets HOT...very very HOT...so be careful. I left my feet too long in it the first time I used it and when I took my feet out the suddenly became super itchy, sort of like when you&#x27;re a kid and you play outside too long and feet and hands get really cold and when they warm up they start itching...well, that is what this felt like...it was actually torturous...but the thick callous skin literally rubbed off with ease. I used a laser thermometer and found that the water temp topped out at 114 Fahrenheit...so I just have to remember to turn the heat off periodically as I&#x27;m using it. Your feet will actually get used to the heat while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> I finally got to use this after getting it for a Christmas present and it was very nice. The water did get quite warm when I had it on setting 3 but I just turned it down to 1 for a few and then turned it back up when the water got cooler. I added some soaking crystals and it worked well. Just rubbing your feet on the bottom massaging bumps felt great while soaking. I used it for a total of probably 30 minutes and then used my callous razor and scrubber. I cleaned it out immediately after I had my toe nails painted. I put a small dab of dish soap in and washed it out with a rag then rinsed it. It&#x27;s ready for the next use and it didn&#x27;t take long at all. It did exactly what I wanted it to do so I am happy I received this for a gift.</li>
            <li> I used this footbath to soak my tired feet, and it worked great for about 5 times, and then the motor started making a loud rattling sound, loud enough so that it makes any relaxation go out the window.  You just keep pushing your feet in many different directions hoping to stop the motor noise. I gave it 5 stars when I first bought it, but now give it 1 because it&#x27;s built so shoddily that the motor keeps hitting something in the housing.  Don&#x27;t waste  your money.</li>
            <li> Got it in the mail- filled up with water- leaked about a gallon out two holes in bottom- nice mess- returning it- poor quality- NOT EVEN SAME PICTURE !!!! TWICE THE PRICE OF COMPARABLE UNITS. Had to pay shipping back that didn&#x27;t get refunded- not happy at all.</li>
            <li> I normally do not write reviews but I had to on this one. Heat is incredible along with the vibration option there are bubbles that are directed at your arches ( I am not a bubble person) The accessories are nothing to speak of but I did not buy it for them anyway, If it hold up for a year that&#x27;s all I care about I would buy a new one every year with no complaints for the price, First one I every bought big upgrade from the pan. I would buy it again comes with a one year warranty and I use it at least 20 -60 minutes a day.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect foot bath massager.  It heated up quickly, maintained heat, has a nice size reservoir and arrived promptly. I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Ever since I had a Dr. Scholl&#x27;s foot massager many years ago, I enjoy use foot massager at night.&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s time to buy a new model with to-day&#x27;s tech.&lt;br /&gt;My requirements are simple; compac in size, light in weight, produce heat and not loud when motor is on.&lt;br /&gt;I have been visit stores and made research on line, the PIBBS seams right for my need. The price is higher in the market.&lt;br /&gt;However,  there are no instructions, only two pages of home made recommended times, and it is out dated.  It doesn&#x27;t match with massager.  I emailed and called many times, but no answer at all.  No service at all.</li>
            <li> This massager rules! Really massages and warms your feet. Glad I spent a little more than the cheap ones!</li>
            <li> I just got this today for my birthday. My feet feel great now. It is very relaxing, the water stays hot and like someone else said, I actually had to turn it to the mode without heat for a little while. I do wish it bubbled more, but the vibrating massage feels great. This is something I will be more than happy to use over and over.&lt;br /&gt;I kind of guessed how full to fill it. Even though it says not to go past the fill line, I couldn&#x27;t see one. I am not sure either what the round strap thing is for, that was in the attachment bag. And there is an oblong blue piece that sticks up in the center, at the end of the tub that your toes are at. It has all these little holes in it, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything. It is not in the picture or the figure guide. I&#x27;m sure I will get it figured out.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with my gift and will get lots of use out of it.</li>
            <li> I have tried other cheaper foot baths and have been disappointed. They not only do not heat water but do not keep the water hot. This foot bath not only will heat cold water but keeps it piping hot until you turn it off (1 hour, 2 hours-does not matter how long). It vibrates and seems plenty for me. I just love having hot water the entire time I am using the foot bath. Hot water, after all, is what helps my feet relax.&lt;br /&gt;It will hold plenty of water to soak your feet in and does not overflow. I personally love more than inches covering my feet.&lt;br /&gt;If you have tired, aching feet you will love this foot bath. Price is reasonable considering what it does.&lt;br /&gt;My feet feel so much better after soaking in hot, vibrating water!&lt;br /&gt;Love this foot bath and would purchase again and again. You will love this model also if your feet are hurting.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase. The foot bath I received today is different from the one pictured, but does match the box it came in. I was displeased to see the price today, $68. I paid $79 four days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foot bath weighs five pounds. Adding one gallon of water adds 8 pounds. This brings the water level to below my ankle bone.  I wear a size eleven shoe and there is plenty of room in length and width. The foot bath will comfortably accommodate a foot that measures 11 3/8 inches long. So get out your tape measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using cold tap water first. After one hour on level 3, and no perceptible heating of the water, I gave up and dumped the water out and replaced it with hot water from the bathtub. The foot bath was able to maintain between 104 degrees and 105.5 degrees for the two hours I kept it running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foot bath feels and looks well-made. It has two small holes in the bottom of each foot section that provide bubbles. The nubs on the bottom are invigorating. Two rubbery gray foot pads are provided which can be used nubs up or down, providing softer nubs or a smooth surface. Three plastic inserts are included, a rounded cone-shape, a tall nub-shape, and a roller with nubs. I like the roller attachment, but the built in nubs are sufficient to provide accupressure. There is also a hood to prevent splashing, although I didn&#x27;t use it. The more water you use, the more likely you are to need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foot bath vibrates. It is not too loud.  It is easy to carry, dump, rinse and pat dry. I have posted pictures.</li>
            <li> I have had this foot bath for a few months now and it still works great, I like how the machine heats the water on its own.</li>
            <li> I have had 3 other foot baths all returned because they were way too shallow. This footpath does the job. My only complaint is the water heater gets too hot and one must switch to another mode to allow it to cool down.</li>
            <li> doesnt have temp  settings only one that keeps getting hotter. pads will slide arould also. other wise i like it</li>
            <li> Heater does not appear to work.  I just received it and I see it is no longer available on Amazon.  What gives!  Very expensive for what it is but willing to pay to get something that  heats the water HOT and massages feet.  This was not worth $125.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife.  She had another unit that needed replacement, and this was it.  She loves it!  I chose this one based on the reviews, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 5 months ago, and used it about 5 times a week.  I did a lot research before picking is particular product. Having used it for almost 5 months now, I have to concur that all the previous positive reviews are accurate.  The heating feature on the foot bath is awesome, it might be the only one on the market that heats the water this well. I actually have to turned off the heat each time I use the product.  Would I repeat my purchase?  Definitely.</li>
            <li> Aww, it works perfect. As stated in other reviews &amp;#34;it does get hot&amp;#34; but no problem to turn it down or back up as it cools. I love it.</li>
