            <li>Just simply the best oil hair product for your hair!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>cannot wait to buy full size because this is just too amazing for a sample size</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the smell and how smooth it makes your hair feel.</li>
            <li>and the shipping was quick too!</li>
            <li>This little one is perfect for going on vacation!</li>
            <li>I got a bottle for free, and will now continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>It is also good for a short trip.  </li>
            <li>Not only does this product work as described, but it smells incredibly good, too.</li>
            <li>That is very unusual for me!</li>
            <li>You would never think I had an oil in my hair, just blessed with amazingly healthy Soft shiny hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, dry hair and can&#x27;t use too much conditioner because it weighs the hair down, but the macadamia oil works wonderfully in conjunction with Pert and a shine supplement.</li>
            <li>or I would keep a large bottle on backbar!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not yet been able to decide if this is better than a larger bottle of a different product that isn&#x27;t as powerful..</li>
            <li>So for some reason the smaller bottle smells better than the 4.2oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first discovered this product when a Salon Rep. gave me a couple of samples.</li>
            <li>just what I expected ans also has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>I love this healing oil, and with this small bottle, I am able to spread the words without giving up my whole bottle of $20.00.  </li>
            <li>However, I have similar products that do the same thing for a cheaper price, except they do not smell as good.</li>
            <li>Yes, I will buy it again, and remember you do not need large quantity on the tips of the hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil, on dry hair, on wet hair, I love it.</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Very good price, and even a bottle this small will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>makes my hair soooo soft, and shiny!</li>
            <li>I wanted to get a trial size before I spent the little extra more to buy the full size.</li>
            <li>I am using other products, so I can&#x27;t be positive as to how much of a difference it has made to my hair.</li>
            <li>If I am going to wear my hair natural (wavy curly) to bed.</li>
            <li>Looks almost professional.</li>
            <li>Small bottle - powerful...</li>

            <li> I have very long hair, and recently went 6 months without a trim.</li>
            <li> and I also put a tiny amount in my damp hair before I blow dry.</li>
            <li> It keepsyour curls, and makes your hair fluffy, fuller, alive.  </li>
            <li> When I told my stylist, she couldn&#x27;t believe it had been that long.</li>
            <li> works well in humid and dry air conditions alike.</li>
            <li> I use it on the ends of my hair before I blow dry.</li>
            <li> and I recommend using it in wet hair before blow drying and maybe (if you have long hair)</li>
            <li> I buy the larger bottles and refill this little one now.</li>
            <li> coating your finger tips just slightly and running it through the ends of dry hair when you&#x27;re done styling or on &amp;#34;second day hair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> She said a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The macadamia nut smells extremely fruity with a hint of tropical aroma included.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> I will order it again once the bottle is half empty, do not want to run out of</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> Does not weigh your hair down, gives shine and body.</li>
            <li> but when is wet is very very very hard to untangle.</li>
            <li> i like the small bottle, take me about 3 month to finish it.</li>
            <li> She said I had hardly any split ends at all.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown, because the thin spots are filling in.</li>
            <li> I wish It wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> Silly me.  </li>
            <li> it stinks too, probably from synthetic fragrance.</li>

            <li> It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Smells great and gives my hair lots of body!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I wanted to get a trial size before I spent the little extra more to buy the full size. I love it! makes my hair soooo soft, and shiny! and the shipping was quick too!</li>
            <li> Small bottle - powerful... Really makes a difference in my hair.  I&#x27;ve not yet been able to decide if this is better than a larger bottle of a different product that isn&#x27;t as powerful.. Hopefully I&#x27;ll know in another couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this healing oil, and with this small bottle, I am able to spread the words without giving up my whole bottle of $20.00.  It is also good for a short trip.  It keepsyour curls, and makes your hair fluffy, fuller, alive.  I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> This stuff is liquid gold for your hair! I&#x27;ve been using for about a month now and it has dramatically improved the texture of my hair. I am a hairdresser and would use this over any redken/pureology oil out there. I wish It wasn&#x27;t so expensive or I would keep a large bottle on backbar! I add it to my conditioner and leave it in for 10 min before washing it out and I also put a tiny amount in my damp hair before I blow dry. The volume and softness I get out of it is incredible. You would never think I had an oil in my hair, just blessed with amazingly healthy Soft shiny hair. Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it look greasy. Just use a tiny amount and I recommend using it in wet hair before blow drying and maybe (if you have long hair) coating your finger tips just slightly and running it through the ends of dry hair when you&#x27;re done styling or on &amp;#34;second day hair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I LOVED IT!  It was light and offered the tips of my hair added moisture during the week preventing the tips from drying out which prevents unnecessary breakage to the hair.  The oil smells GREAT!  The macadamia nut smells extremely fruity with a hint of tropical aroma included.  No breakage or fall out while using this OIL.  Yes, I will buy it again, and remember you do not need large quantity on the tips of the hair.  I will order it again once the bottle is half empty, do not want to run out of this product!&lt;br /&gt;Please order immediately, and also keep it in stock.</li>
            <li> So for some reason the smaller bottle smells better than the 4.2oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product lasted me 4 months.  I use it after, bath or shower If I am going to wear my hair natural (wavy curly) to bed.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have fine, dry hair and can&#x27;t use too much conditioner because it weighs the hair down, but the macadamia oil works wonderfully in conjunction with Pert and a shine supplement. Looks almost professional.</li>

            <li> One of my favorite hair products. Very good price, and even a bottle this small will last a very long time. A little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was just macadamia nut oil.  Silly me.  Lots of ingredients and it stinks too, probably from synthetic fragrance.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was not same quality as when I purchased this in the salon.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works well and smells soooo good! It has a warm, spicy smell that I wish I could heat and use to make my house smell good. Hmmm, I wonder....</li>
            <li> My hair love this product! It gives my hair nice shine and softness.</li>
            <li> made my hair feel like silk! cannot wait to buy full size because this is just too amazing for a sample size</li>
            <li> This product is so good for my hair. my hair is easy to manage when is dry but when is wet is very very very hard to untangle. With this product I dont need to fight with my hair anymore. I loved it. I have try and invest in too many expensive product and didnt work. Is an excellent product. The oil and conditining is perfect</li>
            <li> Love this product makes my color treated hair feel like baby hair. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, on dry hair, on wet hair, I love it. This little one is perfect for going on vacation! I buy the larger bottles and refill this little one now.</li>

            <li> I first discovered this product when a Salon Rep. gave me a couple of samples. She said a little goes a long way. She wasn&#x27;t kidding. Not only does this product work as described, but it smells incredibly good, too. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and recommend it to all the girls. If you want to maintain the frizz around your hairline, or prevent dryness by working it in to your ends, then this is the product. I swear by this stuff!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the smell and how smooth it makes your hair feel. However, I have similar products that do the same thing for a cheaper price, except they do not smell as good. I do love it though!</li>
            <li> essential in my haircare routine. i use it on the ends to diminish frizz and help with split ends. works well in humid and dry air conditions alike. i like the small bottle, take me about 3 month to finish it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I got a bottle for free, and will now continue to buy it. I use it on the ends of my hair before I blow dry. It smells amazing, and I think it has made my hair healthier. I have very long hair, and recently went 6 months without a trim. When I told my stylist, she couldn&#x27;t believe it had been that long. She said I had hardly any split ends at all. That is very unusual for me! I credit this stuff.</li>
            <li> just what I expected ans also has a nice scent to it.</li>
