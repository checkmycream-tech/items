            <li>The smell is softer, not as strong as this one.</li>

            <li>Overall, great stuff and worth every penny you pay for it.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product I first came across at my nail salon!</li>
            <li>Makes body smooth and soft!!!!!</li>
            <li>I absolute feel in love with the scent and the coverage.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a huge bottle, has a nice light lemon-ish scent, and the lotion goes a long way....</li>
            <li>It feels fresh and clean when you put it on.</li>
            <li>lotion and scent wears off rather quickly.</li>
            <li>The scent does go away pretty quickly though!  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and absorbs reasonably fast.</li>
            <li>I just bought another bottle because my beauty supply store had it for $9.99- originally $14.99 although bought first one for $11.99).</li>
            <li>So happy I tried the new salon even for the simple purpose of finding this lotion...</li>
            <li>I would have ordered more except it showed only one available on Amazon at the time.</li>
            <li>It makes your hands soft and I love the way it smells</li>
            <li>I love this lotion because it smells fresh and leaves skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I feel it is well worth the price paid.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion, in fact, I love it so much, I got two large bottles.  </li>
            <li>The one from the squeeze tube is definitely thicker and richer whereas this one was more watery and just DIFFERENT.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty funny.  </li>
            <li>This lotion needs a commercial everyone should know about this product I love it</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the smoothness of it especially in winter</li>
            <li>I recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li>Thanks Codi Olive The Wife.</li>
            <li>i really, really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>Your skin feels very silky.</li>
            <li>I really  like it as I can use it on my face without clogging my pores.  </li>
            <li>like I do from most other lotions that Nail places use nowadays.  </li>
            <li>It has a great smell and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way with this stuff and again, it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I should have realized that for the moderate price and the bigger than normal quantity the product wouldn&#x27;t be outstanding.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the large container I received.</li>
            <li>Love it use it everyday</li>
            <li>Green tea is probably my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I happened to have my manicurist use this at a new salon.  </li>
            <li>First time I purchase this product it shines your skin and never go dry at all the whole day.</li>
            <li>I first heard of this lotion when I got a regular sized tube from my spa owner one Christmas.  </li>
            <li>I first used it at my local nail salon and took a picture of it with my phone</li>
            <li>other lotion in Green Tea is equally good.</li>
            <li>So when I saw this large size at Amazon,  there was only one thing to</li>
            <li>And the bottle is huge, so it will last a very long time!</li>
            <li>, its thick and rich not water down like most lotions.</li>
            <li>It feels soooo soft.</li>
            <li>and I am scent sensitive so the scent makes my stomach turn</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t rub in completely (like some lotions), but maybe this is why it works so well.</li>
            <li>In addition to that it leaves your skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>I received my first bottle of Codi Olive for a Christmas present last year.  </li>
            <li>I recently went to a new Nail Salon, and they used this lotion on my hands.  </li>
            <li>It also hydrates the skin very well, so if you have dry skin it will work well for you.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, it&#x27;s feel silky smooth and</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m only half way thru the first bottle but wanted to grab another for the price.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend it over all other lotions</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good in the sense that it smells like lemons, but bad in the sense that it also smells like household chemicals (or reminds me of them).  </li>

            <li> I was given the large bottle for Christmas this past year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically disappointing that there is a variation in the quality if you buy them in different sizes (probably is made to be different for different containers so it can easily be pumped out...)</li>
            <li> have very dry skin, and it itches terribly, especially at night.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing</li>
            <li> My hands were very dry and chapped and this made a big difference in one day alone.</li>
            <li> The cream is thick but not greasy and hydrates the skin very well.</li>
            <li> Skin feels less dry than ever.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I previously owned the squeeze tube of lotion</li>
            <li> The scent is a little like furniture polish, but it fades quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While she likes the scent she prefers the green tea version.</li>
            <li> I like to rotate between the green tea and the olive.</li>
            <li> I usually say no lotion, but I forgot.  </li>
            <li> I had received this lotion as a ( small tube) gift from my nail salon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick lotion that glides on and stays on even after washing.</li>
            <li> - i dont mean like pledge furniture cleaner or anything like that</li>
            <li> The pump was broken off and laying beside the bottle when I opened it :/</li>
            <li> Just try it you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Smells bad.</li>

            <li> I first heard of this lotion when I got a regular sized tube from my spa owner one Christmas.  I fell in love with this the first time I used it. It is creamy, but not gooey.  It is light and has a fragrance I like. So when I saw this large size at Amazon,  there was only one thing to do----order it immediately!</li>
            <li> Great Price &amp; product!</li>
            <li> This hand lotion is amazing. I received it as a gift and saw a difference in the skin on my hands in a week.  I then orderrf it as a gift gor my boss. She loves it so its a win/win.  I would have ordered more except it showed only one available on Amazon at the time.</li>
            <li> Wonderful feeling after use.  Skin feels less dry than ever.  Will be buying another bottle for my daughter. Just try it you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  I first used it at my local nail salon and took a picture of it with my phone so I could order it later.  It comes in a huge bottle, has a nice light lemon-ish scent, and the lotion goes a long way....currently my favorite lotion, and is cheaper than some of the better known brands.</li>
            <li> Very rich and super moisturizing! I recommend this to anyone that has tried many lotions with  no luck, this will be the end of your search!</li>
            <li> I should have realized that for the moderate price and the bigger than normal quantity the product wouldn&#x27;t be outstanding. But it&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;ll have to finish using it before deciding if I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome and is also priced a little better than the pomegranate version. I recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li> I previously owned the squeeze tube of lotion and I noticed the difference with the viscosity of the product. The one from the squeeze tube is definitely thicker and richer whereas this one was more watery and just DIFFERENT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion and scent wears off rather quickly. It&#x27;s basically disappointing that there is a variation in the quality if you buy them in different sizes (probably is made to be different for different containers so it can easily be pumped out...)</li>
            <li> I love it!! First time I purchase this product it shines your skin and never go dry at all the whole day.</li>
            <li> The pump was broken off and laying beside the bottle when I opened it :/</li>
            <li> This lotion is great not greasy like a lot. Acts like a much more expensive Lotion. I not only use it but got my husband to use it on his hands and he to now likes it and I like that he uses it much nicer when he touches me great product. Thanks Codi Olive The Wife.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing. I bought it at a beauty supply store for the same price that&#x27;s on here.&lt;br /&gt;It has a tangy kind of citrus smell. It feels soooo soft. It&#x27;s not sticky, it just goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels different, softer.&lt;br /&gt;The other lotion in Green Tea is equally good. The smell is softer, not as strong as this one.</li>
            <li> best olive lotion my skin got so good and will order more....why to buy something else ....this lotion is best</li>
            <li> It makes your hands soft and I love the way it smells</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had this lotion at work and it smells amazing. It has a citrus tint to it, yet not too overpowering. A little bit goes a long way with this stuff and again, it smells amazing! It also hydrates the skin very well, so if you have dry skin it will work well for you. Overall, great stuff and worth every penny you pay for it. And the bottle is huge, so it will last a very long time!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion because it smells fresh and leaves skin soft.  It&#x27;s a thick lotion that glides on and stays on even after washing.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and give it for gifts. Everyone loves it !</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m alone in my review about the scent - it totally smells like my dishwasher detergent and all my lemon scented household cleaners.  It&#x27;s good in the sense that it smells like lemons, but bad in the sense that it also smells like household chemicals (or reminds me of them).  The thickness and feel of the lotion is nice.  It&#x27;s not watery or greasy.  When I ordered it, I guess I was so excited about it after reading the reviews that I didn&#x27;t notice the size.  I thought it was a smaller bottle but it&#x27;s bigger than my house!  It&#x27;s pretty funny.  I don&#x27;t like the scent and I am scent sensitive so the scent makes my stomach turn and here I have the biggest bottle of it that I&#x27;ve ever seen!  The scent does go away pretty quickly though!  It&#x27;s a great size if you love the smell!  Pump is nice.    Update:  Lemon Pledge is the smell!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer!!!! Nice mild fragrance!! Makes body smooth and soft!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my manicurist uses it. It smells great and it moisturizes deeply. It can be quite greasy though, so if you want something light this is not for you</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It&#x27;s light going on and leaves your skin feeling softer.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great!  It has a nice aroma and works great on dry skin.  A little goes a long way.  It doesn&#x27;t rub in completely (like some lotions), but maybe this is why it works so well.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best lotion ever!!!  It&#x27;s great for use on the entire body!!!  I highly recommend this lotion, in fact, I love it so much, I got two large bottles.  It also does wonders for your heels, hands, and face as well.  It&#x27;s more expensive if you order online.  I got it for 9.99 in a beauty supply store...same size bottle.</li>
            <li> Great for the winter time dry skin, refreshing and great scent. Use it almost daily. Like the bottle as well.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews. i really, really like this lotion. I just bought another bottle because my beauty supply store had it for $9.99- originally $14.99 although bought first one for $11.99). i&#x27;m only half way thru the first bottle but wanted to grab another for the price. smooth, moisturizes really good and smells great (has a clean, refreshing, lemon-y, scent - i dont mean like pledge furniture cleaner or anything like that LOL!). I definatley plan on continueing to use it.</li>
            <li> I was given the large bottle for Christmas this past year.&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin, and it itches terribly, especially at night.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing had worked..anti-itch sprays, creams, etc - nothing worked until I got this bottle of Codi hand and lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I slather it on my arms, ankles and back....and no greasiness but especially - an itch-free night&#x27;s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use it every night - never rubs off on clothing or sheets, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND...it smells so great !</li>
            <li> I received my first bottle of Codi Olive for a Christmas present last year.  I absolute feel in love with the scent and the coverage.  A little goes a long way, it&#x27;s feel silky smooth and the scent is just great.  I found it though Amason and ordered a bottle for me and my daughter who loves it as well.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff.  The transparent plastic bottle has the look of glass without the fragility.  she also loves the lotion, it works wonders.  While she likes the scent she prefers the green tea version.</li>
            <li> Love it use it everyday</li>
            <li> Love this hand cream ~~ keep it by my kitchen sink</li>
            <li> Great scent and absorption. Use it almost daily.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion. Smells great and great for dry skin. They use these at a lot&lt;br /&gt;Of the nail salons.</li>
            <li> Just love this cream. Beautiful fragrance of lemons. It feels fresh and clean when you put it on. Your skin feels very silky. I will order this again.&lt;br /&gt;Cindy</li>
            <li> Fabulous product I first came across at my nail salon! It smells great. Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy. A little goes a long way. My hands were very dry and chapped and this made a big difference in one day alone.</li>
            <li> I recently went to a new Nail Salon, and they used this lotion on my hands.  I loved the smell, and I didn&#x27;t get a rash from it like I do from most other lotions that Nail places use nowadays.  I usually say no lotion, but I forgot.  I absolutely love it!  So happy I tried the new salon even for the simple purpose of finding this lotion...</li>
            <li> Smells awesome. I love it, its thick and rich not water down like most lotions. I wish Codi would provide a variety pack where you could purchase one of each the lotions scents they have..</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this lotion and I am about to buy a 3rd.  I like to rotate between the green tea and the olive. Green tea is probably my favorite scent. The cream is thick but not greasy and hydrates the skin very well.</li>
            <li> I had bought this lotion before. It has a great smell and a little goes a long way.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> this lotion the salons are using now and it smells great... In addition to that it leaves your skin feeling so soft. I highly reccommend it over all other lotions</li>
            <li> I happened to have my manicurist use this at a new salon.  I loved it and they happened to sell it.  So, I searched online and found it comparably priced but, no tax (yes)!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and it was delivered quickly!</li>
            <li> Love it. Use morning and night. Moisturizes well and absorbs into the skin easily. Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Great lotion! It has light citrus fragrance. Moisturizes the skin well.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle looks glass, but it&#x27;s plastic.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone. It also makes a great inexpensive gift.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. The scent is a little like furniture polish, but it fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It feel okay on my skin.</li>
            <li> Good delivery and good product.</li>
            <li> This lotion needs a commercial everyone should know about this product I love it</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I ever use. I love the smell and the smoothness of it especially in winter it is very good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Smells bad. Like dollar tree dish washing liquid.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the large container I received. I guess I did not pay attention to the size which is 25 oz.  I had received this lotion as a ( small tube) gift from my nail salon. I really  like it as I can use it on my face without clogging my pores.  It goes on easily and absorbs reasonably fast. I feel it is well worth the price paid.</li>
