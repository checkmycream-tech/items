            <li>It has a shoulder strap which is a major plus for me. :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li>The drawers do not open very nicely or straight.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>

            <li>This case is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>It was quickly returned with amazon providing a free label.</li>
            <li>ITS PINK (MY FAVORITE COLOR) AND ITS SNAKE SKIN!!</li>
            <li>it is as good as my old case which i got for a 100 dollars but much cuter.</li>
            <li>Super sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li>It has large compartments great for storing pallets or other bulky makeup items.</li>
            <li>There is more than enough room for everything, and a special cup for makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>This product looks exactly like its image  </li>
            <li>The photo looks better than what you actually get.</li>
            <li>I really recommend you all try this!</li>
            <li>I think the color is so pretty.</li>
            <li>Love the outside print - ultra girly just like me!</li>
            <li>I felt pretty embarrassed giving my daughter such a cheaply made gift.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty case (although mine came a little dented but I was able to dent it back)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been guilty of storing my favorite jewlry in it (and more..!)</li>
            <li>Its great... I was about to purchase a similar one from sephora but the price was a little to much for me.</li>
            <li>It was much more than i expected it to be.</li>
            <li>Thanks SHany.</li>
            <li>The trays are very flimsy....</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and roomy</li>
            <li>Pink is my favorite color ever</li>
            <li>The pink makes this case look really cute.</li>
            <li>and i love pink!</li>
            <li>I love the pink snake skin!</li>
            <li>The product overall is good if the price is below $30, but not worth if you pay over $30 for this.</li>
            <li>This is a huge make up kit with a cute little fold up chest that makes storing it quite simple.</li>
            <li>I love that it is big enough to store all the vital necessities and room for all your extras as well!!</li>
            <li>The make up is high quality and the colors are decent, I like that you don&#x27;t have to worry about storage.</li>
            <li>Very classy and \\&quot;girly pink\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this case.</li>
            <li>I so wanted this product to be awesome since it fit her wild crazy personality (pink animal skin)</li>
            <li>its so big plenty of room for everything, my favorite color is pink</li>
            <li>A little pricey considering how easily it dented</li>
            <li>it is so big, there is so much space to put all your makeup/ tools inside</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically like pink, but i fell in love with this case as soon as I saw it.</li>
            <li>Considering that it is really big, I would have thought it would have made more separators for each drawer or at least of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It actually looks very professional and fancy  </li>
            <li>When this arrived today I thought, wow this thing is big!</li>
            <li>However, I did not want to replace order and return the old one because of $5 different.</li>
            <li>I knew i was getting a deal by reading the other reviews, but i was very surperosed when the item actually arrived.</li>

            <li> I knew i was getting a deal by reading the other reviews, but i was very surperosed when the item actually arrived.</li>
            <li> The outside cover does actually feel like snake&#x27;s skin, quite shiny and pink  </li>
            <li> You have room for your expensive makeup and your cheap stuff (yes ladies we all have both kinds).</li>
            <li> Not good quality, but it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li> the pink train case is so big.</li>
            <li> A lot bigger than I expected it to be</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had it long</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how it will stand up in the long run.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too late to send it back because I need it for a gift, I will have to get out my hot glue gun to stick down the lining.</li>
            <li> The case is large enough to fit everything sadly it was just poorly made.</li>
            <li> The outside had an odd sticky substance and the metal looked rusty.  </li>
            <li> The black liner of the case was peeling off and several scratches were inside it.</li>
            <li> but it looks so small on the outside totally recommend</li>
            <li> Not very well-built.</li>
            <li> It is pink, durable and roomy.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for any other person looking for a makeup kit.</li>
            <li> irst of all it is pink!</li>
            <li> I have some other shany makeup cases and I am still using them.</li>
            <li> I use it to hold my brushes and other tools.</li>
            <li> Returned it and had a hard time receiving my money back.</li>
            <li> This product not worth $50-$60 range...</li>
            <li> Later after further inspection we discovered the inside support frame was bent, the sides were coming unglued and the outside was dirty and rubbed.  </li>
            <li> The down side is that I order the aluminum case and somehow got alligator.</li>
            <li> The inside of the mettal the folds down with the three tiers was bend and crocked  </li>
            <li> I had already broke down the box</li>
            <li> which was a big oh fail for my friend that is rough on everything she owns (cars, phones, hair....)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It is small so traveling with this case is not an hassle.</li>
            <li> when I received it in the mail, The outside of the box was dirty, torn, the insides fabric was peeling off, the \\&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot;metal\\&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot; was bending.</li>
            <li> Inside has room for brushes to lay flat, I HATE when my bristles get smashed down into a too small case!</li>
            <li> alas I am now sad I have to buy a Plain Jane case with a pack of stickers</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll need to fix the poor craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> the lining was poorly glued on (you could see the attempts made to glue lining on).....</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s on sale for $20 then buy it, otherwise, save your money and disappointment.</li>
            <li> Quality is very poor!</li>
            <li> Brought this as a gift for my product junkie friend and was VERY disappointed at the quality.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality!!!</li>

            <li> The size and shape of the box were perfect, but the manufacturing was terrible.  The outside had an odd sticky substance and the metal looked rusty.  The inside was torn and lifting up.</li>
            <li> The case was just what I was looking for. I recommend it for any other person looking for a makeup kit.</li>
            <li> i love this case. the color is my favorite. i could never find a colored case that had good quality but this one is amazing. it is as good as my old case which i got for a 100 dollars but much cuter. i highly recommend this case.</li>
            <li> This product looks exactly like its image  It actually looks very professional and fancy  The outside cover does actually feel like snake&#x27;s skin, quite shiny and pink  I have it set up in the bathroom  It keeps everything super organized and handy  Also makes life easier for asap on the go schedules.   I&#x27;ve also been guilty of storing my favorite jewlry in it (and more..!)</li>
            <li> I got this case for my niece and she loved it. I have got the silver shany makeup case for myself and i am very happy with it. the pink train case is so big. love it...</li>
            <li> When this arrived today I thought, wow this thing is big! There is more than enough room for everything, and a special cup for makeup brushes. You have room for your expensive makeup and your cheap stuff (yes ladies we all have both kinds). The down side is that I order the aluminum case and somehow got alligator. No biggie, and I&#x27;m not upset enough to send it back.</li>
            <li> I bought this item thinking it would make a great gift for my daughter&#x27;s birthday however, when it came, it smelled \\&quot;old\\&quot; and was scratched up.  The glue on the inside parts had seperated and there was rust around the handle.  I thought I was sent a used one by mistake so a replacement was sent, when I got it, it was in the same condition.  It looked used.</li>
            <li> This is an amzing case with a beautiful color. I knew i was getting a deal by reading the other reviews, but i was very surperosed when the item actually arrived. It was much more than i expected it to be. Thanks SHany.</li>
            <li> The price was dropped after 1 day I placed the order, but I could not get the refund the different because of Amazon policy (I did not get the product at that time). However, I did not want to replace order and return the old one because of $5 different. The product overall is good if the price is below $30, but not worth if you pay over $30 for this.</li>
            <li> I bought this and am dissappointed with the quality. It&#x27;s too late to send it back because I need it for a gift, I will have to get out my hot glue gun to stick down the lining. Not good quality, but it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased it, I read the reviews they all gave it good ratings, so I decided to get it for a gift of x-mas.  It was falling apart when I opened the box.  Very disappointed!! Very poor quality!!! If you do decide to get this, you should also get a glue gun cause that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll need to fix the poor craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> Brought this as a gift for my product junkie friend and was VERY disappointed at the quality. The trays are very flimsy....the lining was poorly glued on (you could see the attempts made to glue lining on).....the case dents VERY easily...which was a big oh fail for my friend that is rough on everything she owns (cars, phones, hair....)...I so wanted this product to be awesome since it fit her wild crazy personality (pink animal skin) sigh.... alas I am now sad I have to buy a Plain Jane case with a pack of stickers so she can jazz it up......thanks Shany for crushing all my hopes, dreams, and aspirations at sending my only friend in the world an awesome surprise gift!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this make up box for my mom for Christmas. when I received it in the mail, The outside of the box was dirty, torn, the insides fabric was peeling off, the \\&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot;metal\\&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot; was bending. Returned it and had a hard time receiving my money back. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Another winner from Shany. Great case for traveling. Super sturdy and durable. And a place for my OCD self to organize everything! Great buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift and if I had done this sooner I would return it. Not very well-built. Does not feel nor smell like it&#x27;s a quality product. I inspected cosmetic case before wrapping it up and noticed there was a significant gap at the bottom of the case. The photo looks better than what you actually get. This product not worth $50-$60 range...well, that&#x27;s what I get for last minute Christmas shopping. If it&#x27;s on sale for $20 then buy it, otherwise, save your money and disappointment.</li>
            <li> Its great... I was about to purchase a similar one from sephora but the price was a little to much for me. I found this one it is so big and just what I needed.</li>
            <li> A lot bigger than I expected it to be, which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Lots of room.&lt;br /&gt;+ Very pretty case (although mine came a little dented but I was able to dent it back)&lt;br /&gt;+ Feels sturdy on the outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The drawers do not open very nicely or straight.&lt;br /&gt;- Considering that it is really big, I would have thought it would have made more separators for each drawer or at least of them.&lt;br /&gt;- A little pricey considering how easily it dented and I undented it and the wobbly drawers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had it long so I don&#x27;t know how it will stand up in the long run.</li>
            <li> I thought this looked like the perfect makeup case for my daughter because she loves pink and it offers great storage.  At first glance on Christmas morning it looked great.  Later after further inspection we discovered the inside support frame was bent, the sides were coming unglued and the outside was dirty and rubbed.  I felt pretty embarrassed giving my daughter such a cheaply made gift.  It was quickly returned with amazon providing a free label.</li>
            <li> irst of all it is pink! and i love pink! this stored my makeup when i traveled and loved the brush part. Very sturdy and roomy</li>
            <li> This case is so neat! I love the pink snake skin! It matches perfect with my brush set! It has many tiers and I love how much room it gives me to put all of my makeup!</li>
            <li> Very classy and \\&quot;girly pink\\&quot;! Love the snake skin texture. The shoulder strap is a great plus for portability. Has a latch and key for security. This case is versitile as it fits my larger powder brushes as well.</li>
            <li> I have some other shany makeup cases and I am still using them. I ordered this one and I love it because it is so cute and it has more room to fit all my makeups.</li>
            <li> Great case. It works well for what I need it for. I wish it was bigger. But I like it a lot overall.</li>
            <li> When I received my train case I was so excited, the train is beautiful and a great size. Once I opened the case my &#x27;happiness flew out the door. The black liner of the case was peeling off and several scratches were inside it. The inside of the mettal the folds down with the three tiers was bend and crocked  The case is large enough to fit everything sadly it was just poorly made. I had already broke down the box it came in so now I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>

            <li> I love this case! Pink is my favorite color ever and I use it all time time. It holds all of my accessories. I use it to hold my brushes and other tools. Its very handy and i cant imagine not using it.</li>
            <li> Perfect perfect perfect, I love the detail of this train case and for it to have a strap makes it so much more easier to travel with !</li>
            <li> The pink makes this case look really cute. It is small so traveling with this case is not an hassle. It also comes with a shoulder strap so even easier to carry around.</li>
            <li> Quality is very poor!</li>

            <li> This is a huge make up kit with a cute little fold up chest that makes storing it quite simple. The make up is high quality and the colors are decent, I like that you don&#x27;t have to worry about storage.</li>
            <li> Love the outside print - ultra girly just like me! Inside has room for brushes to lay flat, I HATE when my bristles get smashed down into a too small case!</li>
