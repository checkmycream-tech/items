            <li>Hair is very straight leaves a very good shine to the hair.</li>
            <li>&quot; should have known the good price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Like all appliances the true test is the time, but this is working great after a couple months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>Good price, fast shipping, but not quite as good as I hoped.  </li>
            <li>cracked after 2 weeks, very cheap</li>
            <li>Very smooth and makes my hair shine.</li>
            <li>Either they broke quickly or took forever to straighten my hair, and didnt do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good but no auto off and gets very hot on the shell of it.</li>

            <li>I love this curling iron!!the temperature control.</li>
            <li>it works better then</li>
            <li>However if u love closer to the tip of the iron it gets tighter.</li>
            <li>I want to be able to straighten thicker pieces of my hair at once.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly thru hair at all!</li>
            <li>Priced others with this temperature and most of them were twice the price.</li>

            <li>I love this straightener it work so well on my hair.</li>
            <li>I used this on the highest temperature and it made my hair so straight,I love it.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I do love it for the price.</li>
            <li>I am in love with my Gurin.</li>
            <li>Could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I tend to lean towards the highest heat setting to save time, although everyone is different, and no two heads of hair are alike, so you can play around with it to find out which setting works best for you.</li>
            <li>I love most about this iron (besides the fact that it works well)</li>
            <li>Like I said, I love the adjustable heat setting on this.</li>
            <li>Like I said, I love the adjustable heat setting on this.</li>

            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Since I started using this straightener, it looks and feels even better.  </li>
            <li>My Wal-Mart straightener does a better job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome overall, but for me the temp.</li>
            <li>Ordered two more as gifts, I know they will love them.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>Even more to love is the bright red carrying case; it’s a very nice touch.</li>
            <li>hundreds over the years on tourmaline flat irons and this one is the best!</li>

            <li>The carrying bag is really cute, great for travel and makes the iron seem high quality and expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>

            <li>its very smooth and easy to use in your hair, with no tangling.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box and seen how beautiful the packaging was all wrapped in a silk like blanket wrapped with the straightener.</li>
            <li>All of the settings and controls work, and it feels/appears to be pretty good quality equipment.</li>
            <li>Well idk pretty good for a months run.</li>
            <li>I loved the fact that while using this, my hair didn&#x27;t get extremely hot, and leave it feeling fried.</li>
            <li>With this being so quick and easy I can see me taking the time to straighten my hair much more often now!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m all about healthy hair and remaining damage free.  </li>
            <li>loved it so much that I ordered my sister one.</li>
            <li>I have semi-weird hair that has caused much jealousy in my life for people who so effortlessly have gorgeous hair ALL.</li>

            <li>Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It heats up quickly and it&#x27;s the perfect size to do my bangs as well as my entire head.</li>
            <li>I set the temperature for about 300 and still achieved a great look--straight and smooth without being completely flat, which I really liked.</li>
            <li>The other thing I am happy about with this straightener is the price!</li>
            <li>I only had to go over each section one time, which I LOVED!</li>
            <li>I give this a full 5 stars!</li>
            <li>LOL for sure at teenage</li>

            <li>I have fine hair and it pulls it some.  </li>
            <li>I can curl my hair quickly too!</li>
            <li>This product arrived sooner then the expected date and works very good.</li>
            <li>If a hair tool is TOO light, it seems cheap to me.</li>
            <li>but I felt like it is justified</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>hope this helped, and feel free to ask any questions from me in regards to this product</li>
            <li>, I sort of figured that having nice straight hair just wasn&#x27;t in my cards...</li>
            <li>I bought it because it was a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li>Nice, heats up fast, works well.</li>
            <li>When the HSI iron I had been using was stolen, I then purchased this for myself because it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>Great product - I was looking for one of these to seal mylar bags, so I only wanted to spend about $20.</li>
            <li>As you can see in the picture below, my hair went from frizzy poof ball to nice and straight.</li>
            <li>It also came with a fantastic carrying case.  </li>
            <li>and it works perfectly for her as well as my short, stick straight</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: FAST SHIPPING&amp;#60; NO CHIPS&amp;#60; OR BREAKS ON MERCHANDISE &amp;#62;EXCELLENT QUALITY!!!  </li>
            <li>I stand by my original review and add a star for the free replacement.  </li>
            <li>Great flat iron for the price</li>
            <li>The unique ergonomic design features a swivel cord for easy hair curling, a soft grip ensures that you can comfortably hold the flat iron until your perfect look is achieved.</li>
            <li>The carry case, on the other hand, is really pretty and perfect if you travel a lot!</li>
            <li>It does not take long to heat up and works great.</li>
            <li>, I will be more than willing to answer and help out in any way that I can.</li>
            <li>I was excited to put this iron to the test</li>
            <li>You RARELY ever see that!</li>
            <li>You RARELY ever see that!</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair smooth and shiny &amp; It gets very hot... which is fabulous for my hair type.</li>
            <li>I am thoroughly impressed with my new Gurin Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron Hair Straightener.</li>
            <li>I love love love these flat irons  </li>
            <li>, It is actually heavier than I anticipated, but heavy in a sturdy and good material and good plates kind of way.  </li>
            <li>best flat iron thus far</li>
            <li>Happy and works as expected.  </li>
            <li>Very disappointed...Doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly through hair at all!</li>
            <li>and I don’t need it to be 400 degrees, but some days I need the full power of this straighter.  </li>
            <li>My mom really liked it too, so I surprised her with one for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>So I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly and easily I was able to straighten my hair with this straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good deal and found this flat iron on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The Gurin heats up quickly and is adjustable from 240° all the way to 450°.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>No snagging, quick heat-up time.  </li>
            <li>It heats up relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li>The HSI I had before this was quick to use and gave the results I wanted.  </li>
            <li>In my dreams, it looks like nice tousled beach waves, but in reality, I look like I have a head of hair that doesn&#x27;t know if it wants to be curly or straight.</li>
            <li>Does the job, and does it quickly.</li>
            <li>She can do a quick straighten in 10min now</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and straightens hair well.  </li>
            <li>It heated up quickly, again that amazed me.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly.</li>
            <li>Love it Highly Recommend</li>
            <li>I was quite taken by all of the positive reviews but also now see that there were more negatives than I saw at first.</li>
            <li>This worked great for my hair that was already mostly straight, but I knew that I would really have to test it out when I let my hair go naturally wavy before straightening!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The plates were chipped and it snagged my hair on the very first try.</li>
            <li>I also loved that it has a very long cord.  </li>
            <li>Even so, I am happy that I brought it, I have found a heat setting, which is a bit after the half way mark in the range</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, straightens, flips, and curlys hair easily withought damageing your hair.</li>
            <li>Straighteners at mid heat beautifuly and curls are gorgeous at slightly higher heat.</li>
            <li>This flat iron work pretty good on my hair and</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, and with most irons I keep it on a lower setting and only need one or two passes.  </li>
            <li>I also love the super long, swivel cord because it made it so easy to work with and not once did I end up tangled up with the cord or even feel like the cord was in the way.  </li>
            <li>Hair came out straight and smooth.... had body and shine</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>I did receive this complimentary to test and leave my unbiased review.</li>
            <li>It’s not a big deal, except I’m kind of a klutz</li>
            <li>It’s not a big deal, except I’m kind of a klutz</li>
            <li>Overall it is a nice straightener</li>
            <li>I love that it has temperature control because a normal hot iron will not work on my hair.  </li>
            <li>the flat iron bag that comes with it, is cute and useable !</li>
            <li>, that does not produce a lot of smoke when passing through the relaxed or natural hair, yet it works fabulously!</li>
            <li>is that you can adjust the heat settings to as hot as 450 degrees or as cool as 140 degrees F.</li>
            <li>I am able to get the same results at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s already looking pretty straight, and that way I can take it easy on my hair too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s already looking pretty straight, and that way I can take it easy on my hair too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I can tell right away if the iron is worth purchasing or not.</li>
            <li>My hair was super straight and shinier than it&#x27;s ever looked!  </li>
            <li>but it has quickly moved up to the one I reach for first.  </li>
            <li>Nice flat iron</li>
            <li>I want it at , but other than that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I got started right away with the straightening!&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>It does not burn my fine hair and does a nice job of straightening my slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li>It only took about 10 minutes to do my entire head and the results were beautiful.  </li>
            <li>This iron heats up super fast, and has an indicator light when it is ready.</li>
            <li>So light and easy to handle doing entire head by yourself!!!</li>
            <li>The actual straightener is pretty good quality especially since the price was so cheap.</li>
            <li>I thought this Gurin Ceramic Flat Iron Hair Straightener was very easy to hold on to while using it also.</li>
            <li>Overall, a really good flat iron...AND really cheap.  </li>
            <li>I never felt satisfied from any of the hair straightener or curler because all of them used to give temporary results but this hair straightener is just cool for long term results for any of the hair types.</li>
            <li>so it does not tangle whoo hoo, Heats up super fast</li>
            <li>It gets old but my hair looks better straight.  </li>
            <li>the cost was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>For the price I paid I&#x27;m a satisfies customer and would very much recommend this product..</li>
            <li>also shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>My hair is flat as a pancake and very fine</li>
            <li>I tested it&#x27;s results out against my $100+ flat iron, and honestly I couldn&#x27;t tell much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Plus, red is my favorite color.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain too much about that!</li>
            <li>I have only used this to straighten my bangs and it does its job for the most part.</li>
            <li>Instantly transform your hair to silky smooth, shiny and touchable hair in just minutes!</li>
            <li>and I’m just waiting for my first finger burn when I’m in a hurry to turn off the iron.</li>
            <li>and I’m just waiting for my first finger burn when I’m in a hurry to turn off the iron.</li>
            <li>i have A LOT of hair and this iron gets soo hot and straightens so well with no snagging.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast!.  </li>
            <li>Worked great with no snagging and she has THICK hair.</li>
            <li>my hair is pretty curly.</li>
            <li>Handle doesn&#x27;t get too hot to hold even though the plates have heated up to straighten the hair.</li>
            <li>After my first use..this iron is fire!!!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I bought Gurin because it was a great price thinking if it doesn&#x27;t works at least</li>
            <li>That was a first.</li>
            <li>but I have it trained where it is pretty manageable</li>
            <li>I first did a hot oil treatment</li>
            <li>It gets hot when you turn it up</li>
            <li>Recently traveled abroad for 3 weeks &amp; found this most helpful.</li>
            <li>The red satin bag was a really cute accessory, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even the Conair I had bought at Rite Aid was a better buy, even though it only lasted about a year.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>But it works like a charm, hits 450 degrees - more than enough to seal mylar.</li>
            <li>The Gurin Hair Straightener has provided me with reliable, consistent performance day after day with no faulty functioning.</li>
            <li>I tried it at a lower setting the first time, since I had blow-dried my hair already</li>
            <li>I was a bit nervous cranking up the heat on this iron, that it would damage and do the dreaded sizzling of the hair when you use it, but I got absolutely none of that!</li>

            <li>It gives it a silky, smooth finish and it completely takes the frizz away.</li>
            <li>this item does not get hot at all even on the highest setting</li>
            <li>Overall, it works ok.  </li>
            <li>And it comes with a really cute red satin carrying bag.</li>
            <li>works as good if not better then those sold at the mall for right 100 dollars or so,so to me</li>
            <li>I used to use a wide flat iron, but loved how precise the skinnier ones were.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron, does exactly what it states.</li>
            <li>I like a lower heat setting for my bangs because if it&#x27;s too high they will be full of static and just strange looking.</li>
            <li>I love how great this iron works and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality flat iron at low price.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Love the flat iron</li>
            <li>you are better off using a flat iron by Revlon that you can buy at Walmart for $14</li>
            <li>it does what you need it to do, warms up real fast and heats up pretty high</li>
            <li>Over all I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>Over all I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I opened my box to find a beautiful red, silk bag with this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Love the flat iron, it heats up quick, high heat settings good for my thick hair, leaves hair shiny</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smooth the hair and barely straightens.</li>
            <li>With the Gurin Flat Iron I was able to get all my hair under control and straight in 10-15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>and it was already looking pretty straight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used straighteners that costed $100&#x27;s of dollars and this one is every bit as good if not better.</li>
            <li>The carrying case broke when I first used it,but I didn&#x27;t really need it so I doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>This gets hot and ready fast.</li>
            <li>I turn it all the way up for a quick straighten and it still doesn&#x27;t straighten completely.</li>
            <li>My hair looks shiny and healthy, even my horribly dry ends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair looks shiny and healthy, even my horribly dry ends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Heats up a little slower than my older iron, but I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue to use this product in the future and is on the top of my list Straighteners!</li>
            <li>This flat iron is good for long hair.</li>
            <li>The tip of the flat iron lets you get super close especially for thos edges which is always a problem area when going from curly to straight for most women.  </li>
            <li>While I knew it didn&#x27;t have an automatic shutoff as that was properly described, the thermostat does not seem accurate--</li>
            <li>and my hair stays straight.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>And I really like that the flat iron is lightweight and portable enough that I could confidently say that curling or flip-outs would be a breeze!  </li>
            <li>: Doesn&#x27;t glide as smoothly over my hair as my last straightener.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to exchange.</li>
            <li>I was told that the temperature had to be between 400 &amp; 450 to accomplish straight hair for women of color that DO NOT use chemicals to straighten their hair.</li>
            <li>This heats up fast.</li>
            <li>My hair was perfectly straight and it even had a shine to it.</li>
            <li>I feel so much glamour and style in my hair now by using this hair straightener.</li>
            <li>My daughter says it heats up VERY well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never straightened my hair before; I thought my hair WAS straight.</li>
            <li>but just really really really thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent....get your hair really straight....</li>
            <li>Really straightens and leaves my hair shiny.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Much heavier than my chi.</li>
            <li>I have very course, curly hair.</li>
            <li>my Gurin iron was really going to get the test</li>
            <li>cranked the heat setting up on my iron this time, knowing that it would really have to work to get this wavy hair straight.</li>
            <li>I gently started gliding the iron through my hair.  </li>
            <li>It takes forever to get your hair straight, and it was always pulling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This fantastic straighter was not only ceramic</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>For the price, it seems very well made.</li>
            <li>you aren’t 100% satisfied Gurin offers a 100% Money Back Guarantee!</li>
            <li>After borrowing her \\&quot;much\\&quot; more expensive straightener for a while, I decided to get my own.    </li>
            <li>It heated up a lot faster, which was really surprising because it was ready before I was ready to use it, and I like that the blades are narrow, and overall the iron is short which is good for my smaller hands.</li>
            <li>and like you spent a whole lot more time doing</li>
            <li>I have found that this heats right up within a minute or two, which is amazing for those days when you are running late, or thought you turned it on, but really didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The flat iron heats up quickly and I control the temperature!</li>
            <li>The flat iron heats up quickly and I control the temperature!</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t get too hot for my fingers to touch the outside.  </li>
            <li>( I did this because it had been about 6-8 months since I last used heat on my hair and wanted to prevent heat damage), rinsed, applied heat protectant spray by tresseme&#x27; and blow dried, then used this wonderful flat Iron.  </li>
            <li>I have been through so many other straighteners</li>
            <li>There are also other suppliers on Amazon who sell this for a lot more ($57.94 and $89).  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried this many times with other irons and</li>
            <li>This iron works as good as a Chi or FHI, but it is much cheaper, (as was previously stated in a review, which prompted my to purchase---I totally agree!).  </li>
            <li>To my surprise the Gurin did just as good of a job, if not better than my old CHI.</li>
            <li>It simply will not go straight without lots of heat so being able to turn this up to such a high temperature works wonders for me!  </li>
            <li>quick to heat up and cool down.</li>
            <li>i bought it as a second hot tool but its definitely my first choice now and for a price like that it really earned its place.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since the Gurin has ceramic/tourmaline plates and adjustable heat temperature, I’m able to get the hairstyle I WANT in less time than using my curling iron.  </li>
            <li>This one was a bit heavier than I prefer, making me think that it&#x27;s an older design.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a decent backup straightener.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t; this is essentially the same thing but 1/10 the price.</li>
            <li>Especially for the price it honestly is a diamond in the rough.</li>
            <li>That next morning I woke to super wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I LIKE IT BETTER THAN A MORE EXPENSIVE ONE I HAD</li>
            <li>Will keep my Remington as my main straightener though.</li>
            <li>It really leaves my bangs looking shiny and feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>my hair is straight and looks natural!</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I know the 450 setting would be way too high</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own; it is very resistant to styling, and the second it becomes humid out, any previous styling to those hairs is forgotten.</li>
            <li>When I noticed the Gurin iron on sale for 20 dollars I decided to order it - I needed a budget iron that packed a little more punch than the Conair CS27VCS I had been using.</li>
            <li>I have been using a flat iron for a LONG time to get the straight hair look that better suits my preferences, and puts those rebellious hairs in their place.</li>
            <li>This item is not only the same iron as sold under another name with the exact-same material, pattern, etc., it also has the temperature adjustment dial inside where you could easily burn yourself if you needed to adjust the heat--which, in my case, was an issue when I first turned it on as it did not attain the heat it should have despite the light having switched to green, presumably meaning ready.</li>
            <li>The Flat Iron heats up quickly and has a 1.25 inch plate.  </li>
            <li>Super flat iron</li>
            <li>Professional quality without the typical price tag of a good flat iron.</li>
            <li>I can not believe how straight and SOFT my hair was.  </li>
            <li>received complimentary to review only</li>
            <li>hope this iron last a long time :)</li>
            <li>I timed it first time I used it and with no prior blow drying and using it straight on my wavy/curly hair it took me 18 minutes to work it all through.</li>
            <li>The Gurin plates are definitely more narrow.</li>
            <li>sometimes a have a long hair, but most of the time, short hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that if you&#x27;re looking to buy a new straightener, check out #Amazon for the Gurin Ceramic Tourmaline straightner.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is great for all hair types, my daughter has very long, thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li>I am not stuck right next to the outlet in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>The Gurin Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron is better than my old Jilbere flat iron &amp;</li>
            <li>The retailer read this review and is sending a new one in its place.</li>
            <li>will return and try a new one, maybe a defective one.</li>
            <li>i thought i couldnt live without.</li>
            <li>I am somewhat new to straightners but this one is seems to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new one</li>
            <li>But I absolutely live this product.</li>
            <li>The controls are very basic, so you can easily turn the flat iron on and off and adjust the heat setting which ranges from 140°F to 450°F (120°C - 220°C).</li>

            <li>During the winter, my hair gets super dry and frizz is a year-round problem.</li>
            <li>I like the higher heat settings, although everyone is different.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife and she tried it once and said it did not get hot enough to work the way it should.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get hot enough.  </li>
            <li>this one did because they did not get hot enough.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough also wasn&#x27;t an inch.</li>
            <li>, though, it&#x27;s really hot (adjustable), and it does allow for a bit of curling because the outside plastic edges are rounded.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;BUT, I was completely amazed!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m absolutely amazed with this iron and am thrilled that I&#x27;ve found a complete bargain of an iron that does all the heavy-lifting of a super expensive iron!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m absolutely amazed with this iron and am thrilled that I&#x27;ve found a complete bargain of an iron that does all the heavy-lifting of a super expensive iron!</li>
            <li>In comparison to my other flat iron I like this one a bit more.</li>
            <li>It does not get hot enough and the light keep switching between red and green the whole time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t often use flat irons &amp; my last one died after 10 years of mild use but at this price and quality, I&#x27;d be a fool NOT to get a spare.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, only using lowest setting so far &amp; it works on my curly</li>
            <li>I am a natural with 4a-4b hair.  </li>
            <li>The ceramic panels really did make my hair feel softer, smoother and definitely straighter.</li>
            <li>It did not close completely except at the end.</li>
            <li>Doesnt damage my hair as much as my old one</li>
            <li>The hair was soft, shinny and held up the shape until I washed it again.</li>
            <li>For comparison, I held this straightener in between my old Belson Pro and Solia (both of these irons are 1.25 inches).  </li>
            <li>I use it to straighten my daughters natural hair</li>
            <li>My hair is straight and as a plus this iron has a temp control where as the CHI was set at 370; my hair is fragile and I prefer a lower setting.</li>
            <li>for the most part when it is this short it is just fluffy.  </li>
            <li>Love it, I have thick wavy hair</li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy hair that pushes the limits of most drug-store hair irons.</li>
            <li>I previously was using a Babybliss titanium blue colored flat iron worth a lot more than this flat iron.....</li>
            <li>My flat iron is always the last thing packed and it’s still a little to warm to pack on it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very picky about my flat irons...</li>
            <li>I really do like this flat iron</li>
            <li>I have coarse, thick, , type 4, natural African hair that doesn&#x27;t straighten easily, even with a relaxer, but this did the job better than I expected that it would!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used a CHI, but my cord started sparking and it actually sparked the cord right off the flat iron.</li>
            <li>I gave it a few seconds as I slid it down my hair to make sure it would really get all the wave out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are in the market for a flat iron, I would highly recommend this one as it can deliver straight, frizz-free locks or styles with flips and curls after a simple flick of the wrist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick heating and straightens my hair in half the time that it took me before.</li>
            <li>My hair was still soft, even softer than the side I did with my high end flat iron!</li>
            <li>Item takes a long time to straighten my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t stay straight all day.</li>
            <li>I was able to style my hair within 15 minutes - a task that took my old iron at least an hour!</li>
            <li>This flat iron styles my hair better than my CHI that i was using for the past couple of years.</li>
            <li>Now I know when my other daughter is ready for a new straightener (she also has a CHI)</li>
            <li>I love that styling my hair takes only a few minutes from the time I turn the flat iron on to the time I shut it off.</li>
            <li>I am new to straightening my hair as I have always had very short hair or permed hair.</li>
            <li>It also has a &amp;#34;ready&amp;#34; light that is red when you turn it on, and turns green when the iron has reached your desired temperature.</li>
            <li>and the results were not to my liking, my hair would either not be totally straight or would loose it&#x27;s shape and become wavy again after just a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>She ordered this size because apparently the 1.00 and 1.50 make a major difference in the curls?</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this iron for the last few weeks, my hair also looks and feels super healthy too, thanks to the ceramic tourmaline plates you will find on this iron (just like what the uber expensive irons have).</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this iron for the last few weeks, my hair also looks and feels super healthy too, thanks to the ceramic tourmaline plates you will find on this iron (just like what the uber expensive irons have).</li>
            <li>am not very patient with my hair (thats the main reason why I dont ever do anything with it!)</li>
            <li>but simple math will tell you if the high setting is 450 then in the middle of the dial it will be a temperature of 225.  </li>
            <li>I love the barrel size too since I was able to do my bangs and all of those smaller hairs at the base of my hair with no problems at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest too, at $20, I was completely skeptical.</li>
            <li>Bam,  the Gurin Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1.25 inch comes into my life and changes my whole perception and ideas I had on flat iron/hair straighteners!</li>
            <li>If you have the right one it can take just a few minutes to have your hair looking sleek shinny</li>
            <li>The plates of the flat iron are ceramic/tourmaline providing a soft, silky look while saving you time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just as good as some of those expensive ones out there!</li>
            <li>This is why I was so surprised with the results I got from this Gurin Flat Iron!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about sending it back only because my hair is natural</li>
            <li>I like that it is a full size flat iron for less than the price of a mini/travel flat iron.  </li>
            <li>This was a huge disappointment and is same item as sold under another name (HSI).It seemed a bit odd that the top of the box didn&#x27;t even mention the Gurin name at all--</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see the controls inside the flat iron, instead of on the outside.  </li>
            <li>Does EXACTLY what I wanted it to do for so much less!</li>
            <li>I cannot believe the great quality of this flat iron and I am shocked by the low price!  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast less then 5 days.</li>
            <li>I have a natural wave to my hair if I let it air dry.</li>
            <li>However, I have super thick hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me about 5-7 minutes to straighten out my super thick mane, but I was absolutely stunned that this $20 iron was able to pull off some serious straightening of my wavy hair, especially when my hair is already so thick and course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anywho my hair is very curly and tight</li>
            <li>The plates seem as if they could easily grab/snag hair as at least one other consumer mentioned.</li>

            <li> cracked after 2 weeks, very cheap</li>
            <li> Very smooth and makes my hair shine.</li>
            <li> Either they broke quickly or took forever to straighten my hair, and didnt do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good but no auto off and gets very hot on the shell of it.</li>

            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly thru hair at all!</li>

            <li> Could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I tend to lean towards the highest heat setting to save time, although everyone is different, and no two heads of hair are alike, so you can play around with it to find out which setting works best for you.</li>
            <li> I love most about this iron (besides the fact that it works well)</li>
            <li> Like I said, I love the adjustable heat setting on this.</li>

            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this straightener, it looks and feels even better.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s awesome overall, but for me the temp.</li>
            <li> Ordered two more as gifts, I know they will love them.</li>

            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box and seen how beautiful the packaging was all wrapped in a silk like blanket wrapped with the straightener.</li>
            <li> All of the settings and controls work, and it feels/appears to be pretty good quality equipment.</li>
            <li> Well idk pretty good for a months run.</li>
            <li> I loved the fact that while using this, my hair didn&#x27;t get extremely hot, and leave it feeling fried.</li>
            <li> With this being so quick and easy I can see me taking the time to straighten my hair much more often now!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m all about healthy hair and remaining damage free.  </li>
            <li> loved it so much that I ordered my sister one.</li>
            <li> I have semi-weird hair that has caused much jealousy in my life for people who so effortlessly have gorgeous hair ALL.</li>
            <li> I received this item complimentary for the purpose of an honest review on my blog.</li>
            <li> Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It heats up quickly and it&#x27;s the perfect size to do my bangs as well as my entire head.</li>
            <li> I set the temperature for about 300 and still achieved a great look--straight and smooth without being completely flat, which I really liked.</li>
            <li> The other thing I am happy about with this straightener is the price!</li>
            <li> I only had to go over each section one time, which I LOVED!</li>
            <li> I give this a full 5 stars!</li>
            <li> LOL for sure at teenage</li>
            <li> I do, however like the rounded frame, makes it easy to curl as well as straighten.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to turn on and off and change the temperature as needed.</li>

            <li> It straightens my hair easily.</li>

            <li> The shipping was pretty quick and when I got it, it came with a silk bag to put the straightener into I loved it.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and really hot, this excellent for my really course hair!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it pulls it some.  </li>
            <li> I can curl my hair quickly too!</li>
            <li> This product arrived sooner then the expected date and works very good.</li>
            <li> If a hair tool is TOO light, it seems cheap to me.</li>
            <li> but I felt like it is justified</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> hope this helped, and feel free to ask any questions from me in regards to this product</li>
            <li> , I sort of figured that having nice straight hair just wasn&#x27;t in my cards...</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li> Nice, heats up fast, works well.</li>
            <li> When the HSI iron I had been using was stolen, I then purchased this for myself because it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much</li>
            <li> Great product - I was looking for one of these to seal mylar bags, so I only wanted to spend about $20.</li>
            <li> As you can see in the picture below, my hair went from frizzy poof ball to nice and straight.</li>
            <li> It also came with a fantastic carrying case.  </li>
            <li> and it works perfectly for her as well as my short, stick straight</li>

            <li> I stand by my original review and add a star for the free replacement.  </li>
            <li> Great flat iron for the price</li>

            <li> The carry case, on the other hand, is really pretty and perfect if you travel a lot!</li>

            <li> , I will be more than willing to answer and help out in any way that I can.</li>
            <li> I was excited to put this iron to the test</li>
            <li> You RARELY ever see that!</li>
            <li> You RARELY ever see that!</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair smooth and shiny &amp; It gets very hot... which is fabulous for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly impressed with my new Gurin Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron Hair Straightener.</li>
            <li> I love love love these flat irons  </li>
            <li> , It is actually heavier than I anticipated, but heavy in a sturdy and good material and good plates kind of way.  </li>
            <li> best flat iron thus far</li>
            <li> Happy and works as expected.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed...Doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly through hair at all!</li>
            <li> and I don’t need it to be 400 degrees, but some days I need the full power of this straighter.  </li>
            <li> My mom really liked it too, so I surprised her with one for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> So I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly and easily I was able to straighten my hair with this straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good deal and found this flat iron on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The Gurin heats up quickly and is adjustable from 240° all the way to 450°.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> No snagging, quick heat-up time.  </li>
            <li> It heats up relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li> The HSI I had before this was quick to use and gave the results I wanted.  </li>
            <li> In my dreams, it looks like nice tousled beach waves, but in reality, I look like I have a head of hair that doesn&#x27;t know if it wants to be curly or straight.</li>
            <li> Does the job, and does it quickly.</li>
            <li> She can do a quick straighten in 10min now</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and straightens hair well.  </li>
            <li> It heated up quickly, again that amazed me.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly.</li>
            <li> Love it Highly Recommend</li>
            <li> I was quite taken by all of the positive reviews but also now see that there were more negatives than I saw at first.</li>
            <li> This worked great for my hair that was already mostly straight, but I knew that I would really have to test it out when I let my hair go naturally wavy before straightening!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The plates were chipped and it snagged my hair on the very first try.</li>
            <li> I also loved that it has a very long cord.  </li>
            <li> Even so, I am happy that I brought it, I have found a heat setting, which is a bit after the half way mark in the range</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, straightens, flips, and curlys hair easily withought damageing your hair.</li>
            <li> Straighteners at mid heat beautifuly and curls are gorgeous at slightly higher heat.</li>
            <li> This flat iron work pretty good on my hair and</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, and with most irons I keep it on a lower setting and only need one or two passes.  </li>
            <li> I also love the super long, swivel cord because it made it so easy to work with and not once did I end up tangled up with the cord or even feel like the cord was in the way.  </li>
            <li> Hair came out straight and smooth.... had body and shine</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> I did receive this complimentary to test and leave my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> It’s not a big deal, except I’m kind of a klutz</li>
            <li> It’s not a big deal, except I’m kind of a klutz</li>
            <li> Overall it is a nice straightener</li>
            <li> I love that it has temperature control because a normal hot iron will not work on my hair.  </li>
            <li> the flat iron bag that comes with it, is cute and useable !</li>
            <li> , that does not produce a lot of smoke when passing through the relaxed or natural hair, yet it works fabulously!</li>
            <li> is that you can adjust the heat settings to as hot as 450 degrees or as cool as 140 degrees F.</li>
            <li> I am able to get the same results at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already looking pretty straight, and that way I can take it easy on my hair too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already looking pretty straight, and that way I can take it easy on my hair too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can tell right away if the iron is worth purchasing or not.</li>
            <li> My hair was super straight and shinier than it&#x27;s ever looked!  </li>
            <li> but it has quickly moved up to the one I reach for first.  </li>
            <li> Nice flat iron</li>
            <li> I want it at , but other than that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I got started right away with the straightening!&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> It does not burn my fine hair and does a nice job of straightening my slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It only took about 10 minutes to do my entire head and the results were beautiful.  </li>
            <li> This iron heats up super fast, and has an indicator light when it is ready.</li>
            <li> So light and easy to handle doing entire head by yourself!!!</li>
            <li> The actual straightener is pretty good quality especially since the price was so cheap.</li>
            <li> I thought this Gurin Ceramic Flat Iron Hair Straightener was very easy to hold on to while using it also.</li>
            <li> Overall, a really good flat iron...AND really cheap.  </li>
            <li> I never felt satisfied from any of the hair straightener or curler because all of them used to give temporary results but this hair straightener is just cool for long term results for any of the hair types.</li>
            <li> so it does not tangle whoo hoo, Heats up super fast</li>
            <li> It gets old but my hair looks better straight.  </li>
            <li> the cost was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> For the price I paid I&#x27;m a satisfies customer and would very much recommend this product..</li>
            <li> also shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> My hair is flat as a pancake and very fine</li>
            <li> I tested it&#x27;s results out against my $100+ flat iron, and honestly I couldn&#x27;t tell much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Plus, red is my favorite color.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain too much about that!</li>
            <li> I have only used this to straighten my bangs and it does its job for the most part.</li>
            <li> Instantly transform your hair to silky smooth, shiny and touchable hair in just minutes!</li>
            <li> and I’m just waiting for my first finger burn when I’m in a hurry to turn off the iron.</li>
            <li> and I’m just waiting for my first finger burn when I’m in a hurry to turn off the iron.</li>
            <li> i have A LOT of hair and this iron gets soo hot and straightens so well with no snagging.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast!.  </li>
            <li> Worked great with no snagging and she has THICK hair.</li>
            <li> my hair is pretty curly.</li>
            <li> Handle doesn&#x27;t get too hot to hold even though the plates have heated up to straighten the hair.</li>
            <li> After my first use..this iron is fire!!!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I bought Gurin because it was a great price thinking if it doesn&#x27;t works at least</li>
            <li> That was a first.</li>
            <li> but I have it trained where it is pretty manageable</li>
            <li> I first did a hot oil treatment</li>
            <li> It gets hot when you turn it up</li>
            <li> Recently traveled abroad for 3 weeks &amp; found this most helpful.</li>
            <li> The red satin bag was a really cute accessory, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even the Conair I had bought at Rite Aid was a better buy, even though it only lasted about a year.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well.</li>
            <li> But it works like a charm, hits 450 degrees - more than enough to seal mylar.</li>
            <li> The Gurin Hair Straightener has provided me with reliable, consistent performance day after day with no faulty functioning.</li>
            <li> I tried it at a lower setting the first time, since I had blow-dried my hair already</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous cranking up the heat on this iron, that it would damage and do the dreaded sizzling of the hair when you use it, but I got absolutely none of that!</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous cranking up the heat on this iron, that it would damage and do the dreaded sizzling of the hair when you use it, but I got absolutely none of that!</li>
            <li> It gives it a silky, smooth finish and it completely takes the frizz away.</li>
            <li> this item does not get hot at all even on the highest setting</li>
            <li> Overall, it works ok.  </li>
            <li> And it comes with a really cute red satin carrying bag.</li>
            <li> works as good if not better then those sold at the mall for right 100 dollars or so,so to me</li>
            <li> I used to use a wide flat iron, but loved how precise the skinnier ones were.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron, does exactly what it states.</li>
            <li> I like a lower heat setting for my bangs because if it&#x27;s too high they will be full of static and just strange looking.</li>
            <li> I love how great this iron works and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality flat iron at low price.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Love the flat iron</li>
            <li> you are better off using a flat iron by Revlon that you can buy at Walmart for $14</li>
            <li> it does what you need it to do, warms up real fast and heats up pretty high</li>
            <li> Over all I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> Over all I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I opened my box to find a beautiful red, silk bag with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Love the flat iron, it heats up quick, high heat settings good for my thick hair, leaves hair shiny</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smooth the hair and barely straightens.</li>
            <li> With the Gurin Flat Iron I was able to get all my hair under control and straight in 10-15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> and it was already looking pretty straight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used straighteners that costed $100&#x27;s of dollars and this one is every bit as good if not better.</li>
            <li> The carrying case broke when I first used it,but I didn&#x27;t really need it so I doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> This gets hot and ready fast.</li>
            <li> I turn it all the way up for a quick straighten and it still doesn&#x27;t straighten completely.</li>
            <li> My hair looks shiny and healthy, even my horribly dry ends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair looks shiny and healthy, even my horribly dry ends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heats up a little slower than my older iron, but I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to use this product in the future and is on the top of my list Straighteners!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is good for long hair.</li>
            <li> The tip of the flat iron lets you get super close especially for thos edges which is always a problem area when going from curly to straight for most women.  </li>
            <li> While I knew it didn&#x27;t have an automatic shutoff as that was properly described, the thermostat does not seem accurate--</li>
            <li> and my hair stays straight.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> And I really like that the flat iron is lightweight and portable enough that I could confidently say that curling or flip-outs would be a breeze!  </li>
            <li> : Doesn&#x27;t glide as smoothly over my hair as my last straightener.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to exchange.</li>
            <li> I was told that the temperature had to be between 400 &amp; 450 to accomplish straight hair for women of color that DO NOT use chemicals to straighten their hair.</li>
            <li> This heats up fast.</li>
            <li> My hair was perfectly straight and it even had a shine to it.</li>
            <li> I feel so much glamour and style in my hair now by using this hair straightener.</li>
            <li> My daughter says it heats up VERY well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never straightened my hair before; I thought my hair WAS straight.</li>
            <li> but just really really really thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent....get your hair really straight....</li>
            <li> Really straightens and leaves my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Much heavier than my chi.</li>
            <li> I have very course, curly hair.</li>
            <li> my Gurin iron was really going to get the test</li>
            <li> cranked the heat setting up on my iron this time, knowing that it would really have to work to get this wavy hair straight.</li>
            <li> I gently started gliding the iron through my hair.  </li>
            <li> It takes forever to get your hair straight, and it was always pulling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This fantastic straighter was not only ceramic</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> For the price, it seems very well made.</li>
            <li> you aren’t 100% satisfied Gurin offers a 100% Money Back Guarantee!</li>
            <li> After borrowing her \\&quot;much\\&quot; more expensive straightener for a while, I decided to get my own.    </li>
            <li> It heated up a lot faster, which was really surprising because it was ready before I was ready to use it, and I like that the blades are narrow, and overall the iron is short which is good for my smaller hands.</li>
            <li> and like you spent a whole lot more time doing</li>
            <li> I have found that this heats right up within a minute or two, which is amazing for those days when you are running late, or thought you turned it on, but really didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The flat iron heats up quickly and I control the temperature!</li>
            <li> The flat iron heats up quickly and I control the temperature!</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t get too hot for my fingers to touch the outside.  </li>
            <li> ( I did this because it had been about 6-8 months since I last used heat on my hair and wanted to prevent heat damage), rinsed, applied heat protectant spray by tresseme&#x27; and blow dried, then used this wonderful flat Iron.  </li>
            <li> I have been through so many other straighteners</li>
            <li> There are also other suppliers on Amazon who sell this for a lot more ($57.94 and $89).  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried this many times with other irons and</li>
            <li> This iron works as good as a Chi or FHI, but it is much cheaper, (as was previously stated in a review, which prompted my to purchase---I totally agree!).  </li>
            <li> To my surprise the Gurin did just as good of a job, if not better than my old CHI.</li>
            <li> It simply will not go straight without lots of heat so being able to turn this up to such a high temperature works wonders for me!  </li>
            <li> quick to heat up and cool down.</li>
            <li> i bought it as a second hot tool but its definitely my first choice now and for a price like that it really earned its place.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the Gurin has ceramic/tourmaline plates and adjustable heat temperature, I’m able to get the hairstyle I WANT in less time than using my curling iron.  </li>
            <li> This one was a bit heavier than I prefer, making me think that it&#x27;s an older design.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a decent backup straightener.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t; this is essentially the same thing but 1/10 the price.</li>
            <li> Especially for the price it honestly is a diamond in the rough.</li>
            <li> That next morning I woke to super wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT BETTER THAN A MORE EXPENSIVE ONE I HAD</li>
            <li> Will keep my Remington as my main straightener though.</li>
            <li> It really leaves my bangs looking shiny and feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> my hair is straight and looks natural!</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I know the 450 setting would be way too high</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own; it is very resistant to styling, and the second it becomes humid out, any previous styling to those hairs is forgotten.</li>
            <li> When I noticed the Gurin iron on sale for 20 dollars I decided to order it - I needed a budget iron that packed a little more punch than the Conair CS27VCS I had been using.</li>
            <li> I have been using a flat iron for a LONG time to get the straight hair look that better suits my preferences, and puts those rebellious hairs in their place.</li>
            <li> This item is not only the same iron as sold under another name with the exact-same material, pattern, etc., it also has the temperature adjustment dial inside where you could easily burn yourself if you needed to adjust the heat--which, in my case, was an issue when I first turned it on as it did not attain the heat it should have despite the light having switched to green, presumably meaning ready.</li>
            <li> The Flat Iron heats up quickly and has a 1.25 inch plate.  </li>
            <li> Super flat iron</li>
            <li> Professional quality without the typical price tag of a good flat iron.</li>
            <li> I can not believe how straight and SOFT my hair was.  </li>
            <li> received complimentary to review only</li>
            <li> hope this iron last a long time :)</li>
            <li> I timed it first time I used it and with no prior blow drying and using it straight on my wavy/curly hair it took me 18 minutes to work it all through.</li>
            <li> The Gurin plates are definitely more narrow.</li>
            <li> sometimes a have a long hair, but most of the time, short hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that if you&#x27;re looking to buy a new straightener, check out #Amazon for the Gurin Ceramic Tourmaline straightner.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is great for all hair types, my daughter has very long, thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> I am not stuck right next to the outlet in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> The Gurin Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron is better than my old Jilbere flat iron &amp;</li>
            <li> The retailer read this review and is sending a new one in its place.</li>
            <li> will return and try a new one, maybe a defective one.</li>
            <li> i thought i couldnt live without.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat new to straightners but this one is seems to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new one</li>
            <li> But I absolutely live this product.</li>
            <li> The controls are very basic, so you can easily turn the flat iron on and off and adjust the heat setting which ranges from 140°F to 450°F (120°C - 220°C).</li>

            <li> During the winter, my hair gets super dry and frizz is a year-round problem.</li>
            <li> I like the higher heat settings, although everyone is different.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she tried it once and said it did not get hot enough to work the way it should.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get hot enough.  </li>
            <li> this one did because they did not get hot enough.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough also wasn&#x27;t an inch.</li>
            <li> , though, it&#x27;s really hot (adjustable), and it does allow for a bit of curling because the outside plastic edges are rounded.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;BUT, I was completely amazed!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m absolutely amazed with this iron and am thrilled that I&#x27;ve found a complete bargain of an iron that does all the heavy-lifting of a super expensive iron!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m absolutely amazed with this iron and am thrilled that I&#x27;ve found a complete bargain of an iron that does all the heavy-lifting of a super expensive iron!</li>
            <li> In comparison to my other flat iron I like this one a bit more.</li>
            <li> It does not get hot enough and the light keep switching between red and green the whole time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often use flat irons &amp; my last one died after 10 years of mild use but at this price and quality, I&#x27;d be a fool NOT to get a spare.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, only using lowest setting so far &amp; it works on my curly</li>
            <li> I am a natural with 4a-4b hair.  </li>
            <li> The ceramic panels really did make my hair feel softer, smoother and definitely straighter.</li>
            <li> It did not close completely except at the end.</li>
            <li> Doesnt damage my hair as much as my old one</li>
            <li> The hair was soft, shinny and held up the shape until I washed it again.</li>
            <li> For comparison, I held this straightener in between my old Belson Pro and Solia (both of these irons are 1.25 inches).  </li>
            <li> I use it to straighten my daughters natural hair</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and as a plus this iron has a temp control where as the CHI was set at 370; my hair is fragile and I prefer a lower setting.</li>
            <li> for the most part when it is this short it is just fluffy.  </li>
            <li> Love it, I have thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair that pushes the limits of most drug-store hair irons.</li>
            <li> I previously was using a Babybliss titanium blue colored flat iron worth a lot more than this flat iron.....</li>
            <li> My flat iron is always the last thing packed and it’s still a little to warm to pack on it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very picky about my flat irons...</li>
            <li> I really do like this flat iron</li>
            <li> I have coarse, thick, , type 4, natural African hair that doesn&#x27;t straighten easily, even with a relaxer, but this did the job better than I expected that it would!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used a CHI, but my cord started sparking and it actually sparked the cord right off the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I gave it a few seconds as I slid it down my hair to make sure it would really get all the wave out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a flat iron, I would highly recommend this one as it can deliver straight, frizz-free locks or styles with flips and curls after a simple flick of the wrist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick heating and straightens my hair in half the time that it took me before.</li>
            <li> My hair was still soft, even softer than the side I did with my high end flat iron!</li>
            <li> Item takes a long time to straighten my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t stay straight all day.</li>
            <li> I was able to style my hair within 15 minutes - a task that took my old iron at least an hour!</li>
            <li> This flat iron styles my hair better than my CHI that i was using for the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> Now I know when my other daughter is ready for a new straightener (she also has a CHI)</li>
            <li> I love that styling my hair takes only a few minutes from the time I turn the flat iron on to the time I shut it off.</li>
            <li> I am new to straightening my hair as I have always had very short hair or permed hair.</li>
            <li> It also has a &amp;#34;ready&amp;#34; light that is red when you turn it on, and turns green when the iron has reached your desired temperature.</li>
            <li> and the results were not to my liking, my hair would either not be totally straight or would loose it&#x27;s shape and become wavy again after just a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> She ordered this size because apparently the 1.00 and 1.50 make a major difference in the curls?</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this iron for the last few weeks, my hair also looks and feels super healthy too, thanks to the ceramic tourmaline plates you will find on this iron (just like what the uber expensive irons have).</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this iron for the last few weeks, my hair also looks and feels super healthy too, thanks to the ceramic tourmaline plates you will find on this iron (just like what the uber expensive irons have).</li>
            <li> am not very patient with my hair (thats the main reason why I dont ever do anything with it!)</li>
            <li> but simple math will tell you if the high setting is 450 then in the middle of the dial it will be a temperature of 225.  </li>
            <li> I love the barrel size too since I was able to do my bangs and all of those smaller hairs at the base of my hair with no problems at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest too, at $20, I was completely skeptical.</li>
            <li> Bam,  the Gurin Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1.25 inch comes into my life and changes my whole perception and ideas I had on flat iron/hair straighteners!</li>
            <li> If you have the right one it can take just a few minutes to have your hair looking sleek shinny</li>
            <li> The plates of the flat iron are ceramic/tourmaline providing a soft, silky look while saving you time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just as good as some of those expensive ones out there!</li>
            <li> This is why I was so surprised with the results I got from this Gurin Flat Iron!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about sending it back only because my hair is natural</li>
            <li> I like that it is a full size flat iron for less than the price of a mini/travel flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This was a huge disappointment and is same item as sold under another name (HSI).It seemed a bit odd that the top of the box didn&#x27;t even mention the Gurin name at all--</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see the controls inside the flat iron, instead of on the outside.  </li>
            <li> Does EXACTLY what I wanted it to do for so much less!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe the great quality of this flat iron and I am shocked by the low price!  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast less then 5 days.</li>
            <li> I have a natural wave to my hair if I let it air dry.</li>
            <li> However, I have super thick hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me about 5-7 minutes to straighten out my super thick mane, but I was absolutely stunned that this $20 iron was able to pull off some serious straightening of my wavy hair, especially when my hair is already so thick and course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anywho my hair is very curly and tight</li>
            <li> The plates seem as if they could easily grab/snag hair as at least one other consumer mentioned.</li>
            <li> Sticky grips on handle aren&#x27;t great around hair strands; leaves my hair limp compared to the other straightener that I unfortunately had to toss because the coating on the plate was falling off.</li>
            <li> most of them fail to get my wavy hair completely straight, especially when they cost so little!</li>
            <li> The flat iron is heavy duty and very well made.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very short, and this flat iron works very well to tame my unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have had several flat irons over the years.  </li>
            <li> I broke my last one which was a Biosilk Tourmaline flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I think this flat iron is slightly above drugstore quality.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron for my sister as a Christmas present.  </li>
            <li> It used to be curly but with all the grays it now has a wiry wave which the Gurin flat iron totally dominates!</li>
            <li> You no need expend a lot of money , with this flat iron you can have in home the same that you expend in the salon</li>
            <li> I recently had the chance to review a Gurin 1.25&amp;#34; Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li> I had a CHI flat iron for several years, which I accidentally broke.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and live is an area of high humidity</li>

            <li> I have frizzy hair &amp; within 10 min my entire head is flat &amp; sleek!</li>
            <li> However, there is no real thermostat other than the low temp and high temp (450 degrees).  </li>
            <li> - the only regret I have is that I didn&#x27;t a larger size, because I do have long hair.  </li>
            <li> The Gurin Flat Iron has ceramic/tourmaline plates that are 1¼” which is perfection for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the flat iron to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Once you get use to the barrel of this flat iron</li>
            <li> Believe it or not Gurin Factory Website list this flat iron at $199 MSRP.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loves this flat iron.</li>
            <li> If you need a flat iron that will reach 450 degrees.</li>
            <li> It feels like the flat iron my beautician used and</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive  Flat Iron/Hair Straightener this product is your answer.</li>
            <li> so I guess that&#x27;s all that matters when it comes to a flat iron hair straightener.</li>
            <li> Long story short, the Gurin iron exceeded all expectations.</li>
            <li> I did not plan on writing such a long review........</li>
            <li> At 15 bucks this flat iron is a steal!  </li>
            <li> I received the Gurin Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron Hair Straightener to review!  </li>
            <li> When I use my Gurin Flat Iron I have silky shiny hair!!</li>
            <li> Like most my hair can get crazy, but</li>
            <li> Definitely not professional quality.  </li>
            <li> This Gurin does not completely straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> Ive tried straightening it before, but since it is so thick it took close to an hour to get my whole head done.</li>
            <li> dry and flat-iron my hair everyday since it is naturally curly.  </li>
            <li> so it looks quite generic like what you&#x27;d find in a dollar store though other parts were branded.</li>
            <li> Used a little product, blow dried straight and then straightened</li>
            <li> I used to use a wide flat iron, but coveted the preciseness of the skinnier ones.</li>
            <li> It leaves our hair shiny and just 1-2 passes is needed, of course with the help of a couple of other staple straightening products, such as heat protectant!  </li>
            <li> I have very strange hair.  </li>
            <li> If I blow dry it, it looks poofy all around, and for some reason, the hairs on the underside always try to curl or wave or do whatever the rest of my hair is NOT doing.</li>
            <li> I have never had that issue with any other flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have never had that issue with any other flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Bought this flat iron a few months back and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that this iron did not have numbered heat settings, but that was my own fault for not examining the box closely before putting it in my cart.  </li>
            <li> Knob is really loose and gets off the setting</li>
            <li> As always my Mom had a slight bit of frizz left to her hair, but nothing that some argon oil won&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> My hair can be super difficult to strengthen</li>
            <li> First off I must disclaim, I dont often straighten my hair because of how time consuming it is, my hair is long and thick!!</li>
            <li> For the price it was not a major loss, but it&#x27;s frustrating having to buy a third flat iron in the last 6 months.</li>
            <li> very thick, wavy hair &amp; this flat-iron was very helpful in &#x27;taming&#x27; my mane.  </li>
            <li> Was looking for a flat iron that straightens black nonchemical treated hair.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to say the least.</li>
            <li> The next thing I noticed was how heavy this iron is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds, YES</li>
            <li> Not really curly but definitely not straight either.  </li>
            <li> Not really what I wanted</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> shipping on the other hand took a few extra days to deliver</li>
            <li> Easy to use except for the controls as they are located inside the straightener and very difficult to get to.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it doesn&#x27;t have tight seal on the hair as you move down to straighten your hair.</li>
            <li> The  Gurin Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron Hair is helping to tame my hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to other naturals with 4 hair.</li>
            <li> I do agree with other reviews about the location of the settings button;  </li>
            <li> Sorry, mall kiosky guy, but thanks for doing my hair!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been graying since I was 9, which means my hair is extremely unruly.</li>
            <li> I wish I had listened other reviews.</li>
            <li> I use this flat iron almost everyday, and I have run into zero problems!</li>
            <li> I use this flat iron almost everyday, and I have run into zero problems!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with long, very thick &amp; wavy hair, but my gf likes it straightened.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is wish it came in a wider size.</li>
            <li> You basically have to guess at temperatures, which sucks if you have a specific temperature you like to use when straightening your hair.  </li>
            <li> Was not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It does not heat up to the temperature it says, it does not help my thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Other than that, no complaints!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy/curly hair and every time I tried to straighten my hair using other tools it took up to one hour</li>
            <li> : I will admit not seeing the numbers on the temperature setting was slightly a bummer.</li>
            <li> Straightened my hair in half the time</li>
            <li> the on/off switch is a little hidden.  </li>
            <li> I can crank it up when my hair is already wavy, or turn it down when I&#x27;ve blow dried my hair</li>
            <li> I can crank it up when my hair is already wavy, or turn it down when I&#x27;ve blow dried my hair</li>
            <li> On the not so positive side, I found the dial and the ON/OFF switch awkwardly place, in between the prongs.</li>
            <li> I was never able to do that with my other straighteners.</li>
            <li> Some guy tricked me into sitting at his little kiosk in the mall while he straightened my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a little picky</li>
            <li> NOT A GOOD FLAT IRON.</li>
            <li> so this gives me a little added lift.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d drop it and burn myself, since I have a little neuropathy in my hands, but that hasn&#x27;t been the case.</li>
            <li> Heats up very well but buttons placed in a inconvenient spot.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret the few dollars you spend.</li>
            <li> It is not smooth when in use.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to get into the hard to reach sections behind my ears, which is hard to do with the bigger irons without getting burned.  </li>
            <li> I turned the dial past the half way mark</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay hot, which makes it nearly impossible to use.  </li>
            <li> When I do use a hair product in the past I have found my other iron to get slick, but with the grips on the Gurin handle</li>
            <li> &#x27;cause it pulled hair, 2nd &#x27;cause of stupid placement of switches-(laughing at myself...read my other review &amp; you&#x27;ll get it), &amp; 3rd couldn&#x27;t justify the cost.    </li>
            <li> When I am on the road not I don’t have to worry about the cords and the space, this takes up very little room in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so not sure I would trust it to not pose a danger.</li>
            <li> hair hangs just an inch past my shoulder.  </li>
            <li> the root which is where my problem usually is.  </li>
            <li> If you use small sections of hair it will straighten on one pass.  </li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed even if you had paid a much higher price for it.</li>
            <li> I found this one steeply discounted from about $200, not sure why.</li>
            <li> I have made the mistake in the past of buying a hair strainer that was not ceramic.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and extremely course.</li>
            <li> My Mom has thin hair, but extremely frizzy.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with product because it does not straighten my hair and this hair straightener feels and looks cheap</li>
            <li> the controls are on the inside and hard to get to or read</li>
            <li> ended up with dull looking hair at 450..</li>
            <li> and it was hard to select online....</li>
            <li> people complained about the placement of the heat control.  </li>
            <li> and I have been using a Remington hair straightener, or at least attempted to use a hair straightener</li>
            <li> and Ive spent alot on expensive ones</li>
            <li> Although shipping was slow, the product itself is well made and performs.</li>
            <li> and I have thick  shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> It is weird that the on-off and heat control is inside, as I read on other reviews, but with caution you don&#x27;t burn yourself.</li>
            <li> I envy the long, shiny, frizz-free look, and, while I do not have curly hair, I have stubborn hair that is dangerously persuaded by the weather.</li>
            <li> that only normally a very expensive iron can do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried very expensive flat irons that did not work for me as well as</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good for thin hair, pulling on it somewhat, while also having a hard time holding hair between the plates.  </li>
            <li> Quality sucks!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s medium length and very hard to straighten.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very thick and has a mind of</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thin curly hair and it worked for me.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t make ribbon curls with thin hair</li>
            <li> have owned, in the past, very expensive straighteners -</li>
            <li> It was kinda difficult to maneuver my hand in to adjust the temperature while the tool was still on</li>
            <li> I can see how that would be a possibility in a careless moment.  </li>
            <li> Yes I had purchased twice before those expensive ones, and always ended up with problems with them...</li>
            <li> Ordered wrong size &amp; had to return.  </li>
            <li> The reviews I read were completely wrong.</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair maybe once or twice a month, so I didn&#x27;t need to shell out for something expensive.</li>
            <li> Boy that was the wrong thing to do.  </li>
            <li> It is probably one of the worst flat irons I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> TERRIBLE FLAT IRON</li>
            <li> and I was a bit afraid that I would end up burning my hand.</li>
            <li> Disappointing...</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s awkward, once you set it, there&#x27;s no need to adjust it,</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> I almost bought his stupid, expensive hair straightener on the spot.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this it pulls my hair, leaving me with a very uncomfortable experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to leave a bad review</li>
            <li> it pulls your hair, have not seen any iron as bad as this...</li>
            <li> I didn’t want you to think I was deathly ill!!</li>
            <li> Worst piece of crap I ever bought.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this product!</li>
            <li> Horrible product!</li>

            <li> This was a huge disappointment and is same item as sold under another name (HSI).It seemed a bit odd that the top of the box didn&#x27;t even mention the Gurin name at all--so it looks quite generic like what you&#x27;d find in a dollar store though other parts were branded. I was quite taken by all of the positive reviews but also now see that there were more negatives than I saw at first. This item is not only the same iron as sold under another name with the exact-same material, pattern, etc., it also has the temperature adjustment dial inside where you could easily burn yourself if you needed to adjust the heat--which, in my case, was an issue when I first turned it on as it did not attain the heat it should have despite the light having switched to green, presumably meaning ready. The plates seem as if they could easily grab/snag hair as at least one other consumer mentioned. While I knew it didn&#x27;t have an automatic shutoff as that was properly described, the thermostat does not seem accurate--so not sure I would trust it to not pose a danger.</li>
            <li> UPDATE - The retailer read this review and is sending a new one in its place. 5 stars for customer service! I stand by my original review and add a star for the free replacement.  (I did not even ask, they based their response on my review and sent me a message)    I liked it when it worked, I would of given it a 4/5 stars bc the controls are on the inside and hard to get to or read / see.  I got it in July, I use it Maybe once a week - twice at the most, it is now October and the thing has died. It is \\&quot;no longer eligible for return\\&quot; should have known the good price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener. I use it every day and my hair is like silk. I have thick long hair and live is an area of high humidity and my hair stays straight. I have been through so many other straighteners but they don&#x27;t work as well as this one.</li>
            <li> I am a natural with 4a-4b hair.  This flat iron work pretty good on my hair and the cost was very reasonable.  I would recommend this product to other naturals with 4 hair.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money and it only tskes one time to straighten my hair. takes me 15 Minutes tops! would buy again! shipping on the other hand took a few extra days to deliver but I still appreciate it!</li>
            <li> I used to use a wide flat iron, but loved how precise the skinnier ones were. I use this flat iron almost everyday, and I have run into zero problems! The controls are very basic, so you can easily turn the flat iron on and off and adjust the heat setting which ranges from 140°F to 450°F (120°C - 220°C). I like the higher heat settings, although everyone is different.</li>
            <li> Could not wait to get this item, especially after reading the reviews!  I love it......its very smooth and easy to use in your hair, with no tangling.  It is nice size an weight;  it comes wrapped in bubble wrap and with a travel bag. I do agree with other reviews about the location of the settings button;  its in a inconvient area.  However the location comes in handy to prevent you from changing the settings in error.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I opened my box to find a beautiful red, silk bag with this flat iron. It&#x27;s nice to carry it in a fashionable way. Plus, red is my favorite color. I can&#x27;t complain too much about that! haha. The next thing I noticed was how heavy this iron is. If a hair tool is TOO light, it seems cheap to me. This one was a bit heavier than I prefer, making me think that it&#x27;s an older design. I have only used this to straighten my bangs and it does its job for the most part. I like that I can adjust the temperature with the knob on the inside of the iron. I like a lower heat setting for my bangs because if it&#x27;s too high they will be full of static and just strange looking. It really leaves my bangs looking shiny and feeling very soft. My biggest concern is the fact that the darn plates pull my hair. Every time I use this it pulls my hair, leaving me with a very uncomfortable experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like that it leaves my hair shiny and I like the temperature settings. I give this 3 stars because I don&#x27;t like the weight of the straightener or the fact that it pulls my hair. I think it&#x27;s a decent backup straightener. I did receive this complimentary to test and leave my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> It is awesome per teenage daughter. She ordered this size because apparently the 1.00 and 1.50 make a major difference in the curls? LOL for sure at teenage girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it doesn&#x27;t trip the breaker and that my teen is happy with her hair styles! This item was provided to me through a discount coupon or gift card.</li>
            <li> When reviewing hair straighteners I always used to use it on my own hair, but now going through chemo my hair isn&#x27;t an issue anymore so I use my Mom as a test tool. My Mom has thin hair, but extremely frizzy. She hates her curly hair and likes it when I straighten it for her and fix her up. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box and seen how beautiful the packaging was all wrapped in a silk like blanket wrapped with the straightener. When using the straightener I must admit I&#x27;ve always been attached to the CHI&#x27;s and I have to say this Gurin Hair Straightener held up just as good and left my Mom very happy. As always my Mom had a slight bit of frizz left to her hair, but nothing that some argon oil won&#x27;t fix. I like the way the heating is set up and how simple the design is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used a CHI, but my cord started sparking and it actually sparked the cord right off the flat iron. I wanted to try this one because of the low price and I love it. It works just as good as the CHI did.</li>
            <li> During the winter, my hair gets super dry and frizz is a year-round problem. So I decided to test if a straightener helped with that! The ceramic panels really did make my hair feel softer, smoother and definitely straighter. I set the temperature for about 300 and still achieved a great look--straight and smooth without being completely flat, which I really liked. And I really like that the flat iron is lightweight and portable enough that I could confidently say that curling or flip-outs would be a breeze!  On the not so positive side, I found the dial and the ON/OFF switch awkwardly place, in between the prongs. It was kinda difficult to maneuver my hand in to adjust the temperature while the tool was still on and I was a bit afraid that I would end up burning my hand. I can see how that would be a possibility in a careless moment.  The carry case, on the other hand, is really pretty and perfect if you travel a lot!</li>
            <li> This product arrived sooner then the expected date and works very good. For the price I paid I&#x27;m a satisfies customer and would very much recommend this product..</li>
            <li> I love love love these flat irons  My hair is very thick and extremely course. It has made my hair look like I have just came out of the hair salon. I have been l</li>
            <li> ended up with dull looking hair at 450..took a while to heat. will return and try a new one, maybe a defective one.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly impressed with my new Gurin Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron Hair Straightener. The Gurin heats up quickly and is adjustable from 240° all the way to 450°. The Gurin Flat Iron has ceramic/tourmaline plates that are 1¼” which is perfection for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair hangs just an inch past my shoulder.  When I use my Gurin Flat Iron I have silky shiny hair!! I use the flat iron to curl my hair. I can curl my hair quickly too! The size is perfect for hair; even my bangs. If you want to straighten your hair the Gurin will do a great job there too! Instantly transform your hair to silky smooth, shiny and touchable hair in just minutes! The unique ergonomic design features a swivel cord for easy hair curling, a soft grip ensures that you can comfortably hold the flat iron until your perfect look is achieved. Ceramic plates heat up evenly and within seconds. I only have to glide the Gurin through my hair one time to get the curl I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the Gurin has ceramic/tourmaline plates and adjustable heat temperature, I’m able to get the hairstyle I WANT in less time than using my curling iron.  This curling iron is great for all hair types, my daughter has very long, thick, wavy hair and it works perfectly for her as well as my short, stick straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to get creative with the cropping of these photo’s! For some reason my face came out very yellow! I didn’t want you to think I was deathly ill!! Gesh!! No morning hair here…. but definitely morning face!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you aren’t 100% satisfied Gurin offers a 100% Money Back Guarantee! You can’t beat that! Even more to love is the bright red carrying case; it’s a very nice touch. It’s also lined; which great when I’m packing. My flat iron is always the last thing packed and it’s still a little to warm to pack on it’s own. In the lined pouch I don’t worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHINES&lt;br /&gt;My only whine is where the on and off switch is. It’s inside along with the temperature control. It’s not a big deal, except I’m kind of a klutz and I’m just waiting for my first finger burn when I’m in a hurry to turn off the iron. Over all I love this flat iron! The flat iron heats up quickly and I control the temperature! It’s compact in size. I love this curling iron!!the temperature control.

            <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever bought! I&#x27;ve spent hundreds, YES hundreds over the years on tourmaline flat irons and this one is the best! You can&#x27;t beat the price! It&#x27;s so nice and works great! Its has a dial for temp and on/off switch. But you cannot tell what temp it is. This doesn&#x27;t matter to me. And it doesn&#x27;t have a test/reset button. With all that said, it&#x27;s still the best I&#x27;ve bought and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Hair is very straight leaves a very good shine to the hair.</li>
            <li> i have A LOT of hair and this iron gets soo hot and straightens so well with no snagging. it works better then the Chi i thought i couldnt live without. i bought it as a second hot tool but its definitely my first choice now and for a price like that it really earned its place. would buy again. also shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she tried it once and said it did not get hot enough to work the way it should. Disappointing...</li>
            <li> Worst piece of crap I ever bought. Doesn&#x27;t work properly and smells of burning hair. My hair got damaged after using it. Save yourselves and don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Catches my hair and pulls strands out!</li>
            <li> Love it, I have thick wavy hair that&#x27;s medium length and very hard to straighten.  Used a little product, blow dried straight and then straightened and it worked wonderful all the way to  the root which is where my problem usually is.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, thick, , type 4, natural African hair that doesn&#x27;t straighten easily, even with a relaxer, but this did the job better than I expected that it would! I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. good product.</li>
            <li> This is hair good iron. I have thin curly hair and it worked for me. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it doesn&#x27;t have tight seal on the hair as you move down to straighten your hair. However if u love closer to the tip of the iron it gets tighter. For the price ita a great hair iron</li>
            <li> Pros:  Heats up quickly, lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Doesn&#x27;t glide as smoothly over my hair as my last straightener. This is the reason for the 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people complained about the placement of the heat control.  While it&#x27;s awkward, once you set it, there&#x27;s no need to adjust it, so what&#x27;s the problem?</li>
            <li> First off I must disclaim, I dont often straighten my hair because of how time consuming it is, my hair is long and thick!! So I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly and easily I was able to straighten my hair with this straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned, in the past, very expensive straighteners - you know - the ones they sell for like $200 at the kiosks in the mall!? Yes I had purchased twice before those expensive ones, and always ended up with problems with them... Either they broke quickly or took forever to straighten my hair, and didnt do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not very patient with my hair (thats the main reason why I dont ever do anything with it!) I want to be able to straighten thicker pieces of my hair at once. I was never able to do that with my other straighteners. BUT I was happy to find that I could do that with this one from Gurin! The other thing I am happy about with this straightener is the price! What a deal!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to watch a video demo of me using the straightener (to straighten and make curls) you can check it out here: http://youtu.be/eUkLKF2bA4Q</li>
            <li> Ordered wrong size &amp; had to return.  Very convenient to exchange. This flat iron is good for long hair.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair &amp; within 10 min my entire head is flat &amp; sleek! Love it.</li>
            <li> Hot....hot....HOT.  There is no way not to get burned using this....I do, however like the rounded frame, makes it easy to curl as well as straighten.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly thru hair at all! You get what you pay for....cheaply made item!</li>
            <li> Was looking for a flat iron that straightens black nonchemical treated hair. I was told that the temperature had to be between 400 &amp; 450 to accomplish straight hair for women of color that DO NOT use chemicals to straighten their hair. This does the job and comes with a carrying case. Priced others with this temperature and most of them were twice the price. Once you get use to the barrel of this flat iron it&#x27;s easy to use. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> Best hair iron I have ever had</li>
            <li> I have had several flat irons over the years.  I broke my last one which was a Biosilk Tourmaline flat iron.  I was looking for a good deal and found this flat iron on Amazon. It had good reviews and for the price it works great. This heats up fast. It does not burn my fine hair and does a nice job of straightening my slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful item :) would definitally buy it again if i could</li>
            <li> Believe it or not Gurin Factory Website list this flat iron at $199 MSRP.  There are also other suppliers on Amazon who sell this for a lot more ($57.94 and $89).  At 15 bucks this flat iron is a steal!  It heats up fast!.  If you use small sections of hair it will straighten on one pass.  My hair is very short, and this flat iron works very well to tame my unruly hair.  I like that it is a full size flat iron for less than the price of a mini/travel flat iron.  The tourmaline coating helps the iron glide through my coarse hair without pulling or snagging.  It&#x27;s not perfect - there is no &amp;#34;ready indicator&amp;#34; and the on/off switch and heat setting dials are located underneath the top bar rather than on the side.  I was able to turn the unit off without burning myself but if that is a concern, just unplug the unit.  I do use product to protect from heat and didn&#x27;t experience any scorching even when set to the maximum temperature.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this zero stars. You get what you pay for. It doesn&#x27;t smooth the hair and barely straightens.</li>
            <li> The Gurin Tourmaline Flatiron I ordered is wonderful. It&#x27;s quick heating and straightens my hair in half the time that it took me before. My hair was perfectly straight and it even had a shine to it. I&#x27;ve used straighteners that costed $100&#x27;s of dollars and this one is every bit as good if not better. I highly recommend that if you&#x27;re looking to buy a new straightener, check out #Amazon for the Gurin Ceramic Tourmaline straightner. You won&#x27;t regret the few dollars you spend.</li>
            <li> Definitely not professional quality.  Didn&#x27;t get hot enough.  Sent it back.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener it work so well on my hair. If you have thick,course,super curly hair it works great. I used this on the highest temperature and it made my hair so straight,I love it. The carrying case broke when I first used it,but I didn&#x27;t really need it so I doesn&#x27;t really matter. Overall it is a nice straightener and I would defenitly purchase another and reccomend it!</li>
            <li> I have ordered a lot of items from Amazon and never disappoint until now. I read the reviews like I always do for this item and most of them were very good. The problem with this flatiron was it could not traighten my hair. It did not close completely except at the end. I don&#x27;t like to leave a bad review but I felt like it is justified</li>
            <li> This is the BEST flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used!. It works great- heats up quickly and moves through hair smoothly&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product, especially for the price. This product does a great job on my hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome product- Awesome design- Awesome machinery used in it- Gives awesome results. This hair straightener is just awesome. I never felt satisfied from any of the hair straightener or curler because all of them used to give temporary results but this hair straightener is just cool for long term results for any of the hair types. I feel so much glamour and style in my hair now by using this hair straightener.</li>
            <li> I have very strange hair.  Not really curly but definitely not straight either.  It&#x27;s also very thick and has a mind of it&#x27;s own.  This is why I was so surprised with the results I got from this Gurin Flat Iron!  I love that it has temperature control because a normal hot iron will not work on my hair.  It simply will not go straight without lots of heat so being able to turn this up to such a high temperature works wonders for me!  I also love the super long, swivel cord because it made it so easy to work with and not once did I end up tangled up with the cord or even feel like the cord was in the way.  I love the barrel size too since I was able to do my bangs and all of those smaller hairs at the base of my hair with no problems at all.  It only took about 10 minutes to do my entire head and the results were beautiful.  My hair was super straight and shinier than it&#x27;s ever looked!  I cannot believe the great quality of this flat iron and I am shocked by the low price!  I have tried very expensive flat irons that did not work for me as well as this one did because they did not get hot enough.  If you need a flat iron and don&#x27;t have a lot to invest this is perfect for you....you will not be disappointed even if you had paid a much higher price for it.</li>
            <li> Good but no auto off and gets very hot on the shell of it.</li>
            <li> Never used a flatiron before this.  Happy and works as expected.  Great price and service.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair straighter! Professional quality without the typical price tag of a good flat iron. Very Happy!</li>
            <li> Just like the $100+++ ones they sell in the mall.</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping, but not quite as good as I hoped.  Definitely better than some brands, not as good as others.</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> works as good if not better then those sold at the mall for right 100 dollars or so,so to me that makes it an amazing buy here on amazon. 5 stars</li>
            <li> Quality sucks! Very disappointed with product because it does not straighten my hair and this hair straightener feels and looks cheap</li>
            <li> BOUGHT THIS IRON FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS...NOTHING FANCY BUT WORKS WELL...NICE STYLE AND LENGTH...I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT ...SHE LOVED IT</li>
            <li> wife loves it as do her friends who have also bought one based on her advice.</li>
            <li> Works perfect! I got a product that works just like it was advertised. I use it every day and I have had not problems.</li>
            <li> Works great! Heats up fast and really hot, this excellent for my really course hair!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this product! The reviews I read were completely wrong. This product did not straighten my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Love the flat iron, it heats up quick, high heat settings good for my thick hair, leaves hair shiny and I love the Gurin Ceramic Plates hair just slides through!!!In addition the flat iron bag that comes with it, is cute and useable ! I would recommend this to others !</li>
            <li> 1 1/2 inch plate heats up to 450. needs a smoothing product to look sleek though. great price!</li>
            <li> This does a great job straightening hair and doesn&#x27;t get too hot on your hand (which I&#x27;ve experienced before with a hair iron).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit feels substantial and well-built. Like all appliances the true test is the time, but this is working great after a couple months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with an iron to use and provide an objective review.</li>
            <li> This flatiron did great job on my daughters frizzy hair and I was able to put a flip in the ends for her. Worked great with no snagging and she has THICK hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough also wasn&#x27;t an inch. If you have thinner hair it works okay.</li>
            <li> Great Straightener.  My daughter says it heats up VERY well and she is loving it.  It does not take long to heat up and works great.</li>
            <li> Love it. Wish it was digital insted of the dial but it still a great product.</li>
            <li> my hair is pretty curly. The  Gurin Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron Hair is helping to tame my hair. I especially like the adjustable heat. I also like this if I just want to straighten my bangs that day. I am somewhat new to straightners but this one is seems to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received complimentary to review only</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this flat iron. She is in the cosmetology program at school and it&#x27;s perfect for her.</li>
            <li> Love it Highly Recommend</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way this retailed for the price shown.  I&#x27;ve had irons that cost over $100 and this is not one of them!  It is not smooth when in use.  It&#x27;s like a drug store brand.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> So affordable and so much better then the straightners in stores. Heats up fast, straightens, flips, and curlys hair easily withought damageing your hair. I recommend.</li>
            <li> This is incredible quality for the price, I have tried many and this is the best</li>
            <li> Very disappointed...Doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly through hair at all! You get what you pay for....cheaply made item! it pulls your hair, have not seen any iron as bad as this...</li>
            <li> I have poofy, frizzy hair that can often get quite unruly. Ive tried straightening it before, but since it is so thick it took close to an hour to get my whole head done. Not anymore! With the Gurin Flat Iron I was able to get all my hair under control and straight in 10-15 minutes.  With this being so quick and easy I can see me taking the time to straighten my hair much more often now! Easy to turn on and off and change the temperature as needed. Handle doesn&#x27;t get too hot to hold even though the plates have heated up to straighten the hair.</li>
            <li> Some guy tricked me into sitting at his little kiosk in the mall while he straightened my hair. I&#x27;d never straightened my hair before; I thought my hair WAS straight. Boy was I wrong! My hair looked so amazing I almost bought his stupid, expensive hair straightener on the spot. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t; this is essentially the same thing but 1/10 the price. Sorry, mall kiosky guy, but thanks for doing my hair!</li>
            <li> Bought this fro my daughter.  She is very pleased.  No snagging, quick heat-up time.  Only negative is wish it came in a wider size.</li>
            <li> Love it..  works great. Doesnt damage my hair as much as my old one</li>
            <li> This gets hot and ready fast. Curls my hair when I want curls and they stay all day without product. I have had this since last year and no problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very picky about my flat irons...I don&#x27;t even like the CHI.  However, based on recommendations, I tried this one.  It is actually really great.  I&#x27;m not giving it a 5 star because I&#x27;d prefer for it to be longer and the on/off switch is a little hidden.  Other than that, though, it&#x27;s really hot (adjustable), and it does allow for a bit of curling because the outside plastic edges are rounded.  Overall, a really good flat iron...AND really cheap.  I&#x27;d put it up there with the ones you pay $50+ for on Amazon (no telling what you&#x27;d pay in the store).</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!  Works great!!!</li>
            <li> After my first use..this iron is fire!!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks sleek and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this iron last a long time :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about sending it back only because my hair is natural and I&#x27;ve changed my mind</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I bought it for my niece and she uses it every day.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy/curly hair and every time I tried to straighten my hair using other tools it took up to one hour and the results were not to my liking, my hair would either not be totally straight or would loose it&#x27;s shape and become wavy again after just a couple of hours. I bought Gurin because it was a great price thinking if it doesn&#x27;t works at least I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune on it. I timed it first time I used it and with no prior blow drying and using it straight on my wavy/curly hair it took me 18 minutes to work it all through. That was a first. The hair was soft, shinny and held up the shape until I washed it again. I am very happy with my new aquisition.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron. Easy to use, quick to heat up and cool down.</li>
            <li> cracked after 2 weeks, very cheap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with long, very thick &amp; wavy hair, but my gf likes it straightened.  I \\&quot;hate\\&quot; fussing with my hair.    After borrowing her \\&quot;much\\&quot; more expensive straightener for a while, I decided to get my own.    Purchased &amp; returned 3 different ones.  1st &#x27;cause it pulled hair, 2nd &#x27;cause of stupid placement of switches-(laughing at myself...read my other review &amp; you&#x27;ll get it), &amp; 3rd couldn&#x27;t justify the cost.    After using it, I can honestly say that I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the results I received with this hair straightener.    With the exception of the color, it&#x27;s an \\&quot;EXACT\\&quot; clone of her $200+ straightener.    AAA+ product that performs as it&#x27;s claimed &amp; should, &amp; Gurin has a 100% satisfaction guarantee.    Works for me.</li>
            <li> If you need a flat iron that will reach 450 degrees. Please nite this one will only go to 400 degrees. In the description it does say 450 but this is not correct.</li>
            <li> Excellent, works great, gets hair very straight and silky. loved it so much that I ordered my sister one.</li>
            <li> It does not get hot enough and the light keep switching between red and green the whole time. I believe I got a defective product</li>
            <li> It does not heat up to the temperature it says, it does not help my thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this but I used my mom&#x27;s account since she has amazon prime (we do this quite often #thestruggle)  (Order #: 110-4916934-1017849 in case they need to verify my purchase)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see from my title I am #teamnatural (for those of you who are unfirmiliar with this, it simply means I choose to not chemically process my hair example: relaxer, Keratin treatments, ect)  Anywho my hair is very curly and tight but I have it trained where it is pretty manageable but just really really really thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did: I first did a hot oil treatment ( I did this because it had been about 6-8 months since I last used heat on my hair and wanted to prevent heat damage), rinsed, applied heat protectant spray by tresseme&#x27; and blow dried, then used this wonderful flat Iron.  I can not believe how straight and SOFT my hair was.  Especially for the price it honestly is a diamond in the rough. I previously was using a Babybliss titanium blue colored flat iron worth a lot more than this flat iron.....however the Gurin has won me over and I doubt I will be using my Babybliss iron anymore....yes it is that good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: FAST SHIPPING&amp;#60; NO CHIPS&amp;#60; OR BREAKS ON MERCHANDISE &amp;#62;EXCELLENT QUALITY!!!  It  has a Swival cord so it does not tangle whoo hoo, Heats up super fast, It is actually heavier than I anticipated, but heavy in a sturdy and good material and good plates kind of way.  It feels like the flat iron my beautician used and the grips are amazing.  The tip of the flat iron lets you get super close especially for thos edges which is always a problem area when going from curly to straight for most women.  The carrying bag is really cute, great for travel and makes the iron seem high quality and expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I will admit not seeing the numbers on the temperature setting was slightly a bummer. but simple math will tell you if the high setting is 450 then in the middle of the dial it will be a temperature of 225.  I turned the dial past the half way mark so I guesstimate I was using a setting of about 325.  I know the 450 setting would be way too high and I&#x27;m all about healthy hair and remaining damage free.  That was my only con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please purchase I promise you will not regret it.  $20 plus you get it in 2 days who can beat that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helped, and feel free to ask any questions from me in regards to this product, I will be more than willing to answer and help out in any way that I can.</li>
            <li> Although shipping was slow, the product itself is well made and performs. My daughter is a little picky and it was hard to select online....this was a good pick for us.</li>
            <li> This iron is what  I was looking for and the price was awesome, thank you for always having the finest products.</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair maybe once or twice a month, so I didn&#x27;t need to shell out for something expensive. This does the job surprisingly well. All of the settings and controls work, and it feels/appears to be pretty good quality equipment. Works perfectly for my needs.</li>
            <li> Excellent....get your hair really straight....fast 2 day shipping...and great bargain!!</li>
            <li> Love this iron! Really straightens and leaves my hair shiny. Better than my rip off $200.00 mall iron.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and I have been using a Remington hair straightener, or at least attempted to use a hair straightener, I sort of figured that having nice straight hair just wasn&#x27;t in my cards...Bam,  the Gurin Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1.25 inch comes into my life and changes my whole perception and ideas I had on flat iron/hair straighteners! I love how nice it makes my hair look and feel...If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive  Flat Iron/Hair Straightener this product is your answer.</li>
            <li> Gread gift for my granddaughters, no more fighting for the hot iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product. It gets hot when you turn it up so I guess that&#x27;s all that matters when it comes to a flat iron hair straightener.</li>
            <li> Not that great. Sticky grips on handle aren&#x27;t great around hair strands; leaves my hair limp compared to the other straightener that I unfortunately had to toss because the coating on the plate was falling off.</li>
            <li> The shipping was pretty quick and when I got it, it came with a silk bag to put the straightener into I loved it. The actual straightener is pretty good quality especially since the price was so cheap. I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Straightener works great! :-)  I was looking for a new one so when I saw it on amazon I bought it because it was a fantastic deal. Thanks</li>
            <li> best flat iron thus far and Ive spent alot on expensive ones</li>
            <li> I do love this product!  Recently traveled abroad for 3 weeks &amp; found this most helpful. I have very thick, wavy hair &amp; this flat-iron was very helpful in &#x27;taming&#x27; my mane.  It also was compact &amp; packed easily for transport.</li>
            <li> Great flat iron for the price</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27; say good weight and I like the temp adjustment ability.</li>
            <li> Shipped in 2 days. Nice, heats up fast, works well.</li>
            <li> Loved it more than my chi until it started snagging my hair and ripping bf it out. Much heavier than my chi. Stopped using it after it started snagging. The problem started about a month after I got it maybe I melted the iron. I do set it to the highest temp and used it daily.  Well idk pretty good for a months run.</li>
            <li> I think this flat iron is slightly above drugstore quality.  The floating plates make this a nice iron for curls and flips.  I did feel as though the iron snagged on my hair a bit.  It heats up relatively quickly.  However, there is no real thermostat other than the low temp and high temp (450 degrees).  What if I wanted 360 degrees?  You basically have to guess at temperatures, which sucks if you have a specific temperature you like to use when straightening your hair.  The red satin bag was a really cute accessory, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line -- I will probably use this as a backup iron.  I need to know the temperature I&#x27;m using.  Also, the Amazon listing and the packaging for the iron indicate this is a 1.25 inch iron.  The plates on this iron are definitely NOT 1.25 inches.  I think this is probably a 1 inch iron.  For comparison, I held this straightener in between my old Belson Pro and Solia (both of these irons are 1.25 inches).  The Gurin plates are definitely more narrow.</li>
            <li> Love the flat iron it&#x27;s just as good as some of those expensive ones out there! I didn&#x27;t experience any problems with heat damage. The only issue I had was trying to figure out the temperature dial. I had to guess between 300 to 375 degrees. Other than that, no complaints!</li>
            <li> works great and does the job</li>
            <li> Did not keep.  Returned unopened.  Not really what I wanted</li>
            <li> Hair gets pulled every time you flattened your hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron for my sister as a Christmas present.  When the HSI iron I had been using was stolen, I then purchased this for myself because it was so cheap. I should have asked my sister what she thought of the one I had gotten her.  It is probably one of the worst flat irons I have ever purchased.  Even the Conair I had bought at Rite Aid was a better buy, even though it only lasted about a year.  My problem with this one is that it is ineffective.  It doesn&#x27;t stay hot, which makes it nearly impossible to use.  The HSI I had before this was quick to use and gave the results I wanted.  This Gurin does not completely straighten my hair.  It takes multiple passes on the highest setting to get my hair anywhere close to where I want it, but within 10 minutes it is frizzy and wavy again.I have never had that issue with any other flat iron. My hair is fine, and with most irons I keep it on a lower setting and only need one or two passes.  I have never had that issue with any other flat iron.  For the price it was not a major loss, but it&#x27;s frustrating having to buy a third flat iron in the last 6 months.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected. It works pretty well. However, I have super thick hair so it takes forever to straighten. I turn it all the way up for a quick straighten and it still doesn&#x27;t straighten completely. But I think that&#x27;s in part of my hair. I do love it for the price. The quality is good too!</li>
            <li> NOT A GOOD FLAT IRON.</li>
            <li> I am in love with my Gurin. I am a women of color and I have thick  shoulder length hair. I have used it  when I wear my own and also works great on my sew in weave. Love the temp setting and great red bag. I liked it so much I order one for my Dtr-in-law.&lt;br /&gt;Could not beat the price returned my more expensive one. Shipping was fast less then 5 days. Could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Great product - I was looking for one of these to seal mylar bags, so I only wanted to spend about $20. I found this one steeply discounted from about $200, not sure why. But it works like a charm, hits 450 degrees - more than enough to seal mylar. So I&#x27;m not complaining!</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair that pushes the limits of most drug-store hair irons. When I noticed the Gurin iron on sale for 20 dollars I decided to order it - I needed a budget iron that packed a little more punch than the Conair CS27VCS I had been using. Long story short, the Gurin iron exceeded all expectations. I was able to style my hair within 15 minutes - a task that took my old iron at least an hour!</li>
            <li> Happy with the purchase.  Nice flat iron</li>
            <li> Perfect for my type of curly hair. It works awesome!!</li>
            <li> I have semi-weird hair that has caused much jealousy in my life for people who so effortlessly have gorgeous hair ALL. THE. TIME. I envy the long, shiny, frizz-free look, and, while I do not have curly hair, I have stubborn hair that is dangerously persuaded by the weather. I have a natural wave to my hair if I let it air dry. In my dreams, it looks like nice tousled beach waves, but in reality, I look like I have a head of hair that doesn&#x27;t know if it wants to be curly or straight. If I blow dry it, it looks poofy all around, and for some reason, the hairs on the underside always try to curl or wave or do whatever the rest of my hair is NOT doing. It is coarser, curlier and just has a mind of it&#x27;s own; it is very resistant to styling, and the second it becomes humid out, any previous styling to those hairs is forgotten. I have been using a flat iron for a LONG time to get the straight hair look that better suits my preferences, and puts those rebellious hairs in their place. I used to use a wide flat iron, but coveted the preciseness of the skinnier ones. I use this flat iron almost everyday, and I have run into zero problems! The controls are very basic, so you can easily turn the flat iron on and off and adjust the heat setting which ranges from 140°F to 450°F (120°C - 220°C). I tend to lean towards the highest heat setting to save time, although everyone is different, and no two heads of hair are alike, so you can play around with it to find out which setting works best for you. It also has a &amp;#34;ready&amp;#34; light that is red when you turn it on, and turns green when the iron has reached your desired temperature. I have found that this heats right up within a minute or two, which is amazing for those days when you are running late, or thought you turned it on, but really didn&#x27;t. The plates of the flat iron are ceramic/tourmaline providing a soft, silky look while saving you time. The Gurin Hair Straightener has provided me with reliable, consistent performance day after day with no faulty functioning. If you are in the market for a flat iron, I would highly recommend this one as it can deliver straight, frizz-free locks or styles with flips and curls after a simple flick of the wrist. I love that styling my hair takes only a few minutes from the time I turn the flat iron on to the time I shut it off. I received this item complimentary for the purpose of an honest review on my blog.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent flat iron.  I use it to straighten my daughters natural hair and I also use it to feather my relaxed hair.  This iron works as good as a Chi or FHI, but it is much cheaper, (as was previously stated in a review, which prompted my to purchase---I totally agree!).  It leaves our hair shiny and just 1-2 passes is needed, of course with the help of a couple of other staple straightening products, such as heat protectant!  I was disappointed that this iron did not have numbered heat settings, but that was my own fault for not examining the box closely before putting it in my cart.  Even so, I am happy that I brought it, I have found a heat setting, which is a bit after the half way mark in the range, that does not produce a lot of smoke when passing through the relaxed or natural hair, yet it works fabulously! I did not plan on writing such a long review........I am just happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I have very course, curly hair. I thought I could never get a chi that could chi this well without going to a salon! I absolutely love this product! my hair is straight and looks natural! Plus my highlights aren&#x27;t damaged!</li>
            <li> This iron did not last 3 months</li>
            <li> Was not worth the wait. Horrible product! With all the hassle I had to go through to get this product. I was expecting something way better!!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a back up to my Remington but it has quickly moved up to the one I reach for first.  Does the job, and does it quickly.</li>
            <li> Curls and straightens.  Heats up a little slower than my older iron, but I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well for flipping/adding curls</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to put this iron to the test. My hair can be super difficult to strengthen so I can tell right away if the iron is worth purchasing or not. I&#x27;ll be honest too, at $20, I was completely skeptical. I thought, there is no way in Hell this Iron will do the job for my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I was completely amazed! Turns out a $20 Iron can get the job done that only normally a very expensive iron can do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love most about this iron (besides the fact that it works well) is that you can adjust the heat settings to as hot as 450 degrees or as cool as 140 degrees F. I tried it at a lower setting the first time, since I had blow-dried my hair already and it was already looking pretty straight. This worked great for my hair that was already mostly straight, but I knew that I would really have to test it out when I let my hair go naturally wavy before straightening!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the next day, I washed my hair, put it up in a bun and slept on it. That next morning I woke to super wavy hair. my Gurin iron was really going to get the test this time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cranked the heat setting up on my iron this time, knowing that it would really have to work to get this wavy hair straight. I was excited to put this iron to the test and I&#x27;ve tried this many times with other irons and most of them fail to get my wavy hair completely straight, especially when they cost so little! I got started right away with the straightening!&lt;br /&gt;Then I gently started gliding the iron through my hair.  I gave it a few seconds as I slid it down my hair to make sure it would really get all the wave out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And voila! my hair is straightened!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about 5-7 minutes to straighten out my super thick mane, but I was absolutely stunned that this $20 iron was able to pull off some serious straightening of my wavy hair, especially when my hair is already so thick and course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m completely thrilled that a $20 iron can do the work of a $200 iron! You RARELY ever see that! Like I said, I love the adjustable heat setting on this. I can crank it up when my hair is already wavy, or turn it down when I&#x27;ve blow dried my hair and it&#x27;s already looking pretty straight, and that way I can take it easy on my hair too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this iron for the last few weeks, my hair also looks and feels super healthy too, thanks to the ceramic tourmaline plates you will find on this iron (just like what the uber expensive irons have). I was a bit nervous cranking up the heat on this iron, that it would damage and do the dreaded sizzling of the hair when you use it, but I got absolutely none of that! My hair looks shiny and healthy, even my horribly dry ends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m absolutely amazed with this iron and am thrilled that I&#x27;ve found a complete bargain of an iron that does all the heavy-lifting of a super expensive iron!

            <li> Love this flat iron, does exactly what it states.</li>
            <li> My daughter compared it to the chi and said this one is just as good as the chi and I (the mother) paid $120.00 for the chi.  For this straightener, I only paid like $22.00.  I am so very happy she is happy with this product and that I saved $100.00.  Now I know when my other daughter is ready for a new straightener (she also has a CHI), I know where I&#x27;m going to purchase her next one.  thank you!</li>
            <li> When it came to straightening my hair, I think the Gurin Ceramic Flat Iron Hair Straightener did an excellent job. I only had to go over each section one time, which I LOVED! As you can see in the picture below, my hair went from frizzy poof ball to nice and straight. I thought this Gurin Ceramic Flat Iron Hair Straightener was very easy to hold on to while using it also. I will definitely continue to use this product in the future and is on the top of my list Straighteners!</li>
            <li> In comparison to my other flat iron I like this one a bit more. I like the way it feels in my hand a lot. When I do use a hair product in the past I have found my other iron to get slick, but with the grips on the Gurin handle I don&#x27;t feel I will have that issue. It heated up a lot faster, which was really surprising because it was ready before I was ready to use it, and I like that the blades are narrow, and overall the iron is short which is good for my smaller hands. This iron heats up super fast, and has an indicator light when it is ready. Below are before and after photos - all before photos on top. My hair is flat as a pancake and very fine so this gives me a little added lift. I am glad Gurin asked me to review this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really do like this flat iron - the only regret I have is that I didn&#x27;t a larger size, because I do have long hair.  But I might just get the larger size and keep this one.  Excellent and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great iron for the price!</li>
            <li> Hair came out straight and smooth.... had body and shine</li>
            <li> Does EXACTLY what I wanted it to do for so much less! So I also bought one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I got this to try .&lt;br /&gt; Like most my hair can get crazy, but for the most part when it is this short it is just fluffy.  Some times I wake up and it looks like I am back in the 80&#x27;s with feathered air.  A hair straighter is one of the best items I have in my hair arsenal.  If you have the right one it can take just a few minutes to have your hair looking sleek shinny and like you spent a whole lot more time doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have made the mistake in the past of buying a hair strainer that was not ceramic.  Boy that was the wrong thing to do.  They never heat up evenly. It takes forever to get your hair straight, and it was always pulling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This fantastic straighter was not only ceramic it also had a temperature dial.  Which I love some days I just need a touch up and I don’t need it to be 400 degrees, but some days I need the full power of this straighter.  I also loved that it has a very long cord.  I am not stuck right next to the outlet in the bathroom.  It also came with a fantastic carrying case.  When I am on the road not I don’t have to worry about the cords and the space, this takes up very little room in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I loved this straighter.  It did not pull my hair at all. It got my  hair shinny and straight in just a few minutes.  I would recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> use it every week leave my hair nice and shining without burning it!!</li>
            <li> My niece can straighten her hair in 20min perfectly. She can do a quick straighten in 10min now and it used to take her 2ours and come out looking OK... LOVE this straightener! She has think think curly hair</li>
            <li> Heats up very well but buttons placed in a inconvenient spot.</li>
            <li> The Gurin Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron is better than my old Jilbere flat iron &amp; it was only a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly and it&#x27;s the perfect size to do my bangs as well as my entire head. I&#x27;m 35 and I&#x27;ve been graying since I was 9, which means my hair is extremely unruly. It used to be curly but with all the grays it now has a wiry wave which the Gurin flat iron totally dominates! 😃&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this thing and am thinking of buying a spare. I don&#x27;t often use flat irons &amp; my last one died after 10 years of mild use but at this price and quality, I&#x27;d be a fool NOT to get a spare.</li>
            <li> It works great . Heats up quickly and straightens hair well.  It is easy to use and works great. Bl</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man and sometimes a have a long hair, but most of the time, short hair. It straightens my hair easily. It is sometimes used by my female cousin and use it for curling.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT- I LIKE IT BETTER THAN A MORE EXPENSIVE ONE I HAD</li>
            <li> You no need expend a lot of money , with this flat iron you can have in home the same that you expend in the salon</li>
            <li> My girlfriend says the instruction is easy to follow, even though she didn&#x27;t read it.</li>
            <li> I received the Gurin Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron Hair Straightener to review!  The flat iron is heavy duty and very well made.  I was surprised to see the controls inside the flat iron, instead of on the outside.  It has ceramic/tourmaline plates, with adjustable heat temperature.  The Flat Iron is perfect for getting just the right style and it makes my hair look AWESOME!  You can get a nice and sleek looking hair style or voluminous curls.  The Flat Iron heats up quickly and has a 1.25 inch plate.  This is definitely the perfect beauty tool and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Works good but off and on buttom didnt work</li>
            <li> This iron is great for me. I have short hair and it&#x27;s so easy to use. Heats up fast, only using lowest setting so far &amp; it works on my curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Hasn&#x27;t burned my hair either. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I recently had the chance to review a Gurin 1.25&amp;#34; Flat Iron.  For the last few months, I have been wearing my hair straight.  This means I have to blow dry and flat-iron my hair everyday since it is naturally curly.  It gets old but my hair looks better straight.  Since I started using this straightener, it looks and feels even better.  It gives it a silky, smooth finish and it completely takes the frizz away. It is small enough to get into the hard to reach sections behind my ears, which is hard to do with the bigger irons without getting burned.  It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t get too hot for my fingers to touch the outside.  I love how great this iron works and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality flat iron at low price.</li>
            <li> Item takes a long time to straighten my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t stay straight all day. My Wal-Mart straightener does a better job. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am actually sending this product back. The plates were chipped and it snagged my hair on the very first try.</li>
            <li> Pulls hair out. TERRIBLE FLAT IRON</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to hold. It is weird that the on-off and heat control is inside, as I read on other reviews, but with caution you don&#x27;t burn yourself. This is my first straightener ever and I am very happy with how easy it is to use. I thought I&#x27;d drop it and burn myself, since I have a little neuropathy in my hands, but that hasn&#x27;t been the case. For the price, it seems very well made. I have only had it a short time, though.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3ARNVQYSTMV0T]]I was honestly impressed by this Gurin flat iron. I tested it&#x27;s results out against my $100+ flat iron, and honestly I couldn&#x27;t tell much of a difference. It heated up quickly, again that amazed me. I loved the fact that while using this, my hair didn&#x27;t get extremely hot, and leave it feeling fried. My hair was still soft, even softer than the side I did with my high end flat iron! I give this a full 5 stars! *Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> this item does not get hot at all even on the highest setting so if you have relaxed hair it will not make your hair silky you are better off using a flat iron by Revlon that you can buy at Walmart for $14</li>
            <li> It works as well as more expensive models. Heats quickly.</li>
            <li> Super flat iron I would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome overall, but for me the temp. Knob is really loose and gets off the setting I want it at , but other than that it&#x27;s good. Straightened my hair in half the time</li>
            <li> Got today used immediately. Straighteners at mid heat beautifuly and curls are gorgeous at slightly higher heat. Ordered two more as gifts, I know they will love them. So light and easy to handle doing entire head by yourself!!!</li>
            <li> I wish I had listened other reviews. It&#x27;s not good for thin hair, pulling on it somewhat, while also having a hard time holding hair between the plates.  Can&#x27;t make ribbon curls with thin hair</li>
            <li> Great straightener and great price. Very smooth and makes my hair shine.</li>
            <li> Bought this flat iron a few months back and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. I had a CHI flat iron for several years, which I accidentally broke. I was devastated that I had to buy a replacement, but when I read the good reviews on the Gurin I thought I&#x27;d give it a try instead. The price was also very convincing too!! To my surprise the Gurin did just as good of a job, if not better than my old CHI. My mom really liked it too, so I surprised her with one for Christmas.  LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Love it...I am new to straightening my hair as I have always had very short hair or permed hair. But I absolutely live this product.</li>
            <li> This flat iron styles my hair better than my CHI that i was using for the past couple of years. It keeps my hair smooth and shiny &amp; It gets very hot... which is fabulous for my hair type. It reminds me of the kind used in salons. 100% recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Overall, it works ok.  I have fine hair and it pulls it some.  I use it as a backup and travel straightener since it is smaller than my regular one, so it serves the purpose.  Will keep my Remington as my main straightener though.</li>
            <li> I had recently bought a CHI from Ulta on sale and then got this iron shortly there after.  I used them both and ended up returning the CHI. I am able to get the same results at a much more reasonable price. My hair is straight and as a plus this iron has a temp control where as the CHI was set at 370; my hair is fragile and I prefer a lower setting. And it comes with a really cute red satin carrying bag.</li>
            <li> it does what you need it to do, warms up real fast and heats up pretty high 450 degrees!&lt;br /&gt;love it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use except for the controls as they are located inside the straightener and very difficult to get to.</li>
