            <li>Just be sure to moisture while using this as often as you can.</li>
            <li>but i love this fade cream.</li>
            <li>My sunspots are a bit lighter and the over-all &#x27;evenness&#x27; of my skin looks pretty good.</li>
            <li>I use it and saw enough results THE FIRST DAY, also seems to shrink pores! :D</li>
            <li>This cream work fast and effective, and I love the smell</li>
            <li>It makes my BB cream not go on smoothly and becomes streaky.  </li>
            <li>Thank you, Amazon, for keeping both of these products available...</li>
            <li>Been using it for years now and it makes my skin smooth and cool,clear blemishes and brightens my complexion,i would recommend it anytime</li>
            <li>Not the original i thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It made my skin super smooth.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S A GOOD FACIAL CREAM</li>
            <li>absorbs quickly with no greasy residue or dryness occurring.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a little more potent for faster results, but I&#x27;m glad to have found something that&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>Mine in particular is pretty much &amp;#34;classic ivory,&amp;#34; but it tended to get  blotchy red before I discovered and began using this marvelous fade cream on a daily &amp;#34;morning after shower&amp;#34; basis along with another longtime favorite, Colonial Dames Vitamin E Cream (also available on Amazon)!  </li>
            <li>Very funny</li>
            <li>I use all their products and like them very much</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I have a second level ivory skin color, not porcelein, but in the light category.</li>
            <li>Product does work eventually, non greasy and fast drying.</li>
            <li>it really  works  </li>
            <li>I am now very fond of Nadinola.</li>
            <li>Really lightens up skin markings.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see why you would not want to</li>
            <li>Use this product on  my discolored elbows and it really does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive, adult acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>The dark patches on my face still remained but I just didn&#x27;t want to use it for more than six weeks because of the hydroquinone.</li>
            <li>I also use Vitamin E oil and coconut oil sparingly on my face while using this to prevent dry out and keep my skin looking smooth, dark bronzed and healthy.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen noticeable improvement but skin is very soft</li>
            <li>But the upside for me is that after i use this for a few weeks to fade my scars, once I go out and enjoy some sun, my skin browns back to normal and the scars and my skin are pretty much blended and my skin looks back to normal, dark brown and smooth and even toned.</li>
            <li>I live far from America</li>
            <li>Have not used it long enough to see much improvement but some success is coming.  </li>
            <li>With frequent use it took about 2-3wks before I saw results using Palmers fade cream.</li>
            <li>I love this for end-of-the-summer sun spots/ &#x27;&#x27;dark stains&#x27;&#x27; and other horrid skin problems caused by hormones.</li>
            <li>Has a thick sunscreen feel when first applied, yet very smoothing to sun spots.</li>
            <li>This product is a thick white creme and a light smell.</li>

            <li> This product is a thick white creme and a light smell.</li>
            <li> Your face will be so soft and the dark spots will go away.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything, but I don&#x27;t really like the thick, waxy feeling on my face.  </li>
            <li> The downside however is that this cream is not good for dabbing it on your problem areas only, you have to apply it over the entire surface area (in my case, my entire face) that you want to tone and even or else you&#x27;ll be left with big faded spots in your face or wherever.</li>
            <li> I am dark African American and whenever I get scars they turn really dark, darker than my actual skin complexion.</li>
            <li> The product takes a very very very long time to show results.</li>
            <li> It fades dark spots back to you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used product a handful of times and already dark spots are fading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few nights</li>
            <li> delivery also took longer than expected.</li>
            <li> Since then I decided to try other brands.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that YOU HAVE TO USE IT EVERYDAY!</li>
            <li> One on each side of my cheek due to pregnancy.</li>
            <li> The jar I got from this vendor had multiple small black  specks in it that looked like small hairs.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now (definately longer than a month, maybe two months) every morning.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of freckles from getting sunburn as a child, I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and see that they have lightened.</li>
            <li> Just a few days a week</li>
            <li> very stong unpleasant odor, have no idea if its going to work</li>
            <li> so I use very little, you also feel a tingle after use</li>
            <li> This cream helped clear my chicken pox and pimple scars.</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying I hope no one is using this product for any self-hate reasons, like lightening your skin just because you think lighter skin ppl are prettier or some crap like that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thick</li>
            <li> The product works, albeit slowly.</li>
            <li> the container is really small and too expensive for the price.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!!</li>
            <li> My mom has terrible scars from a recent disease.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have not used it long enough to see much improvement but some success is coming.  I do like Palmer&#x27;s creams , they do not use animals in their testing and that&#x27;s a big plus.  I use all their products and like them very much</li>
            <li> This product is just OK. It made my skin super smooth. The dark patches on my face still remained but I just didn&#x27;t want to use it for more than six weeks because of the hydroquinone.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, I would recommend it to anyone, it is the best fade cream on the market. I have been using it for 10yrs.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now (definately longer than a month, maybe two months) every morning.  I haven&#x27;t noticed anything, but I don&#x27;t really like the thick, waxy feeling on my face.  It makes my BB cream not go on smoothly and becomes streaky.  I have a second level ivory skin color, not porcelein, but in the light category.</li>
            <li> not the best i have tried. The product takes a very very very long time to show results. however most skin fader creams do. Product does work eventually, non greasy and fast drying.</li>
            <li> I orders the products on the picture but I received something else. I live far from America so I can&#x27;t return them. Very funny</li>
            <li> it really  works  I love all of their products  they work</li>
            <li> Great cream, works really well.  You&#x27;ll need to follow the directions and if you do, you&#x27;ll see results.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen noticeable improvement but skin is very soft</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I have used about two jars of this product. Since then I decided to try other brands. I am now very fond of Nadinola. Nadinola works faster.  With frequent use it took about 2-3wks before I saw results using Palmers fade cream. But, hey it works. I&#x27;ve learned for faster results; use as a spot treatment, keep applying, like when you don&#x27;t have to go out etc.  This product is a thick white creme and a light smell. Product didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.  I have super sensitive, adult acne prone skin. I didn&#x27;t experience any tingling feeling like another reveiwer posted.  Overall I give it a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> The jar I got from this vendor had multiple small black  specks in it that looked like small hairs. I had to throw it out. Totally gross.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few nights and I could already tell the difference. It&#x27;s a bit thick so I use very little, you also feel a tingle after use so you know it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Really lightens up skin markings.</li>
            <li> My mom has terrible scars from a recent disease. The cream is working wonders.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of freckles from getting sunburn as a child, I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and see that they have lightened. I wish it was a little more potent for faster results, but I&#x27;m glad to have found something that&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Products are great.  I love them.  This purchase was a gift and she (my cousin) loves them too.  Adele</li>
            <li> It really works! I love this for end-of-the-summer sun spots/ &#x27;&#x27;dark stains&#x27;&#x27; and other horrid skin problems caused by hormones. LOVE IT and will never be without it again. Just a few days a week I use it and saw enough results THE FIRST DAY, also seems to shrink pores! :D</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for various skin types... Mine in particular is pretty much &amp;#34;classic ivory,&amp;#34; but it tended to get  blotchy red before I discovered and began using this marvelous fade cream on a daily &amp;#34;morning after shower&amp;#34; basis along with another longtime favorite, Colonial Dames Vitamin E Cream (also available on Amazon)!  Thank you, Amazon, for keeping both of these products available...</li>
            <li> Not the original i thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Great product love the texture</li>
            <li> This cream is a miracle worker,i love it! Been using it for years now and it makes my skin smooth and cool,clear blemishes and brightens my complexion,i would recommend it anytime</li>
            <li> Love this cream. My mom who is 80 has been using this since she was in her 20&#x27;s. Her skin is gorgeous.  I am 47 I have been using it since I was 15. Very good you won&#x27;t regret it. Your face will be so soft and the dark spots will go away. I really don&#x27;t see why you would not want to&lt;br /&gt;Put it on your neck. It fades dark spots back to you skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;NOT  A WHITEN CREAM.</li>
            <li> Some fading but not enough to even skin tone. I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 2 months.</li>
            <li> very stong unpleasant odor, have no idea if its going to work</li>
            <li> I have not been seen is work since am using it</li>
            <li> Works great on bug bites</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll echo what others have said here. The product works, albeit slowly. I&#x27;ve been using this daily for about 3 weeks and am starting to see a noticeable difference across my entire face. My sunspots are a bit lighter and the over-all &#x27;evenness&#x27; of my skin looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> affordable alternative to mederma/other scar removers. I have medium skin complexion and used these for my knees and elbows. I used it twice daily for about 3 weeks and saw a noticeable change in color. I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation, even after using it on my freckles on my face. absorbs quickly with no greasy residue or dryness occurring.</li>
            <li> I saw results after using for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> They said,once you start using Palmer&#x27;s cream, you will start seeing changes in 4 to 6 weeks; I started to see changes in 2 weeks.This cream work fast and effective, and I love the smell</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying I hope no one is using this product for any self-hate reasons, like lightening your skin just because you think lighter skin ppl are prettier or some crap like that. Now that that&#x27;s out the way. This cream helped clear my chicken pox and pimple scars.I am dark African American and whenever I get scars they turn really dark, darker than my actual skin complexion. This product helps me fade the scars. The downside however is that this cream is not good for dabbing it on your problem areas only, you have to apply it over the entire surface area (in my case, my entire face) that you want to tone and even or else you&#x27;ll be left with big faded spots in your face or wherever. But the upside for me is that after i use this for a few weeks to fade my scars, once I go out and enjoy some sun, my skin browns back to normal and the scars and my skin are pretty much blended and my skin looks back to normal, dark brown and smooth and even toned. I also use Vitamin E oil and coconut oil sparingly on my face while using this to prevent dry out and keep my skin looking smooth, dark bronzed and healthy. I understand that everyone cannot put oil on your faces tho. Just be sure to moisture while using this as often as you can. And wear sunscreen while using this.</li>
            <li> it works and it takes a while before you see results. the container is really small and too expensive for the price. you can get the same size at Walmart for $6.00. delivery also took longer than expected.</li>
            <li> Has a thick sunscreen feel when first applied, yet very smoothing to sun spots. Give the Serum a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Still using it, no results yet.</li>
            <li> Use this product on  my discolored elbows and it really does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I am a African American Male so i cant say the results are the same for everyone but i love this fade cream. It removes any dark-spots you have on your skin and makes your skin have a nice even-tone glow.</li>
            <li> I HERD IT&#x27;S A GOOD FACIAL CREAM BUT I CANNOT USE IT BECAUSE IT HAS RETINOL.</li>
            <li> I started this cream in &#x27;09 and before I knew it, my stretch marks faded a lot. The only thing is that YOU HAVE TO USE IT EVERYDAY! It works...period!! I would have upload before and after pics but I been using its for years.</li>
            <li> Wow,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got two patches. One on each side of my cheek due to pregnancy. I&#x27;ve only used product a handful of times and already dark spots are fading. Unbelievable!!</li>
