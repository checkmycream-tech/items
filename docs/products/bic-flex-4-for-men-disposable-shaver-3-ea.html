            <li>Good disposable razor that does what a razor is suppose too.  </li>
            <li>I could not believe it took 2 shavers to get a good shave.</li>

            <li>even some from Asia, are trying to come up with a razor as good as the Gilettes.  </li>
            <li>Good,</li>
            <li>The best and most economical way to shave is with a safety razor and blades, but these are very good disposable razors.</li>
            <li>The great thing is it feels smooth on my head.</li>
            <li>- he can go write his own rating.  </li>

            <li>The BIC Flex4 Disposable Razor is a surprisingly high-quality razor with four blades and a good moisturizing strip connected to an ergonomic handle with a comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This disposable razor is by far the best disposable razor I have used yet!</li>
            <li>Very smooth close shave.</li>
            <li>They work fine, but I don&#x27;t like them any more than the kind I pay a couple of bucks for.</li>
            <li>The Flex4 can provide an outstanding shave that&#x27;s better than almost anything else on the shelf.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Longevity: 3 stars.</li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s a better razor than this out there, I&#x27;ve not met up with it.  </li>
            <li>and I sincerely believe you&#x27;ll echo every word I&#x27;ve written here.</li>
            <li>Sure, there are cheaper options but</li>
            <li>a smooth shave beats skin nicks any day of the week!</li>
            <li>They were enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve held some reusable razors that felt weaker and more \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; than these BIC razors.</li>
            <li>so you may want top replace your disposable razor after six or seven shaves.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Works better for me than the Battery powered ones.</li>
            <li>At almost $18, I&#x27;d want more than three shavers.</li>
            <li>There are 4 blades, with a rubber strip at the bottom and a lubricant strip at the top.  </li>
            <li>I love love love love these.</li>
            <li>Four blades has become the perfect amount for me personally.</li>
            <li>It was as though Gilette had lost their rights to the design and many companies,</li>
            <li>One thing that I do notice about the bic vs. the quattro, is that the bic razor is better at removing stubbly hair under my chin.  </li>
            <li>Something I could never get with the Quattro now matter how many times I shaved.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always found Bic disposable razors to give pretty good shaves</li>
            <li>WHat makes this so outstanding is its ergonomic design which fits the hand so much more easily and more comfortably than any</li>
            <li>Pretty good compliments from a guy who is usually quick to criticize!</li>
            <li>The bulky head isn&#x27;t a deal-breaker, but I think I&#x27;m more comfortable with my Mach3 blades.</li>
            <li>The price on these razors makes them an all-around good buy.</li>
            <li>COOL!  </li>
            <li>other areas feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li>He said they are easy to rinse while using and they feel sturdier in his hand than some others he has tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable to hold, and shaves very smoothly and very close to the skin without causing any chaffing or cuts.</li>
            <li>I tried the Bic Flex4 recently after my girlfriend told me what great shaves she gets from the women&#x27;s version, which is the [[ASIN:B004DMEXQS Bic Soleil Bella For Women -- 3 ct.]].</li>
            <li>It feels like a disposable razor so the fact it doesn&#x27;t have a great balance isn&#x27;t a big surprise.  </li>
            <li>Definitely more economical than my replacement balde razors.</li>
            <li>it is smooth</li>
            <li>The four flexible blades bend slightly to fit the contours of your face.</li>
            <li>The lubricating strip with aloe and vitamin E gives a smooth glide.</li>
            <li>the man in your life is convinced that a fancy razor with high-priced blades is the only way to get a great shave, then introduce him to BIC Flex 4 razors.</li>
            <li>and it again did a fantastic job of giving me a close shave.  </li>
            <li>They are cheap</li>
            <li>: This is a good substitute if you aren&#x27;t near an electric razor and need something to get the job done.</li>
            <li>These have changed my mind - clean, smooth shave, with fewer nicks than I have had in years.     </li>
            <li>I have a new favorite razor!</li>
            <li>Somehow, even though there are four blades, it&#x27;s easier to clean than the 2-bladed one I was using before.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean of stray hairs in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>top is very flexible and the blades positioned in just the right manner where everything is smooth and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>They are very well made and very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>They glide, they are cool to look at and substantial to hold.  </li>
            <li>It was able to shave my head very well, without having to repeat.</li>
            <li>Five seems to be too much, for lack of a better explanation.</li>
            <li>4 blades works so much better than 3, for a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>So far, the Bic Flex 4 is the first to achieve results as good as Gilette.  </li>
            <li>I use my disposable razor in the shower to shave my armpits and legs and found this razor to be just what I was looking for - it gave me a nice close shave without a single nick - better than any women&#x27;s disposable razor.  </li>
            <li>Three are good, but four are better as it didn&#x27;t take me as long to shave with the Flex4 as it usually does with my beloved [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I kept trying out many of the new multiblade disposable razors purchased at drugstores.  </li>
            <li>I was much more pleased with the results of this shaver than I have been with others in quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These razors do NOT cut in any way - and believe me if they did I would be the first to know!  </li>
            <li>I use a blade shaver every day and for a good review used this until I managed to dull the blades to where I didn&#x27;t want to use it any more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, though I didn&#x27;t really see the benefit of the lubricating strip.</li>
            <li>The key I have found with this razor is that you absolutely must use good quality shave cream or gel.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>right on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I picked these up for my husband and noticed right away what a close shave these razors provided him with no irritation.</li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always been able to get several days worth of shaves out of them.  </li>
            <li>That being said, when I do what I can to soften my beard and cushion my face prior to shaving, Flex4 provides a better shave than I get with a ProGlide or anything else out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I will more than likely be purchasing this product, once I use up the razors I still have.</li>
            <li>First of all this is a disclaimer to all the men who are reading this review, this is one for the women.  </li>
            <li>I first opened the package of 3 disposable razors</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to return to the same spot more than once.</li>
            <li>I bought these razors for the first time ever and regret it.</li>
            <li>As a female, I have found that men&#x27;s razors work better.</li>
            <li>Plus I get a pretty close shave.</li>
            <li>I have recently seen the Flex 4&#x27;s in the stores for more than $8 for a pack of three razors.</li>
            <li>The weight was all in the handle rather than the head, so I had to push down more than I felt comfortable doing.     </li>
            <li>I do mean good-not great.</li>
            <li>long as you don&#x27;t mind using multiple blades to shave yourself, this is a good product to use.  </li>
            <li>The package says the strip contains aloe and vitamin E, but all I can say for certain is that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face type is extremely sensitive, so anytime there is a new shaver available</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a pretty decent product.</li>
            <li>I think if you are a very slow and methodical shaver, this would be great.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;NOT a head hair clipper for hair cuts, but a real beard trimmer (just no attachment)</li>
            <li>/&gt;i do because of my skin and its soo much</li>
            <li>the lines between a real shaver and a disposable one have been blurred to oblivion.  </li>
            <li>The four blades really shave close.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Bic Flex4 Disposable Four Blade Shaver is really a well thought out, well designed razor.</li>
            <li>I normally use the mach 3 to shave my legs but was willing to try out this four blade razor instead.  </li>
            <li>&quot; that support the pivoting head appear to be much weaker than the rest of the razor.</li>
            <li>My face was left feeling smooth and there&#x27;s even a convenient cap to slide over the head of the razor for travels or storage when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This combination really helps ease shaving and prevents cuts.      </li>
            <li>I like it so much that I order them from Amazon on a subscription basis to save money.  </li>
            <li>I had used the Schick Quattro disposable for years and then one day I stumbled upon the bic flex 4 which they were much cheaper than the schick quattro.  </li>
            <li>The handle has a weighty feel to it, the entire razor has matte-feel grippiness to it and the ergonomics are overall nice.</li>
            <li>I would assume that due to the large number of blades, the razor seems to last a good amount of time (maybe around 6 leg shaves.)  </li>
            <li>The shaver is also a bit heavier than other disposable shavers, allowing for better control.  </li>
            <li>However, I must admit the razor delivers a great shave, it seems less likely to nick, and it offers a smoother shave than I am accustomed to having.  </li>
            <li>If use disposables frequently enough, the somewhat closer shave may be worth the higher price to you.  </li>
            <li>When I first saw the BIC Flex4 Disposable Shaver with the FOUR BLADES, I nearly passed out.  </li>
            <li>They are definitely a lot better than the average disposable razor, but not as good as more expensive models with replaceable blades.</li>
            <li>one main concern with this razor is the long-term durability of the plastic that connects the handle to the pivoting head.</li>
            <li>classic style single blade throw-away razors can pull on skin, or hair, and at times give a person razor burn, these Flex4 disposables invariably give a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>extra cost is worth it because basically, if you think it through, if you have four blades instead of one on your shaver, you are going to have a great shave that, from the Bic Flex4, basically will last four times as long as a single blade before you need to replace</li>
            <li>They last me about 6 shaves before I bother to grab a new one, but my face is incapable of growing a full beard.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>These blades gave me a smooth shave with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li>I can squeeze a work week&#x27;s worth of shaves out of a Flex4, which is enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4 stars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always very skeptical it will be a good fit for me.  </li>
            <li>I use a Mach 3 razor blade, but I decided to bring this Flex4 on a week long vacation, and it was an adequate substitute.</li>
            <li>They may have just got a new follower for the Flex 4.</li>
            <li>I like the spacing between the blades because I found it didn&#x27;t clog up so easily, but the overall size made it hard to be precise and keep from nicking myself trying to get under the nose and around the edges.</li>
            <li>The actual unit that houses the blades is just too big to be comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The handle of shaver is larger than other disposable shavers out there, making for a better grip and a fuller feeling in the palm of your hand.  </li>
            <li>As with other razors, the only way to know for sure would be to try it.</li>
            <li>It was not as smooth and did not last as long.     </li>
            <li>Of course when I think of disposables, I think of those little cheap ones I used to get 10 for a dollar or two.</li>
            <li>Also, the blades are larger than most of the others that I have used, and I found myself going over places that I had already shaved, and it irritated a little.  </li>
            <li>I had trouble getting precise around my nose and mouth, and these are sensitive areas</li>
            <li>The extra blades on the Flex 4 makes it so much easier to shave my head.</li>
            <li>I gave these to my 24 year old son to try out for me.</li>
            <li>Secondly, the shave was really close with the 4 blade technology.</li>
            <li>I am far from a high-maintenance metrosexual in any respect.  </li>
            <li>While these had a good heft to them, they seemed to be weighted wrong.</li>
            <li>The quality of the shave is quite good (extremely close shave with no real irritation and minimal nicks while shaving) and</li>
            <li>A little more spendy on the front end, but in the long run?</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives a close shave, and actually lasted for several shaves more than my previous razors.</li>
            <li>All the same, they give a decent shave, with or without shaving cream.     </li>
            <li>He highly recommends these for anyone looking for an upgrade for a traditional disposable.</li>
            <li>Forget about those cheap, yellow, metallic face scrapers that passed for a &#x27;disposable&#x27; shave in years past - with this new breed of shaver</li>
            <li>feel smooth against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;the head was a little bit big..</li>
            <li>These new BIC Flex4&#x27;s do the job of a solid razor with the benefit of being disposable.</li>
            <li>These are not like the over-engineered Gillette and Schick cartridge razors that have a ton of goop and blade coating forgiveness -- you can get yourself into a lot of trouble quickly if you&#x27;re not careful about how you prepare your face.</li>
            <li>If you travel or camp out a lot and still place a degree of value on such creature comforts like a decent shave, definitely give these razors a try.  </li>
            <li>The closeness of the shave was immediately apparent as all of those blades just took care of it in one of two swipes.  </li>
            <li>These blades give an effective but uncomfortable shave.</li>
            <li>BIC&#x27;s Flex4 disposable shavers provide such a smooth, tight shave that I actually felt a mild sense of pity when i recently disposed of one after using it every other day for nearly 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>This thing has been designed so that not only is cutting yourself not a very likely scenario, but it&#x27;s smooth and easy as well.  </li>
            <li>First, they lasted longer than a typical disposable (he told me one of the razors lasted him over 2 weeks of daily use).</li>
            <li>My husband showed down and truly did come to appreciate how much closer the shave was for him.</li>
            <li>The flexible blade feature seemed to make for a somewhat closer shave than I&#x27;ve typically received from a disposable razor, but not much so closer that I would pay significantly more for this razor than for a typical disposable.  </li>
            <li>My husband normally uses Bic razors so he was not sure what to expect from Bic&#x27;s new Flex 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have four blades here, plus a lubricating strip, and it&#x27;s a little much.</li>
            <li>, this is a \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; razor that isn&#x27;t really meant to hold up for years of regular use, but I wouldn&#x27;t be as worried about the durability of the pivoting head if the plastic was a little thicker in that</li>

            <li> They were enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve held some reusable razors that felt weaker and more \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; than these BIC razors.</li>
            <li> so you may want top replace your disposable razor after six or seven shaves.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Works better for me than the Battery powered ones.</li>
            <li> At almost $18, I&#x27;d want more than three shavers.</li>
            <li> There are 4 blades, with a rubber strip at the bottom and a lubricant strip at the top.  </li>
            <li> I love love love love these.</li>
            <li> Four blades has become the perfect amount for me personally.</li>
            <li> It was as though Gilette had lost their rights to the design and many companies,</li>
            <li> One thing that I do notice about the bic vs. the quattro, is that the bic razor is better at removing stubbly hair under my chin.  </li>
            <li> Something I could never get with the Quattro now matter how many times I shaved.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always found Bic disposable razors to give pretty good shaves</li>
            <li> WHat makes this so outstanding is its ergonomic design which fits the hand so much more easily and more comfortably than any</li>
            <li> Pretty good compliments from a guy who is usually quick to criticize!</li>
            <li> The bulky head isn&#x27;t a deal-breaker, but I think I&#x27;m more comfortable with my Mach3 blades.</li>
            <li> The price on these razors makes them an all-around good buy.</li>
            <li> COOL!  </li>
            <li> other areas feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li> He said they are easy to rinse while using and they feel sturdier in his hand than some others he has tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable to hold, and shaves very smoothly and very close to the skin without causing any chaffing or cuts.</li>
            <li> I tried the Bic Flex4 recently after my girlfriend told me what great shaves she gets from the women&#x27;s version, which is the [[ASIN:B004DMEXQS Bic Soleil Bella For Women -- 3 ct.]].</li>
            <li> It feels like a disposable razor so the fact it doesn&#x27;t have a great balance isn&#x27;t a big surprise.  </li>
            <li> Definitely more economical than my replacement balde razors.</li>
            <li> it is smooth</li>
            <li> The four flexible blades bend slightly to fit the contours of your face.</li>
            <li> The lubricating strip with aloe and vitamin E gives a smooth glide.</li>
            <li> the man in your life is convinced that a fancy razor with high-priced blades is the only way to get a great shave, then introduce him to BIC Flex 4 razors.</li>
            <li> and it again did a fantastic job of giving me a close shave.  </li>
            <li> They are cheap</li>
            <li> : This is a good substitute if you aren&#x27;t near an electric razor and need something to get the job done.</li>
            <li> These have changed my mind - clean, smooth shave, with fewer nicks than I have had in years.     </li>
            <li> I have a new favorite razor!</li>
            <li> Somehow, even though there are four blades, it&#x27;s easier to clean than the 2-bladed one I was using before.</li>
            <li> It rinses clean of stray hairs in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> top is very flexible and the blades positioned in just the right manner where everything is smooth and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> They are very well made and very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> They glide, they are cool to look at and substantial to hold.  </li>
            <li> It was able to shave my head very well, without having to repeat.</li>
            <li> Five seems to be too much, for lack of a better explanation.</li>
            <li> 4 blades works so much better than 3, for a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> So far, the Bic Flex 4 is the first to achieve results as good as Gilette.  </li>
            <li> I use my disposable razor in the shower to shave my armpits and legs and found this razor to be just what I was looking for - it gave me a nice close shave without a single nick - better than any women&#x27;s disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> Three are good, but four are better as it didn&#x27;t take me as long to shave with the Flex4 as it usually does with my beloved [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I kept trying out many of the new multiblade disposable razors purchased at drugstores.  </li>
            <li> I was much more pleased with the results of this shaver than I have been with others in quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These razors do NOT cut in any way - and believe me if they did I would be the first to know!  </li>
            <li> I use a blade shaver every day and for a good review used this until I managed to dull the blades to where I didn&#x27;t want to use it any more.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, though I didn&#x27;t really see the benefit of the lubricating strip.</li>
            <li> The key I have found with this razor is that you absolutely must use good quality shave cream or gel.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> right on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I picked these up for my husband and noticed right away what a close shave these razors provided him with no irritation.</li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always been able to get several days worth of shaves out of them.  </li>
            <li> That being said, when I do what I can to soften my beard and cushion my face prior to shaving, Flex4 provides a better shave than I get with a ProGlide or anything else out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I will more than likely be purchasing this product, once I use up the razors I still have.</li>
            <li> First of all this is a disclaimer to all the men who are reading this review, this is one for the women.  </li>
            <li> I first opened the package of 3 disposable razors</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to return to the same spot more than once.</li>
            <li> I bought these razors for the first time ever and regret it.</li>
            <li> As a female, I have found that men&#x27;s razors work better.</li>
            <li> Plus I get a pretty close shave.</li>
            <li> I have recently seen the Flex 4&#x27;s in the stores for more than $8 for a pack of three razors.</li>
            <li> The weight was all in the handle rather than the head, so I had to push down more than I felt comfortable doing.     </li>
            <li> I do mean good-not great.</li>
            <li> long as you don&#x27;t mind using multiple blades to shave yourself, this is a good product to use.  </li>
            <li> The package says the strip contains aloe and vitamin E, but all I can say for certain is that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face type is extremely sensitive, so anytime there is a new shaver available</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a pretty decent product.</li>
            <li> I think if you are a very slow and methodical shaver, this would be great.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;NOT a head hair clipper for hair cuts, but a real beard trimmer (just no attachment)</li>
            <li> /&gt;i do because of my skin and its soo much</li>
            <li> the lines between a real shaver and a disposable one have been blurred to oblivion.  </li>
            <li> The four blades really shave close.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Bic Flex4 Disposable Four Blade Shaver is really a well thought out, well designed razor.</li>
            <li> I normally use the mach 3 to shave my legs but was willing to try out this four blade razor instead.  </li>
            <li> &quot; that support the pivoting head appear to be much weaker than the rest of the razor.</li>
            <li> My face was left feeling smooth and there&#x27;s even a convenient cap to slide over the head of the razor for travels or storage when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This combination really helps ease shaving and prevents cuts.      </li>
            <li> I like it so much that I order them from Amazon on a subscription basis to save money.  </li>
            <li> I had used the Schick Quattro disposable for years and then one day I stumbled upon the bic flex 4 which they were much cheaper than the schick quattro.  </li>
            <li> The handle has a weighty feel to it, the entire razor has matte-feel grippiness to it and the ergonomics are overall nice.</li>
            <li> I would assume that due to the large number of blades, the razor seems to last a good amount of time (maybe around 6 leg shaves.)  </li>
            <li> The shaver is also a bit heavier than other disposable shavers, allowing for better control.  </li>
            <li> However, I must admit the razor delivers a great shave, it seems less likely to nick, and it offers a smoother shave than I am accustomed to having.  </li>
            <li> If use disposables frequently enough, the somewhat closer shave may be worth the higher price to you.  </li>
            <li> When I first saw the BIC Flex4 Disposable Shaver with the FOUR BLADES, I nearly passed out.  </li>
            <li> They are definitely a lot better than the average disposable razor, but not as good as more expensive models with replaceable blades.</li>
            <li> one main concern with this razor is the long-term durability of the plastic that connects the handle to the pivoting head.</li>
            <li> classic style single blade throw-away razors can pull on skin, or hair, and at times give a person razor burn, these Flex4 disposables invariably give a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> extra cost is worth it because basically, if you think it through, if you have four blades instead of one on your shaver, you are going to have a great shave that, from the Bic Flex4, basically will last four times as long as a single blade before you need to replace</li>
            <li> They last me about 6 shaves before I bother to grab a new one, but my face is incapable of growing a full beard.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> These blades gave me a smooth shave with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> I can squeeze a work week&#x27;s worth of shaves out of a Flex4, which is enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always very skeptical it will be a good fit for me.  </li>
            <li> I use a Mach 3 razor blade, but I decided to bring this Flex4 on a week long vacation, and it was an adequate substitute.</li>
            <li> They may have just got a new follower for the Flex 4.</li>
            <li> I like the spacing between the blades because I found it didn&#x27;t clog up so easily, but the overall size made it hard to be precise and keep from nicking myself trying to get under the nose and around the edges.</li>
            <li> The actual unit that houses the blades is just too big to be comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The handle of shaver is larger than other disposable shavers out there, making for a better grip and a fuller feeling in the palm of your hand.  </li>
            <li> As with other razors, the only way to know for sure would be to try it.</li>
            <li> It was not as smooth and did not last as long.     </li>
            <li> Of course when I think of disposables, I think of those little cheap ones I used to get 10 for a dollar or two.</li>
            <li> Also, the blades are larger than most of the others that I have used, and I found myself going over places that I had already shaved, and it irritated a little.  </li>
            <li> I had trouble getting precise around my nose and mouth, and these are sensitive areas</li>
            <li> The extra blades on the Flex 4 makes it so much easier to shave my head.</li>
            <li> I gave these to my 24 year old son to try out for me.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the shave was really close with the 4 blade technology.</li>
            <li> I am far from a high-maintenance metrosexual in any respect.  </li>
            <li> While these had a good heft to them, they seemed to be weighted wrong.</li>
            <li> The quality of the shave is quite good (extremely close shave with no real irritation and minimal nicks while shaving) and</li>
            <li> A little more spendy on the front end, but in the long run?</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives a close shave, and actually lasted for several shaves more than my previous razors.</li>
            <li> All the same, they give a decent shave, with or without shaving cream.     </li>
            <li> He highly recommends these for anyone looking for an upgrade for a traditional disposable.</li>
            <li> Forget about those cheap, yellow, metallic face scrapers that passed for a &#x27;disposable&#x27; shave in years past - with this new breed of shaver</li>
            <li> feel smooth against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;the head was a little bit big..</li>
            <li> These new BIC Flex4&#x27;s do the job of a solid razor with the benefit of being disposable.</li>
            <li> These are not like the over-engineered Gillette and Schick cartridge razors that have a ton of goop and blade coating forgiveness -- you can get yourself into a lot of trouble quickly if you&#x27;re not careful about how you prepare your face.</li>
            <li> If you travel or camp out a lot and still place a degree of value on such creature comforts like a decent shave, definitely give these razors a try.  </li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave was immediately apparent as all of those blades just took care of it in one of two swipes.  </li>
            <li> These blades give an effective but uncomfortable shave.</li>
            <li> BIC&#x27;s Flex4 disposable shavers provide such a smooth, tight shave that I actually felt a mild sense of pity when i recently disposed of one after using it every other day for nearly 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> This thing has been designed so that not only is cutting yourself not a very likely scenario, but it&#x27;s smooth and easy as well.  </li>
            <li> First, they lasted longer than a typical disposable (he told me one of the razors lasted him over 2 weeks of daily use).</li>
            <li> My husband showed down and truly did come to appreciate how much closer the shave was for him.</li>
            <li> The flexible blade feature seemed to make for a somewhat closer shave than I&#x27;ve typically received from a disposable razor, but not much so closer that I would pay significantly more for this razor than for a typical disposable.  </li>
            <li> My husband normally uses Bic razors so he was not sure what to expect from Bic&#x27;s new Flex 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have four blades here, plus a lubricating strip, and it&#x27;s a little much.</li>
            <li> , this is a \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; razor that isn&#x27;t really meant to hold up for years of regular use, but I wouldn&#x27;t be as worried about the durability of the pivoting head if the plastic was a little thicker in that</li>
            <li> They get 4 stars instead of 5 because the price is a little high without coupons  - Amazon is discounted, but I haven&#x27;t seen these on sale in a brick and mortar store - and because they are only marketed to men.</li>
            <li> I am normally not a fan of  disposable razors because in my experience they tend to be rough on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a disposable razor, and while disposables have come a long way, they are not made with the same amount of thought and quality that cartridge refillable razors are.</li>
            <li> While an extremely close shaved is welcomed by both sexes, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m willing to pay this price in my local store.</li>
            <li> The blades are still sharp after four uses, even though I have coarse facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I was a little surprised by the quality of the razor.</li>
            <li> This razor does provide a close shave comparable to the more expensive razors (like mach 3 and such) but it also tends to be a little rougher on the skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a minor criticism and would not prevent me from buying the product.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other female reviewers - BIC -</li>
            <li> I have shaved with these things several times when I let my facial hair get out of control and have always been amazed at how little pull</li>
            <li> If I could still buy them, I would probably buy single blade razor refills.  </li>
            <li> I have had closer shaves with a single blade than this one.</li>
            <li> I can remember when all we had was single blades.</li>
            <li> The head is on a pivot but has very little pivoting action to it -- nothing like the paddle-pivot design of Gillette razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have semi sensitive skin and usually just go with a gillete mach 3 if i have to shave with cream.&lt;br /&gt;didnt</li>
            <li> It took my entire shaving time down by two thirds.  </li>
            <li> you will just get more mad that your money went down the&lt;br /&gt;drain</li>
            <li> His big complaint was that they were too big.  </li>
            <li> I try to be careful with.</li>
            <li> The razor head is a little larger, so shaving is slightly faster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not even complete with half of my face and the shaver was dull.</li>
            <li> They stay sharp forever and you are DONE legs, and here and there in 45 seconds.  </li>
            <li> The blades are mounted on a pivoting head similar to the Gillette and Schick brand reusable razors that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> the moisturizing/lubricating strip does its job extremely well.</li>
            <li> I prefer these over the Mach 3 and other permanent shavers.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why Marketing Departments insist on different disposable razors for men and women - we basically want the same thing - an inexpensive razor that gives you a close shave without nicking or irritating your skin.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, it cost much less.</li>
            <li> Usually, I don&#x27;t care for disposable razors, since I am not wild about a disposable economy.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;There was no way I was going to put that blade anywhere near my throat for fear of cutting myself wide open.  </li>
            <li> The shaver head pivots up and down, and adjusts to your face.  </li>
            <li> (less to pack).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend these razors for travelers who don&#x27;t want to risk damaging or losing an expensive reusable razor while on a vacation or business trip.</li>
            <li> When I shave my legs, I tend to be a little quicker</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money or time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a plastic that responds to your every slight movement of the hand as you reach every small corner and crevice.    </li>
            <li> It was impossible to get that four-blade shaver to shave my upper lip, so I pulled out my single blade version to get that part.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i usually just use a portable electric beard and hair trimmer..</li>
            <li> I usually tend to have a bald hair style, so I need a razor that will work well.</li>
            <li> And the area just below my lower lip was also difficult with this shaver, again necessitating my single blade</li>
            <li> so hard to manuever around my goatee and chin</li>
            <li> Remember a  razor loses 5 per cent of its sharpness after each</li>
            <li> I mean come on the 3 razors for 12.00 for the quattro.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the \\&quot;potentially\\&quot; weak point in the design</li>
            <li> too bad you have to give it one even a single star.</li>
            <li> Electric seems to be smoother, easier to handle, less chance of you cutting yourself, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about that silly shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> So, when I tried this product I thought the four blade idea was silly and extravagant.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, you still have to deal with the silly shaving cream</li>
            <li> Expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid of cutting myself with all those razors, but I managed to not cut myself with this device.</li>
            <li> When it comes to shaving, all I ask for my razor is that is cut the whiskers without cutting my face or yanking them out by the roots.  </li>
            <li> Now that&#x27;s not to say that the Quattro is bad.  </li>
            <li> I was going to give this product three stars - because my husband HATED these razors.  </li>
            <li> It can also provide a painfully awful shave that will make you never want to buy anything branded Bic again.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I tried the Bic Flex4 recently after my girlfriend told me what great shaves she gets from the women&#x27;s version, which is the [[ASIN:B004DMEXQS Bic Soleil Bella For Women -- 3 ct.]]. Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetics: 4 stars. This is a surprisingly hefty razor considering that it&#x27;s a disposable. The handle has a weighty feel to it, the entire razor has matte-feel grippiness to it and the ergonomics are overall nice. The head is on a pivot but has very little pivoting action to it -- nothing like the paddle-pivot design of Gillette razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave: 4 stars. The Flex4 can provide an outstanding shave that&#x27;s better than almost anything else on the shelf. It can also provide a painfully awful shave that will make you never want to buy anything branded Bic again. The key I have found with this razor is that you absolutely must use good quality shave cream or gel. You cannot skimp on moisture here because the Flex4 will not provide it. These are not like the over-engineered Gillette and Schick cartridge razors that have a ton of goop and blade coating forgiveness -- you can get yourself into a lot of trouble quickly if you&#x27;re not careful about how you prepare your face. That being said, when I do what I can to soften my beard and cushion my face prior to shaving, Flex4 provides a better shave than I get with a ProGlide or anything else out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: 3 stars. This is a disposable razor, and while disposables have come a long way, they are not made with the same amount of thought and quality that cartridge refillable razors are. I can squeeze a work week&#x27;s worth of shaves out of a Flex4, which is enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4 stars. The price on these razors makes them an all-around good buy. Again, your experience will vary greatly on how you prepare your face.</li>
            <li> I was fair in reviewing this product by splitting it between my husband and me.  We both felt like it gave a closer shave.  And we both walked away with cuts.  I think if you are a very slow and methodical shaver, this would be great.  When I shave my legs, I tend to be a little quicker and this wasn&#x27;t for me.  My husband showed down and truly did come to appreciate how much closer the shave was for him.</li>
            <li> I was going to give this product three stars - because my husband HATED these razors.  BUT - this is my review - he can go write his own rating.  His big complaint was that they were too big.  The exact reason I LOVED them!  It took my entire shaving time down by two thirds.  Yeah, I collect data like this.  These razors do NOT cut in any way - and believe me if they did I would be the first to know!  They stay sharp forever and you are DONE legs, and here and there in 45 seconds.  They glide, they are cool to look at and substantial to hold.  They&#x27;re just awesome!  I&#x27;ve been using the same two in my shower for the last month and they don&#x27;t show any signs of rust.  Definitely worth the money.  I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> These blades give an effective but uncomfortable shave. You feel like it&#x27;s pulling the hair out instead of trimming it.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I am a woman, and used these for shaving my legs, so men, take note!    I tend to like a heavier razor for shaving my legs. While these had a good heft to them, they seemed to be weighted wrong. The weight was all in the handle rather than the head, so I had to push down more than I felt comfortable doing.     All the same, they give a decent shave, with or without shaving cream.     They work fine, but I don&#x27;t like them any more than the kind I pay a couple of bucks for.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why Marketing Departments insist on different disposable razors for men and women - we basically want the same thing - an inexpensive razor that gives you a close shave without nicking or irritating your skin.  I use my disposable razor in the shower to shave my armpits and legs and found this razor to be just what I was looking for - it gave me a nice close shave without a single nick - better than any women&#x27;s disposable razor.  It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, though I didn&#x27;t really see the benefit of the lubricating strip. I agree with the other female reviewers - BIC - don&#x27;t just market these for men!</li>
            <li> I use a blade shaver every day and for a good review used this until I managed to dull the blades to where I didn&#x27;t want to use it any more.  I&#x27;m not impressed and glad to be done.  It feels like a disposable razor so the fact it doesn&#x27;t have a great balance isn&#x27;t a big surprise.  The actual unit that houses the blades is just too big to be comfortable.  I like the spacing between the blades because I found it didn&#x27;t clog up so easily, but the overall size made it hard to be precise and keep from nicking myself trying to get under the nose and around the edges.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s a better razor than this out there, I&#x27;ve not met up with it.  I&#x27;ve  been accustomed to BICs 2-blade razor in this series, then 3 blades.  Now we have four blades and as close a shave as I can remember.    WHat makes this so outstanding is its ergonomic design which fits the hand so much more easily and more comfortably than any I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s a plastic that responds to your every slight movement of the hand as you reach every small corner and crevice.    Give this a try and I sincerely believe you&#x27;ll echo every word I&#x27;ve written here.</li>
            <li> If I could still buy them, I would probably buy single blade razor refills.  So, when I tried this product I thought the four blade idea was silly and extravagant.  However, I must admit the razor delivers a great shave, it seems less likely to nick, and it offers a smoother shave than I am accustomed to having.  Therefore, to my surprise, I am recommending these disposables.</li>
            <li> not so impressed.&lt;br /&gt;i have semi sensitive skin and usually just go with a gillete mach 3 if i have to shave with cream.&lt;br /&gt;didnt feel smooth against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;the head was a little bit big.. so hard to manuever around my goatee and chin strap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i usually just use a portable electric beard and hair trimmer..&lt;br /&gt;NOT a head hair clipper for hair cuts, but a real beard trimmer (just no attachment) right on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i do because of my skin and its soo much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;id get a gillette mach 3.</li>
            <li> BIC&#x27;s Flex4 disposable shavers provide such a smooth, tight shave that I actually felt a mild sense of pity when i recently disposed of one after using it every other day for nearly 3 weeks.  Forget about those cheap, yellow, metallic face scrapers that passed for a &#x27;disposable&#x27; shave in years past - with this new breed of shaver the lines between a real shaver and a disposable one have been blurred to oblivion.  If you travel or camp out a lot and still place a degree of value on such creature comforts like a decent shave, definitely give these razors a try.  Sure, there are cheaper options but a smooth shave beats skin nicks any day of the week!</li>
            <li> I admit upfront that I am a bigger fan of electric razors then I am of hand ones. Electric seems to be smoother, easier to handle, less chance of you cutting yourself, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about that silly shaving cream.  BIC&#x27;s Flex shaver is a big exception to the rule.  This thing has been designed so that not only is cutting yourself not a very likely scenario, but it&#x27;s smooth and easy as well.  I have shaved with these things several times when I let my facial hair get out of control and have always been amazed at how little pull I feel when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top is very flexible and the blades positioned in just the right manner where everything is smooth and easy to use.  Sadly, you still have to deal with the silly shaving cream but I guess this is just one pitfall shaving manufacturer&#x27;s haven&#x27;t quite figured out yet.  Bottom line: This is a good substitute if you aren&#x27;t near an electric razor and need something to get the job done.</li>
            <li> This razor worked OK but probably wouldn&#x27;t buy them often as I find that they are really expensive in the store.  Also, the blades are larger than most of the others that I have used, and I found myself going over places that I had already shaved, and it irritated a little.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a pretty decent product.</li>
            <li> They may have just got a new follower for the Flex 4. This razor works great for me. I was expecting it to cut my facial hairs well, but I was concerned how well it would shave my head. I usually tend to have a bald hair style, so I need a razor that will work well. It was able to shave my head very well, without having to repeat. The extra blades on the Flex 4 makes it so much easier to shave my head. The great thing is it feels smooth on my head. I was afraid of cutting myself with all those razors, but I managed to not cut myself with this device. So I will more than likely be purchasing this product, once I use up the razors I still have.</li>
            <li> My husband was out of town and I was out of razors when the Vine package showed up. Therefore, I opened it and gave this a spin. I have a new favorite razor! I&#x27;ve now used all 3 that came in my package, and have yet to nick any legs or underarms. The razor head is a little larger, so shaving is slightly faster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives a close shave, and actually lasted for several shaves more than my previous razors. The lubricating strip works well, and the head pivots nicely around my corners. Somehow, even though there are four blades, it&#x27;s easier to clean than the 2-bladed one I was using before. It rinses clean of stray hairs in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These razors are definitely recommended. They get 4 stars instead of 5 because the price is a little high without coupons  - Amazon is discounted, but I haven&#x27;t seen these on sale in a brick and mortar store - and because they are only marketed to men. (Why do razors need to be gender specific anyway?)</li>
            <li> I picked these up for my husband and noticed right away what a close shave these razors provided him with no irritation. He said they are easy to rinse while using and they feel sturdier in his hand than some others he has tried. Pretty good compliments from a guy who is usually quick to criticize!</li>
            <li> took a chance on these and they work great.  they are better than all replaceables I have tried except for to expensive proglides.</li>
            <li> Usually, I don&#x27;t care for disposable razors, since I am not wild about a disposable economy.     These have changed my mind - clean, smooth shave, with fewer nicks than I have had in years.     And I&#x27;ve been using the same razor for six months now, shaving several times a week.     A little more spendy on the front end, but in the long run? Definitely more economical than my replacement balde razors.</li>
            <li> The Bic Flex4 Disposable Four Blade Shavers are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Whereas classic style single blade throw-away razors can pull on skin, or hair, and at times give a person razor burn, these Flex4 disposables invariably give a smooth shave. The four blades really shave close.&lt;br /&gt;The only safety caveat for a man would be if he hadn&#x27;t used this type of shaver before. He may have to take extra care getting used to shaving around his nose and above his lip as the head of the razor flips and swivels and he could get nicked.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it is smooth sailing.&lt;br /&gt;The extra cost is worth it because basically, if you think it through, if you have four blades instead of one on your shaver, you are going to have a great shave that, from the Bic Flex4, basically will last four times as long as a single blade before you need to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;Once you try a shaver of this quality, you won&#x27;t go back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So: in conclusion: smoother shave, longer lasting product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bic Flex4 Disposable Four Blade Shaver is really a well thought out, well designed razor.</li>
            <li> First of all this is a disclaimer to all the men who are reading this review, this is one for the women.  I normally use the mach 3 to shave my legs but was willing to try out this four blade razor instead.  I am normally not a fan of  disposable razors because in my experience they tend to be rough on my sensitive skin.  This razor does provide a close shave comparable to the more expensive razors (like mach 3 and such) but it also tends to be a little rougher on the skin.  I would assume that due to the large number of blades, the razor seems to last a good amount of time (maybe around 6 leg shaves.)  I would recommend this product and would myself use it in the future.  This disposable razor is by far the best disposable razor I have used yet!</li>
            <li> The best and most economical way to shave is with a safety razor and blades, but these are very good disposable razors. They were enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li> The BIC Flex4 Disposable Razor is a surprisingly high-quality razor with four blades and a good moisturizing strip connected to an ergonomic handle with a comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the package of 3 disposable razors I was a little surprised by the quality of the razor. I&#x27;ve held some reusable razors that felt weaker and more \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; than these BIC razors. The blades are mounted on a pivoting head similar to the Gillette and Schick brand reusable razors that I&#x27;ve used in the past. The quality of the shave is quite good (extremely close shave with no real irritation and minimal nicks while shaving) and the moisturizing/lubricating strip does its job extremely well. The package says the strip contains aloe and vitamin E, but all I can say for certain is that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one main concern with this razor is the long-term durability of the plastic that connects the handle to the pivoting head. The plastic \\&quot;arms\\&quot; that support the pivoting head appear to be much weaker than the rest of the razor. I used one disposable razor during a two-week trip overseas and it never broke, but it looks and feels like it might not hold up over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, this is a \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; razor that isn&#x27;t really meant to hold up for years of regular use, but I wouldn&#x27;t be as worried about the durability of the pivoting head if the plastic was a little thicker in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the \\&quot;potentially\\&quot; weak point in the design this disposable razor provides an excellent shave and good value for the money. I&#x27;d highly recommend these razors for travelers who don&#x27;t want to risk damaging or losing an expensive reusable razor while on a vacation or business trip.</li>
            <li> My husband normally uses Bic razors so he was not sure what to expect from Bic&#x27;s new Flex 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With BIC Flex 4 there is no need to shave over the same area multiple times. The four flexible blades bend slightly to fit the contours of your face. The lubricating strip with aloe and vitamin E gives a smooth glide. The textured grip also seems to make it easier to manipulate the razor for closer shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the man in your life is convinced that a fancy razor with high-priced blades is the only way to get a great shave, then introduce him to BIC Flex 4 razors. Remember a  razor loses 5 per cent of its sharpness after each so you may want top replace your disposable razor after six or seven shaves.</li>
            <li> Good disposable razor that does what a razor is suppose too.  And I like that fact that 3 come in a package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always associated BIC razors with cheapness. The Flex4 is another story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four blades make a difference. Three are good, but four are better as it didn&#x27;t take me as long to shave with the Flex4 as it usually does with my beloved [[ASIN:B000XVTYYY Gillette Mach3 blades]]. I didn&#x27;t need to return to the same spot more than once. I may have only \\&quot;shaved off\\&quot; a minute or two, but for someone who hates shaving, that&#x27;s a plus! My face was left feeling smooth and there&#x27;s even a convenient cap to slide over the head of the razor for travels or storage when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while I like it, I&#x27;m not entirely sold on it either. My sole gripe is that the head is too bulky. You have four blades here, plus a lubricating strip, and it&#x27;s a little much. I had trouble getting precise around my nose and mouth, and these are sensitive areas I try to be careful with. The bulky head isn&#x27;t a deal-breaker, but I think I&#x27;m more comfortable with my Mach3 blades.</li>
            <li> I have been using the BIC FLEX 4 for about 2 years, it&#x27;s the best Razor I have found. I love it. Works better for me than the Battery powered ones.</li>
            <li> I bought these razors for the first time ever and regret it. I was not even complete with half of my face and the shaver was dull. I could not believe it took 2 shavers to get a good shave. I do mean good-not great. I have had closer shaves with a single blade than this one. don&#x27;t waste your money or time you will just get more mad that your money went down the&lt;br /&gt;drain before the hair on your face was gone. too bad you have to give it one even a single star.</li>
            <li> Of course when I think of disposables, I think of those little cheap ones I used to get 10 for a dollar or two. These new BIC Flex4&#x27;s do the job of a solid razor with the benefit of being disposable. I gave these to my 24 year old son to try out for me. He gave them a 5 star ratin. First, they lasted longer than a typical disposable (he told me one of the razors lasted him over 2 weeks of daily use). Secondly, the shave was really close with the 4 blade technology. He highly recommends these for anyone looking for an upgrade for a traditional disposable. They would be wonderful to take on vacation this year to use in place of your every day razor and you can throw it out before you leave the islands to come home (less to pack). These disposables come as close to a traditional razor as you can get.</li>
            <li> I am far from a high-maintenance metrosexual in any respect.  When it comes to shaving, all I ask for my razor is that is cut the whiskers without cutting my face or yanking them out by the roots.  To that end, the BIC Flex4 succeeds admirably.  These disposable razors are one-shot deals - the handle is disposable as well as the blades/heads.      The four blades do the trick with speed and economy, and the pivoting head does not flop around willy-nilly.  I&#x27;ve used these for two weeks without a nick and the shave is close enough that the five o&#x27;clock shadow doesn&#x27;t show up until around 8 pm.      My only quibble is that there is no single-blade trimmer that can be used for the sideburns.  This is a minor criticism and would not prevent me from buying the product.  However, it does separate it from a five-star rave review.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the difference between blades for men and women? Marketing. The BIC Flex4 is a wonderful disposable shaver that is excellent for women. It&#x27;s very comfortable to hold, and shaves very smoothly and very close to the skin without causing any chaffing or cuts. I was much more pleased with the results of this shaver than I have been with others in quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I&#x27;m giving it four stars is because of the price. At almost $18, I&#x27;d want more than three shavers. While an extremely close shaved is welcomed by both sexes, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m willing to pay this price in my local store.</li>
            <li> These razor blade shavers are excellent.  They are very well made and very comfortable to use.  They have grips at each point where you would hold the shaver.  There are 4 blades, with a rubber strip at the bottom and a lubricant strip at the top.  This combination really helps ease shaving and prevents cuts.      The handle of shaver is larger than other disposable shavers out there, making for a better grip and a fuller feeling in the palm of your hand.  The shaver is also a bit heavier than other disposable shavers, allowing for better control.  The blades are still sharp after four uses, even though I have coarse facial hair.  The shaver head pivots up and down, and adjusts to your face.  I prefer these over the Mach 3 and other permanent shavers.  Highly recommended.  5 stars.</li>
            <li> I use a Mach 3 razor blade, but I decided to bring this Flex4 on a week long vacation, and it was an adequate substitute.</li>
            <li> My face type is extremely sensitive, so anytime there is a new shaver available I&#x27;m always very skeptical it will be a good fit for me.  When I first saw the BIC Flex4 Disposable Shaver with the FOUR BLADES, I nearly passed out.  You&#x27;ve GOT to be kidding me with four blades, right?  I remember when the double blade was considered eccentric and then the triples came along.  What&#x27;s next, a 10-blade shaver?  Sheez!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no way I was going to put that blade anywhere near my throat for fear of cutting myself wide open.  So I started along the sideburns area and cheek.  The closeness of the shave was immediately apparent as all of those blades just took care of it in one of two swipes.  COOL!  Then I gingerly worked my way to the throat and lower neck area and it again did a fantastic job of giving me a close shave.  The only problem was around my mouth area.  It was impossible to get that four-blade shaver to shave my upper lip, so I pulled out my single blade version to get that part.  And the area just below my lower lip was also difficult with this shaver, again necessitating my single blade shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as you don&#x27;t mind using multiple blades to shave yourself, this is a good product to use.  Still scares me even after 10 shaves, though.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products where you probably already know whether you want to use it or not.  I&#x27;ve always found Bic disposable razors to give pretty good shaves and I&#x27;ve always been able to get several days worth of shaves out of them.  The flexible blade feature seemed to make for a somewhat closer shave than I&#x27;ve typically received from a disposable razor, but not much so closer that I would pay significantly more for this razor than for a typical disposable.  So, if you like Bic disposables, you should like this one as well.  If use disposables frequently enough, the somewhat closer shave may be worth the higher price to you.  As with other razors, the only way to know for sure would be to try it.</li>
            <li> I love love love love these. As a female, I have found that men&#x27;s razors work better. Four blades has become the perfect amount for me personally. Five seems to be too much, for lack of a better explanation. Four tends to be cheaper and get the same results. Three blades are just not enough. These razors move perfectly and leave my legs/other areas feeling wonderful. Plus I get a pretty close shave. I always keep these in stock.</li>
            <li> It cannot compare to Gillette Fusion. Maybe I should not expect it to.    It was not as smooth and did not last as long.     On the other hand, it cost much less.</li>
            <li> I kept trying out many of the new multiblade disposable razors purchased at drugstores.  It was as though Gilette had lost their rights to the design and many companies, even some from Asia, are trying to come up with a razor as good as the Gilettes.  So far, the Bic Flex 4 is the first to achieve results as good as Gilette.  I like it so much that I order them from Amazon on a subscription basis to save money.  I have recently seen the Flex 4&#x27;s in the stores for more than $8 for a pack of three razors.</li>
            <li> I just tried using this product, works perfect around parts of beard I don&#x27;t shave, perfect for sensitive skin.  I can remember when all we had was single blades. This blade gives a good shave, with good shaving cream !</li>
            <li> I had used the Schick Quattro disposable for years and then one day I stumbled upon the bic flex 4 which they were much cheaper than the schick quattro.  I mean come on the 3 razors for 12.00 for the quattro.  Expensive.  Now that&#x27;s not to say that the Quattro is bad.  It&#x27;s  a very good razor.  But I think the Bic Flex 4 exceeded my expectations.  One thing that I do notice about the bic vs. the quattro, is that the bic razor is better at removing stubbly hair under my chin.  Very smooth close shave. Something I could never get with the Quattro now matter how many times I shaved.  So if you are looking a cheaper alternative to Schick Quattro, Bic 4 is it?</li>
            <li> These blades gave me a smooth shave with minimal irritation. They are definitely a lot better than the average disposable razor, but not as good as more expensive models with replaceable blades. I&#x27;d buy these in a pinch, if I were on vacation and forgot to pack my razor, but they&#x27;re not going to be a regular purchase for me.</li>
            <li> Well, they shave my face. They are cheap so I was not expecting glorious results, and I got what I paid for. They last me about 6 shaves before I bother to grab a new one, but my face is incapable of growing a full beard.</li>
            <li> Good, but I prefer Schick Xtreme III</li>
            <li> 4 blades works so much better than 3, for a much closer shave. Give it a shot, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
