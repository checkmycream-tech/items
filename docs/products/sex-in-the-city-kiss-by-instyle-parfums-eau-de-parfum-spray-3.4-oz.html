            <li>for the price i&#x27;m paying, it was a good perfume ; you can give as a gift for a friend; i think for young more than adult</li>
            <li>i couldn&#x27;t smell it anymore,i will say when its  first sprayed it has a nice scent , but it has no staying power at all so weak,i say save your  money and put it towards some thing else,you will enjoy even at 2 box its still a waste, shipping was good tho</li>
            <li>a true value for money.</li>
            <li>The box was pristine and worthy of gift giving.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells super ...</li>

            <li>i am very happy with perfume, thought i had purchased the red one for valentine day, the green came instead my girl, was very happy with the smell of the green one</li>
            <li>This cologne is for anyone who wants a light summer scent.  </li>
            <li>The box clearly says, SEXY CITY.</li>
            <li>Amis friends love their sweet aroma and especially my girl</li>
            <li>The seller was very easy to work with and accepted the product back without hassle.</li>

            <li>It smells very identical to Chanel Allure Sensuelle, not kidding!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Love the smell, last all day</li>
            <li>the bottle is big and stylish but just like Paris Fashion</li>
            <li>I loved the small bottle I have at home.</li>
            <li>So, you kind of have to squirt it upside down and let it drip onto you...</li>
            <li>large size bottle...buy it</li>
            <li>Turns out she loves using this product more often than her other higher price perfumes.</li>
            <li>But, for the price and it shipped fast...</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and</li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed in this.</li>
            <li>We both liked it and now my wife is using it everyday while going to office.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>im a guy who bought this here long time ago, &amp;  not only my mom liked this for her birthday..</li>
            <li>, its like it is watered down or something because the smell does not linger for more than 2 two seconds.</li>
            <li>I bought a few of these perfume bottles on Amazon for Christmas gifts and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It smells like white floral, woody, musky, amber &amp; fresh spicy.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my girlfriend, she had bought this item before and liked it, but this fragrance didn&#x27;t smell the same as her previous bottle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for everyday use and it actually lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li>I live sex in the city</li>
            <li>Just wish the scent was more grown up, and not so much teenager trying to hard.</li>
            <li>This was not my first bottle of this perfume and it does not smell the same at all!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume and it is so hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>Very flowery perfume, where-as the pink ones are very fruity.</li>
            <li>It came fast in the mail and its a big bottle I promise when.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m young</li>
            <li>this product help for complete anything.</li>
            <li>i love that it dosent smell up the entire room with its gaudy smell.. or stiff smells..</li>
            <li>This is the first time I got a bad batch of Sex in the City, all the others were good.</li>
            <li>i really love the fact that this perfume is a personal smell.. and whatbi mean is you have to get up close and personal to smell it..</li>
            <li>This obviously is a knock off and it smells nowhere near the same.</li>
            <li>Everyone likes different smells &amp; every perfume mixes different with each person&#x27;s natural skin oils.</li>
            <li>crisp a little fruity</li>
            <li>this a different fragrance..both delicious smelling, but totally crazy and hard to handle bottle</li>
            <li>I paid less then $5.00 per bottle and you absolutely can&#x27;t bet this price.</li>

            <li> I am not a strong scent type of person, but this one really needs a kick or a boost.</li>
            <li> I sent an adulterated perfume, water and alcohol, odorless, they supposed to be an original perfume, that is of poor quality</li>
            <li> my order came with a small travel size spray, thanks seller...</li>
            <li> This perfume smells alright but doesnt last long.</li>
            <li> AND DONT LAST A LONG TIME</li>
            <li> The perfume bottle spray cap is depressed so far down</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> andbi mean for a few bucks to try..was well worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I have tried other \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; perfumes to wear on a daily basis (to save my expensive $100 bottles for special occasions) but they all have a \\&quot;funky\\&quot; after smell after about an hour of wear.</li>
            <li> So, just for comparison, the perfumes I wear are: Givenchy&#x27;s Hot Couture, Estée Lauder&#x27;s Tuscanny, Armani Mania, Armani Code ,Brittany Spear&#x27;s Fantasy, and Body by Victoria&#x27;s Secret.</li>
            <li> Meh, not really my smell.</li>
            <li> Then again, I am used to getting my items within days due to my Prime membership.</li>
            <li> Will try other sex in the city scents soon...</li>
            <li> It barely had any scent at all and the scent it did have was not good.</li>
            <li> Also, the sent smells a little diluted.  </li>
            <li> They clearly say they do not sell knock offs, wrong.</li>
            <li> I love this smell.-cece peace out world the world the world though tough guy hate not love yes</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if I will order again because of have no patience for the extended delivery time.</li>
            <li> I am really not enjoying.</li>

            <li> This cologne is for anyone who wants a light summer scent.  The name is appropriate.  Just a sweet kiss on the body.</li>
            <li> sex in the city kiss by instyle parfum eau de  spray has not good smell and state just for 1 minut i don not recomend</li>
            <li> Meh, not really my smell. I&#x27;m big into fragrances, but this one doesn&#x27;t really last, and I don&#x27;t like the smell. But it was still a great deal. I just regifted this</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my girlfriend, she had bought this item before and liked it, but this fragrance didn&#x27;t smell the same as her previous bottle.  The seller was very easy to work with and accepted the product back without hassle. I would order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent perfume its scent is very nice and durable, I liked the aroma s truly excellent. Amis friends love their sweet aroma and especially my girl loves this perfume. mr said that she was the one she was looking for.</li>
            <li> good price for the amount. I love this smell.-cece peace out world the world the world though tough guy hate not love yes</li>
            <li> I bought a few of these perfume bottles on Amazon for Christmas gifts and absolutely love it. I paid less then $5.00 per bottle and you absolutely can&#x27;t bet this price. The bottle has a great design. Makes a great gift I ended up keeping two for myself!</li>
            <li> The product came when it said it would but I dont like it because after i spray it after 2 seconds the smell is almost completly gone, its like it is watered down or something because the smell does not linger for more than 2 two seconds. I would not recommend anyone buying this at all, I quess I got what I paid for.. sorry seller!!!</li>
            <li> im a guy who bought this here long time ago, &amp;  not only my mom liked this for her birthday.. my aunt,other aunt,other relatives &amp; many more. the image looks very nice even tho its not the popular sho \\&quot;sex &amp; the city but it still a good buy for a girl :)</li>
            <li> The perfume bottle spray cap is depressed so far down that it doesn&#x27;t spray, it puddles around the neck. So, you kind of have to squirt it upside down and let it drip onto you... Also, the sent smells a little diluted.  But, for the price and it shipped fast... You can&#x27;t beat it! So I give it a good rating.</li>
            <li> for the price i&#x27;m paying, it was a good perfume ; you can give as a gift for a friend; i think for young more than adult</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am glad I didn&#x27;t listen to some of the reviews, I would have missed out on a great smell! Compared to some of the others I have this Is one of the best smells. It did seem to take some time to receive this item. Then again, I am used to getting my items within days due to my Prime membership. So, the shipping time may have been standard. As always, the bottles are nice and the smell lasts for a reasonable amount of time for the cost of this spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if I will order again because of have no patience for the extended delivery time. I will try to purchase locally or from another seller. I will have time before I need to purchase again.</li>
            <li> This perfume surprisingly smells amazing! It smells very identical to Chanel Allure Sensuelle, not kidding! The lasting power is awesome about 8hrs+ on my skin &amp; the projection power is amazing, 1 spritz on your neck &amp; the entire room can smell this. It smells like white floral, woody, musky, amber &amp; fresh spicy. Don&#x27;t let the price or the brand fool you into thinking this smells cheap because it doesn&#x27;t! $8 for a 100ml bottle, trust me you have nothing to lose. ;)</li>
            <li> i am very happy with perfume, thought i had purchased the red one for valentine day, the green came instead my girl, was very happy with the smell of the green one so all is well</li>
            <li> I figured I would wait until I got my shipment, sprayed like everyone else did and the scent does not last. This is the first time I got a bad batch of Sex in the City, all the others were good. I must admit it smells nice at first but goes away pretty quick. Fast shipping and my order came with a small travel size spray, thanks seller...</li>
            <li> Very flowery perfume, where-as the pink ones are very fruity. For the price and the cool bottle I will recommend this one as the best scent! ;)</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle of Sex in The City.. this a different fragrance..both delicious smelling, but totally crazy and hard to handle bottle.. good price.. yes i would buy it again,</li>
            <li> ME ENCANTO FUE UN BUEN REGALO PARA EL CUMPLE DE MI HERMANA Y TAMBIEN LE GUSTO MUCHO RECOMIENDO ESTE VENDEDODR MUY PUNTUAL Y ME GUSTO MUCHO EL PRODUCTO</li>
            <li> Did not reach to this day I do not know where my money went not up to something I do not know whether this kind of monument ......</li>
            <li> Took a chance hoping to get a good product at a great price.  If you want the scent to last, be prepared to carry along and spray throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This smells so Great I always receive alot of compliments on this! It came fast in the mail and its a big bottle I promise when. You order once you will continue to order it when your low!! Get this I&#x27;m young 22 boo get one to!</li>
            <li> I sent an adulterated perfume, water and alcohol, odorless, they supposed to be an original perfume, that is of poor quality</li>
            <li> Love the smell, last all day</li>
            <li> I am taken pleasure by the product acquired in his shop. Thank you for the sending until Friday it was that receipt the product in my hands and I am very satisfied thank you.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend . Smells absolutely wonderful. Many...many compliments 😊 I wear it quite often . Not too potent..excellent</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> I bought it for my friend for her bday. She lived it. N I live sex in the city so&lt;br /&gt;Had to buy it. Perfect price at the time.</li>
            <li> I am very dissapointed in this. It smells so good at first but the smell goes completely away after 5 mionutes.</li>
            <li> I think this is a really good perfume being that it is so cheap! It&#x27;s good for everyday use and it actually lasts pretty long. I&#x27;ll spray it on in the morning and all through out the day people will still compliment me on how good I smell. Sicne I liked this one so much I think I&#x27;m going to try the others as well.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells alright but doesnt last long. I use it for when I go to work. I probably wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great packaging, was in cellophane, undisturbed. The box was pristine and worthy of gift giving. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> the bottle is big and stylish but just like Paris Fashion the smell don&#x27;t last an hour on you when wearing it</li>
            <li> This  should be called a body spray not a perfume. It stinks! yek! and i will not recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> This was not my first bottle of this perfume and it does not smell the same at all! It barely had any scent at all and the scent it did have was not good. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see this available here.  This is my favorite perfume and it is so hard to find in stores.  I tried it for the first time when I bought it from a street vendor in NY six years ago, and then had a horrible time trying to find it again.</li>
            <li> Everything was fine, the product fits the description given in the amazon page, the cover and the case where in good condition.</li>
            <li> sorry but this doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star,i spray the thing on my wrist and literally 5 minutes i couldn&#x27;t smell it anymore,i will say when its  first sprayed it has a nice scent , but it has no staying power at all so weak,i say save your  money and put it towards some thing else,you will enjoy even at 2 box its still a waste, shipping was good tho i got it before expected date which is the only good thing i can say,other wise this thing is terrible ,</li>
            <li> This perfume is just dull for me. I am really not enjoying. It just does not come out for me, especially because it is a Eau De Parfum. I am not a strong scent type of person, but this one really needs a kick or a boost.</li>
            <li> Bought this as an inexpensive gift for the wife a while back. Turns out she loves using this product more often than her other higher price perfumes.</li>
            <li> this product is interesting and good product. good factory. this product help for complete anything. is important have this product</li>
            <li> This bottle is cute I like the color of the bottle, but the smell is not all that. However, the shipper of this product did ship it out to me fast and it arrived in great shape. Good packaging!</li>
            <li> This scent is amazing! The smell is lights, airy and refreshing! I wear this scent to work and I always receive compliments</li>
            <li> I ordered this knowing that the perfume should have been Sex IN THE City, Kiss. I loved the small bottle I have at home. Unfortunately, what arrived was a knock off. The box clearly says, SEXY CITY. Which obviously I did not order. They clearly say they do not sell knock offs, wrong. This obviously is a knock off and it smells nowhere near the same. Rip off!!</li>
            <li> love the perfume but now it&#x27;s to expensive</li>
            <li> I really love this perfume. I have tried other \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; perfumes to wear on a daily basis (to save my expensive $100 bottles for special occasions) but they all have a \\&quot;funky\\&quot; after smell after about an hour of wear. This one is a very clean sent with no bad after smell, no one would ever believe you got this for such a steal. I stumbled on this at a mall perfume shop in 2009 &amp; bought it for I think $20. I got as many compliments on this as I do on my pricey bottles. Everyone likes different smells &amp; every perfume mixes different with each person&#x27;s natural skin oils. So, just for comparison, the perfumes I wear are: Givenchy&#x27;s Hot Couture, Estée Lauder&#x27;s Tuscanny, Armani Mania, Armani Code ,Brittany Spear&#x27;s Fantasy, and Body by Victoria&#x27;s Secret.</li>
            <li> El producto y el tiempo de entrega cumplio al 100% mi expectativas. sin duda alguna volveria comprar. recomiendo hacer compras con este vendedor.</li>
            <li> Great perfume smells fresh n crisp a little fruity it&#x27;s 60$ in stores only $3.50 on here I bought 4 bottles it&#x27;s a great deal 100ml big bottle I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
            <li> Omgoodness!! This stuff smells super ...i really love the fact that this perfume is a personal smell.. and whatbi mean is you have to get up close and personal to smell it.. i love that it dosent smell up the entire room with its gaudy smell.. or stiff smells.. its a great clean smell..works well with you natural body odor.. andbi mean for a few bucks to try..was well worth the buy! Will try other sex in the city scents soon... but for now im loving this smell!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. The scent is a bit cheap. Doesn&#x27;t last very long. Really cool bottle! Just wish the scent was more grown up, and not so much teenager trying to hard.</li>
            <li> SMELL VERY GOOD  LIGHT SMELL CHEAP PRICE WEAR IT EVERY DAY  BOTTLE IS PRETTY SMELLS GOOD AND DONT LAST A LONG TIME</li>
            <li> sex in the city...great product...adorable scent...large size bottle...buy it</li>
            <li> They charged me and I not received the item yet on top of that they start playing blame game putting things on UPS.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this perfume. Initially I was disagree to buy this because of its price. However when we got this bottle and I test its fragrance &amp;#34;its awesome and long lasting&amp;#34;. We both liked it and now my wife is using it everyday while going to office.&lt;br /&gt;Its a true value for money.</li>
            <li> As always Sex in the City is an excellent choice. Product arrived in perfect shape. Bought 2 bottles of it for presents and happy to say it was a hit.</li>
