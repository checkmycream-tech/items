            <li>I absolutely love how smooth and soft it makes my hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely a favorite that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Was thrilled to find this online rather than purchasing on my next visit to my hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price....</li>
            <li>Makes my hair smooth and very soft.</li>
            <li>This bottle smells very strong and strange.</li>
            <li>for more curl definition, i also use the leave in conditioner from same line.</li>
            <li>love the smell of the combined essential oils.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I use it on my skin before hot yoga and it helps keep my skin nourished without getting greasy.</li>
            <li>This serum is really good on my old dry hair.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair feel very soft and easy to comb, but is not \\&quot;weighty\\&quot; like so many other products i have tried.</li>
            <li>Someone told me to try a hot olive oil treatment mask, so I did, but it didn&#x27;t really help that much.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend buying it!</li>
            <li>No grease (unless you put too much).  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I also want to note that the shipper was very responsive to an issue I had with an the container opening in shipment and promptly sent me a new one.</li>
            <li>Eufora uses only all natural ingredients and essential oils which is important to me, as most commercial beauty products give me a headache.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Rubbed into your scalp it helps with dryness, and a few drops in your favorite body lotion boosts the moisture level.</li>
            <li>and it is the only product I can use right now</li>
            <li>that let&#x27;s me dry my hair and not have to style or flat iron it after drying, and I have tried many products.  </li>
            <li>I turned to my stylist, which I should have done first, anyway, as luck would have it, she had recently started carrying Eufora products.  </li>
            <li>Makes it soft and pliable.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft...</li>
            <li>I even use it on my face to keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and my hair adores this stuff.</li>
            <li>The smell is gross, I don&#x27;t think its the real thing.</li>
            <li>It is marked eufora, but I don&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find any stores near me with the product</li>
            <li>I have straight blonde hair</li>
            <li>I have tried to skip using it everyday, but my hair does much better when I use it daily.</li>
            <li>It has made my hair so thick and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Not only does this serum make your hair feel silky smooth, but it also feels luxurious on your face and other exposed skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, not greasy and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>so I have to be careful not to apply too much.  </li>
            <li>It is the only thing I have found that leaves my curly, course hair soft.  </li>
            <li>My stylist recommended this product a little over a year and a half ago, and I&#x27;ve been in love ever since.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, rather thin blonde hair.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and keeps my scalp from feeling dry after I shampoo</li>
            <li>I use it after every shampoo, and because I don&#x27;t like to subject my hair to more heat than necessary, I usually let it air-dry about 80% before styling.  </li>
            <li>My hair is color treated and very dry at the ends especially before a cut, this serum smooths them and makes them soft and easier to style.</li>
            <li>expensive, but worth it for me because finding good products to work with wild, thick curls is hard.</li>

            <li> You only need a teeny bit too, so this bottle will last you a long long time.</li>
            <li> I also like the softness it gives my coarse, dry mostly grey hair.</li>
            <li> This dry oil is a must for flat iron use.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft without being limp.  </li>
            <li> just a dab goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and over time, my hair and scalp is healthier than before using it.</li>
            <li> My hair is over-processed - I went from dark brown to blonde -</li>
            <li> I have a somewhat oily scalp, but my ends tend to be very dry.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair before other styling products and it helps to protect and moisturize.</li>
            <li> My hair gets really dried out when I blow dry it, but this serum solves that problem.  </li>
            <li> One squirt, smoothed through the bottom half of my hair when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well enough, just an old bottle, not as advertised here on Amazon, which makes me skeptical if it has been sitting in storage for years.</li>
            <li> while I loved the color, the texture felt awful.  </li>
            <li> All for half the price of the salon.</li>
            <li> Price is much less than the salon.</li>
            <li> A little smooths out your hair.</li>
            <li> Started using this serum a few years ago after a stylist at a spa used it on my hair.</li>
            <li> It is in a green bottle that I&#x27;ve never seen before for this line of products.  </li>
            <li> $40 wasted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this in the past from a salon</li>
            <li> Have used a small amount on damp hair, then blow-dryed and styled.  </li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time, considering the serum is rather expensive as hair care products go.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was a little less expensive just because I use it so often.</li>
            <li> I have VERY HARD WATER</li>
            <li> I have very thick course hair</li>
            <li> sad to say that it is sitting in the reject basket under the sink...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product for the ends of your hair. Makes it soft and pliable.</li>
            <li> This is one of my MUST HAVE beauty staples. A little smooths out your hair. Rubbed into your scalp it helps with dryness, and a few drops in your favorite body lotion boosts the moisture level.</li>
            <li> this is a great finishing product if you have naturally curly hair. it makes my hair feel very soft and easy to comb, but is not \\&quot;weighty\\&quot; like so many other products i have tried. for more curl definition, i also use the leave in conditioner from same line. expensive, but worth it for me because finding good products to work with wild, thick curls is hard.</li>
            <li> Eufora Beautifying Serum is wonder full for the hair. It is not oily and absorbs well. I have very long hair and over time, my hair and scalp is healthier than before using it. The delivery of this product was excellent and on time and I highly recommend buying it!</li>
            <li> This serum is great.  I have very thick course hair and it is the only product I can use right now that let&#x27;s me dry my hair and not have to style or flat iron it after drying, and I have tried many products.  It makes my hair soft without being limp.  Plus it has a nice smell. Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Product work like described..</li>
            <li> Another great product.  Works to add shine, control frizz, and keep hair looking good.  All for half the price of the salon.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product! The Eufora Serum  makes my hair look very healthy and shiny. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair silky &amp; smooth.  I recommend this product to all of my friends, because they have all started asking what I am doing differently with my hair!</li>
            <li> Was thrilled to find this online rather than purchasing on my next visit to my hairdresser.  My hair is fine so I have to be careful not to apply too much.  But it leaves my hair looking smooth and I believe I have more shine as well.</li>
            <li> This product is great on face, as body moisturizer (and special treat for softening feet!).  Have also heard it&#x27;s great for hair, but have not tried that.  Great overall product for summer and winter skin.  Definitely a favorite that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought a travel size from local hairdresser.  Loved it.  Found it cheaper on Amazon (as always).  It is perfect for my fine hair that tends to frizz in that perfect kind of weather, ya know?  It makes my hair feel so soft...like I just got out of the salon.  No grease (unless you put too much).  You only need a teeny bit too, so this bottle will last you a long long time.</li>
            <li> Restores moisture and softness to my hair. I use it before blow drying my hair. I have tried to skip using it everyday, but my hair does much better when I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I use this before I shampoo my hair on my scalp and face. It is very soft and keeps my scalp from feeling dry after I shampoo</li>
            <li> This is the best serum I&#x27;ve found.  My hair gets really dried out when I blow dry it, but this serum solves that problem.  I absolutely love how smooth and soft it makes my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this in the past from a salon and it smelled great. This bottle smells very strong and strange.</li>
            <li> I love this oil...it smells so good and is so soft and smooth on my skin!  One of my favorite beauty products!!</li>
            <li> This dry oil is a must for flat iron use. My hair is naturally full and at times frizzy, this product tames my hair beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of the combined essential oils. I even use it on my face to keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, met my expectations</li>
            <li> Use this on my hair &amp; face...it is a wonderful serum for your skin!!</li>
            <li> Ive been using Eufora for years and I absolutely love it. I wish it was a little less expensive just because I use it so often. The whole product line is perfect. And just a side note. I have naturally curly hair and my hair adores this stuff. Just FYI. ;)</li>
            <li> Started using this serum a few years ago after a stylist at a spa used it on my hair. Not only does this serum make your hair feel silky smooth, but it also feels luxurious on your face and other exposed skin.  The bottle lasts a long time, considering the serum is rather expensive as hair care products go.  Well worth the price....just a dab goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and lasts a long time. Great product!</li>
            <li> This serum is perfect.  It&#x27;s light, not greasy and a little goes a long way.  I also want to note that the shipper was very responsive to an issue I had with an the container opening in shipment and promptly sent me a new one.</li>
            <li> Smells sooo good you want to eat it.  My hair is shiny and easy to manage now.  It is actually seeming fuller as well. I don&#x27;t think that was suppose to happen, but it did.  I have VERY HARD WATER and this product is PERFECT!</li>
            <li> Love the silkiness of this product.  Have used a small amount on damp hair, then blow-dryed and styled.  Used it on face and neck and the skin just seems to absorb it.  Use all over after a shower.  Fresh, light scent.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, use it for my hair &amp; skin.  Seller was top notch</li>
            <li> Was recommended this product by a friend, I must say, Great recommendation! This product is amazing, my hair and scalp feel great. It&#x27;s good for the whole family!</li>
            <li> I have a somewhat oily scalp, but my ends tend to be very dry. My stylist recommended this product a little over a year and a half ago, and I&#x27;ve been in love ever since. One squirt, smoothed through the bottom half of my hair when it&#x27;s wet. And, of course, the Amazon price is way better than I have found at salons.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well enough, just an old bottle, not as advertised here on Amazon, which makes me skeptical if it has been sitting in storage for years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  It is the only thing I have found that leaves my curly, course hair soft.  Highly recommend.  Price is much less than the salon.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair before other styling products and it helps to protect and moisturize. I use it on my skin before hot yoga and it helps keep my skin nourished without getting greasy. I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this on line because I was low on the bottle I bought locally.  I did not open the bottle until this week and it is nothing like the one I just finished and loved. The smell is gross, I don&#x27;t think its the real thing. If you want this do not buy it here.</li>
            <li> Great product.  My hair dresser recommended it 4 years ago and I&#x27;ve been using it since. Love it. Thank you Vicky.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, rather thin blonde hair. This product is great, leaves my hair very healthy looking with a nice sheen and yet not weighed down or sticky. And, believe it or not, since I started using it about four months ago, my hair is actually growing faster.</li>
            <li> I use it as part of my daily moisturizing regime.  I add a drop to my moisturizer. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This serum is really good on my old dry hair. Makes my hair smooth and very soft. My hair is color treated and very dry at the ends especially before a cut, this serum smooths them and makes them soft and easier to style. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  My hair is in the best condition ever since I started using the product about 1 year ago.</li>
            <li> This is not what I received.  It is in a green bottle that I&#x27;ve never seen before for this line of products.  It is marked eufora, but I don&#x27;t believe it.  I sent an email asking why in different packaging, but never received a response.  $40 wasted.</li>
            <li> Anything by this product line is great!! It has made my hair so thick and healthy.  Extensions wrecked me...this brought my hair back to where it should be!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  My hair is so healthy!</li>
            <li> My hair is over-processed - I went from dark brown to blonde - while I loved the color, the texture felt awful.  Someone told me to try a hot olive oil treatment mask, so I did, but it didn&#x27;t really help that much.  I turned to my stylist, which I should have done first, anyway, as luck would have it, she had recently started carrying Eufora products.  I told her how upset I was about the texture of my hair and what I had been doing.  She recommended the Beautifying Serum and used it in my hair when she styled it.  Oh my goodness, what a huge difference!  My hair felt and looked incredible!  Friends and family asked me if stylist had performed magic, it looked that incredible.  I bought some at the shop, but when I ran out, I ordered it via Amazon.  I use it after every shampoo, and because I don&#x27;t like to subject my hair to more heat than necessary, I usually let it air-dry about 80% before styling.  Incredible and well-worth the price.</li>
            <li> the other eufora products worked great for me...this one is too oily...sad to say that it is sitting in the reject basket under the sink...oh well...think twice before you buy this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve love this product since I first noticed my stylist putting it in my hair. I love the way it makes my hair sparkle in the light. I also like the softness it gives my coarse, dry mostly grey hair. Eufora uses only all natural ingredients and essential oils which is important to me, as most commercial beauty products give me a headache. The scent is light and appealing to me. GREAT product--I will continue to buy more!</li>
            <li> I got this tip from a friend during a girls weekend. I couldn&#x27;t find any stores near me with the product so I bought it here. I&#x27;m now on my 2nd bottle and I just love this stuff! I have straight blonde hair but this just makes it that much more shinny and throughout the day it rarely get tangled! Love love love this product- I&#x27;m a repeat buyer for life!</li>
            <li> I use this product as an alternative to my daily stuff. I use a dab. It brings out the shine &amp; luster in my hair. This is a must have. It was delivered by estimated date.</li>
