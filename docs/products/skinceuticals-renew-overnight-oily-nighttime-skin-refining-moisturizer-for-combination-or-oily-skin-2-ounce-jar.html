            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>This product has left my skin more supple, even, and pores appear visibly reduced.</li>
            <li>She recommended it for my very oily skin, and oh my gosh was she right.  </li>
            <li>The first moisturizer I have found that is not too much for my oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I like this more than &#x27;dry&#x27; one because even though I have combination skin, my skin stays hydrated till the morning with this product.</li>
            <li>My skin gets very oily during the summer and prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>I was using another product and it made my face very oily and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I have very finicky skin that has a tendency to break out.  </li>
            <li>I finished the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>My face is much softer than it has ever been.</li>
            <li>This product really helps my combination skin and hormonal breakouts.</li>

            <li>and yes, it really works.</li>
            <li>Anyone who suffers from acne knows better than to use a product that has any kind of oil in it.  </li>
            <li>Recommend highly using this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this product mostly because it stays so moist on the skin and the smell is a little off-putting.</li>
            <li>Before I started using this moisturizer, my skin was combination, but a little more on the oily side.  </li>
            <li>I did not even use it near my eyes and the skin around my eye became very irritated and itchy.  </li>
            <li>Well after I used this product I noticed that my face was not oily any longer and transitioned to a normal skin.  </li>
            <li>but I wanted to try something new and whoa do I regret it.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, adult acne prone post-pregnancy skin, an my face LOVES this stuff!</li>
            <li>I have purchased this from Amazon and thru other sellers on Amazon &amp; at Sephora, price is always between $50-60 and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite night cream for the past 2 years.</li>
            <li>I really like this product so far, it adds some moisture which I&#x27;m starting to need in the winter as I get older, but doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or aggravate my rosacea.</li>
            <li>This is my abs fav moisturizer; a couple friends and fam have also began purchasing (I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3yrs) because it addresses breakouts, large pores, and starting wrinkles in one product.</li>
            <li>This nightcream does not make my acne prone skin break up,  yet it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily, goes on light, smells fruity/fresh.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, and a little cream goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have been underwhelmed by other more expensive night creams and LOVE this one.</li>
            <li>Will make skin feel a bit dry for the first couple days</li>
            <li>I had to use a cortisone product to calm it down.  </li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for a moisturizer that would actually moisturize without causing breakouts.</li>
            <li>My skin definitely feels hydrated and so soft since I started using it.</li>

            <li> My skin definitely feels hydrated and so soft since I started using it.</li>
            <li> , next time will order for dry skin though</li>
            <li> Skinceuticals seems to have only this oily and a dry formula - no &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> but it also gets very dry - oddly enough.</li>
            <li> stay hydrated all day long.  </li>
            <li> My face isn&#x27;t oily when I wake up in the morning, nor does it feel too dry in my cheeks/forehead.</li>
            <li> Also, it keeps my t zone from being oily, but my dry spots are have moisture.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a spa after I received a facial.  She recommended it for my very oily skin, and oh my gosh was she right.  This moisturizer is amazing for oily skin.  I do notice some tingling when I use it but it just feels so good. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin although it does make me feel extremely moisturized.  I noticed my skin was alot softer and more refined when I started using it.  It&#x27;s really good for oily skin.</li>
            <li> This nightcream does not make my acne prone skin break up,  yet it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> My skin gets very oily during the summer and prone to breakouts. This product hydrates my skin without leaving it extra oily.</li>
            <li> I really like this product so far, it adds some moisture which I&#x27;m starting to need in the winter as I get older, but doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or aggravate my rosacea.</li>
            <li> I was using another product and it made my face very oily and shiny.  After reading the review of other users, I decided to try Skinceuticals moisturizer and I am very happy to say that it works really well for me.  I have since switch over to using Skinceuticals product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Especially if you have dark spots on face</li>
            <li> Skinceutical&#x27;s products are great.  I have combination skin and this Overnight cream just perfect for me. Not to grease, enough moisturizing.  My skin is glowing after I use this cream.</li>
            <li> This product is a keeper. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily, goes on light, smells fruity/fresh.  Recommend for oily/problem skin that still needs nighttime moisture.</li>
            <li> I have T-zone skin and love this stuff. My face isn&#x27;t oily when I wake up in the morning, nor does it feel too dry in my cheeks/forehead.</li>
            <li> I love the Skinceuticals Renew Overnight Oily Nighttime Skin-Refining Moisturizer!  I have very finicky skin that has a tendency to break out.  This moisturizer clears up my skin overnight and has revolutionized the way my face looks.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of products over the years (since I&#x27;ve had acne issues for over 15 years now) and this product is one of the best I&#x27;ve used, including products recommended by dermatologists.  I originally discovered Skinceuticals Nighttime Moisturizer at Ajune Day Spa in New York City, and now I&#x27;ll be a life-long customer.</li>
            <li> used this for about a week it&#x27;s a bit irritating my skin and causes redness and a stingy feeling, i have already stopped using this</li>
            <li> I finished the whole bottle. Didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference. My skin does feel a bit sticky and shiny after putting it on. Would have tolerated if it showed more visible results but I didn&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t think I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely irritating to the skin.  Be very very careful when you use it.  I did not even use it near my eyes and the skin around my eye became very irritated and itchy.  I had to use a cortisone product to calm it down.  Be very very careful before using this!</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin but it also gets very dry - oddly enough. I have searched high and low for a moisturizer that would actually moisturize without causing breakouts. I have finally found it! My skin definitely feels hydrated and so soft since I started using it. And my acne hasn&#x27;t flared up. I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I like this more than &#x27;dry&#x27; one because even though I have combination skin, my skin stays hydrated till the morning with this product.</li>
            <li> Made my skin have an allergic reaction</li>
            <li> No breakouts. Or greasiness. I&#x27;m 32 with combination skin. Having very fair skin also means early fine lines, so this is perfect!</li>
            <li> After trying loads of moisturizers, I have finally found one that does not make me break out and does indeed moisturize my skin!  The texture is amazing - very rich and soft.  The cream is light and non-greasy.  A small amount is enough to moisturize the entire face.  Not inexpensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is just perfect.  It&#x27;s extremely light and leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized, but not greasy.  A small amount does the job.</li>
            <li> The first moisturizer I have found that is not too much for my oily skin.  My face is much softer than it has ever been.</li>
            <li> This product really helps my combination skin and hormonal breakouts. I tried so many cheaper products and finanlly bought this based on reviews. Get it! So worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> This is my abs fav moisturizer; a couple friends and fam have also began purchasing (I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3yrs) because it addresses breakouts, large pores, and starting wrinkles in one product. Will make skin feel a bit dry for the first couple days but if you stick with it it balances back out. The only moisturizer I &#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t aggrevate my tempermental skin while helping it&#x27;s issues. I have purchased this from Amazon and thru other sellers on Amazon &amp; at Sephora, price is always between $50-60 and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this nighttime moisturizer. Light weight and non-greasy. Feels great on the skin. I have noticed brighter skin already and have only been using it a week.</li>
            <li> This product is great, smells good, absorbs quickly, can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s reducing any wrinkles, but it does make my skin feel good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 6 months - love the way my skin feels. Recommend highly using this product.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  It is a must have, and I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;m able to buy this online.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, adult acne prone post-pregnancy skin, an my face LOVES this stuff! Doesn&#x27;t make me red, or break out, or get excema, or.... you get the idea! I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected from SkinCeuticals. I have used the serum and expected great things from this overnight cream, but was dissappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two years . I ran out and bought another cream wu at a mistake. This product is by far the best face cream I have ever used</li>
            <li> I use this every night on my face, neck, and chest.  My skin looks instantly better once i&#x27;ve applied.  I&#x27;ve never used a moisturizer witht this great of results! I have oily to combo skin that is acne prone.  This hasn&#x27;t caused any trouble what so ever with acne! Also, it keeps my t zone from being oily, but my dry spots are have moisture.  It&#x27;s very light, and a little cream goes a long way. Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> It seems to work well.  I have only used it for a short while but usually by now my face will start to break out or get too greasy.  I don&#x27;t have that problem with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this Product. It so renews your skin auring the nighttime. Gives you the glowing looking in the morning. I recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Great product! Skin definitely looks more even and nourished!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product mostly because it stays so moist on the skin and the smell is a little off-putting. I thought I could use this to add a little moisture to my skin at night after using a bunch of drying acne products, but I couldn&#x27;t continue using it past a week. I really did try to make this cream work because it was quite expensive, but alas I decided I couldn&#x27;t deal with it. Besides, I did notice a couple more pimples sprout out...not sure if this cream was the culprit. I&#x27;ve decided to use cold-pressed argon oil for my nightly ritual instead of this.</li>
            <li> It works great. I order it repeatedly.</li>
            <li> Even though I got the oily cream and my face isn&#x27;t oily I love this, next time will order for dry skin though, I could use a little more moisture, if your skin is oily this is awesome.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite night cream for the past 2 years. You wake up with beautiful skin. It never looks oily or shiney and actually glows, I feel like a movie star when I use this. My husband always comments about how nice my skin looks when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is exactly as advertised. It goes on creamy - a little goes a long way. It tingles a little on application and my skin wakes up refreshed. I have been underwhelmed by other more expensive night creams and LOVE this one.</li>
            <li> Is this really made for oil skin? this one is so oily, I have to use tissue to wipe my face after I apply this cream every night</li>
            <li> I always get good results when I use this product. My aesthetician recommended this to me approx. 10 yrs. ago.  Have used it on and off ever since.  It keeps my skin looking youthful - clear, soft, smooth, dewey, and blemish free.</li>
            <li> This night cream does not seem to \\&quot;renew\\&quot; but is really good for my oily skin. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the money though.</li>
            <li> I already have day creams from skinceuticals and decided to try overnight moisturizer and works very nice on my oily/combination skin. I noticed my skin is so smooth in the morning. This stuff works.</li>
            <li> I use it for daily moisturizer.  It&#x27;s great....stay hydrated all day long.  I&#x27;m on about my 10th bottle.  Only wish I could buy it at a quantity discount.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Before I started using this moisturizer, my skin was combination, but a little more on the oily side.  Well after I used this product I noticed that my face was not oily any longer and transitioned to a normal skin.  It has a citrus scent and I truly feel that my skin is moisturized.  The jar has lasted me 6 months.  It is pricey, but for me it is worth it since it works.</li>
            <li> This product is too expensive and made my skin break out. I tried it over a month and my skin is worse because of it.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for night time use, it&#x27;s not heavy and it works well. I enjoy using most skin ceutical products.</li>
            <li> Great product and great service.  Less expensive than my Hair salon/Spa charges for the same items!</li>
            <li> Skin feels refreshed in morning and has a nice dewy look will be using it every night especially this upcoming winter!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality lotion. Skinceuticals have never disappointed. Dermatologist recommended</li>
            <li> I bought this after researching night creams that are supposed to be good for acne prone skin. I am in my 30s and suffer from hormonal breakouts.  This was highly recommended on more than one website and, as you have probably seen, gets great reviews.  This cream gave me the worst breakouts I have had in years. After using for one week, I got horrible huge cyst-like zits on my forehead, sides of nose, and chin.  I researched further and saw that this cream has an oil as one of its ingredients. My bad for buying it. Anyone who suffers from acne knows better than to use a product that has any kind of oil in it.  It does seem like a quality product, although overpriced, and it might work great for others that don&#x27;t have oily, acne prone skin.  I just don&#x27;t understand why they market it toward women with oily skin since it makes it so much worse.</li>
            <li> I love this nighttime moisturizer! My skin has felt smoother and healthier since starting to use this produce a month ago. I switched from the skinceuticals pore minimizing moisturizer to this one and I love the difference it has made in my skin. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Love that this night cream is not heavy and greasy on my face and helps with my maturing skin.  Worth the price!</li>
            <li> This products is for oily, oily skin. I have combination oily. When first applied it is light and feels good - than dries and tightens and irritates my skin.  Skinceuticals seems to have only this oily and a dry formula - no &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ll have to try a different nighttime moisturizer for aging skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a night cream that was recommended for acne/oily skin. I saw this cream got great reviews so I bought it, now I regret it!&lt;br /&gt;I used it for two weeks and I got really bad, painful cystic acne all round my chin and the sides of my face. My face was doing so great before using this product .  Stay away if you have skin prone to acne. I was using PCA skin care but I wanted to try something new and whoa do I regret it. Going back to my PCA.</li>
            <li> I love this product !!  It&#x27;s perfect for summer when I don&#x27;t want a heavy moisturizer.  This product came sealed and wrapped.  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Full disclosure, I have a historically bad track record of using moisturizer at all, but I&#x27;m reaching my 30s, and wanted to find a nighttime product that helps with refining, rejuvenating, and oil-control. This product has left my skin more supple, even, and pores appear visibly reduced. Given the summer heat, I do not use true daytime moisturizer (I&#x27;ve switched to a BB cream), but find this to be a wonderful way to acheive the goal without piling on product during the day.</li>
            <li> As a mid-30&#x27;s guy, I&#x27;ve become more aware of skin care. I picked this one out of the hat of options on Amazon and yes, it really works. Used at night, my \\&quot;manly\\&quot; skin is more tender, refreshed, and even clean looking in the morning. My skin looks hydrated and fine lines have dissipated. I&#x27;ve tried others and very few show actual results; Renew Overnight does show a difference. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> It is very Dry in Colorado.  I use this on my face day and night.  There is no sunscreen in the overnight, so I wouldn&#x27;t use it in the summer.</li>
