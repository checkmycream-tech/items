            <li>These are the best scissors i have ever bought!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for scissors that blow, suck or stink, these are perfect.</li>
            <li>These are the best way to cut babies nails!</li>
            <li>Stick with nail clippers, even Tweezerman brand, which are very good.</li>
            <li>These are excellent nail scissors - I don&#x27;t like to go to the salon for pedicures - these were a great purchase.</li>
            <li>Every product I buy from tweezerman works great and lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>great product, great deal</li>
            <li>They are made by a good company.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>They look good, and having been repurposed, they work well for paper.</li>
            <li>these are a good product.</li>
            <li>Holds a good edge.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this as a good product.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Nice.. i loved this scissor.</li>
            <li>I own tweezerman&#x27;s toenail scissors and think they are great, but the toenail scissors cut my fingernails better than this product.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman is a really good company - they will sharpen your tweezers for free and pay for your return postage!  </li>
            <li>They are effectively unusable.</li>
            <li>They would work better if they were all around skinner.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>I usually love all tweezerman products, but these need to be retooled (heheh pun intended).</li>
            <li>Otherwise these scissors are best suited for a 1st or 2nd grade arts and crafts class.</li>
            <li>I purchased this scissor after my favorite scissor was confiscated by Hong Kong Customs.</li>
            <li>They are much better than Aussie scissors and ones available on Ebay.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping, good quality</li>
            <li>My toesees look all sweet too!</li>
            <li>Size is good, but they aren&#x27;t as sharp as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>The blades separate and chew their way through if they cut at all, not the clean cleaving that one hopes for.</li>
            <li>I like the look of the photo better, the ones they send have closed, rounded handles, which are probably more comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally a great scissor for small kids nails</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit that the scissor works okay for what it was designed, it does not match the comfort and sharpness of my former model.</li>
            <li>The scissors are nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li>These scissors cut really well.</li>
            <li>Very durable material.</li>
            <li>Scissors are well made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li>yet the finger holes for the scissors were too small for me to effectively use the scissors.</li>
            <li>Quality stainless, sharp blades, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The ones I had confiscated on an airline flight were a little bulkier and easier to use with my non dominant hand.&lt;br /&gt;Overall much better than the poorer substitutes.&lt;br /&gt;David Munro</li>
            <li>Scissos is very thik and not sharp.</li>
            <li>Not as sharp as my 20 year old scissors..does not cut as finely.</li>
            <li>Cuts nails well, great sharp blades that do not have to be squeezed hard and do not snag or get loosened.</li>
            <li>The first went off with a son who is teaching English abroad.     </li>
            <li>After a nail -trimming session, my scissors-holding fingers are marked and sore.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the new pair do not seem to cut any better.</li>
            <li>these are so sharp, they cut finger nails really well.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman Stainless Steel Nail Scissors , sharp , and sturdy</li>
            <li>Scissors with micro serration of the cutting surface and/or straight blades work better for me.</li>
            <li>, i bought them for my boys who were off to live in the dormitory and believe that these will last them for as long as they have them.</li>
            <li>(maybe an older version of these when they used to make them sharp?).</li>
            <li>Maybe for delicate ladylike fingernails these might be fine, but stubby old handyman&#x27;s fingernails, not adequate at all.</li>

            <li> My problem with them is the tendency to back out of a cut rather than advance the cut in harder nails.</li>
            <li> Twezerman Stainless Steel nails scissors are thick and blades are straight.&lt;br /&gt;Prefer</li>
            <li> On the other hand, if you are a guy with bigger tougher toenails maybe these are the ones for you!</li>

            <li> Very thick, much thicker than in the photo.</li>
            <li> I bought them to replace an almost identical pair that is at least 15 years old.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of my time.</li>

            <li> They are much better than Aussie scissors and ones available on Ebay. I seem to remember a more expensive pair advertised about 12-18 months ago and possibly the same brand. The ones I had confiscated on an airline flight were a little bulkier and easier to use with my non dominant hand.&lt;br /&gt;Overall much better than the poorer substitutes.&lt;br /&gt;David Munro</li>
            <li> Finally a great scissor for small kids nails</li>
            <li> These are awful. The blades are really thick and they slide backwards when attempting to cut fingernails. I thought I had a defective pair until I read others have the same problem.</li>
            <li> Pros: The scissors are nice and sharp.  They are made by a good company.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I think the scissors are too thick.  They would work better if they were all around skinner.  The grip on the scissors is very bulky and the cutting area is also thick and bulky.  If I would have seen these in the store I would not have bought them.  On the other hand, if you are a guy with bigger tougher toenails maybe these are the ones for you!</li>
            <li> Size is good, but they aren&#x27;t as sharp as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Very thick, much thicker than in the photo. Not good for nail cutting unless they are long nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also look nothing like the photo. I like the look of the photo better, the ones they send have closed, rounded handles, which are probably more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, they are sharp, so that gives them an extra star. They cut well, just not well for what they are intended to cut.</li>
            <li> This products picture is a lie it is nothing like what it is supposed to be. What you receive is twice as thick and not even the same design. Total waste of my time. Shouldn&#x27;t even get 1 star.</li>
            <li> Maybe for delicate ladylike fingernails these might be fine, but stubby old handyman&#x27;s fingernails, not adequate at all. The blades separate and chew their way through if they cut at all, not the clean cleaving that one hopes for. They look good, and having been repurposed, they work well for paper.</li>
            <li> these are so sharp, they cut finger nails really well. my husband uses them for his finger nails and his beard. I&#x27;ve bought less expensive scissors, but you also get what you pay for. these are a good product.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman Stainless Steel Nail Scissors , sharp , and sturdy , i bought them for my boys who were off to live in the dormitory and believe that these will last them for as long as they have them.</li>
            <li> Twezerman Stainless Steel nails scissors are thick and blades are straight.&lt;br /&gt;Prefer curved nail blades for cutting small toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;I use the other nail scissors I bought from amazon.</li>
            <li> I have only used them once, but they don&#x27;t appear to be very sharp.  I bought them to replace an almost identical pair that is at least 15 years old.  The old scissors were dull and difficult to cut with.  Unfortunately, the new pair do not seem to cut any better.</li>
            <li> This is the second pair of these nail scissors I&#x27;ve bought. The first went off with a son who is teaching English abroad.     They work on fingernails, giving a smooth, neat edge to a broken nail. They work on toenails, too.    What more can I say?</li>
            <li> I usually love all tweezerman products, but these need to be retooled (heheh pun intended). They are too thick and are hard to control.  My nails come out cut slanted, even when I&#x27;m cutting with my dominant hand.  I own tweezerman&#x27;s toenail scissors and think they are great, but the toenail scissors cut my fingernails better than this product.</li>
            <li> These are the best scissors i have ever bought!</li>
            <li> Scissos is very thik and not sharp. I can&#x27;t cut my nails .</li>
            <li> Nice.. i loved this scissor.</li>
            <li> These scissors cut really well. The blades are well designed and sharp. I happen to like the shape of the blade for fingernail trimming.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the handle is super uncomfortable. The loop is not complete so there is a gap where part of your finger tends to slide and get pinched. After a nail -trimming session, my scissors-holding fingers are marked and sore.&lt;br /&gt;So blades get a 5, handle gets a 1.</li>
            <li> It does the j.ob that I bought it to do.  I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, good quality</li>
            <li> Every product I buy from tweezerman works great and lasts forever.  Quality stainless, sharp blades, easy to use.  A brand you can always trust.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for scissors that blow, suck or stink, these are perfect. If you&#x27;re looking for scissors that actually cut, go elsewhere (maybe an older version of these when they used to make them sharp?). Otherwise these scissors are best suited for a 1st or 2nd grade arts and crafts class. For nails, terrible. Just very dull and slip backwards when cutting a nail. Stick with nail clippers, even Tweezerman brand, which are very good. But these just don&#x27;t cut it, pun intended.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as my 20 year old scissors..does not cut as finely. I will not ever use them. My mistake.</li>
            <li> Forget baby nail clippers and Emory boards!  These are the best way to cut babies nails! I recommend them to all moms!!</li>
            <li> Tweezerman is a really good company - they will sharpen your tweezers for free and pay for your return postage!  These are excellent nail scissors - I don&#x27;t like to go to the salon for pedicures - these were a great purchase.</li>
            <li> works as expected; well made product and very sharp.</li>
            <li> Very durable material. Not cheap and flimsy. Very sharp. Holds a good edge. I would recommend this as a good product.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using these for your shrubs. But if you do, know that they will last through the hardiest of perennials. But the evergreens get them all gooey. My toesees look all sweet too!</li>
            <li> Cuts nails well, great sharp blades that do not have to be squeezed hard and do not snag or get loosened.</li>
            <li> These were very disappointing. I have a fairly small hand and yet the finger holes for the scissors were too small for me to effectively use the scissors. They are effectively unusable.</li>

            <li> great product, great deal</li>
            <li> I purchased this scissor after my favorite scissor was confiscated by Hong Kong Customs. I&#x27;ll admit that the scissor works okay for what it was designed, it does not match the comfort and sharpness of my former model. Granted the former model cost me $26, I would expect the added benefits.</li>
