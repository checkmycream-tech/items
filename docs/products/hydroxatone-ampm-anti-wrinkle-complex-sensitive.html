            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize very effectively.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very nice lightweight moisturizer with a non-greasy feel.  </li>

            <li>It would have to work as well as the Avon ANEW that I loved, to justify that price for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Hydroxatone product is good at keeping my face hydrated, but it just can&#x27;t keep up with my neck now that I&#x27;m using acid peel products.</li>

            <li>This Hydroxatone product is good at keeping my face hydrated, but it just can&#x27;t keep up with my neck now that I&#x27;m using acid peel products.</li>
            <li>I agreed to to review this to see if it would make any difference to my face, and to be fair to the product makers, I used it for 6 weeks as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the idea of trying a product for three times the price to see if it makes a three times difference was too good to pass up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>feel that it has a great texture and feels nice to applicate.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it did feel weightless on my face which is good.  </li>
            <li>This is great cause its FREE!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I was very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it smells, it feels great going onto your skin, but it&#x27;s just not for me.  </li>
            <li>Although, to be fair, some of my friends are not quite as enthusiastic.</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I had to give up my beloved Avon ANEW skincare (one of the best, most effective ones I have ever tried) and this really bummed me out.</li>
            <li>Feels amazing on my skin - thoroughly moisturizing face cream.  </li>
            <li>my skin is not as amazing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice cream and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>It hydrates nicely, and it causes ZERO irritation on my face or neck.</li>
            <li>BUT I will say that that this lotion has reduced the depth of my wrinkles nicely.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin within seconds and leaves my face feeling moisturized but without any kind of \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; feel to it.  </li>
            <li>This cream goes on very easily and feels nice on my face.</li>
            <li>This provides the perfect amount of moisture for my combination skin (mostly normal with a tendency to get oily in the t-zone).  </li>
            <li>though I was satisfied that this cream is nice, this price point of over $50 is not of interest to me.</li>
            <li>but maybe it ran out quicker because I really liked it:-)  </li>
            <li>It looks beautiful, but it is very deceptive</li>
            <li>and I can see a difference, mostly around the bottom area of my chin.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product in that my skin feels smoother and looks healthier than it did before.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting or burn or itch when applied, so I&#x27;ve been able to use it awhile now</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a reduction of lines in areas where I have them, but they also don&#x27;t appear to be more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I also feel that gel-cream formulations make me use more.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the olay I think.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I got to preview this product and didn&#x27;t spend my hard-earned money on it.  </li>
            <li>I am sure you would need more than one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the price we won&#x27;t be trying to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the end, if it were cheaper we would probably buy more of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always sure I must  be getting the rest of the product loaded (although my hands are always washed) with germs every time I stick my finger in the jar.  </li>
            <li>It might match my face&#x27;s moisture needs better in the spring or summer rather than now in winter when my skin tends to be driest.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li>I think my fine lines around my eyes are more prominent since I started using this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, the container is a very bright blue</li>
            <li>This feels great and keeps my skin soft all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and creamy, I love it&#x27;s texture.  </li>
            <li>It made my makeup go on more smoothly in the morning</li>
            <li>I have not noticed fine lines on my 50-year-old face anyway, so I cannot tell if this works for that.</li>
            <li>I will have some improvement in the fine lines around the eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>in terms of that feature, it was fine.</li>
            <li>like how smoothly it goes on my skin, it glides on, so</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth with this cream.</li>
            <li>However, regardless, it makes my skin feel smooth and doesn&#x27;t break it out, so I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li>I will say that areas tending to have a roughness some mornings, are smooth after using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One star off because I am not at all sure it is worth the posted price.  </li>
            <li>Because it is light, it can be used at night or during the day under makeup.</li>
            <li>It is also fragrance free, another plus for me.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth, hydrated nourished.  </li>
            <li>The smell of this cream is light and has almost no smell at all.  </li>
            <li>I really like it is goes on light,smells nice, and did not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s used because it makes it seem like you&#x27;re getting far more than just 1 oz. of product, but I don&#x27;t like having to stick my fingers into the jar to scoop out the product; it&#x27;s easy to spread bacteria that way.  </li>
            <li>product goes on easy and disappears fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>-- Hopefully those private facts will help you to better compare my life to your own and</li>
            <li>I do like this cream because it is mild and light -</li>
            <li>it absorbed easily into the skin.  </li>
            <li>While it feels pleasant enough, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on wrinkles, lines, or skin tone unevenness.</li>
            <li>This is no where near as effective as the original.  </li>
            <li>-- I might look a bright 10 years younger.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is great because it sinks into your skin without leaving you feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>Truely nothing is going to fix the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>, it makes it seem as if there is much more in the container than there really is.</li>
            <li>have somewhat sensitive skin with certain things and this did not give me any discomfort so that is a good thing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This does go away quickly, but still.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not greasy at all and disappears into your skin quickly.</li>
            <li>But this goes on very lightly and keeps skin moisturized and soft all day.</li>
            <li>But this product has a lot of quality, more natural ingredients and now that I&#x27;m in my 30s</li>
            <li>The more I used it, the more I began to notice the little wrinkles setting in.</li>
            <li>I guess if it was your first you could see a difference.</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin looking exactly my age.</li>
            <li>It seems to fill in locations when you first apply it.  </li>
            <li>It does not bother my eyes at all which is a first.</li>
            <li>Stop applying the product, even after a month of consistent application, and wrinkles appear again.  </li>
            <li>I also like that after the first day I could see a softening of my lines.</li>
            <li>Not caused by the cream, surely, but the cream is definitely not doing anything to fight them off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also recommend this cream for those with more sensitive skin - my skin is somewhat sensitive and it didn&#x27;t make my skin itch or burn at all.</li>
            <li>Fine lines seem to dissapear with consistent application whereas larger wrinkles soften.  </li>
            <li>while I think the product has done a good job, I think there are other products that do a close enough or similar job for a more affordable price.</li>
            <li>This seems to really work well on firming my skin.  </li>
            <li>so I just dip the very tip of one finger into the cream.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The white cream is smooth as silk when applied to the face and neck in the morning and in the evening.  </li>
            <li>as a moisturizer, it&#x27;s absolutely FABALOUS</li>
            <li>but as a anti-wrinkle cream, not so much.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much and there is no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care for the &#x60;jar&#x27; packaging.  </li>
            <li>I think some people are using way too much of this product.  </li>
            <li>I waited with much anticipation and hope for this product to arrive from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>applied it to the tiny wrinkles near my eyes as well as the more intense wrinkles on my frown head</li>
            <li>They were not worse but they were there as before.  </li>
            <li>I originally liked the Hydroxatone in the Green jar.  </li>
            <li>It also eliminates the need for a separate night cream -- it is light enough to wear during the day but rich enough to use at night as well.</li>
            <li>My face has held in more moisture with this 10-30 degree weather than with any other lotion</li>
            <li>With that in mind, I doubt this would be rich enough for</li>
            <li>I realize for some people this may not be realistic, it&#x27;s just my preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This time the only option available was this product, for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Nothing worked, so when I saw this Hydroxatone Anti-Wrinkle \\&quot;complex\\&quot; offered on Vine for a review, I thought Wow!!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t notice any marked improvement there, but I do really like this product</li>
            <li>I also had my mom try the product (she has normal skin).  </li>
            <li>However, please take my stats, which will follow, into consideration when using this review for the purposes of deciding whether or not to purchase this product:  39 years old, married, mother of four; smoker; resides in Tennessee; and is frequently outdoors during Spring, Summer, and Fall; seldom uses sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the feel of heavy lotions on my face and feel they just make wrinkles more prevalent.</li>
            <li>First thing you will notice is that the container is far larger than included product, with its first (and largest) ingredient being water.</li>
            <li>For the consistency, I thought it would be more moisturizing and too heavy for  my oily complexion.  </li>
            <li>This particular product is made for sensitive skin and it had no negative effects on my skin over the course of the month that I tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it has become my new go-to moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>That makes this at least 10 times the cost of what I have used before, which I really cannot fathom paying for, for a bit more smoothness in application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You need only a light coating on your fingertips to cover your entire face.  </li>
            <li>cost is just far too high for a simple moisturizer (I do like how it feels, thus the 2 star rating), but there are many other fine products out there who do the same for a much lesser cost.</li>
            <li>As a person with very sensitive skin it is always a risk when I agree to test out a skin care product.  </li>
            <li>Am I to assume that the color of the jar was changed and that the am/pm regular Hydroxatone in the Blue jar (no silver top) has the same formulation.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if it contains precious metals or</li>
            <li>Wrinkles and fine lines are less noticeable when the skin is temporarily \\&quot;plumped up\\&quot; by moisturizers, and this one does contain Hyaluronic Acid (a known plumping ingredient).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a pretty modest claim, which I actually appreciate.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s the only positive thing about the container.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have the sensitive skin formula, but it tingles a bit when I put it on.</li>
            <li>only thing I really didn&#x27;t like about it, was the texture.</li>
            <li>and I like to see at least 2 months or more out of a pricey night cream.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have no break-out problems to speak of.</li>
            <li>I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Overall, would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I had no trouble with this cream at all.</li>
            <li>This is a good enough skin cream, but not great.</li>
            <li>But as others have noted, I don&#x27;t see how the effect (fine, but not stunning) justifies the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little on the fence about the anti-aging effects; I can see that my skin is being hydrated well as I don&#x27;t have as many dry patches as before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is too bad this is sold as yet another \\&quot;anti-wrinkle cream\\&quot; because I am sure there are many consumer who know to stay away from such product claims.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ladies, I have yet to find any product that actually reduces wrinkles or stop new ones from appearing; we age, it is a fact, let&#x27;s get over it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and can usually only use fragrance-free, natural products, but my skin has not broken out with daily use of this for several months.  </li>
            <li>From the first day I used it my skin felt moisturized and soft (thereby showing less creases).  </li>
            <li>I live in Nevada&#x27;s dry climate and find many moisturizers do me no good.</li>
            <li>NOt healed and young but different.  </li>
            <li>It tingles a tiny bit when I put it on, but did not bother my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While the product has a smell I did not personally care for, it was not offensive by any means; but some say I am hyper sensitive to smell.  </li>
            <li>and like I said I&#x27;ve developed red splotches.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 40 year old male.  </li>
            <li>My skin is normal to dry.  </li>
            <li>have to admit this feels the nicest and blends in the smoothest of any cream I have used; but strangely it reminds me of ponds cold cream which worked just as good as this as far as results go.</li>
            <li>It feels a little greasy when you first apply it, but then it absorbs quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>me, I&#x27;m not sure the price is worth it, but it IS a helpful cream</li>
            <li>I say too bad, because it is a really good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Hydroxatone am/pm anti-wrinkle complex for sensitive skin works really well.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m always sure I must  be getting the rest of the product loaded (although my hands are always washed) with germs every time I stick my finger in the jar.  </li>
            <li> It might match my face&#x27;s moisture needs better in the spring or summer rather than now in winter when my skin tends to be driest.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li> I think my fine lines around my eyes are more prominent since I started using this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, the container is a very bright blue</li>
            <li> This feels great and keeps my skin soft all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and creamy, I love it&#x27;s texture.  </li>
            <li> It made my makeup go on more smoothly in the morning</li>
            <li> I have not noticed fine lines on my 50-year-old face anyway, so I cannot tell if this works for that.</li>
            <li> I will have some improvement in the fine lines around the eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> in terms of that feature, it was fine.</li>
            <li> like how smoothly it goes on my skin, it glides on, so</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth with this cream.</li>
            <li> However, regardless, it makes my skin feel smooth and doesn&#x27;t break it out, so I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> I will say that areas tending to have a roughness some mornings, are smooth after using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One star off because I am not at all sure it is worth the posted price.  </li>
            <li> Because it is light, it can be used at night or during the day under makeup.</li>
            <li> It is also fragrance free, another plus for me.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth, hydrated nourished.  </li>
            <li> The smell of this cream is light and has almost no smell at all.  </li>
            <li> I really like it is goes on light,smells nice, and did not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s used because it makes it seem like you&#x27;re getting far more than just 1 oz. of product, but I don&#x27;t like having to stick my fingers into the jar to scoop out the product; it&#x27;s easy to spread bacteria that way.  </li>
            <li> product goes on easy and disappears fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> -- Hopefully those private facts will help you to better compare my life to your own and</li>
            <li> I do like this cream because it is mild and light -</li>
            <li> it absorbed easily into the skin.  </li>
            <li> While it feels pleasant enough, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on wrinkles, lines, or skin tone unevenness.</li>
            <li> This is no where near as effective as the original.  </li>
            <li> -- I might look a bright 10 years younger.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great because it sinks into your skin without leaving you feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> Truely nothing is going to fix the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> , it makes it seem as if there is much more in the container than there really is.</li>
            <li> have somewhat sensitive skin with certain things and this did not give me any discomfort so that is a good thing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This does go away quickly, but still.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not greasy at all and disappears into your skin quickly.</li>
            <li> But this goes on very lightly and keeps skin moisturized and soft all day.</li>
            <li> But this product has a lot of quality, more natural ingredients and now that I&#x27;m in my 30s</li>
            <li> The more I used it, the more I began to notice the little wrinkles setting in.</li>
            <li> I guess if it was your first you could see a difference.</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin looking exactly my age.</li>
            <li> It seems to fill in locations when you first apply it.  </li>
            <li> It does not bother my eyes at all which is a first.</li>
            <li> Stop applying the product, even after a month of consistent application, and wrinkles appear again.  </li>
            <li> I also like that after the first day I could see a softening of my lines.</li>
            <li> Not caused by the cream, surely, but the cream is definitely not doing anything to fight them off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also recommend this cream for those with more sensitive skin - my skin is somewhat sensitive and it didn&#x27;t make my skin itch or burn at all.</li>
            <li> Fine lines seem to dissapear with consistent application whereas larger wrinkles soften.  </li>
            <li> while I think the product has done a good job, I think there are other products that do a close enough or similar job for a more affordable price.</li>
            <li> This seems to really work well on firming my skin.  </li>
            <li> so I just dip the very tip of one finger into the cream.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The white cream is smooth as silk when applied to the face and neck in the morning and in the evening.  </li>
            <li> as a moisturizer, it&#x27;s absolutely FABALOUS</li>
            <li> but as a anti-wrinkle cream, not so much.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much and there is no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care for the &#x60;jar&#x27; packaging.  </li>
            <li> I think some people are using way too much of this product.  </li>
            <li> I waited with much anticipation and hope for this product to arrive from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> applied it to the tiny wrinkles near my eyes as well as the more intense wrinkles on my frown head</li>
            <li> They were not worse but they were there as before.  </li>
            <li> I originally liked the Hydroxatone in the Green jar.  </li>
            <li> It also eliminates the need for a separate night cream -- it is light enough to wear during the day but rich enough to use at night as well.</li>
            <li> My face has held in more moisture with this 10-30 degree weather than with any other lotion</li>
            <li> With that in mind, I doubt this would be rich enough for</li>
            <li> I realize for some people this may not be realistic, it&#x27;s just my preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This time the only option available was this product, for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Nothing worked, so when I saw this Hydroxatone Anti-Wrinkle \\&quot;complex\\&quot; offered on Vine for a review, I thought Wow!!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice any marked improvement there, but I do really like this product</li>
            <li> I also had my mom try the product (she has normal skin).  </li>
            <li> However, please take my stats, which will follow, into consideration when using this review for the purposes of deciding whether or not to purchase this product:  39 years old, married, mother of four; smoker; resides in Tennessee; and is frequently outdoors during Spring, Summer, and Fall; seldom uses sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the feel of heavy lotions on my face and feel they just make wrinkles more prevalent.</li>
            <li> First thing you will notice is that the container is far larger than included product, with its first (and largest) ingredient being water.</li>
            <li> For the consistency, I thought it would be more moisturizing and too heavy for  my oily complexion.  </li>
            <li> This particular product is made for sensitive skin and it had no negative effects on my skin over the course of the month that I tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it has become my new go-to moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> That makes this at least 10 times the cost of what I have used before, which I really cannot fathom paying for, for a bit more smoothness in application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You need only a light coating on your fingertips to cover your entire face.  </li>
            <li> cost is just far too high for a simple moisturizer (I do like how it feels, thus the 2 star rating), but there are many other fine products out there who do the same for a much lesser cost.</li>
            <li> As a person with very sensitive skin it is always a risk when I agree to test out a skin care product.  </li>
            <li> Am I to assume that the color of the jar was changed and that the am/pm regular Hydroxatone in the Blue jar (no silver top) has the same formulation.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it contains precious metals or</li>
            <li> Wrinkles and fine lines are less noticeable when the skin is temporarily \\&quot;plumped up\\&quot; by moisturizers, and this one does contain Hyaluronic Acid (a known plumping ingredient).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a pretty modest claim, which I actually appreciate.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s the only positive thing about the container.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have the sensitive skin formula, but it tingles a bit when I put it on.</li>
            <li> only thing I really didn&#x27;t like about it, was the texture.</li>
            <li> and I like to see at least 2 months or more out of a pricey night cream.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have no break-out problems to speak of.</li>
            <li> I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Overall, would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I had no trouble with this cream at all.</li>
            <li> This is a good enough skin cream, but not great.</li>
            <li> But as others have noted, I don&#x27;t see how the effect (fine, but not stunning) justifies the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little on the fence about the anti-aging effects; I can see that my skin is being hydrated well as I don&#x27;t have as many dry patches as before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is too bad this is sold as yet another \\&quot;anti-wrinkle cream\\&quot; because I am sure there are many consumer who know to stay away from such product claims.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ladies, I have yet to find any product that actually reduces wrinkles or stop new ones from appearing; we age, it is a fact, let&#x27;s get over it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and can usually only use fragrance-free, natural products, but my skin has not broken out with daily use of this for several months.  </li>
            <li> From the first day I used it my skin felt moisturized and soft (thereby showing less creases).  </li>
            <li> I live in Nevada&#x27;s dry climate and find many moisturizers do me no good.</li>
            <li> NOt healed and young but different.  </li>
            <li> It tingles a tiny bit when I put it on, but did not bother my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While the product has a smell I did not personally care for, it was not offensive by any means; but some say I am hyper sensitive to smell.  </li>
            <li> and like I said I&#x27;ve developed red splotches.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40 year old male.  </li>
            <li> My skin is normal to dry.  </li>
            <li> have to admit this feels the nicest and blends in the smoothest of any cream I have used; but strangely it reminds me of ponds cold cream which worked just as good as this as far as results go.</li>
            <li> It feels a little greasy when you first apply it, but then it absorbs quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> me, I&#x27;m not sure the price is worth it, but it IS a helpful cream</li>
            <li> I say too bad, because it is a really good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Hydroxatone am/pm anti-wrinkle complex for sensitive skin works really well.</li>
            <li> From my wife:  I have sensitive skin and am usually hesitant to try new products on my face.  </li>
            <li> whether Hydroxatone AM/PM Anti-Wrinkle Complex is the right choice for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK moisturizer, no more, and for the price it should at least sing and dance.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s what this is supposed to do though - add enough long lasting moisture to make the wrinkles fill in a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use Olay products (Regenerist) and have found that I really like how they work on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it works on wrinkles as in that area we didn&#x27;t see much</li>
            <li> The product is a bit pricey and did not last as long as I thought...</li>
            <li> not great not bad</li>
            <li> Far less visible hydration.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*may not provide enough moisture for dry/very dry skin</li>
            <li> Not unexpected I might add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> help reduce the appearance of a wide range of wrinkles and improve the overall appearance of the skin\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The texture is thick, but spreads really well.  </li>
            <li> Now several days later the treated hand looks a bit less wrinkly.  </li>
            <li> and I do believe it kept my skin from getting overly parched, which usually happens in New England winters.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other products last that long</li>
            <li> I rubbed a bit on the back of one hand and not the other.  </li>
            <li> That may be from it being winter and no sun exposure OR some other products I have been using (Clinique Repairwear Intensive Night Cream and Skinceuticals Overnight Dry, which I alternate).</li>
            <li> I also have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> dry/very dry skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems like a decent but not exceptional product.</li>
            <li> B0038T184W Hydroxatone AM/PM Anti-Wrinkle Complex for Sensitive Skin]], however, I am not nearly as impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had I been doing the cream to a less crabby looking area and doing it religiously</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the product is decent but not exceptional in consideration of price point.</li>
            <li> If you look at it carefully, the only part that has the cream is a small section in the middle.</li>
            <li> And the texture isn&#x27;t totally smooth--it&#x27;s a little lumpy.</li>
            <li> This review is for the AM/PM Anti-Wrinkle Complex for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now two weeks later, but this effect started to kick in in a few days.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different anti-wrinkle type of creams and lotions and well, nothing is a sure-fire way to get rid of wrinkles...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cross between a heavy cream and petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li> I found that it did not moisturize as well as i expected</li>
            <li> Further, a little goes a long way, so this jar lasted a little over a month for me.  </li>
            <li> Yet, in all fairness, I will say I&#x27;ve not noticed any new wrinkles so it is doing at least half of what it should.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried various creams, lotions, potions, prayer, yoga, fad diets and Shamanic chanting, all in the hopes of at least slowing down the lines of time, if not reversing time itself (what woman doesn&#x27;t want her boobs back up where they belong).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not old, but my age is starting to show and why not nip it in the bud before it&#x27;s too late,</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t tell any difference from the other anti wrinkle cream I was using.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t expect to be wrinkle-free after a week of using this or any other cream.</li>
            <li> I also am always amazed at expensive products whose first ingredient is water, which is what this has.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why all the Hydroxatone reviews are being lumped together as the different formulations vary significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have some of the issues other people had --</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t made me break out once or suffer any other allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I thought I was ordering the regular Hydroxatone NOT the one for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> but I would be afraid to pay so much for something a child could smear on the mirror in 5 seconds flat.</li>
            <li> For my client photo shoots, I will probably go back to using far less expensive mositurizers.</li>
            <li> I have always ordered the Hydroxatone AM/PM anti-wrinkle complex -- for regular skin.  </li>
            <li> I often have trouble with creams burning my eyes, no matter how careful I am about applying them nearby.</li>
            <li> The outer blue flare of the jar is just for show and the lid is meant to look really thick but the amount of cream is one ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin seems less wobbly to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Slowly I&#x27;ve braved a few products since then, with mixed results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this about a month and a half</li>
            <li> I had previously reviewed [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I frankly expected very little if anything to happen</li>
            <li> , perhaps some moisturizing of my skin but no true erasing of \\&quot;time\\&quot; on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does seem a little spendy for the amount you get, so I  took off a star.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to try the Hydroxatone since it is an anti-aging product</li>
            <li> It has a gel-cream consistency, which takes a little effort to scoop out.</li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t dried out by using it</li>
            <li> I guess they assume everyone will use this up before a few months time?</li>
            <li> If you were putting makeup on after, you would need to wait a few minutes, but it is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually made my skin look worse.  </li>
            <li> My issue is usually with fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the product as compared with the regular version.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But no matter what, I can&#x27;t get past the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of money to spend on a deceivingly small container.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be for \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin which I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> They are missing out on grabbing a large consumer base by this claim.</li>
            <li> but I also think that the skin on my face has plumped ever so slightly which is what has decreased the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My one complaint:  </li>
            <li> ordered this anti-wrinkle complex with the hopes that it would prevent wrinkles from appearing in my skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, my skin is subtly improved as a result of using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, I know we all get wrinkles as we age, but that still doesn&#x27;t mean I have to like it!</li>
            <li> Last year, I had a violent allergic reaction to a MAC foundation, and had to stop using anything on my face that was &#x60;anti-aging&#x27; in nature.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for approximately two weeks now.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my skin broke out into almost immediately after using this product.  </li>
            <li> The consistency of the product is a bit weird.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> After a few months, the cream turned rancid and smelled terrible.</li>
            <li> I could not use anything stronger than coconut oil on my face, it was that bad.  </li>
            <li> am disappointed that I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting done with brutal northern U.S. winter weather.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  My issue is usually with fragrance.  I also have dry skin.  I was very excited to try this product.  Unfortunately, my skin broke out into almost immediately after using this product.  Some bumps were pimples and some were hives from reacting to something in this.  I also had my mom try the product (she has normal skin).  She did not react immediately, but after a couple of days the product was also bothering her skin.  I would NOT recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This seems to really work well on firming my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it under my chin and neck area and I can see a difference, mostly around the bottom area of my chin.  My skin seems less wobbly to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how smoothly it goes on my skin, it glides on, so I don&#x27;t need to pull at my skin while applying it.  It doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable scent to me, which I also like.  It&#x27;s a nice cream and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  A little goes a long way so I just dip the very tip of one finger into the cream.  I like this this cream and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I thought I was ordering the regular Hydroxatone NOT the one for sensitive skin.  I was not impressed with the product as compared with the regular version.  Far less visible hydration.  I originally liked the Hydroxatone in the Green jar.  Am I to assume that the color of the jar was changed and that the am/pm regular Hydroxatone in the Blue jar (no silver top) has the same formulation.  I wish I could get this answer...</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product in that my skin feels smoother and looks healthier than it did before. It&#x27;s now two weeks later, but this effect started to kick in in a few days. But as others have noted, I don&#x27;t see how the effect (fine, but not stunning) justifies the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Yes, my skin is subtly improved as a result of using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. I have the sensitive skin formula, but it tingles a bit when I put it on. This does go away quickly, but still.&lt;br /&gt;2. Expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I&#x27;m not sure the price is worth it, but it IS a helpful cream</li>
            <li> This is a good enough skin cream, but not great. It feels a little greasy when you first apply it, but then it absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It seems like a decent but not exceptional product.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer/anti-aging cream. I have sensitive skin, and can usually only use fragrance-free, natural products, but my skin has not broken out with daily use of this for several months.  I have not noticed fine lines on my 50-year-old face anyway, so I cannot tell if this works for that. My skin feels smooth with this cream. I do notice some age/sun damage spots that appear lighter. That may be from it being winter and no sun exposure OR some other products I have been using (Clinique Repairwear Intensive Night Cream and Skinceuticals Overnight Dry, which I alternate). However, regardless, it makes my skin feel smooth and doesn&#x27;t break it out, so I&#x27;ll keep using it. It has an attractive jar, if keeping it out on your vanity table as an eye-pleaser matters to you. It does seem a little spendy for the amount you get, so I  took off a star.</li>
            <li> Last year, I had a violent allergic reaction to a MAC foundation, and had to stop using anything on my face that was &#x60;anti-aging&#x27; in nature. Anything with actives, fragrance, etc. all caused my face to redden, sting, burn, swell up. I had to give up my beloved Avon ANEW skincare (one of the best, most effective ones I have ever tried) and this really bummed me out. I could not use anything stronger than coconut oil on my face, it was that bad.  Slowly I&#x27;ve braved a few products since then, with mixed results. I was a little hesitant to try the Hydroxatone since it is an anti-aging product and I feared irritation, but tried it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this does just what it says it will! It hydrates nicely, and it causes ZERO irritation on my face or neck. I&#x27;m a little on the fence about the anti-aging effects; I can see that my skin is being hydrated well as I don&#x27;t have as many dry patches as before. It doesn&#x27;t sting or burn or itch when applied, so I&#x27;ve been able to use it awhile now and like it. I haven&#x27;t noticed a reduction of lines in areas where I have them, but they also don&#x27;t appear to be more noticeable. Just the fact that this doesn&#x27;t cause me any allergic reactions was impressive.  I will say that areas tending to have a roughness some mornings, are smooth after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I really didn&#x27;t like about it, was the texture. It has a gel-cream consistency, which takes a little effort to scoop out. I also feel that gel-cream formulations make me use more. I&#x27;ve had this about a month and a half and I like to see at least 2 months or more out of a pricey night cream. (Just my personal budgetary and usage preference) I&#x27;ve had other products last that long and it&#x27;s something I have come to expect from night creams. I realize for some people this may not be realistic, it&#x27;s just my preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Even though I was satisfied that this cream is nice, this price point of over $50 is not of interest to me. It would have to work as well as the Avon ANEW that I loved, to justify that price for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using various acid peels (mandelic, glycolic, TCA) on my face and neck. This Hydroxatone product is good at keeping my face hydrated, but it just can&#x27;t keep up with my neck now that I&#x27;m using acid peel products. My neck will sometimes look like it&#x27;s 70 as the skin turnover takes place in the days after a peel; this moisturizer simply can&#x27;t keep up.as the Avon ANEW that I loved, to justify that price for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using various acid peels (mandelic, glycolic, TCA) on my face and neck.

            <li> not great not bad but I can&#x27;t tell any difference from the other anti wrinkle cream I was using. I guess if it was your first you could see a difference. My skin wasn&#x27;t dried out by using it I just couldn&#x27;t tell a difference.</li>
            <li> (this review comes from my wife, who used it for a month)&lt;br /&gt;I tried AM/PM cream on a daily basis for about a month. While it feels pleasant enough, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on wrinkles, lines, or skin tone unevenness. And the texture isn&#x27;t totally smooth--it&#x27;s a little lumpy. it leaves my skin looking exactly my age. Doesn&#x27;t make me want to give up my Olay Total Effects. It&#x27;s an OK moisturizer, no more, and for the price it should at least sing and dance. I wouldn&#x27;t get this again.</li>
            <li> Yes, I know we all get wrinkles as we age, but that still doesn&#x27;t mean I have to like it! I have tried various creams, lotions, potions, prayer, yoga, fad diets and Shamanic chanting, all in the hopes of at least slowing down the lines of time, if not reversing time itself (what woman doesn&#x27;t want her boobs back up where they belong). Nothing worked, so when I saw this Hydroxatone Anti-Wrinkle \\&quot;complex\\&quot; offered on Vine for a review, I thought Wow!! This is great cause its FREE! It&#x27;s gotta work, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, I have yet to find any product that actually reduces wrinkles or stop new ones from appearing; we age, it is a fact, let&#x27;s get over it. I agreed to to review this to see if it would make any difference to my face, and to be fair to the product makers, I used it for 6 weeks as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is too bad this is sold as yet another \\&quot;anti-wrinkle cream\\&quot; because I am sure there are many consumer who know to stay away from such product claims. They are missing out on grabbing a large consumer base by this claim. I say too bad, because it is a really good moisturizer. I live in Nevada&#x27;s dry climate and find many moisturizers do me no good. This feels great and keeps my skin soft all day.I have sensitive skin and have no break-out problems to speak of. I will continue to use it for these reasons.</li>
            <li> I had previously reviewed [[ASIN:B009XRFA88 Hydroxatone Hydrolyze Intensive Under Eye Treatment]] and found it to be a most excellent product which lived up to its promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the [[ASIN:B0038T184W Hydroxatone AM/PM Anti-Wrinkle Complex for Sensitive Skin]], however, I am not nearly as impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white cream is smooth as silk when applied to the face and neck in the morning and in the evening.  I noticed my face is firmer, plump - as if a hydration fairy visited me during my sleeping hows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as a moisturizer, it&#x27;s absolutely FABALOUS but as a anti-wrinkle cream, not so much.  During the time I&#x27;ve used this, I&#x27;ve witnessed no evidence that my visible wrinkles on my forehead and along my cheekbones have faded - as promised by this product.  Yet, in all fairness, I will say I&#x27;ve not noticed any new wrinkles so it is doing at least half of what it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve rated this product based on my experience.  However, please take my stats, which will follow, into consideration when using this review for the purposes of deciding whether or not to purchase this product:  39 years old, married, mother of four; smoker; resides in Tennessee; and is frequently outdoors during Spring, Summer, and Fall; seldom uses sunscreen.  -- Hopefully those private facts will help you to better compare my life to your own and whether Hydroxatone AM/PM Anti-Wrinkle Complex is the right choice for you.</li>
            <li> I rubbed a bit on the back of one hand and not the other.  I did it again.  Now several days later the treated hand looks a bit less wrinkly.  NOt healed and young but different.  Had I been doing the cream to a less crabby looking area and doing it religiously -- I might look a bright 10 years younger.  Testing continues.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for approximately two weeks now.  My face has held in more moisture with this 10-30 degree weather than with any other lotion I have tried so far.  It&#x27;s light and creamy, I love it&#x27;s texture.  It&#x27;s not greasy and rubs into the skin beautifully.  It seems to fill in locations when you first apply it.  I haven&#x27;t seen a diminshed look on any of my face wrinkles yet.  I am hopeful byt the time I finish the container I will have some improvement in the fine lines around the eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> Truely nothing is going to fix the wrinkles.  But this goes on very lightly and keeps skin moisturized and soft all day. It does not bother my eyes at all which is a first. It doesn&#x27;t take much and there is no greasy feel.  One star off because I am not at all sure it is worth the posted price.  It is one ounce of product, that is two tablespoons, IOW the size of a serving of salad dressing.&lt;br /&gt;It did not come with an ingredient list so I&#x27;m not sure if it contains precious metals or what but I would be afraid to pay so much for something a child could smear on the mirror in 5 seconds flat.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different anti-wrinkle type of creams and lotions and well, nothing is a sure-fire way to get rid of wrinkles... it&#x27;s just a fact of life! BUT I will say that that this lotion has reduced the depth of my wrinkles nicely. Notice I say \\&quot;reduced\\&quot;... so don&#x27;t expect to be wrinkle-free after a week of using this or any other cream. I do like this cream because it is mild and light - I don&#x27;t like the feel of heavy lotions on my face and feel they just make wrinkles more prevalent. This cream goes on very easily and feels nice on my face. Because it is light, it can be used at night or during the day under makeup. I also recommend this cream for those with more sensitive skin - my skin is somewhat sensitive and it didn&#x27;t make my skin itch or burn at all. It is also fragrance free, another plus for me.</li>
            <li> The container this anti-wrinkle cream comes in is very nice. It looks beautiful, but it is very deceptive, it makes it seem as if there is much more in the container than there really is. I also am always amazed at expensive products whose first ingredient is water, which is what this has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit this feels the nicest and blends in the smoothest of any cream I have used; but strangely it reminds me of ponds cold cream which worked just as good as this as far as results go. That makes this at least 10 times the cost of what I have used before, which I really cannot fathom paying for, for a bit more smoothness in application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&gt;After a few months, the cream turned rancid and smelled terrible. It should have an expiration date. I guess they assume everyone will use this up before a few months time?</li>
            <li> Feels amazing on my skin - thoroughly moisturizing face cream.  Leaves skin smooth, hydrated nourished.  Love it!  Although, to be fair, some of my friends are not quite as enthusiastic.</li>
            <li> I used the entire jar and see no change. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize very effectively. I do have sensitive skin and I did not react to this product, so in terms of that feature, it was fine.</li>
            <li> From my wife:  I have sensitive skin and am usually hesitant to try new products on my face.  But this product has a lot of quality, more natural ingredients and now that I&#x27;m in my 30s my skin is not as amazing.  The smell of this cream is light and has almost no smell at all.  The texture is thick, but spreads really well.  It tingles a tiny bit when I put it on, but did not bother my sensitive skin.  Soaks in well and moisturizes well.  If you were putting makeup on after, you would need to wait a few minutes, but it is not greasy.  My skin is normal to dry.  From the first day I used it my skin felt moisturized and soft (thereby showing less creases).  Additionally, any redness or hormonal breakouts seemed to be diminished.  The product is a bit pricey and did not last as long as I thought...but maybe it ran out quicker because I really liked it:-)  Overall, would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> First thing you will notice is that the container is far larger than included product, with its first (and largest) ingredient being water. Keep that in mind as you shop products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the product has a smell I did not personally care for, it was not offensive by any means; but some say I am hyper sensitive to smell.  As a moistuirizer, the product works great.  Fine lines seem to dissapear with consistent application whereas larger wrinkles soften.  Believe it or not, I use this for clients during photoshoots because it does not leave an oily sheen(to avoid post processing skin when possible).  However, I found this to be the case only while the product is applied.  Stop applying the product, even after a month of consistent application, and wrinkles appear again.  Not unexpected I might add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product is decent but not exceptional in consideration of price point. For my client photo shoots, I will probably go back to using far less expensive mositurizers.</li>
            <li> Hydroxatone am/pm anti-wrinkle complex for sensitive skin works really well. I had been using oil of olay regenerist but decided to try the hydroxatone. I really like it is goes on light,smells nice, and did not irritate my skin at all. I also like that after the first day I could see a softening of my lines.It is not greasy at all and disappears into your skin quickly. I like it better than the olay I think.Just because it seems to work faster.Try it I think you will like it.</li>
            <li> This review is for the AM/PM Anti-Wrinkle Complex for sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m not sure why all the Hydroxatone reviews are being lumped together as the different formulations vary significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice lightweight moisturizer with a non-greasy feel.  It absorbs into the skin within seconds and leaves my face feeling moisturized but without any kind of \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; feel to it.  I can apply make-up almost immediately after using this moisturizer in the morning and it does not affect how well my make-up wears throughout the day.  This provides the perfect amount of moisture for my combination skin (mostly normal with a tendency to get oily in the t-zone).  With that in mind, I doubt this would be rich enough for dry/very dry skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things to consider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sensitive formula does not contain sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;*non-scented&lt;br /&gt;*may not provide enough moisture for dry/very dry skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the product claim that&#x27;s printed on the side of the box:  \\&quot;...help reduce the appearance of a wide range of wrinkles and improve the overall appearance of the skin\\&quot;.  That&#x27;s a pretty modest claim, which I actually appreciate.  No miracle anti-aging claims here.  Wrinkles and fine lines are less noticeable when the skin is temporarily \\&quot;plumped up\\&quot; by moisturizers, and this one does contain Hyaluronic Acid (a known plumping ingredient).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was very pleased with this product.  It&#x27;s convenient to have one moisturizer that can be used for both AM and PM, and I prefer my skin care products without sunscreen - who needs a night cream that contains sunblock?  My one complaint:  I really don&#x27;t care for the &#x60;jar&#x27; packaging.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s used because it makes it seem like you&#x27;re getting far more than just 1 oz. of product, but I don&#x27;t like having to stick my fingers into the jar to scoop out the product; it&#x27;s easy to spread bacteria that way.  I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I got to preview this product and didn&#x27;t spend my hard-earned money on it.  It did not help in any way, shape, or form.  It&#x27;s actually made my skin look worse.  I&#x27;ve got red splotches all over my face where I used this product.  I didn&#x27;t have some of the issues other people had -- it doesn&#x27;t tingle/burn my skin, and I didn&#x27;t find it greasy it absorbed easily into the skin.  I think some people are using way too much of this product.  You need only a light coating on your fingertips to cover your entire face.  I love the way it smells, it feels great going onto your skin, but it&#x27;s just not for me.  I think my fine lines around my eyes are more prominent since I started using this product and like I said I&#x27;ve developed red splotches.  I can&#x27;t recommend to anyone.  And I&#x27;ll be ditching the rest of my jar and going back to my tried-and-true Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great because it sinks into your skin without leaving you feeling greasy.  Further, a little goes a long way, so this jar lasted a little over a month for me.  It made my makeup go on more smoothly in the morning and I do believe it kept my skin from getting overly parched, which usually happens in New England winters.  I kept looking to see if it was helping my eye wrinkles out and I didn&#x27;t notice any marked improvement there, but I do really like this product and it has become my new go-to moisturizer.  It also eliminates the need for a separate night cream -- it is light enough to wear during the day but rich enough to use at night as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not old, but my age is starting to show and why not nip it in the bud before it&#x27;s too late, amirite?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this anti-wrinkle complex with the hopes that it would prevent wrinkles from appearing in my skin. The more I used it, the more I began to notice the little wrinkles setting in. Not caused by the cream, surely, but the cream is definitely not doing anything to fight them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost is just far too high for a simple moisturizer (I do like how it feels, thus the 2 star rating), but there are many other fine products out there who do the same for a much lesser cost.</li>
            <li> I usually use Olay products (Regenerist) and have found that I really like how they work on my skin. But the idea of trying a product for three times the price to see if it makes a three times difference was too good to pass up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product goes on easy and disappears fairly quickly. I often have trouble with creams burning my eyes, no matter how careful I am about applying them nearby. I had no trouble with this cream at all. It never bothered my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that I feel some of my finer wrinkles have softened but I also think that the skin on my face has plumped ever so slightly which is what has decreased the appearance of wrinkles. I guess that&#x27;s what this is supposed to do though - add enough long lasting moisture to make the wrinkles fill in a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no matter what, I can&#x27;t get past the price. It&#x27;s a lot of money to spend on a deceivingly small container. If you look at it carefully, the only part that has the cream is a small section in the middle. The outer blue flare of the jar is just for show and the lid is meant to look really thick but the amount of cream is one ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while I think the product has done a good job, I think there are other products that do a close enough or similar job for a more affordable price.</li>
            <li> This cream is a great moisturizer.  I am not sure if it works on wrinkles as in that area we didn&#x27;t see much change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it does work in the wrinkle area I am sure you would need more than one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the price we won&#x27;t be trying to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that it has a great texture and feels nice to applicate.&lt;br /&gt;I have somewhat sensitive skin with certain things and this did not give me any discomfort so that is a good thing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, if it were cheaper we would probably buy more of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40 year old male.  I use it for myself.  I&#x27;m just getting done with brutal northern U.S. winter weather.  I was using this for a while before the weather started getting milder and I think it works.  I started noticing what I believe are wrinkles around the \\&quot;crows\\&quot; feet area?  Started using this and I believe it is helping.  Hasn&#x27;t made me break out once or suffer any other allergic reaction.  Couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars for its hefty price tag though.  $50 for 1 oz?  I think that&#x27;s like gold!</li>
            <li> I waited with much anticipation and hope for this product to arrive from Amazon.  It&#x27;s supposed to be for \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin which I&#x27;m not sure if I have quite yet at the age of 44. What will my skin be considered when I&#x27;m 74?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the container is a very bright blue but that&#x27;s the only positive thing about the container.  I detest containers that require me to stick my finger in the jar.  I&#x27;m always sure I must  be getting the rest of the product loaded (although my hands are always washed) with germs every time I stick my finger in the jar.  The consistency of the product is a bit weird.  It&#x27;s a cross between a heavy cream and petroleum jelly.  For the consistency, I thought it would be more moisturizing and too heavy for  my oily complexion.  I found that it did not moisturize as well as i expected but it did feel weightless on my face which is good.  There is no fragrance to speak of either which is another positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up having to use this ( pricey) cream and then using another (not so pricey) moisturizer which i already had afterwards to make my face feel sufficiently moisturized.  It might match my face&#x27;s moisture needs better in the spring or summer rather than now in winter when my skin tends to be driest.</li>
            <li> I have always ordered the Hydroxatone AM/PM anti-wrinkle complex -- for regular skin.  This time the only option available was this product, for sensitive skin.  This is no where near as effective as the original.  They seem like very different products.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed that I purchased it.</li>
            <li> As a person with very sensitive skin it is always a risk when I agree to test out a skin care product.  This particular product is made for sensitive skin and it had no negative effects on my skin over the course of the month that I tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it to the tiny wrinkles near my eyes as well as the more intense wrinkles on my frown head (my \\&quot;I&#x27;m annoyed/angry\\&quot; lines as I call them).  I frankly expected very little if anything to happen, perhaps some moisturizing of my skin but no true erasing of \\&quot;time\\&quot; on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.  The tiny lines under my eyes disappeared within four uses and the deeper lines above lessened visibly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, and this is a big however, if I did not apply it every day the lines came back. They were not worse but they were there as before.  So the product works but you must keep using it.</li>
