            <li> Kids loooove this. Hilarious stuff. Easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
            <li> Great buy. My kids love it</li>
            <li> Shaving cream consistency. Quickly dissolves, makes water murky. Not the kind of foam you&#x27;d expect in bubble baths (soap foam). My 2 year old got freaked out when the water stopped being transparent (note: there were no bubbles, just murky water).</li>
            <li> This stuff is great fun, not irritating to young skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess!</li>
            <li> Great product, but 3 stars because it is expensive on Amazon. Half the cost at Target.</li>
            <li> I first purchased Mr. Bubble Foam Soap in stores as part of a goodie bag I made for my niece&#x27;s birthday. Long story short, she&#x27;s in love with this stuff!! I had to buy more! Makes showering very fun and of course has the classic Mr. Bubble scent. This is a great buy but I will warn you, you may have trouble getting your little one out of the tub/shower with this fun stuff! The package was delivered safely and before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> 4 year old grand daughter loves it. Probably my 5th pack. Keeps her busy in the shower and bath for a long time (for a four year old).</li>
            <li> The product does exactly what it says it does.  Lots of fun for my toddler during bath time.  Great fun!</li>
            <li> My grand-nephew loves to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; at bath time . Problem has always been that the shaving kits never had enough shaving cream to last but for 1 bath.This was perfect and even came with a bonus &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34;. Bought 2 packs of 2 and will need to reorder more very soon!!</li>
            <li> Son likes this to play with in bath but it is definitely not a soap</li>
            <li> my second grader loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> The Qualtiy is Great, the Delivery of my purchase was even better, I can not think of one bad thing to say? as a Quality Manager for a huge company I am very happy with the Price and Quality of my Purchase.</li>

            <li> My 2 year old twin grandsons love this soap. They get it in their eyes and it doesn&#x27;t sting. They play in the bathtub with it. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great iteam delivered right away, thank you.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the Mr. Bubbles foam soap.  We use it at every bath time.  I wish they made it in a larger size because we use so much of it and go through these bottles so fast.</li>
            <li> Great-grandson loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> These  are great I use them all the time for my two year old he love to play with the foam it even washes away after a week being on the wall I&#x27;ll say I have a new shower and tub those only proble not enough in a bottle and you can buy cheaper other stores</li>
            <li> my kids love this stuff! always a blast in the bath!</li>
            <li> This makes my grandkids love bathtime!  So much fun!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves playing with this in the bath. I actually just ordered some more for her. She doesn&#x27;t want to get out of the tub when she&#x27;s got her &amp;#34;pink and blue&amp;#34; to play with.</li>
            <li> This is great fun for the bath, and we&#x27;ve reordered several times.  The soap is scented to smell like blueberries and... Something fruity that I can&#x27;t quite figure out.  Good though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son dropped a package on my head when I was sleeping though and gave me a black eye that lasted for three weeks.  So beware.  When full, they pack a wallop.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that my daughter and her cousins would use everyday if I allowed them to. Endless times of fun as they enjoy taking a bath :) I gave it 3 stars though coz its quite expensive here in amazon. Buy it at target for half the cost.</li>
            <li> Our two year old grandson loves to squeeze out the foam and turn into bubbles.  Great fun.</li>
            <li> OMG! I couldn&#x27;t get my kids out of the tub with these!! Lol! I will have to buy these again this summer.</li>
