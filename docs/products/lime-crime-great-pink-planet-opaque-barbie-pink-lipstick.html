            <li>Perfect with any attire.</li>
            <li>but this is awesome makeup i would defiantly order somemore</li>
            <li>It is incredibly opaque tho.</li>
            <li>and it still looks great in both cases, it just rubs off and fades easier without using primer.  </li>
            <li>I have been totally happy and continue to do business with them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m so happy to have stumbled onto this line!!!!&lt;br</li>

            <li>I think Lime Crime makes a really great lipstick if you want unique colors.</li>
            <li>This was a very beautiful color i think the price is alittle high</li>
            <li>amazing :)</li>
            <li>True to colour!!</li>
            <li>The lipstick is moist and applies very smoothly.</li>
            <li>very cute unique color.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments from this lipstick, which I wear &amp;#34;every day.&amp;#34;  I am a&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;pink&amp;#34</li>
            <li>i just wasn&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
            <li>&quot; I fell in love with.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color.</li>
            <li>Is more puple in color and is not creamy.</li>
            <li>Pus, cute packaging.</li>
            <li>love the colors that lime crime carry...</li>
            <li>Love the color though...</li>
            <li>I LOVE this lipstick.</li>
            <li>honestly think it&#x27;s the perfect pink for me!</li>
            <li>Its the perfect Barbie pink</li>
            <li>lipstick goes on wayyy too smooth like it feels better than chapstick sometimes.  </li>
            <li>the word.almost appears flouresant.purchased Mac at the same time,very good product as well ,but very pleased with my Lime Crime.</li>
            <li>, surprisingly the Lime Crime Eyeshadow Helper primer works really well as a lip primer also.</li>
            <li>It came off easily but stained everything it touched, including my fingers, lips, and the washcloth I used to take it off.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too drying on my already easily parched lips.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product, my new favorite lipstick.</li>
            <li>The color payoff is great and I will definitely be wearing this all summer.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the texture is smooth and not tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supper creamy n smooth .</li>
            <li>Great color the very same on the photo.</li>
            <li>For the best results use a lip primer or a face primer on your lips prior to applying the lipstick (I just use a MAC face primer on my lips because it makes them super soft and it makes lipstick and lipgloss stay on FOREVER :) )</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick upon first application.  </li>
            <li>its appearance is sort of unique is</li>
            <li>love Lime Crime lipsticks, but it is always important to keep in mind that the pictures are rarely accurate to the color you&#x27;re really going to get.</li>
            <li>If you want a great light milky pink I would suggest this.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as too say that Lime Crime is my ultimate make up company, but it is in the top 5 and will remain a happy customer for years to come.  </li>
            <li>true, to picture.</li>
            <li>It is opaque and is true to color.</li>
            <li>Idk..if I payed as much as I would pay for a M.A.C. lipstick I would expect it to b more durable than that.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this color, but I&#x27;m guessing this is more for the fair-skinned girls.  </li>
            <li>It has good staying power, and I only have to touch it up every once in awhile.</li>
            <li>Tastes good and lasts long.</li>
            <li>I think this color would look great on very dark skinned people.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to worry too much if I accidentally lick my lips, but when I want it off a light scrub it all</li>
            <li>this one by far is the best pink and definitely deserves five stars :)</li>
            <li>This lipstick is BY FAR a better color.  </li>
            <li>It so worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I find myself reapplying pretty often to keep it looking fresh.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty tan</li>
            <li>I really like this lipstick color!</li>
            <li>Then I think that this is pretty close to it.</li>
            <li>Lime Crime Great Pink Planet lipstick is my new favorite pink lipstick!</li>
            <li>Also it came in super early.</li>
            <li>OK so MAC came out with a limited edition  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much...</li>
            <li>In summary, I LOVE this this pink lipstick (and also Coquette, which is a nude lipstick)</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this so much.</li>
            <li>Not so much for the paler shades.</li>
            <li>Was shipped out fast, no issues.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Really like this lipstick.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really mind that</li>
            <li>the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the outside of the lipstic like what its on the plastic feels really cheap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter than the picture</li>
            <li>/&gt;It isn&#x27;t too much lighter than what is shown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this gorgeous Barbie doll pink lipstick.</li>
            <li>but other than that the color is just like the pics and the actual product is great overall</li>
            <li>makes your lips that colour regardless of what colour your lips are naturally!!</li>
            <li>its not what i expected i thought it was going to be moisture as in make my lips look smooth</li>
            <li>&quot; It came and it is an obvious mauve or dark rose color, nowhere near as described.</li>
            <li>It has a very soft and creamy feeling.</li>
            <li>it cracked a little easily</li>
            <li>Would not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>Since I REALLY want to make this color work, I tried to put a clear gloss over the top to make it look a little less in-your-face, and it looks alright.  </li>
            <li>I kept that in mind and bought this lipstick thinking that as long as it was light pink, I wouldn&#x27;t fuss about it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re a person who presses the lipstick on, you haveee to be super careful because these are fragile.</li>
            <li>It was a little more on the bluish pink tone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m incredibly pale (as in I put white foundation in L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s light and coolest foundation shade in order to match my skin)</li>
            <li>(I actually ordered it directly from the Lime Crime website along with the Coquette lipstick.)</li>
            <li>This is a very milky Barbie pink color.</li>
            <li>The lipstick was dry and lumpy upon first application, I had to put chapstick on and THEN put down three layers of the GPP before it came anywhere near looking like the swatches shown by Lime Crime.</li>

            <li> I bought Great Pink Planet and was sorely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on long especially if u eat</li>
            <li> However, the color doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like</li>
            <li> Whenever I wear it everyone comments on how vibrantly pink it is, which really surprised me when I first wore it because I didn&#x27;t expect it to be super pink - mainly because of bad experiences from other pink lipsticks!  </li>
            <li> While I have heard wild rumors and speculation about this company, I have not had one ounce of trouble with the products, design, color payoff, quality and the like.  </li>
            <li> If your looking for something similar to nicki minaj pink Friday lipstick...</li>
            <li> As I said above I play with it, combining it with other lipsticks of mine etc.  TY.</li>
            <li> It wears well with my pink nail polish that I bought from OPI.  </li>
            <li> If I can compare it to any other lipstick I would compare it to the M.A.C. lipsticks because it feels just like them.</li>
            <li> It felt heavy and far too thick and cracked whenever I moved my lips.  </li>
            <li> and so I find it hard to find pinks that have blue undertones.</li>
            <li> This color is awful with my fair skin.</li>
            <li> On the lips, it really looks a little silly...</li>
            <li> I think the formula needs a little work.</li>
            <li> PS, my friend who owns a lot of Lime Crime lipsticks suggests to put Burt&#x27;s Bees on the bottom before applying and it may go on a little bit smoother.  </li>
            <li> Heatherette collection a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> im not a huge fan of lipgloss.</li>
            <li> I was not sure how this would look on me.</li>
            <li> I was not sure I could pull it off.</li>
            <li> It went very unsmoothly without a base gloss or lip balm, and the color just didn&#x27;t do it for me.  </li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to find deeply saturated \\&quot;mod\\&quot; looking lipstick anywhere.</li>
            <li> Completely disappointed and this item was expensive considering the brand.</li>
            <li> Some of their formulas need some work, but none of them are bad.</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed if you like the color on the photo</li>
            <li> how horrible it was and he was like &amp;#34;OH MY GOD!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I ordered it for the color which is close to what I was looking for but the price was outrageous.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I get so many compliments from this lipstick, which I wear &amp;#34;every day.&amp;#34;  I am a&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; person.  It wears well with my pink nail polish that I bought from OPI.  This will be my &amp;#34;go to color&amp;#34; for a lifetime.  Please keep stocking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much...</li>
            <li> its not what i expected i thought it was going to be moisture as in make my lips look smooth but it makes my lips look like it has cracks so i have to put lipgloss over it but it im not a huge fan of lipgloss. i just wasn&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
            <li> Lime Crime Great Pink Planet lipstick is my new favorite pink lipstick! (I actually ordered it directly from the Lime Crime website along with the Coquette lipstick.) Whenever I wear it everyone comments on how vibrantly pink it is, which really surprised me when I first wore it because I didn&#x27;t expect it to be super pink - mainly because of bad experiences from other pink lipsticks!  For the best results use a lip primer or a face primer on your lips prior to applying the lipstick (I just use a MAC face primer on my lips because it makes them super soft and it makes lipstick and lipgloss stay on FOREVER :) ), surprisingly the Lime Crime Eyeshadow Helper primer works really well as a lip primer also. I tried the lipstick with and without primer and it still looks great in both cases, it just rubs off and fades easier without using primer.  In summary, I LOVE this this pink lipstick (and also Coquette, which is a nude lipstick) so I definitely recommend Lime Crime lipstick because it actually does look like the swatches that they use to advertise!  I&#x27;ve used a lot of pricey lipsticks and this one by far is the best pink and definitely deserves five stars :)</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this so much. On the lips, it really looks a little silly...or maybe it&#x27;s just on me.  I think this color would look great on very dark skinned people.  Not so much for the paler shades.</li>
            <li> While I have heard wild rumors and speculation about this company, I have not had one ounce of trouble with the products, design, color payoff, quality and the like.

I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as too say that Lime Crime is my ultimate make up company, but it is in the top 5 and will remain a happy customer for years to come.  This lipstick is way out there in color and perfect for spring or summer.</li>
            <li> This is a very milky Barbie pink color. I think the formula needs a little work. It is incredibly opaque tho. I would suggest using a balm under this and maybe even a gloss over it. The color payoff is great and I will definitely be wearing this all summer. I think Lime Crime makes a really great lipstick if you want unique colors. Some of their formulas need some work, but none of them are bad. If you want a great light milky pink I would suggest this.</li>
            <li> OK so MAC came out with a limited edition  Heatherette collection a few years ago.  There was a lipstick called \\&quot;Melrose Mood\\&quot; I fell in love with.  It was a little more on the bluish pink tone.  This lipstick is BY FAR a better color.  It is almost impossible to find deeply saturated \\&quot;mod\\&quot; looking lipstick anywhere. Not to mention the texture is smooth and not tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy to have stumbled onto this line!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream sickle orange color is to die for as well</li>
            <li> Was shipped out fast, no issues. Love, love, love this product, my new favorite lipstick. I absolutely love this color. Perfect with any attire.</li>
            <li> True to colour!! makes your lips that colour regardless of what colour your lips are naturally!! sort of matte (not as shiny as picture)! Long lasting!! amazing :)</li>
            <li> Not color as shown on amazon. Darker and stains lips.Is more puple in color and is not creamy. Would not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> This color is awful with my fair skin. I think people with darker complexion could pull it off, but it looks like liquid pepto bismol on me. I put it on one time to show my boyfriend how horrible it was and he was like &amp;#34;OH MY GOD!&amp;#34; haha so.. if that says anything.</li>
            <li> Good product. Color wa true, to picture. Tastes good and lasts long. Was happy with my purchase. Would buy again. Pus, cute packaging.</li>
            <li> I was not sure how this would look on me. My inspiration was Nikki Minaj.  I was not sure I could pull it off. Let me just say...it&#x27;s fabulous. The lipstick is moist and applies very smoothly. It is opaque and is true to color. It does not have any \\&quot;shine\\&quot; to it, but that&#x27;s not what I wanted. I will buy this brand again. A GREAT find.</li>
            <li> Its the perfect Barbie pink it smells great. Also it came in super early. It so worth the money. I will definitely be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> Really like this lipstick. If I can compare it to any other lipstick I would compare it to the M.A.C. lipsticks because it feels just like them. It&#x27;s supper creamy n smooth . It doesn&#x27;t stay on long especially if u eat but if u just have it on with out eating it will stay kind of long.lol..bt I don&#x27;t really mind that....the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the outside of the lipstic like what its on the plastic feels really cheap it cracked a little easily I don&#x27;t even know how I just had it in my purse bt maybe that was my fault Idk..if I payed as much as I would pay for a M.A.C. lipstick I would expect it to b more durable than that. but other than that the color is just like the pics and the actual product is great overall</li>
            <li> Based on another review, product description, and picture, this color is supposed to be a \\&quot;Barbie Pink.\\&quot; It came and it is an obvious mauve or dark rose color, nowhere near as described. Completely disappointed and this item was expensive considering the brand.</li>
            <li> UGH!  I had such high hopes for this gorgeous Barbie doll pink lipstick. It went very unsmoothly without a base gloss or lip balm, and the color just didn&#x27;t do it for me.  I&#x27;m pretty tan and I figured that this color would compliment my skin tone, but it just looked like I got lip injections and didn&#x27;t flatter.  Since I REALLY want to make this color work, I tried to put a clear gloss over the top to make it look a little less in-your-face, and it looks alright.  I really wanted to like this color, but I&#x27;m guessing this is more for the fair-skinned girls.  PS, my friend who owns a lot of Lime Crime lipsticks suggests to put Burt&#x27;s Bees on the bottom before applying and it may go on a little bit smoother.  Happy lipstick shopping :)!</li>
            <li> very cute unique color.  lipstick goes on wayyy too smooth like it feels better than chapstick sometimes.  if you&#x27;re a person who presses the lipstick on, you haveee to be super careful because these are fragile.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick upon first application.  However, the color doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like and I find myself reapplying pretty often to keep it looking fresh.  I will probably purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really like this lipstick color! If your looking for something similar to nicki minaj pink Friday lipstick... Then I think that this is pretty close to it.</li>
            <li> Great color the very same on the photo. you will not be disappointed if you like the color on the photo</li>
            <li> Same as above for orange Rocket Opague lipstick.  As I said above I play with it, combining it with other lipsticks of mine etc.  TY.</li>
            <li> I bought Great Pink Planet and was sorely disappointed.  The lipstick was dry and lumpy upon first application, I had to put chapstick on and THEN put down three layers of the GPP before it came anywhere near looking like the swatches shown by Lime Crime. It felt heavy and far too thick and cracked whenever I moved my lips.  It came off easily but stained everything it touched, including my fingers, lips, and the washcloth I used to take it off.  Never buying Lime Crime lipsticks ever again.</li>
            <li> This was a very beautiful color i think the price is alittle high but this is awesome makeup i would defiantly order somemore love the colors that lime crime carry...</li>
            <li> I ordered it for the color which is close to what I was looking for but the price was outrageous. Love the color though...</li>
            <li> its appearance is sort of unique is the word.almost appears flouresant.purchased Mac at the same time,very good product as well ,but very pleased with my Lime Crime.</li>
            <li> Warning: It&#x27;s much lighter than the picture shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Lime Crime lipsticks, but it is always important to keep in mind that the pictures are rarely accurate to the color you&#x27;re really going to get. I kept that in mind and bought this lipstick thinking that as long as it was light pink, I wouldn&#x27;t fuss about it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t too much lighter than what is shown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly think it&#x27;s the perfect pink for me! I&#x27;m incredibly pale (as in I put white foundation in L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s light and coolest foundation shade in order to match my skin) and so I find it hard to find pinks that have blue undertones. I LOVE this lipstick. It has good staying power, and I only have to touch it up every once in awhile. It has a very soft and creamy feeling. It isn&#x27;t too drying on my already easily parched lips. I don&#x27;t need to worry too much if I accidentally lick my lips, but when I want it off a light scrub it all I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can think of is that when buying from Lime Crime, expect the lipstick colors to be slightly different from what you might expect.</li>
