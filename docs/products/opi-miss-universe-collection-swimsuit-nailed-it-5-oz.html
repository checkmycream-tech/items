            <li>This is such a GORGEOUS shade of blue..very striking!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a beautiful rich color!</li>
            <li>Everybody I came in contact with commented on how nice my nails were and people were surprised that blue looked so good!!</li>
            <li>To be honest this was a little too bright for me.</li>
            <li>This blue is really, really bright.</li>
            <li>If you like to wear bright colors I would definitely recommend it for you!!</li>
            <li>The color is true to the bottle.</li>
            <li>The best blue I&#x27;ve found - and I always wear blue on my toes.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s vibrant and has just enough sparkle and sass to be fun but still look good with everything.  </li>
            <li>&quot; This is a metallic looking blue, the glitter in it is VERY fine like a powder..</li>
            <li>That being said I do really like this color.</li>

            <li>I think it might look better with a little shorter nails.</li>
            <li>At the time I was wearing it I was wearing my nails pretty long.</li>
            <li>I laughed &amp; said \\&quot;sorry, but it&#x27;s MINE!\\</li>
            <li>It looks just like the vibrant blue cars.</li>

            <li> My review is for the OPI color: \\&quot;swimsuit..nailed it!\\&quot; Ladies, if you&#x27;re like me &amp; Blue is your fave color, you NEED this in your collection! This is such a GORGEOUS shade of blue..very striking! When i took it with me for my pedicure, the nail tech wanted to keep it for the shop..Lol! He did&#x27;nt want me taking it back home! I laughed &amp; said \\&quot;sorry, but it&#x27;s MINE!\\&quot; This is a metallic looking blue, the glitter in it is VERY fine like a powder..this is what gives it that metallic look. It&#x27;s very unique &amp; you&#x27;ll get compliments on it. It&#x27;s also fast drying &amp; long wearing. The picture does NOT do it justice!</li>
            <li> I think of the ocean every time I look at my nails.  Use a good base coat and good topcoat and you will be thrilled.</li>
            <li> This is a good color. It goes well with most outfits</li>
            <li> Love OPI and the color of this polish. It stood out and had a nice sparkle to it. Lasted nicely.</li>
            <li> I love this color, it&#x27;s awesome! My nail place said they couldn&#x27;t find it anymore but I&#x27;m glad that I could find a here now!</li>
            <li> Love the color and great for summer! I&#x27;m an OPI fan because of their great color selections, pricing, and quality.</li>
            <li> This color is shiny and great!  The best blue I&#x27;ve found - and I always wear blue on my toes.  I had to buy it after trying it at a salon.  I guess they don&#x27;t manufacture it anymore, so get it while it lasts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d normally never wear this blue... im in love with this color! It&#x27;s such a beautiful rich color! If u normally don&#x27;t wear this color, buy it anyway and wear it! U won&#x27;t be sorry! I recommend this polish and OPI to everyone...</li>
            <li> ok so i ordered the \\&quot;I nailed It \\&quot; swimsuit opi ive been waiting days for it so its been preparing for shipment and i go and check it today......... NOTHING THEY REMOVED MY ORDER. disappointed big time</li>
            <li> This nail polish really looks great on. The color is true to the bottle. You will need 2 coats. The only downside is that it left my nails slightly discolored when I removed it, but overall it is really wonderful. Everybody I came in contact with commented on how nice my nails were and people were surprised that blue looked so good!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color and so thankful that I was still able to purchase it since it is a discontinued color.  Thank you to the seller for getting it to me so quickly.</li>
            <li> Vibrant color and great quality! This is the blue I&#x27;ve been looking for. It looks just like the vibrant blue cars.</li>
            <li> Great color. Love It!</li>
            <li> This blue is really, really bright. I wore it one day and could not stop staring at my nails. If you want a color that stands out this is the color for you!! To be honest this was a little too bright for me. At the time I was wearing it I was wearing my nails pretty long. I think it might look better with a little shorter nails. That being said I do really like this color. If you like to wear bright colors I would definitely recommend it for you!!</li>
            <li> I wanted a polish in T.A.R.D.I.S. blue (Doctor Who), and this one is perfect. I can always depend on OPI to make a good product.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colors. Has a lot of depth.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and the item was as described the perfect condition unopened and unused. I would order any color I needed from them if I could. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love the look of this nail polish.  The blue is so vivid and will look great with some of my summer outfits.  Thank you for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I love this color and so does everyone who sees it.  It&#x27;s vibrant and has just enough sparkle and sass to be fun but still look good with everything.  This is the summer for color so enjoy it!</li>
