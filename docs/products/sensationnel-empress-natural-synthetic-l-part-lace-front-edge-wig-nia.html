            <li>Overall I&#x27;m super happy with it, I plan on ordering it in more colors.</li>
            <li>I ditched the cheap wigs and went to laces</li>
            <li>Good natural look when pulled up.</li>
            <li>The color is amazing not as bright as the picture which I liked since it look natural less wigy.</li>
            <li>I love these wigs so so much.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re such a good buy.</li>
            <li>Is this a full head wig</li>
            <li>Received it really quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my very first wig.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m personally not a fan of the L-part, but the quality of the hair is amazing.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because iUsed tweezers to make it look more natural..</li>
            <li>This wig is worth investing ladies and gents.</li>
            <li>The hair is super soft and full!</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more</li>
            <li>I will be ordering this wig in different colors my favorite</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pretty .</li>
            <li>but yea it&#x27;s exactly what</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super high maintance.</li>
            <li>Looks so real and so much volume!</li>
            <li>Going into my second month and giiirl its keeping strong.</li>
            <li>The shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy big hair then this is for you</li>
            <li>I cut it and used my real hair to cover</li>
            <li>OVER all I&#x27;m very please</li>
            <li>Everybody asked me if it was my real hair because of the L-Part.</li>
            <li>So I got this wig because of my short hair, and because I&#x27;m actually familiar with the wigs brands.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d look good in a blonde wig because of my tan skin and dark eyebrows, but holy muffintops</li>
            <li>so if you love three toned colored hair and full thick wigs then buy this</li>
            <li>It feels super soft and has not shed on me so far.</li>
            <li>True blonde as advertize</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more in different colors.</li>
            <li>but I could feel that it was a high quality wig for the price.</li>
            <li>My friends and family actually thought its human hair cus am used to human hair, but as a first synthetic i love the hair.</li>
            <li>I loved the length super long in the back, thick.</li>
            <li>Feels soft and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Mad cute!!</li>
            <li>Major difference.</li>
            <li>After the first month I find it easier to wash every other day to keep it moisturise</li>
            <li>Not too mention the shipping and delivery was MUCH quicker than I expected, so</li>
            <li>But unfortunately it got tangled very easily</li>

            <li> So soft a little fizzy but still</li>
            <li> I like it just to big for me and not really liking the bangs</li>
            <li> &amp; on my picture you&#x27;ll see that the part looks a little bigger ..</li>
            <li> it looks fabulous, I thought it would shed like crazy</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s minimal shedding</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s maybe 1 or even 2 bald spots , so be careful with that ..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to worry about if the cap showed or my actual have coming out ( I have long thick wavy hair).</li>
            <li> And it is extremely bulky which makes it looks wiggy</li>
            <li> Other than that ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve brought a few wig here and there</li>
            <li> Only giving it a 4 star because the bangs can get a little annoying if you don do anything with them.</li>
            <li> Only &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; bad thing</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate this wig because of the color.</li>

            <li> I love these wigs so so much. I can&#x27;t even describe. They&#x27;re such a good buy. They do get frizzy pretty quickly but it&#x27;s nothing a good conditioner can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> i love love love this hair! even though the color is too blonde for me. Received it really quick. Gonna order another one, this time to match my skin tone. lol</li>
            <li> So I got this wig because of my short hair, and because I&#x27;m actually familiar with the wigs brands. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d look good in a blonde wig because of my tan skin and dark eyebrows, but holy muffintops it looks fabulous, I thought it would shed like crazy but nope it has stayed intact and beautiful. I got it yesterday and wore it to work and got so many compliments from customers. It&#x27;s awesome finding a great wig like this one. Not too mention the shipping and delivery was MUCH quicker than I expected, so that&#x27;s awesome. For anyone considering buying this do it, I absolutely love it, it&#x27;s definitely my favorite wig at the moment and I have many. Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy big hair then this is for you</li>
            <li> I love it its beautiful I&#x27;ll always buy my wigs from her always she deserves my money I brought this same blonde wig on the 6th it come this morning on the 8th its beautiful sexy in looks great on its not as bright as the picture that&#x27;s because the girl in the picture has a lot of light on the hair but I love it its full looks real in feel great I will be ordering this wig in different colors my favorite she&#x27;s awesome thank you very much</li>
            <li> Mad cute!! The piece is light and the curls still held up nice once i got it wet.&lt;br /&gt;For the question I received on what piece was what color, I&#x27;ve taken a picture of the chart that came with the piece.</li>
            <li> Is this a full head wig</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair I luv the length of it!!!!</li>
            <li> I ditched the cheap wigs and went to laces and Oh my Oh my thank gosh I did.  Major difference. I cut it and used my real hair to cover and it&#x27;s flawless. I so recommend. The quality is amaaaazing. True blonde as advertize and it&#x27;s super high maintance. Going into my second month and giiirl its keeping strong. I braided it at nights from keeping un matted. After the first month I find it easier to wash every other day to keep it moisturise and it&#x27;s easy because its curly. Good natural look when pulled up. OVER all I&#x27;m very please and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more in different colors.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate this wig because of the color. And it is extremely bulky which makes it looks wiggy so if you love three toned colored hair and full thick wigs then buy this but if not save your money.</li>
            <li> Love it.! It&#x27;s really pretty . Only &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; bad thing iCan say about it.. When u look through the wig you&#x27;ll see there&#x27;s maybe 1 or even 2 bald spots , so be careful with that .. Other than that .. Great !:) 4 stars !&lt;br /&gt;Oh &amp; it sends a wig cap !! &amp; on my picture you&#x27;ll see that the part looks a little bigger .. That&#x27;s because iUsed tweezers to make it look more natural..</li>
            <li> This wig is just perfect. I have bought it for a costume but I could feel that it was a high quality wig for the price. Everybody asked me if it was my real hair because of the L-Part.</li>
            <li> Looks big when put on. Like I gain about 4 inches in height. But can&#x27;t complain on the quality. Really good wig!</li>
            <li> I love this to death! I thought it was a regular wig but it&#x27;s not and I&#x27;m okay with that because it&#x27;s amazing ! So soft a little fizzy but still so good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve brought a few wig here and there but this one is the best! I loved the length super long in the back, thick. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about if the cap showed or my actual have coming out ( I have long thick wavy hair). The color is amazing not as bright as the picture which I liked since it look natural less wigy. This wig is worth investing ladies and gents. But it doesn&#x27;t come with a wig cap like some wigs though. Hope this review help.</li>
            <li> Looks so real and so much volume! And ik how it is when u read these they never sound real but yea it&#x27;s exactly what I</li>
            <li> Yesssss maam or sir who ever....This hair is the $hit! It should come wit toilet paper baby boo! Love it</li>
            <li> Only giving it a 4 star because the bangs can get a little annoying if you don do anything with them. But overall, she&#x27;s beautiful!</li>
            <li> I loved the hair,got plenty of compliments.Came on time,I will order again.Here&#x27;s what it looked like on me :)</li>
            <li> I really loved this wig while it lasted. But unfortunately it got tangled very easily and I tried my best to keep it up.</li>
            <li> I love this wig and I will buy another one</li>
