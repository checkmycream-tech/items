    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent for thinning edges</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with the result</li>
            <li>Really happy for this on.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with this product.</li>
            <li>The peppermint shampoo is great too.</li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t smell too great either, if you accidentally smell it.  </li>
            <li>It has been successful in controlling the scalp itch, but I know it will be a bit longer before I can confirm whether it promotes hair growth.  </li>
            <li>I put it in a fine mist spray bottle and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Iam known for my amazing hair... until is started falling out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been suffering from a bald spot for a while now, and before I went to look at hair transplants, I wanted to see if any kind of hair product could help.</li>
            <li>I am growing new hair.&amp;#34; She replied, &amp;#34;That is great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing more for sure!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>In addition, my scalp has been more than a tad bit tender.  </li>
            <li>I should have known better</li>
            <li>Immediately my hair appeared to be thicker and have more body.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this for two weeks, but it is great!  </li>
            <li>unless otherwise stated in the instructions which I could not read, I don&#x27;t think it is safe to use.</li>
            <li>Like many men my age I have been fighting the battle of thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>Its alright work pretty good.</li>
            <li>went well, and my hair is strong</li>
            <li>Thank you Natural First, keep up the good job!</li>
            <li>, I have light fine hair.</li>
            <li>The application is gentle to the scalp and has a nice after smell.</li>
            <li>I have started using it and seems to be good with all natural ingredients...</li>
            <li>First packaging should be better with a product that liquid.</li>
            <li>first I did not think it will work, but I can say, I am totally satisfied now.&lt;br /&gt;Everything</li>
            <li>This product burned my scalp to a bright red.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel good when what I offer actually helps people!</li>
            <li>It makes my scalp feel good, and I am seeing slight hair growth in areas where I had significant hair loss!  </li>
            <li>He said He started to notice quickly as well.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>It has a consistency of water &amp; I have used an entire bottle hoping for a change &amp; if anything lost more than gaining any!</li>
            <li>Second the tincture has a musty smell to it like it has sat too long or is being stored at temperatures it should not be.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure people have had great progress after using this</li>
            <li>I have tried almost everything out there and definitely have had amazing results.  </li>
            <li>if it does have oils in it, then definitely a minuscule amount that would not be effective for what it claims.  </li>
            <li>I did have some bumps on my scalp at first, but those have gone away</li>
            <li>is my first review on the product.  </li>
            <li>This is not an overnight solution so if that&#x27;s what you are looking for keep looking, but if you are willing to give it time you should see results.</li>
            <li>only thing I will say is I use much more than &amp;#34;one or two drops&amp;#34; which the directions recommend.  </li>
            <li>Fast ship too!</li>
            <li>I have been searching and trying out so many hair growth products and this actually works!!!</li>
            <li>This collection of oils has reduced the inflammation to my scalp somewhat, which is great for a 11 dollar product, while also appearing to stimulate new small hair follicles in places that did not have them before</li>
            <li>business partners asked what expensive stuff I use, I just said it&#x27;s a cheap buy an amazing one!</li>
            <li>I had tried the pure Rosemary extract oil, no luck.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is pure liquid like water, so</li>
            <li>I only went by the positive reviews &amp; that was a huge mistake.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>but hey, ya gotta buy the snake oil once in a while as a reminder that they really don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Searching for something that will really work on me.</li>
            <li>Very watery.  </li>
            <li>I thought,&amp;#34;Is this really possible?&amp;#34; or, &amp;#34;Am</li>
            <li>Really stripped my hair.  </li>
            <li>After 8 weeks of use, I mentioned to my wife, &amp;#34;This Natural First stuff is really working.</li>
            <li>Natural First Hair Growth Tincture works.</li>
            <li>I just imagining this?&amp;#34; After 4-5 weeks of use, I knew that I was not imagining anything--I WAS GROWING NEW HAIR!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>After 2-3 weeks of use I began to see that each hair follicle was indeed thicker, and I began to see some fuzzy new hair growth.</li>
            <li>She said, &amp;#34;YOU ARE GROWING NEW</li>
            <li>This is to promote growth of my hair due to the red spots which reduces the amount of healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Your hair really does seem thicker.&amp;#34; She then got up real close and carefully inspected my head.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a sealer on the top when you unscrew the cap they could have at least put some tap around it so it would not leak.</li>
            <li>It works and it give me a natural feel.  </li>
            <li>I used this on my eyebrows and hair as an attempt to grow and not only noticed faster hair growth but my hair doesn&#x27;t break as much</li>
            <li>Knowing she would only use a product with no harsh ingredients or chemicals, I bought her this tincture since it&#x27;s made with natural herbs.</li>
            <li>The question of saving your hair is a delicate one, and the tendency is to do everything possible to save it, so this product in a sea of others has been a pleasant surprise- at little risk as well.</li>
            <li>My bottle was 75% full, its already a small bottle and the instructions were soaked and smudged.</li>

            <li> I even tried castor oil with some other natural ingredients, no luck.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few months now since my mom first started noticing her hair thinning a little.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time per bottle.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for my edges, no change at all no new growth at all</li>
            <li> will post an update a little later about the product.  </li>
            <li> I noticed no scent which also suggests there is little to no essential oils.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff for my uncle a few months back</li>
            <li> I had to put it into an empty spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Natural First Hair Growth Promoter Tincture is a new weapon in my arsenal to combat, retard and now reverse that trend.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it three days so far to assist with a seriously itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> but it seems I will never know because due to the smell</li>
            <li> will buy an other one, because I used all, and I like the result!&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I had her on the phone the other day, she told me that by the way, she was amazed by the results of this tincture and asked me to get her other bottles!</li>
            <li> I am not sure the inventor of this product is probably just creating different profiles trying to sell this amateur product created with some tap water.</li>
            <li> I used this religiously everyday.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy anything without researching about it or reading the ingredients.</li>
            <li> no magic happened.</li>
            <li> Also, the packaging is not tamper resistance, so it seems amateur like something someone made in their bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works because I don&#x27;t like using it.</li>
            <li> I received it today and when I opened it I saw that it was packaged in a small Ziploc baggie and</li>
            <li> Not sure ifit did grow my hair...</li>
            <li> Although when desperate needs call for desperate measures &amp; then these important factors are over looked.</li>
            <li> and I hardly ever shed anymore while showering.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My issue for the last few weeks has been an extremely itchy scalp (no flakes/dandruff), resulting in my scratching until my hair is breaking off something awful.  </li>
            <li> The directions says use a few drops but the bottle it comes it makes it impossible to &#x27;&#x27;use a few drops&amp;#34; and manage to cover the area you need to cover-plus it drips.</li>
            <li> It really disappointing, and I am sorry I wasted like 10 dollars that could have gone to something else, on this damn thing. :</li>
            <li> I have come to realize o have been rubbing some random water on my head all along &amp;</li>
            <li> Please trust me when I say this do not fall for the so called hair growing review, you will be highly disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month or so now and I&#x27;ve seen hair growth...I put it in a fine mist spray bottle and it works perfectly. I did have some bumps on my scalp at first, but those have gone away and I try to use it overnight before bed. I&#x27;ll be purchasing more for sure!&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have light fine hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for my edges, no change at all no new growth at all</li>
            <li> 12/26/14&lt;br /&gt;This is my first review on the product.  My issue for the last few weeks has been an extremely itchy scalp (no flakes/dandruff), resulting in my scratching until my hair is breaking off something awful.  In addition, my scalp has been more than a tad bit tender.  I had tried the pure Rosemary extract oil, no luck.  I even tried castor oil with some other natural ingredients, no luck.  Regular shampooing throughout the week is always a plus, but it did not resolve my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it three days so far to assist with a seriously itchy scalp.  It has been successful in controlling the scalp itch, but I know it will be a bit longer before I can confirm whether it promotes hair growth.  However, with my no longer scratching my scalp nonstop, that automatically promotes growth by eliminating hair breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post an update a little later about the product.  I&#x27;m also planning to try out their Apple Cider Vinegar shampoo and rinse.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff for my uncle a few months back and I just saw him recently - his hair is growing back! He said He started to notice quickly as well. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Excellent for thinning edges</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from a bald spot for a while now, and before I went to look at hair transplants, I wanted to see if any kind of hair product could help. This did the trick! It&#x27;s been about a month now, and I am finally seeing the beginning of hair growth! I don&#x27;t know if this will work for everyone, but I would definitely try it out before going after something more expensive.</li>
            <li> Nope. This did absolutely nothing. I should have known better but hey, ya gotta buy the snake oil once in a while as a reminder that they really don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have started using it and seems to be good with all natural ingredients...</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen any changes</li>
            <li> I use this together with their shampoo. I apply it twice a week immediately after bath. This is to promote growth of my hair due to the red spots which reduces the amount of healthy hair. The application is gentle to the scalp and has a nice after smell. I like this product and have tried for a month. Will continue to use and monitor.</li>
            <li> I was facing problem with my hair falling. Searching for something that will really work on me. Finally it worked. Really happy for this on. Deserve five star. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i felt it somewhat tingly..</li>
            <li> Its alright work pretty good.</li>
            <li> This product burned my scalp to a bright red.</li>
            <li> DO NOT PURCHASE this product. I usually don&#x27;t buy anything without researching about it or reading the ingredients. Although when desperate needs call for desperate measures &amp; then these important factors are over looked. It has a consistency of water &amp; I have used an entire bottle hoping for a change &amp; if anything lost more than gaining any! I only went by the positive reviews &amp; that was a huge mistake. I am not sure the inventor of this product is probably just creating different profiles trying to sell this amateur product created with some tap water. Please trust me when I say this do not fall for the so called hair growing review, you will be highly disappointed. I have come to realize o have been rubbing some random water on my head all along &amp; no magic happened. Save your time &amp; money &amp; don&#x27;t bother purchasing this product WHAT SO EVER!</li>
            <li> I have tried almost everything out there and definitely have had amazing results.  This is not an overnight solution so if that&#x27;s what you are looking for keep looking, but if you are willing to give it time you should see results. My itchy scalp has cleared up and hair is filling in where it was thinning.  It has taken 6 months but it is working.  I use it 3x a week, overnight before washing hair in the morning.  Be PATIENT and give it a a try.  Just wish it came in a larger size!</li>
            <li> Anyone who has worked with essential oils knows that they have an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; like consistency.  This stuff is pure liquid like water, so if it does have oils in it, then definitely a minuscule amount that would not be effective for what it claims.  Also, the packaging is not tamper resistance, so it seems amateur like something someone made in their bathroom.  I noticed no scent which also suggests there is little to no essential oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product and also the one with aloe Vera and I&#x27;m very happy with the result</li>
            <li> Very watery.  I&#x27;m not sure if it works because I don&#x27;t like using it.</li>
            <li> Thisworks well. My hair stylist asked What was I using, i have peach fuzz in My thinning spots.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this product. Immediately my hair appeared to be thicker and have more body. After 2-3 weeks of use I began to see that each hair follicle was indeed thicker, and I began to see some fuzzy new hair growth. I thought,&amp;#34;Is this really possible?&amp;#34; or, &amp;#34;Am I just imagining this?&amp;#34; After 4-5 weeks of use, I knew that I was not imagining anything--I WAS GROWING NEW HAIR! After 8 weeks of use, I mentioned to my wife, &amp;#34;This Natural First stuff is really working. I am growing new hair.&amp;#34; She replied, &amp;#34;That is great! Your hair really does seem thicker.&amp;#34; She then got up real close and carefully inspected my head. She said, &amp;#34;YOU ARE GROWING NEW HAIR!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else can I say? Natural First Hair Growth Tincture works. It lasts a long time per bottle. The peppermint shampoo is great too. I also use the thickening serum and will be writing separate reviews on those products as well.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for two weeks, but it is great!  It makes my scalp feel good, and I am seeing slight hair growth in areas where I had significant hair loss!  I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I used it every night and see NO Difference! Will not purchase again</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this product. I received it today and when I opened it I saw that it was packaged in a small Ziploc baggie and the instructions were on the inside of the bag. First packaging should be better with a product that liquid. If you don&#x27;t have a sealer on the top when you unscrew the cap they could have at least put some tap around it so it would not leak. My bottle was 75% full, its already a small bottle and the instructions were soaked and smudged. Second the tincture has a musty smell to it like it has sat too long or is being stored at temperatures it should not be.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure people have had great progress after using this but it seems I will never know because due to the smell unless otherwise stated in the instructions which I could not read, I don&#x27;t think it is safe to use.</li>
            <li> I used this religiously everyday. I saw no growth in my hair what so ever. The product didn&#x27;t even make my hair even shinier/healthier looking. The directions says use a few drops but the bottle it comes it makes it impossible to &#x27;&#x27;use a few drops&amp;#34; and manage to cover the area you need to cover-plus it drips. I had to put it into an empty spray bottle. I doesn&#x27;t smell too great either, if you accidentally smell it.  It really disappointing, and I am sorry I wasted like 10 dollars that could have gone to something else, on this damn thing. :((&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck to those who still want to try it out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in conjunction with propecia and have begun to see some independent results. This collection of oils has reduced the inflammation to my scalp somewhat, which is great for a 11 dollar product, while also appearing to stimulate new small hair follicles in places that did not have them before (propecia doesn&#x27;t do this).  The question of saving your hair is a delicate one, and the tendency is to do everything possible to save it, so this product in a sea of others has been a pleasant surprise- at little risk as well.</li>
            <li> I used this product and it was like using water.  I tried it for a month and I just felt ripped off.  Maybe it works for others but it did nothing for me.  My rating is 1 star.  This was my experience with this product.</li>
            <li> Like many men my age I have been fighting the battle of thinning hair.  Natural First Hair Growth Promoter Tincture is a new weapon in my arsenal to combat, retard and now reverse that trend.  I am beginning to feel and see the results with my hair gradually filling out since I started using this product.  It works and it give me a natural feel.  It is not just a boost in my hair, it has given me a boost in my confidence as well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it.. No difference after completed 2 bottles</li>
            <li> I used this on my eyebrows and hair as an attempt to grow and not only noticed faster hair growth but my hair doesn&#x27;t break as much and I hardly ever shed anymore while showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I will say is I use much more than &amp;#34;one or two drops&amp;#34; which the directions recommend.  It is not oily at all so it doesn&#x27;t spread. I went through one bottle in about 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Can visibly see it&#x27;s working!! Fast ship too!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t  do anything  for my hair</li>
            <li> I have no words to describe!&lt;br /&gt;As first I did not think it will work, but I can say, I am totally satisfied now.&lt;br /&gt;Everything went well, and my hair is strong again!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy an other one, because I used all, and I like the result!&lt;br /&gt;My business partners asked what expensive stuff I use, I just said it&#x27;s a cheap buy an amazing one!</li>
            <li> I have been searching and trying out so many hair growth products and this actually works!!! I have been struggling with a sluggish hair growth rate for quite some time and this was just what I needed. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results while using this. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product has provided a lot of growth since I have bought it. I will buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> No difference.  Just bought it make my hair grow faster. I don&#x27;t know what it has done?</li>
            <li> Not sure ifit did grow my hair...</li>
            <li> Really stripped my hair.  It may work but it made my hair like straw.  I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Iam known for my amazing hair... until is started falling out.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily i found this, it works like magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying this again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few months now since my mom first started noticing her hair thinning a little. Knowing she would only use a product with no harsh ingredients or chemicals, I bought her this tincture since it&#x27;s made with natural herbs. When I had her on the phone the other day, she told me that by the way, she was amazed by the results of this tincture and asked me to get her other bottles! It makes me feel good when what I offer actually helps people! Thank you Natural First, keep up the good job!</li>
