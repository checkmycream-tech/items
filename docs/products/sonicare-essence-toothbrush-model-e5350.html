            <li>Great price, great sonic cleaning.</li>
            <li>We were happy with them, so I found what I thought was the replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Looks like a great deal, but within 2 years, it will be junk.  </li>
            <li>The sonicare is great for toothbrushing, however I have noticed that it is strongest after a charge.</li>
            <li>This set is good for 2 in 1 bathroom...</li>

            <li>Buy Philips Sonicare products at your own risk.</li>
            <li>Honestly the pictures and the write up describe one charger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for many years and my teeth have been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>These things do great the first 3 months after owning about 6 months</li>
            <li>stars for the first 3 months being great.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes have excellent sonic vibration and really feel like they&#x27;re getting your teeth clean.   </li>
            <li>I got these for my kids, they love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li>I have used sonicare for many years</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I spend more time cleaning this toothbrush, than cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>Philips is so CHEAP !  </li>
            <li>Seems ok for now.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure they&#x27;d get used to it, but they did within days.  </li>
            <li>But I love the way it feels now.  </li>
            <li>They love it too.</li>
            <li>I bought the Sonicare toothbrush for my parents since I already have one and love it.</li>
            <li>Much better than any manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>you do that you are OK;</li>
            <li>you can get one more brush out of it.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing to get home and use the Sonicare again.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>They replaced it, but with another model, which they said at the time was better.</li>
            <li>I love Sonicare electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention.</li>

            <li>great customer service and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>MY DAUGHTER &amp; HUSBAND JUST LOVE THE BRUSH TOO, SAYS IT MAKES THEIR MOUTHS FEEL SO CLEAN!  </li>
            <li>Our teeth are so clean now!  </li>
            <li>My husband and I loved it so much we bought one for our daughter and son-in-law.  </li>
            <li>The Oral B was not as strong nor thorough as the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>holds the charge strong even after 2 years.</li>
            <li>Now if they can come up with a good usable stand that will hold them instead of a little cheap piece of plastic, I will be really happy.  </li>
            <li>Works perfectly and holds a charge for quite a while longer than the two previous units we have owned.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a worthy investment!</li>
            <li>Seems sorta cheap of Philips to make two power units one with and one without the pacer.</li>
            <li>the recharge light starts</li>
            <li>Had  bought this 2+ years ago somewhere other than Amazon and was for the most part happy.  </li>
            <li>The yellow has diminished after 10 brushings, and my teeth and gums feel simply amazing!</li>
            <li>TOO FUNNY :)  </li>
            <li>I priced these at several sites and at my dentist who also sells them and this was by far this best place to buy.  </li>
            <li>I called them about the problem,they told me how to clean the head and sent me a one time replacement.</li>
            <li>No doubt after you brush with it your mouth feels as clean as ever.</li>
            <li>AND TEETH AND GUMS FEEL REALLY CLEAN.  </li>
            <li>You also need to take the toothbrush apart after every use and clean out the treads.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>There is no doubt that Philips knew full well they were sending me a junk product that they were clearing out of their warehouse because they had to get rid of them.     </li>
            <li>Sonicares in the past have been very good.</li>
            <li>My husband and I are very pleased with this product and actually look forward to the brushing experience--feels like we just stepped out of the hygienist&#x27;s office!  </li>
            <li>I did the research and liked the reviews of this toothbrush plus the back that it uses ultrasonic movement of the brush head.</li>
            <li>I owned an old Sonicare for many years.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s interesting is that I had inadvertently called the professional customer service line (for dentists and the like)</li>
            <li>Best solution for Philips would be to offer only the quadpacer or make sure it is clear that other units don&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li>Time will tell if I made the right decision.</li>
            <li>I use the old Advanced model so I can&#x27;t compare but now that the same heads fit both models I will be able to test one when I get a new head.</li>
            <li>The first time my kids used the brushes they screamed at the speed of the vibrations.  </li>
            <li>JUST UPGRADED FROM THE OLD SONICARE ADVANCED.  </li>
            <li>The biggest plus factor for us is we finally were able to get to the gum line our dentist was always talking about.</li>
            <li>The first is that they don&#x27;t have the timer feature I&#x27;d come to expect.</li>
            <li>Interestingly, I had a Sonicare 8 years ago and it suffered from the same problem.</li>
            <li>It also seemed natural to be sure that my kids would have the same quality clean.  </li>
            <li>Teeth will feel cleaner, positively.</li>
            <li>I thought I was buying two complete full sized toothbrushes, with brushes and chargers.</li>
            <li>Of course the new brush was purposely made not to fit the old recharger -- planned obsolescence.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for your site.</li>
            <li>But very upset that nowhere did it tell me it did&#x27;t have the quadpacer unit.</li>
            <li>Very invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow</li>
            <li>I did not think much of this at the time</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the quad pacer option, but I don&#x27;t really need that anyway.</li>
            <li>I have a real problem with plaque.</li>
            <li>They run for two minutes straight and turn off, so you need to count in your head or whatnot to cover all areas.</li>
            <li>I AM A RETIRED DENTAL ASSISTANT, WORKED FOR 40 YEARS &amp; LOVED IT, I SPENT THE LAST 27 YESRS OF MY CAREER WORKING FOR A PERIODONTIST, AND WE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ALL OF OUR PATIENTS TO USE THE SONICARE</li>
            <li>We used to have the other battery operated ones, this is much much better.</li>
            <li>I normally take a regular tooth brush on trips and my teeth don&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li>I had another, older unit.  </li>
            <li>, THE 14 YEAR OLD IS IN BRACES &amp; HIS ORTHODONTIST SAYS THERE IS A MUCH IMPROVED ORAL HYGIENE IN HIM.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t know how long we&#x27;d be willing to keep that up, but we love our sonicare cleanings so much that it feels natural now to deal with a small amount of hassle.  </li>
            <li>After five years, I purchased a new one.</li>
            <li>We have had our Sonic Care rechargeable for eight or so years and they are having a time holding a charge so we are getting NEW Sonic Care toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Call me lazy, but I really liked when my old toothbrush buzzed every 30 seconds to tell me when to move to the next quadrant.  </li>
            <li>THE SMALLER HEAD GETS IN TIGHT PLACES BETTER</li>
            <li>I bought the Sonicare e5350 and WOW, what a difference.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t possibly be that much cost differential.</li>
            <li>It comes with two adult heads</li>
            <li>After my boyfriend&#x27;s old Sonicare stopped working</li>
            <li>maybe someone wil read this before it is posted and take some action.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used an earlier model of this for many years, and each of them is starting to go down hill, not charging.</li>
            <li>we recently had to buy a new one and did not hesitate to buy another.  </li>
            <li>Occasionally we must buy new ones.</li>
            <li>The handle is larger than my last one, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter anyway.</li>
            <li>Dropping the brush on the tile floor was a negative I must admit, but I was able to snap it back together :-|</li>
            <li>Clearly, there is one company line for dentists who shill these things and get freebies for their staffs, and another company line for consumers who actually buy them.</li>
            <li>tHE 11 YEAR OLD GETS HER BRACES NEXT MONTH</li>
            <li>This despite the fact that it was only nine months old and had a documented history of failures.</li>
            <li>After 1.1 to 2.0 years, the NiCad (aka NiCd or nickel-cadmium) batteries can no longer hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no clear way to open the casing to change the batteries, just a small groove at the top after you remove the brush head.  </li>
            <li>Once it loses its post-charge zest, it won&#x27;t diminish significantly until the battery is completed used, so perhaps this is the optimal speed.</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;feeling\\&quot; goes away after a little while and you won&#x27;t believe how much cleaner your teeth feel.</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t possibly be that much cost differential.</li>
            <li> It comes with two adult heads</li>
            <li> After my boyfriend&#x27;s old Sonicare stopped working</li>
            <li> maybe someone wil read this before it is posted and take some action.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used an earlier model of this for many years, and each of them is starting to go down hill, not charging.</li>
            <li> we recently had to buy a new one and did not hesitate to buy another.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally we must buy new ones.</li>
            <li> The handle is larger than my last one, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter anyway.</li>
            <li> Dropping the brush on the tile floor was a negative I must admit, but I was able to snap it back together :-|</li>
            <li> Clearly, there is one company line for dentists who shill these things and get freebies for their staffs, and another company line for consumers who actually buy them.</li>
            <li> tHE 11 YEAR OLD GETS HER BRACES NEXT MONTH</li>
            <li> This despite the fact that it was only nine months old and had a documented history of failures.</li>
            <li> After 1.1 to 2.0 years, the NiCad (aka NiCd or nickel-cadmium) batteries can no longer hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no clear way to open the casing to change the batteries, just a small groove at the top after you remove the brush head.  </li>
            <li> Once it loses its post-charge zest, it won&#x27;t diminish significantly until the battery is completed used, so perhaps this is the optimal speed.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;feeling\\&quot; goes away after a little while and you won&#x27;t believe how much cleaner your teeth feel.</li>
            <li> After a few uses it become less powerful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what took so long.</li>
            <li> I started using Sonicare brushes so long ago, I can&#x27;t remember when ?</li>
            <li> It seems unthinkable to return to manual toothbrushes...ever!  </li>
            <li> You know guys a little extra holder that FASTENS to the charger to hold the second brush?</li>
            <li> As the warranty had expired I was forced to buy a new toothbrush,  I bought another sonicare but this time one that should not allow water to get in.  </li>
            <li> So, you either need to charge daily, or accept a less vigorous scrub.</li>
            <li> Dr. Katz tooth paste the first round, (with very little water), then Biotene, (with lots of water), the second round!</li>
            <li> I noticed my teeth were a little yellow,</li>
            <li> I would probably rate this package as a 3.5 due to the single charger.</li>
            <li> Keep your mouth closed and just glide the brush to each tooth.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare broke a few years back</li>
            <li> I was sorry I did, I saved about $20-$30 but did not think it was worth it at all.  </li>
            <li> so I got it and only had to wait a few days to get it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no way to open the HX5300 series toothbrush&#x27;s case to replace the batteries without destroying it.  </li>
            <li> Just a bit annoying that my husband and I have to trade off charging days, but to be honest they probably don&#x27;t need to be charged as often as I imagine.   </li>
            <li> Basically the seal where the toothbrush neck meets the wide part is not a complete seal so that when you brush the water/toothpaste mixtures runs down the handle and gets into the cavity.</li>
            <li> I heated it with a hot air dryer and pushed the somewhat softened plastic of the bas outward to make room for the slightly larger base of the new brush.  </li>
            <li> In the process of very carefully trying to expose the batteries to replace them, several very thin and delicate connections (some of them soldered in) will be severed, turning the unit into a complete piece of trash that needs to be disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner.  </li>
            <li> The previous one went for 2 minutes, and had a little break every 30 seconds to tell you that it was time to switch to the next quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li> My last one was starting to get weak</li>
            <li> I would rate the Sonicare as a 4 due to the variance in brush power.</li>
            <li> I owned 2 sets of Sonicare and both of them failed and broken right after a little over a year of normal uses.</li>
            <li> After two minutes brushing it beeps to let you know you are done, and can do an extra minute of hard areas.   </li>
            <li> No doubt it will save us pain/money down the road.  </li>
            <li> How Stupid, how lazy, how cheap!  </li>
            <li> A little noisy..</li>
            <li> But the fact remains that my junk replacement unit failed and the guy I spoke with knew exactly what I was talking about and could describe the failure.</li>
            <li> Some people have a little trouble getting used to the vibration on their teeth.</li>
            <li> But I got it to fit by expanding the base.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses I could already tell the difference in quality and reach between the two brushes.  </li>
            <li> a few minutes before that call.</li>
            <li> but I recently learned that this then leaked into the unit causing it to fail.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint was that gunk and water gets in between where the brush screws on.  </li>
            <li> When I tried to get in touch with Amazon, there was no e-addres where you could make a complaint until now.</li>
            <li> So here is my complaint</li>
            <li> Teeth are at least somewhat brighter.</li>
            <li> Also, this package only includes one charger, which is inconvenient.      </li>
            <li> When I told them what I had been told by the other guy, the response was that he was wrong, that no one at Philips would ever say that.</li>
            <li> The replacement has now failed after a few months.</li>
            <li> This company sells the 2-brush set with only one - count it, one - recharging base.  </li>
            <li> Even the Sonicare for kids is also broken.</li>
            <li> Even so, I continued on, so that others may see how poorly designed this product is.  </li>
            <li> Philips writes in the manual that comes with this thing that one should not use the recharging base from an other model with this unit.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry for this purchase.</li>
            <li> That handle is useless.  </li>
            <li> It failed in a year.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for an electric toothbrush you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It would appear that Philips doesn&#x27;t mind building a product that they know will be useless in 2 years, after the warranty has expired of course.  </li>
            <li> Geez, it felt crazy to me too.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see having to buy two handles then receiving the product and having it be bad from the start.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed at Sonicare product quality.  </li>
            <li> Got so used to having the toothbrush tell me when to switch it is annoying to have to count the seconds now.    </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> the brush heads are SO EXPENSIVE!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got these for my kids, they love &#x27;em. Since they are using the same bathroom one charger is sufficient. I use the old Advanced model so I can&#x27;t compare but now that the same heads fit both models I will be able to test one when I get a new head.</li>
            <li> Throw all of your toothbrushes away, even your Oral-B piece of poo. Sonicare makes your teeth feel smoother and cleaner than they ever have in your entire life. This toothbrush has literally prevented and reduced cavities in my teeth. That says something. I will forever be the biggest advocate of this brush. I think EVERYONE should own one.</li>
            <li> I have used sonicare for many years and I love it.  My wife is now using one since this purchase and she is now hooked.  I priced these at several sites and at my dentist who also sells them and this was by far this best place to buy.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great toothbrush at a great price. Thanks Amazon for your site.</li>
            <li> I spend more time cleaning this toothbrush, than cleaning my teeth.They should discontinue this model. I called them about the problem,they told me how to clean the head and sent me a one time replacement. It continues to fill up with mold and yuck, I have to use a q-tip to get all the mold out. I would not recommend anyone buying this model.</li>
            <li> I went to the dentist last week and had some work done on my teeth, my dentist recommended this toothbrush. I noticed my teeth were a little yellow, (I&#x27;m a coffee drinker). I bought the Sonicare e5350 and WOW, what a difference. The yellow has diminished after 10 brushings, and my teeth and gums feel simply amazing! Walmart had it for 111.84. I go with a two paste double cleaning each time. Dr. Katz tooth paste the first round, (with very little water), then Biotene, (with lots of water), the second round! Keep your mouth closed and just glide the brush to each tooth. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Philips is so CHEAP !  This company sells the 2-brush set with only one - count it, one - recharging base.  So your family member with whom you share the bathroom has to remember to remove your brush from the stand and put their brush, each day, or  some such arrangement.  How Stupid, how lazy, how cheap!  Philips writes in the manual that comes with this thing that one should not use the recharging base from an other model with this unit.  I had another, older unit.  Of course the new brush was purposely made not to fit the old recharger -- planned obsolescence.  But I got it to fit by expanding the base.  I heated it with a hot air dryer and pushed the somewhat softened plastic of the bas outward to make room for the slightly larger base of the new brush.  That, plus a bit of scraping.  Teach Philips a lesson and buy another brand!</li>
            <li> Once you try Sonicare, you&#x27;ll wonder how you ever lived without it.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 5 years.  NO CAVITIES since that time.  Have given several units as presents.  Pays for itself through dental savings.  [[ASIN:B0016BP9HG Philips Sonicare Essence e5350 Power Toothbrush with 2 Handles]]</li>
            <li> Bought this dual unit after several years of sharing one unit with two separate heads. Seems ok for now. But very upset that nowhere did it tell me it did&#x27;t have the quadpacer unit. Seems sorta cheap of Philips to make two power units one with and one without the pacer. Can&#x27;t possibly be that much cost differential. Got so used to having the toothbrush tell me when to switch it is annoying to have to count the seconds now.    Best solution for Philips would be to offer only the quadpacer or make sure it is clear that other units don&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> About 9 months ago I bought this set for my family of four.  It comes with two adult heads and then I bought two compact heads for my children ages 5 and 7.  We have to switch heads around every evening when we&#x27;re brushing.  At first I didn&#x27;t know how long we&#x27;d be willing to keep that up, but we love our sonicare cleanings so much that it feels natural now to deal with a small amount of hassle.  Our teeth are so clean now!  It seems unthinkable to return to manual toothbrushes...ever!  It also seemed natural to be sure that my kids would have the same quality clean.  No doubt it will save us pain/money down the road.  The first time my kids used the brushes they screamed at the speed of the vibrations.  I wasn&#x27;t sure they&#x27;d get used to it, but they did within days.  No problems at all.  Geez, it felt crazy to me too.  But I love the way it feels now.  It massages your gums while you brush. Very invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow....love it...&lt;br /&gt;cons:  the brush heads are SO EXPENSIVE!!!  However, we just use them longer than the recommended 3 months and buy a refill pack from Costco.  I think it&#x27;s a worthy investment!</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested I purchase a Philips Sonicare tootbrush so I bought the Sonicare Essence with two handles. My husband and I loved it so much we bought one for our daughter and son-in-law.  They love it too.</li>
            <li> I bought the Sonicare toothbrush for my parents since I already have one and love it.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare broke a few years back and I replaced it with an Oral B toothbrush.  I was sorry I did, I saved about $20-$30 but did not think it was worth it at all.  The Oral B was not as strong nor thorough as the Sonicare. After my boyfriend&#x27;s old Sonicare stopped working I decided to get this for both of us... We are both extremely happy. After a few uses I could already tell the difference in quality and reach between the two brushes.  Just happy to have a Sonicare again :)</li>
            <li> I bought this unit two years ago. No doubt after you brush with it your mouth feels as clean as ever. Much better than any manual toothbrush. After two minutes brushing it beeps to let you know you are done, and can do an extra minute of hard areas.   The downside of this model is that a lot of gunk gets stuck inside the replacement head where it meets the handle. Basically the seal where the toothbrush neck meets the wide part is not a complete seal so that when you brush the water/toothpaste mixtures runs down the handle and gets into the cavity. You have to open it after each brushing rinse the inside with water and store it with head and handle separately so that  you don&#x27;t get slime growing in that part. I you do that you are OK; but it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle having to separate it each time.   After having it for two years, i have only charged it once the battery runs out, and not each night. But now,  I have to charge it each night. I only get six minutes per day. I brush once and the recharge light starts blinking- you can get one more brush out of it.   I wouldn&#x27;t buy this model again. i would get one of the newer models with longer battery life.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what took so long. I have wanted two handles forever. Now if they can come up with a good usable stand that will hold them instead of a little cheap piece of plastic, I will be really happy.  You know guys a little extra holder that FASTENS to the charger to hold the second brush? Anyway this is a quality toothbrush that is helping my husband with some gum disease. You won&#x27;t be sorry for this purchase. Teeth will feel cleaner, positively.</li>
            <li> This product did not work. I am very disappointed.I will not order this again. Sonicares in the past have been very good. The charger was not working.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED TWO SETS OF THESE SONICARE BRUSHES, ONE SET FOR MY DAUGHTER &amp; HER HUSBAND &amp; ONE SET FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN AGES 14 &amp; 11, THE 14 YEAR OLD IS IN BRACES &amp; HIS ORTHODONTIST SAYS THERE IS A MUCH IMPROVED ORAL HYGIENE IN HIM.  tHE 11 YEAR OLD GETS HER BRACES NEXT MONTH, SO THE SONICARE WILL DEFINATELY BE A BIG HELP TO HER ALSO. SHE SAID ONLY ONE THING GRANDMA YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT IN YOUR MOUTH AFTER YOU TURN IT ON, OR IT SPLATTERS ALL OVER THE MIRROR!!!!  TOO FUNNY :)  MY DAUGHTER &amp; HUSBAND JUST LOVE THE BRUSH TOO, SAYS IT MAKES THEIR MOUTHS FEEL SO CLEAN!  I AM A RETIRED DENTAL ASSISTANT, WORKED FOR 40 YEARS &amp; LOVED IT, I SPENT THE LAST 27 YESRS OF MY CAREER WORKING FOR A PERIODONTIST, AND WE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ALL OF OUR PATIENTS TO USE THE SONICARE,WE HAD A WONDERFUL REP FROM THE COMPANY THAT WOULD GIVE OUR OFFICE GREAT DOSCOUNTS FOR US &amp; OUR PATIENTS.  tHANK YOU  SHARON PRESTON</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve been using sonicare toothbrushes for almost 10 years.  we recently had to buy a new one and did not hesitate to buy another.  one of the handles however would not hold a charge.  we contacted phillips sonicare and they immediately sent out another upgraded model. our toothbrushes have been working great and we are very happy with sonicare.  great customer service and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Had  bought this 2+ years ago somewhere other than Amazon and was for the most part happy.  My biggest complaint was that gunk and water gets in between where the brush screws on.  I did not think much of this at the time but I recently learned that this then leaked into the unit causing it to fail.  As the warranty had expired I was forced to buy a new toothbrush,  I bought another sonicare but this time one that should not allow water to get in.  Time will tell if I made the right decision.</li>
            <li> JUST UPGRADED FROM THE OLD SONICARE ADVANCED.  THE SMALLER HEAD GETS IN TIGHT PLACES BETTER AND TEETH AND GUMS FEEL REALLY CLEAN.  I LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> I started using Sonicare brushes so long ago, I can&#x27;t remember when ? My last one was starting to get weak so I got this version. It doesn&#x27;t have the quad pacer option, but I don&#x27;t really need that anyway. It works great. The handle is larger than my last one, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter anyway. Some people have a little trouble getting used to the vibration on their teeth. This \\&quot;feeling\\&quot; goes away after a little while and you won&#x27;t believe how much cleaner your teeth feel. I normally take a regular tooth brush on trips and my teeth don&#x27;t feel clean. It&#x27;s refreshing to get home and use the Sonicare again. Everyone needs to toss out their regular brushes and use Sonicare. I will always use Sonicare brushes and this one works great also.</li>
            <li> This is all you need to keep the dentist at bay. We used to have the other battery operated ones, this is much much better. The timer is great, tells you when to stop. This set is good for 2 in 1 bathroom... if only would came with different colors... well, nothing is perfect.</li>
            <li> After using the oral B electronic toothbrush I decided to do some research on electronic toothbrushes that help reduce plaque. I have a real problem with plaque. I did the research and liked the reviews of this toothbrush plus the back that it uses ultrasonic movement of the brush head. Just got back from the dentist after using it for about 1.5 months and my peridonic measurements on my gums had gone done 48 measurements being 4 and above to 35 being 4 and above. They want them to be 3 but that may not happen. I had peridontal work some years ago so to go downward in the measurements was very good. I floss every night so I know that this electronic brush is helping with the plaque situation.</li>
            <li> Item#  Phillips Sonicare HX5352/46  Essence 5300  Rechargeable Electric toothbrush with 2 handles..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one handle is good it seems to be running good, also takes a charge.  Then we come to the second handle, there is a problem with that handle.  It will not take a charge.  That handle is useless.  Can&#x27;t see having to buy two handles then receiving the product and having it be bad from the start.  When I tried to get in touch with Amazon, there was no e-addres where you could make a complaint until now. So here is my complaint, se above. I have one handle that doesn&#x27;t work. It wil not take a charge. maybe someone wil read this before it is posted and take some action. If not then it&#x27;s for the world to see. kitedioctor@comcast.net</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and holds a charge for quite a while longer than the two previous units we have owned. Seems to charge faster too.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed at Sonicare product quality.  I owned 2 sets of Sonicare and both of them failed and broken right after a little over a year of normal uses. Even the Sonicare for kids is also broken.</li>
            <li> Great online price and it works with the best of them. A little noisy.. but who&#x27;s trying to talk when you&#x27;re using the thing</li>
            <li> I love the product. And it was cheaper than in the big box store so I got it and only had to wait a few days to get it.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is a great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for nine years. I only wish this model had the quadpacer.</li>
            <li> Great value for our household of 2 (me &amp; my bf). Does its job, our teeth look sparkly whiter than ever!</li>
            <li> I owned an old Sonicare for many years. It was a great product.    After five years, I purchased a new one. This was after Philips bought the company. It failed in a year. They replaced it, but with another model, which they said at the time was better. The replacement has now failed after a few months. They refuse to replace it again.    What&#x27;s interesting is that I had inadvertently called the professional customer service line (for dentists and the like) a few minutes before that call. There I was told the replacement model they sent me had a known history of failures and they would replace it with an improved version. We started to get the replacement information and he found out I was a retail customer. He said he couldn&#x27;t do it and gave me a different number where, he said, they would take care of it. A that line (retail customer service) they told me that there was no problem with the unit and they would not replace it. This despite the fact that it was only nine months old and had a documented history of failures. When I told them what I had been told by the other guy, the response was that he was wrong, that no one at Philips would ever say that. But the fact remains that my junk replacement unit failed and the guy I spoke with knew exactly what I was talking about and could describe the failure. There is no doubt that Philips knew full well they were sending me a junk product that they were clearing out of their warehouse because they had to get rid of them.     Clearly, there is one company line for dentists who shill these things and get freebies for their staffs, and another company line for consumers who actually buy them. Buy Philips Sonicare products at your own risk.</li>
            <li> We have had our Sonic Care rechargeable for eight or so years and they are having a time holding a charge so we are getting NEW Sonic Care toothbrushes. The biggest plus factor for us is we finally were able to get to the gum line our dentist was always talking about. Teeth are at least somewhat brighter. Why? I know not of such things but it has worked for us. Dropping the brush on the tile floor was a negative I must admit, but I was able to snap it back together :-|</li>
            <li> if you are looking for an electric toothbrush you can&#x27;t go wrong.  holds the charge strong even after 2 years.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes have excellent sonic vibration and really feel like they&#x27;re getting your teeth clean.   Two problems though.  The first is that they don&#x27;t have the timer feature I&#x27;d come to expect. They run for two minutes straight and turn off, so you need to count in your head or whatnot to cover all areas. Call me lazy, but I really liked when my old toothbrush buzzed every 30 seconds to tell me when to move to the next quadrant.  The second problem is that they can only be charged one at a time. Maybe this is a power saving feature? I&#x27;ve never owned a cordless electric toothbrush that didn&#x27;t get stored on the charger, these are stored on a platic tray. Just a bit annoying that my husband and I have to trade off charging days, but to be honest they probably don&#x27;t need to be charged as often as I imagine.   Great price, great sonic cleaning. But only four stars for the above reasons.</li>
            <li> I love Sonicare electric toothbrushes. My husband and I have used nothing else for ten years. Occasionally we must buy new ones. I thought I was buying two complete full sized toothbrushes, with brushes and chargers. Honestly the pictures and the write up describe one charger. I should have paid more attention. It never occurred to me that they would sell two identical toothbrushes with only one charger. Beware lest YOU make the same mistake.</li>
            <li> These things do great the first 3 months after owning about 6 months the toothbrushes would not keep a charge. You also need to take the toothbrush apart after every use and clean out the treads.&lt;br /&gt;If you leave it on the charger all the time it will work for the 2 minutes but try to turn it back on after that and will not work.&lt;br /&gt;2 stars for the first 3 months being great. If you go on vacation don&#x27;t for get the charger.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used an earlier model of this for many years, and each of them is starting to go down hill, not charging. We were happy with them, so I found what I thought was the replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Well, almost. The previous one went for 2 minutes, and had a little break every 30 seconds to tell you that it was time to switch to the next quadrant of your mouth. I read (meaning skimmed) the description. Somewhere I thought it had that. After it arrived, we each powered them up for 24 hours as directed and then used them. No 30-second warning.&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the description on the box it came in. No 30-second warning mentioned. I just read the description on the Web page. In the list of what each different toothbrush has is something called Quadpacer. And the lower-end ones don&#x27;t have it.&lt;br /&gt;I guess technically it&#x27;s my fault: I misread, and didn&#x27;t understand what Quadpacer meant. But I&#x27;m also irritated that any of their brushes lack that feature. I think that&#x27;s a marketing ploy, and not a valid way to differentiate products.&lt;br /&gt;If they had the 30-second warning, I&#x27;d have given it five stars.</li>
            <li> Looks like a great deal, but within 2 years, it will be junk.  See my photos and video for more information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no way to open the HX5300 series toothbrush&#x27;s case to replace the batteries without destroying it.  After 1.1 to 2.0 years, the NiCad (aka NiCd or nickel-cadmium) batteries can no longer hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no clear way to open the casing to change the batteries, just a small groove at the top after you remove the brush head.  If you do manage to gingerly open the case, as I did, you will crack the case which will allow water and toothpaste to get in and ruin the electronics.  Even so, I continued on, so that others may see how poorly designed this product is.  In the process of very carefully trying to expose the batteries to replace them, several very thin and delicate connections (some of them soldered in) will be severed, turning the unit into a complete piece of trash that needs to be disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner.  The product is unmaintainable.  See my photos and video to see what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would appear that Philips doesn&#x27;t mind building a product that they know will be useless in 2 years, after the warranty has expired of course.  If you want to buy from such a company, that&#x27;s up to you.  I will not tolerate such unethical behavior.</li>
            <li> The sonicare is great for toothbrushing, however I have noticed that it is strongest after a charge. After a few uses it become less powerful. So, you either need to charge daily, or accept a less vigorous scrub. Once it loses its post-charge zest, it won&#x27;t diminish significantly until the battery is completed used, so perhaps this is the optimal speed. I don&#x27;t know. Interestingly, I had a Sonicare 8 years ago and it suffered from the same problem. Also, this package only includes one charger, which is inconvenient.      I would probably rate this package as a 3.5 due to the single charger. I would rate the Sonicare as a 4 due to the variance in brush power.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are very pleased with this product and actually look forward to the brushing experience--feels like we just stepped out of the hygienist&#x27;s office!  The speedy delivery in good condition was a plus.  We will encourage others to buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for many years and my teeth have been very satisfied.  I bought this one for my son.</li>
