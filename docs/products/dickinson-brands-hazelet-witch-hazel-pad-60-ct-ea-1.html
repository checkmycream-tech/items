    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have used Tucks brand witch hazel pads for years for personal cleaning after going to the bathroom.  I was out and visited my local CVS Pharmacy only to find that they were out of stock. When I saw these were available, I got one.  I am disappointed.  They do the job...I mean witch hazel is witch hazel...but the pads are too small (with Tucks I only needed one, with these I use at least two), and the worst part is they aren&#x27;t soft like Tucks...they are rough which is really uncomfortable at times.  There are probably other brands that are fine but I&#x27;m definitely going back to Tucks brand.</li>
            <li> Great cleansing pads.</li>
            <li> Preferr it in the bottle. Keeps product less likely to get contaminated.</li>
            <li> Funky smelling but my skin loves it and my acne is disappearing by the hour. It&#x27;s like magic. Witch magic.</li>
            <li> These cleansing pads work very well removing make-up.  I have ordered several times and will order again.</li>
            <li> Love it and definitely would recommend</li>
            <li> These are great post workout or as a daily cleanser</li>
            <li> These are fine, but smaller than thayer and are only 4.95 at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff really works well on oily skin.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great product. Natural and effective</li>
            <li> Great cleansing, feels cool and clean. Second time to purchase different types of Dickinsons Witch Hazel online. Happy with each one.</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing the job.</li>
            <li> This is an astringent for facial cleaning.</li>
            <li> These are amazing, I use them for everything.</li>
            <li> Love the convenience of these and how gentile the witch hazel is on my very sensitive skin.  Uses these every day</li>
            <li> Love the clean feeling you get after using these.  I keep mine in my cabinet next to the toilet.</li>
            <li> This product has done wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> If you like witch hazel as a face astringent/toner, this is a good product for travels.  Since it is pads instead of liquid, it can be carried on through TSA and there is no risk of spill in your luggage.</li>
            <li> I typically use witch hazel on a cotton round so I bought this because it&#x27;s two products for the price of one. The pads in this product are thinner than a typical cotton round but they are also pretty saturated with witch hazel. I like it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love Witch Hazel.  It&#x27;s cooling without all the burning chemicals of other toners. I wish the containers were larger, though.</li>
            <li> I purchased T.N. Dickinsons Hazelets Cleansing Witch Hazel pads from the Seller Certainly Good&lt;br /&gt;and it was just that Certainly Good. Pads were saturated nicely not dried out. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Got these for my daughter who is preteen and suffering breakouts. When used in combination with what her dermatologist gave her to wash her face, I am noticing improvements than with just the soap alone. My grandmother used witch hazel, swore by it. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Soooo convenient.  I have been using witch hazel as a toner from the time I was a child....this is the perfect way to not have a mess and the pads are easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product because the pads are thin (like a wet paper towel), scratchy and have an odd plastic smell.</li>
            <li> All these products I&#x27;ve been using over the years and who knew witch hazel would have my skin looking this amazing in such a short period of time. No more break outs, my skin is so soft and my pours are shrinking. The texture of the pad provides great exfoliation too. No more expensive cleansers for me!</li>
            <li> I use these for Neurofeedback- cleaning the ears and scalp.</li>
            <li> I love these cleansing pads, they are cool, cleansing and refreshing after I take off my make-up with a regular cleansing cloth.</li>
            <li> Yes, I love these but they weren&#x27;t selling them when I wanted to re-order. I found another witch hazel pad - that works just fine. Generally, I think I am in favor of the witch hazel pads. I feel like my skin is softer now.</li>
            <li> Great for quick clean of face to remove oil.</li>
            <li> Love! I use this after I workout on my back, shoulders and chest so I don&#x27;t break out.  It&#x27;s too drying for my face but in a pinch I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
