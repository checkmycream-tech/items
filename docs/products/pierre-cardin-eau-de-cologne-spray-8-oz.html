            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>I am so great full.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastically good and the size of the bottle is (almost) embarrassingly huge.</li>
            <li>came securely packaged, good price</li>
            <li>In stores a 1 ounce spray bottle can easily cost $18.00, and that&#x27;s if they have it!  </li>
            <li>This cologne is super strong and lasts all day, which is great if you plan on smelling like an antique store all day.</li>
            <li>8 oz. is a huge bottle!</li>
            <li>The bottle was huge!</li>
            <li>This bottle was HUGE !</li>
            <li>My favorite men&#x27;s fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love this man&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>the smaller bottles ive been buying over the years cost more than this 8 oz, this is a great deal!</li>
            <li>More then expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the money doubt if you will find better.</li>
            <li>This year he used up all his cologne and needed more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a scent better than this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for twenty years or more.  </li>
            <li>ladies, get this for your guy, you&#x27;ll love it on him......</li>
            <li>He enjoyed getting it for Christmas</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of most fragrances (or what women wear, either)</li>
            <li>I gladly tolerate Pierre Cardin however and Canoe cologne as well.</li>
            <li>YOU,L LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>After receiving the product, it turned out to be legitimate :-).</li>
            <li>Really love it..</li>
            <li>I am sure, you would love it..</li>
            <li>Go for it .. :-)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s his favorite</li>
            <li>Great size, and got here fast.</li>
            <li>Will buy more soon.</li>
            <li>My wife has a good nose ;-)</li>
            <li>The same great popular scent from the 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>The cologne is fine but the top of the bottle is cracked and glued.</li>
            <li>Of course, if I do decide to try to buy it online again, I&#x27;ll definitely buy it from Amazon, since they are very good about returns.</li>
            <li>Love the huge bottle.  </li>
            <li>More importantly, my wife likes the fragrance on me.</li>
            <li>I would not again purchase this product as it seems to be a cheap knock-off of the authentic Pierre Cardin product.  </li>
            <li>Just a very nice masculine smell that will turn ladies heads.</li>
            <li>Its not so easy to find.</li>
            <li>Built in spray makes it easy to apply</li>
            <li>because most all are too flowery, sweet or downright in-your-face.</li>
            <li>The aroma is rather light yet lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Being that the cologne is a spray makes it even more economical.</li>
            <li>This smells really cheap and pungent.</li>
            <li>While using the same packaging, the product itself is greatly inferior.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for years and enjoy wearing it.</li>
            <li>i enjoy the scent of pierre cardin</li>
            <li>The delivery was early, and no problems there, so I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>Good Old fashioned Pierre Cardin cologne</li>
            <li>Great smell great long lasting size.</li>
            <li>&quot; My original PC has PC engraved in it on the glass, this one does not.</li>
            <li>My original has PC engraved on the bottle cap, this one does not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and easy!</li>
            <li>Nothing special, just a clean, not overpowering smell.</li>
            <li>Great price for a big bottle of a classic masculine scent that is universally liked by most people.</li>
            <li>Nice soft scent that does not overpower like some do.</li>
            <li>amazon&#x27;s price is much more reasonable.</li>
            <li>Once more Thanks Amazon and friends</li>
            <li>Very atractive price for an interesting cologne.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hard to find in stores, nice to be able to get this large size for a good price.</li>
            <li>This is an old favorite and not always easy to find.  </li>
            <li>Although other colognes have stronger scents and greater staying power, I have been a fan of the unique Pierre Cardin scent for years (since about 1981) and this delivers an abundant supply of it.</li>
            <li>copy.&lt;br /&gt;I examined more my original PC and this \\&quot;new one.\\</li>
            <li>Really super deal based on the price.  </li>
            <li>I find the 8oz bottle a tremendous value.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and intact.  </li>
            <li>Great product fast delivery will definitely buy again</li>
            <li>I had a hard time finding this cologne for my husband and was so happy to find it here at amazon and at such a great price.  </li>
            <li>very pleased and would definitely recommend this to others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks amazon!!</li>
            <li>The bottle I received did NOT have the traditional Pierre Cardin marking on the bottle cap, and it does not smell nearly as nice as what I have always purchased before.</li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>my husband using  this Pierre Carden  the last 20 plus  years, we just loving it.  </li>
            <li>Always gets a laugh.</li>
            <li>i was get it right away.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance is very nice and while it does smell like the Pierre Cardin my husband wore in the 80s, it wears off quickly and the cap seems to be missing the classic PC emblem for Pierre Cardin.</li>
            <li>I bought a large bottle and ended up throwing it away!</li>
            <li>and  the seller was great this time , they send me a big big discont.</li>
            <li>I love the aroma of Pierre Cardin, and have bought it several times over the years since I first discovered it.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>No stale product.  </li>
            <li>This was first rate.</li>
            <li>the description of item is exact according to display in the website</li>
            <li>It is a good gift for everyday use.</li>
            <li>but I would suggest that information that important be typed in a larger font, not just bold since there are lots of highlighed/bold comments on these item pages.</li>
            <li>If it was the real thing this would be a tremendous buy, but as a knockoff copy your paying too much.</li>
            <li>Timeless, clean, crisp, classy scent.</li>
            <li>This is not the original cologne formula from the early 1980&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought 8 oz was a misprint, but this huge bottle my husband received was real and he will enjoy his Pierre Cardin for a very, very long time.  </li>
            <li>If you want to purchase a bottle of cologne with a fresh, unique, refreshing scent that will last you a long time and won&#x27;t have you buying more anytime soon, this is the only way to go.</li>
            <li>This has been his favorite for a long time now.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly what I expected and an outstanding value for this quantity</li>
            <li>This cologne smells like pure musk...</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase on-line, however, my husband really likes this cologne</li>
            <li>My husband really likes it and wears it all the time.  </li>
            <li>Like always, Amazon came through and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>It lasts much longer than the one I just purchased.</li>
            <li>,S VERY CHEAP COMPARED TO OTHER PREMIUM PRODUCT.TRY</li>
            <li>Now, keep in mind, I own a small bottle of PC and could apply the size of a dime on me</li>
            <li>Turns out it is not the real Pierre Cardin cologne, but is very similar and only side-by-side can most people tell it apart.</li>
            <li>It is a classic scent that my dad has been wearing for years and loves.</li>
            <li>Like Pierre Cardin cologne but priced high in stores.</li>
            <li>It is rare to find a quality cologne like this in a store at the same price and quantity.</li>
            <li>But, like several of the other people who commented here, I too think my latest purchase is NOT the real thing.</li>
            <li>I put a couple of sprays on me, smelled right, but 20 minutes later, I couldn&#x27;t smell anything.</li>
            <li>and I live in Hawaii.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Plus, the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long, like the original did.</li>
            <li>When it arrived we immediately knew it was not the actual Pierre Cardin, but a copy - should have known by the reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Shipped directly to my Dad.  </li>
            <li>I have some old Pierre Cardin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is long lasting, sweet however masculine.&lt;br /&gt;I truly recomend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting this while price and availability last.</li>
            <li>It is a very large bottle of cologne and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Bought it to bring back some memories from the early 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Pierre Cardin cologne, but found it fairly expensive in retail stores.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a really classic scent that has endured for at least 30 years based on what I remember of my first purchase.  </li>

            <li> i enjoy the scent of pierre cardin</li>
            <li> The delivery was early, and no problems there, so I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li> Good Old fashioned Pierre Cardin cologne</li>
            <li> Great smell great long lasting size.</li>
            <li> &quot; My original PC has PC engraved in it on the glass, this one does not.</li>
            <li> My original has PC engraved on the bottle cap, this one does not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and easy!</li>
            <li> Nothing special, just a clean, not overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> Great price for a big bottle of a classic masculine scent that is universally liked by most people.</li>
            <li> Nice soft scent that does not overpower like some do.</li>
            <li> amazon&#x27;s price is much more reasonable.</li>
            <li> Once more Thanks Amazon and friends</li>
            <li> Very atractive price for an interesting cologne.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores, nice to be able to get this large size for a good price.</li>
            <li> This is an old favorite and not always easy to find.  </li>
            <li> Although other colognes have stronger scents and greater staying power, I have been a fan of the unique Pierre Cardin scent for years (since about 1981) and this delivers an abundant supply of it.</li>
            <li> copy.&lt;br /&gt;I examined more my original PC and this \\&quot;new one.\\</li>
            <li> Really super deal based on the price.  </li>
            <li> I find the 8oz bottle a tremendous value.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and intact.  </li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this cologne for my husband and was so happy to find it here at amazon and at such a great price.  </li>
            <li> very pleased and would definitely recommend this to others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks amazon!!</li>
            <li> The bottle I received did NOT have the traditional Pierre Cardin marking on the bottle cap, and it does not smell nearly as nice as what I have always purchased before.</li>
            <li> well worth the price.</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> my husband using  this Pierre Carden  the last 20 plus  years, we just loving it.  </li>
            <li> Always gets a laugh.</li>
            <li> i was get it right away.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance is very nice and while it does smell like the Pierre Cardin my husband wore in the 80s, it wears off quickly and the cap seems to be missing the classic PC emblem for Pierre Cardin.</li>
            <li> I bought a large bottle and ended up throwing it away!</li>
            <li> and  the seller was great this time , they send me a big big discont.</li>
            <li> I love the aroma of Pierre Cardin, and have bought it several times over the years since I first discovered it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> No stale product.  </li>
            <li> This was first rate.</li>
            <li> the description of item is exact according to display in the website</li>
            <li> It is a good gift for everyday use.</li>
            <li> but I would suggest that information that important be typed in a larger font, not just bold since there are lots of highlighed/bold comments on these item pages.</li>
            <li> If it was the real thing this would be a tremendous buy, but as a knockoff copy your paying too much.</li>
            <li> Timeless, clean, crisp, classy scent.</li>
            <li> This is not the original cologne formula from the early 1980&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought 8 oz was a misprint, but this huge bottle my husband received was real and he will enjoy his Pierre Cardin for a very, very long time.  </li>
            <li> If you want to purchase a bottle of cologne with a fresh, unique, refreshing scent that will last you a long time and won&#x27;t have you buying more anytime soon, this is the only way to go.</li>
            <li> This has been his favorite for a long time now.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what I expected and an outstanding value for this quantity</li>
            <li> This cologne smells like pure musk...</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase on-line, however, my husband really likes this cologne</li>
            <li> My husband really likes it and wears it all the time.  </li>
            <li> Like always, Amazon came through and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> It lasts much longer than the one I just purchased.</li>
            <li> ,S VERY CHEAP COMPARED TO OTHER PREMIUM PRODUCT.TRY</li>
            <li> Now, keep in mind, I own a small bottle of PC and could apply the size of a dime on me</li>
            <li> Turns out it is not the real Pierre Cardin cologne, but is very similar and only side-by-side can most people tell it apart.</li>
            <li> It is a classic scent that my dad has been wearing for years and loves.</li>
            <li> Like Pierre Cardin cologne but priced high in stores.</li>
            <li> It is rare to find a quality cologne like this in a store at the same price and quantity.</li>
            <li> But, like several of the other people who commented here, I too think my latest purchase is NOT the real thing.</li>
            <li> I put a couple of sprays on me, smelled right, but 20 minutes later, I couldn&#x27;t smell anything.</li>
            <li> and I live in Hawaii.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Plus, the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long, like the original did.</li>
            <li> When it arrived we immediately knew it was not the actual Pierre Cardin, but a copy - should have known by the reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Shipped directly to my Dad.  </li>
            <li> I have some old Pierre Cardin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is long lasting, sweet however masculine.&lt;br /&gt;I truly recomend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting this while price and availability last.</li>
            <li> It is a very large bottle of cologne and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Bought it to bring back some memories from the early 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Pierre Cardin cologne, but found it fairly expensive in retail stores.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a really classic scent that has endured for at least 30 years based on what I remember of my first purchase.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about knockoffs, and this is a full 8 ounce bottle, it&#x27;s BIG, but it smells like the real thing to me, at the same time I am getting old &amp; my smeller ain&#x27;t what it used to be.</li>
            <li> however it&#x27;s pretty hard to find a size that big here.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it arrived earlier than expected</li>
            <li> Like the milder scent of this product as long as you don&#x27;t over spray.</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne my father will wear and its getting harder and harder to find until I looked on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Also loose.</li>
            <li> I am astounded at how they can sell such an authentically packaged product that bears so little resemblance - other than visual - to product</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> The scent is completely different and the bottle is missing the Pierre Cardin markings.  </li>
            <li> It just was not what I expected from a renowned brand like Pierre Cardin.</li>
            <li> last year i send a small bottle to  HUNGARY,  to my friend husband, who is a subway driver.</li>
            <li> Horriable cologne, should have been stop selling it, when Steve Rubell &amp;#34;Studio 54&amp;#34; was throw in jail!</li>
            <li> Shouldn&#x27;t have tried to bring back the past.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased it for a while because of the cost and have been using other fragrances.</li>
            <li> The amount is a bargain, the quality seems to be less than what I have had before from &#x27;brick-based&#x27; merchants.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying it elsewhere where the price was a little less.</li>
            <li> Also, it is one of a few that does not give me a headache.  </li>
            <li> Online no where near as expensive as in a store.</li>
            <li> The bottle was twice the size of the one he previously had so he won&#x27;t run out again anytime soon!  </li>
            <li> And I will be very wary of purchasing such things through amazon in the future.</li>
            <li> At least it smells a little citrusy too.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the problem is</li>
            <li> As usual Amazon came through...</li>
            <li> Not better then z14.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find</li>
            <li> Aside from the web this cologne has been getting increasingly hard to find.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding it stores in my area.  </li>
            <li> Introduced in 1972, Pierre Cardin has been hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Not a trendy, contrived cologne fragrance.</li>
            <li> I say to them that I could tell them, but then I would have to kill them because it is my secret.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a fake before ordering..</li>
            <li> Dated and smells bad!</li>
            <li> And I wasn&#x27;t disappointed !</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a big big bottle. Nice smell. Will last eons.</li>
            <li> I like this fragrance...what else can I say.  nice price too.</li>
            <li> Very good price for a very nice cologne.</li>
            <li> My favourite scent for my husband</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase on-line, however, my husband really likes this cologne and it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find in the stores.  Also, it is one of a few that does not give me a headache.  When it arrived we immediately knew it was not the actual Pierre Cardin, but a copy - should have known by the reasonable price.  The scent is completely different and the bottle is missing the Pierre Cardin markings.  Shame on me that I did not notice it could not be returned, but I would suggest that information that important be typed in a larger font, not just bold since there are lots of highlighed/bold comments on these item pages.</li>
            <li> This is not the original cologne formula from the early 1980&#x27;s.  Not sure what the problem is but it is not the same.  My wife has a good nose ;-)</li>
            <li> Really good sized bottle and it arrived earlier than expected</li>
            <li> My favorite men&#x27;s fragrance.  I&#x27;ve been told that it isn&#x27;t made anymore and it&#x27;s hard to find</li>
            <li> I love the aroma of Pierre Cardin, and have bought it several times over the years since I first discovered it. But, like several of the other people who commented here, I too think my latest purchase is NOT the real thing. They have either changed the formula of the cologne, or it is a counterfeit ... probably the latter. The bottle I received did NOT have the traditional Pierre Cardin marking on the bottle cap, and it does not smell nearly as nice as what I have always purchased before. Plus, the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long, like the original did. I too have had a difficult time finding it in stores locally, but after this experience, I&#x27;m not so sure I&#x27;ll want to buy it online again. Of course, if I do decide to try to buy it online again, I&#x27;ll definitely buy it from Amazon, since they are very good about returns. I made the mistake of buying it elsewhere where the price was a little less.</li>
            <li> It was a present for my son in his birthday. I love this man&#x27;s perfume. I recommend to everybody to buy it.</li>
            <li> For $24.00, this purchase was one of the best values for my money.  The box was a bit dented, but there was no damage, whatsoever, to the cologne bottle.  At first I thought 8 oz was a misprint, but this huge bottle my husband received was real and he will enjoy his Pierre Cardin for a very, very long time.  I would definitely make this purchase again.</li>
            <li> The same great popular scent from the 70&#x27;s.  Still great scent today. Really super deal based on the price.  Can&#x27;t beat this. Prompt shipment.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about knockoffs, and this is a full 8 ounce bottle, it&#x27;s BIG, but it smells like the real thing to me, at the same time I am getting old &amp; my smeller ain&#x27;t what it used to be. The delivery was early, and no problems there, so I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li> As usual Amazon came through...Ordered on a Friday morning and delivered the following Friday morning. Aside from the web this cologne has been getting increasingly hard to find. It smells fantastically good and the size of the bottle is (almost) embarrassingly huge. I would recommend Pierre Cardin and Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorites. Just a very nice masculine smell that will turn ladies heads. It&#x27;s not overbearing and it doesn&#x27;t arrive before you do if you get my meaning here. Women of all nationalities seem to like this fragrance. I didn&#x27;t realize until today that it has been around since 1972. Good price here too I might add and I know I am going to have to get me a bottle or two.</li>
            <li> This is a lot of cologne for the price. 8 oz. is a huge bottle! Fragrance is very nice and while it does smell like the Pierre Cardin my husband wore in the 80s, it wears off quickly and the cap seems to be missing the classic PC emblem for Pierre Cardin. I would not want to make an accusation of a knock-off because I don&#x27;t know, but it is a great fragrance and well worth the price. I would probably buy again based on value.</li>
            <li> well worth the money. i believe the big 8 oz  has the same scent as the smaller ones! the smaller bottles ive been buying over the years cost more than this 8 oz, this is a great deal! thanks amazon!!</li>
            <li> My husband still likes this scent. Its not so easy to find. This is a great value. The bottle is so big. I can always find great deals on amazon.com</li>
            <li> The cologne is fine but the top of the bottle is cracked and glued. Also loose. I do hope the spray cap holds up until my father uses it all.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this cologne for my husband and was so happy to find it here at amazon and at such a great price.  Nice soft scent that does not overpower like some do.</li>
            <li> Arrived perfectly, thank you.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift. When I unwraped it, I noticed the box inside had several tears on it and one was taped slopily over. It looked like it had been around the world. I opened it up and saw the silver foil cover was \\&quot;dripping off\\&quot; one side of the bottle. I removed the cap and saw that it had broke in two and some cologne spilled out. I put a couple of sprays on me, smelled right, but 20 minutes later, I couldn&#x27;t smell anything. Now, keep in mind, I own a small bottle of PC and could apply the size of a dime on me and I could smell it all day and night. I realized I had a knockoff copy.&lt;br /&gt;I examined more my original PC and this \\&quot;new one.\\&quot; My original PC has PC engraved in it on the glass, this one does not. My original has PC engraved on the bottle cap, this one does not.&lt;br /&gt;This is (in my opinion) made in China and has nothing to do with Pierre Cardin. If it was the real thing this would be a tremendous buy, but as a knockoff copy your paying too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Pierre Cardin cologne, but found it fairly expensive in retail stores.  amazon&#x27;s price is much more reasonable.</li>
            <li> Great online store.  Excellent packaging and fast shipping.  Shipped directly to my Dad.  Exactly as described.  No \\&quot;second\\&quot; quality.  No stale product.  This was first rate.</li>
            <li> My rating is based upon quality, quantity and value of amount of product.  The amount is a bargain, the quality seems to be less than what I have had before from &#x27;brick-based&#x27; merchants. However, I like the product and would get it again. More importantly, my wife likes the fragrance on me.</li>
            <li> WE LIKE THE WAY THIS SMELLS</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It is a very large bottle of cologne and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great, been using this cologne for years and love it</li>
            <li> More then expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> For the money doubt if you will find better. The aroma is rather light yet lasts all day. Online no where near as expensive as in a store. Built in spray makes it easy to apply</li>
            <li> I did not like the scent of this cologne at all. It just was not what I expected from a renowned brand like Pierre Cardin.</li>
            <li> Been around for ever...as good as always.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne.  It is a good gift for everyday use. And the size it comes in is great!</li>
            <li> this product has a great scent.  My husband really likes it and wears it all the time.  I will order this product again!</li>
            <li> Timeless, clean, crisp, classy scent. Not a trendy, contrived cologne fragrance. I&#x27;ve been using PC for Men for decades and don&#x27;t plan on ever switching to anything else. Everyone loves it.</li>
            <li> Good Old fashioned Pierre Cardin cologne&lt;br /&gt; I had asked on Amazon customer feedback if it was&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;a knock off brand &amp;#34; and  several who bought it said it was not !&lt;br /&gt; a knock off brand. I trusted them being Amazon customer/shoppers&lt;br /&gt; And I wasn&#x27;t disappointed ! Once more Thanks Amazon and friends&lt;br /&gt;  Aguila</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad for Fathers Day. Had a hard time finding it stores in my area.  Like always, Amazon came through and shipping was fast. It is a classic scent that my dad has been wearing for years and loves. For the size of this bottle, it will last for months, if not years.  And...the price point is great!</li>
            <li> What can I say. Piere Cardin is awesome</li>
            <li> This is an old favorite and not always easy to find.  Love the huge bottle.  My husband loves it and was very happy.</li>
            <li> Great price for a big bottle of a classic masculine scent that is universally liked by most people. Being that the cologne is a spray makes it even more economical. It is rare to find a quality cologne like this in a store at the same price and quantity. I highly recommend getting this while price and availability last. UPDATE: Turns out it is not the real Pierre Cardin cologne, but is very similar and only side-by-side can most people tell it apart.</li>
            <li> The cap wouldn&#x27;t stay on but that was o.k. I didn&#x27;t need it. My husband was been wearing this for years.</li>
            <li> Not Pierre Cardin BY Pierre Cardin  !</li>
            <li> My dad loves this cologne. Don&#x27;t buy it if you haven&#x27;t smelled it. My dad has used it for about 20 years..we get him a bottle every year either for Father&#x27;s Day or Christmas.</li>
            <li> great for the price did not expect this size bottle had to order more</li>
            <li> my husband using  this Pierre Carden  the last 20 plus  years, we just loving it.  and  the seller was great this time , they send me a big big discont. 14$.  i was get it right away.  this smell is fantastik nice,  last year i send a small bottle to  HUNGARY,  to my friend husband, who is a subway driver. so,  every day a ladys stop by, and asking him ;WHAT IS THAT?  we just loving it, and this seller is just perfect.  thank you.</li>
            <li> Having purchased this &amp;#34;large, economy size&amp;#34; twice before, I knew what I was getting when I ordered it a third time and it did not disappoint. Although other colognes have stronger scents and greater staying power, I have been a fan of the unique Pierre Cardin scent for years (since about 1981) and this delivers an abundant supply of it. If you want to purchase a bottle of cologne with a fresh, unique, refreshing scent that will last you a long time and won&#x27;t have you buying more anytime soon, this is the only way to go.</li>
            <li> Horriable cologne, should have been stop selling it, when Steve Rubell &amp;#34;Studio 54&amp;#34; was throw in jail! Dated and smells bad!</li>
            <li> Good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> I have some old Pierre Cardin. It lasts much longer than the one I just purchased. It makes me wonder about it authenticity !</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne my father will wear and its getting harder and harder to find until I looked on Amazon. I am so great full.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Each year I purchase my husband a bottle of this brand.  This year he used up all his cologne and needed more.  I came across this bottle at a excellent price.  It was a joke to get this size....lol</li>
            <li> Great price for this size bottle.  This is one of my favorite colognes to wear and I was very happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> A girlfriend recommended this to me in the 1970&#x27;s.  I liked the odor, and have been wearing it ever since.  I find the 8oz bottle a tremendous value.  In stores a 1 ounce spray bottle can easily cost $18.00, and that&#x27;s if they have it!  I&#x27;ve never found a scent better than this.</li>
            <li> YUCK!!! This smells really cheap and pungent. I swear, I had this years ago and I don&#x27;t remember it smelling like this. I bought a large bottle and ended up throwing it away!</li>
            <li> I would not again purchase this product as it seems to be a cheap knock-off of the authentic Pierre Cardin product.  While using the same packaging, the product itself is greatly inferior.  Is this licensed and approved by the originator?  I am astounded at how they can sell such an authentically packaged product that bears so little resemblance - other than visual - to product I&#x27;ve been using for twenty years or more.  If it isn&#x27;t authorized by the creator/manufacturer, Amazon should label it as such. And I will be very wary of purchasing such things through amazon in the future. Probably won&#x27;t ever take the chance again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for years and enjoy wearing it. And I haven&#x27;t had any complaints from the ladies. LOL</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and intact.  I have used this scent over the years and always get compliments.  The 8 oz is practically a lifetime supply if you apply correctly (sparingly).  I think this is a really classic scent that has endured for at least 30 years based on what I remember of my first purchase.  In any event, Gents buy this for your lady&#x27;s sake, or to get a lady to wear it for, or just to entertain all the ladies you encounter each day (they have noses too).  ladies, get this for your guy, you&#x27;ll love it on him......</li>
            <li> Great smell great long lasting size.</li>
            <li> Like Pierre Cardin cologne but priced high in stores. This is a great value at lower price but I do notice that the cologne smell only last maybe a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> One of my husbands favorites. He enjoyed getting it for Christmas</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores, nice to be able to get this large size for a good price. Like the milder scent of this product as long as you don&#x27;t over spray.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 20 years, it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li> Introduced in 1972, Pierre Cardin has been hard to beat. I&#x27;m not a fan of most fragrances (or what women wear, either) because most all are too flowery, sweet or downright in-your-face. I gladly tolerate Pierre Cardin however and Canoe cologne as well. Both are great... the rest of them, nah.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A QUALITY PRODUCT THAT DOES,NT OVERWHELM YOU AND IT,S VERY CHEAP COMPARED TO OTHER PREMIUM PRODUCT.TRY IT YOU,L LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> came securely packaged, good price</li>
            <li> bought for hubby i like the fragrance also he happy and so am i .</li>
            <li> Bought it to bring back some memories from the early 80&#x27;s.  Good product.  Shouldn&#x27;t have tried to bring back the past.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a fake before ordering.. After receiving the product, it turned out to be legitimate :-). Really love it.. I am sure, you would love it.. Go for it .. :-)</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the purchase--it came really quickly and I live in Hawaii.&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend has been using this for years and it&#x27;s his favorite however it&#x27;s pretty hard to find a size that big here.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased and would definitely recommend this to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating this a 5 star!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the great product and service!</li>
            <li> I used to wear this all the time back in the day. I haven&#x27;t purchased it for a while because of the cost and have been using other fragrances. After I got this and wore it once I realized why I wore it back then. This is an awesome all around scent for just about any occasion. Plus I get compliments and questioned as to what it is. I say to them that I could tell them, but then I would have to kill them because it is my secret. Always gets a laugh.</li>
            <li> My husband  loves it.</li>
            <li> Very atractive price for an interesting cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Great cost X benefit rate.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is long lasting, sweet however masculine.&lt;br /&gt;I truly recomend it.</li>
            <li> Nice. Not better then z14.</li>
            <li> i enjoy the scent of pierre cardin so i recommend it.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what I expected and an outstanding value for this quantity</li>
            <li> My dad&#x27;s favorite! Great size, and got here fast.</li>
            <li> I have worn this cologne for years...40+.  Nothing special, just a clean, not overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> This was a great gift for my Dad! The bottle was huge! He loved it! Shipping was fast and easy!</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I do not have the recommendations, this pack is according for the article! the description of item is exact according to display in the website</li>
            <li> This bottle was HUGE ! We love the fragrance so we were very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a gift for someone who had recently ran out.  The bottle was twice the size of the one he previously had so he won&#x27;t run out again anytime soon!  This was a great value.  Also very pleased with the delivery time.</li>
            <li> This cologne is super strong and lasts all day, which is great if you plan on smelling like an antique store all day. This cologne smells like pure musk... There is just nothing else in it. If you want to smell like musk, then I suggest buying Javon Sex Appeal instead. At least it smells a little citrusy too.</li>
            <li> My brother just loves the smell of Pierre Cardin. This was a good price on a bottle this size. I will be buying this Cologne again.</li>
            <li> Great cologne for my father. He loves it. This has been his favorite for a long time now. Will buy more soon.</li>
