    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;Fekkai is the best health/beauty haircare line Amazon carries, in my opinion..</li>
            <li>Great product for all hair types!</li>
            <li>I just finished reviewing the shampoo, which wasn&#x27;t overly impressive</li>

            <li>I am so in love with this Shea Pot de Creme!!!!  </li>
            <li>For awesome hair, rub this into your damp hair before you ride, braid it, and when you get there you won&#x27;t have helmet hair.</li>

            <li>I still had some fly away -</li>
            <li>I still had some fly away - frizz.</li>
            <li>Great time saver.</li>
            <li>weddings, family parties, ect...and this Fekkai Essentail Shea works great for these times.</li>
            <li>But it does do a great job during the day when at work, keeps everything manageable and the smell is great.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant but not obtrusive.  </li>
            <li>My hair dresser recommended this product for my hair to help with frizz, it works and I always get compliments on my hair smelling good.</li>
            <li>so I know it would be good so wanted to see what it could do for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Fekkai hair products - they have a hair mask that is incredible - and this Pot de Creme product is no exception.  </li>
            <li>It smells so good by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does smell really good...</li>
            <li>Smells good and works effectivity.</li>
            <li>It does give a nice sheen and handles frizz very nicely.</li>
            <li>The product has an amazing smell to start with, a great smooth floral smell with a predominant smell of jasmine, really great.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this creme!</li>
            <li>That saves money and precious time, because you don&#x27;t have to go anywhere to look your best, and you don&#x27;t have to keep buying some hair product over and over for special occasions.</li>
            <li>It has a great smell and goes on easy.</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and dose not freeze your hair.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest, who keeps the box that products come in?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like creamy bananas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it out before straightening my hair, so I kind of wonder what results I would get if I did that.</li>
            <li>As a styling cream this isn&#x27;t that kind of animal.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t expect curls with any kind of maintainable</li>
            <li>I find products in a tub to be kind of . . .</li>
            <li>There are times though when I want it to look nice, going out to dinner,</li>
            <li>So, that is nice.</li>
            <li>First thing: it smells strongly og honeysuckle, the greatest scent ever.</li>
            <li>This scent is best described as &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and it leaves your hair softly scented after your hair is dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This scent is best described as &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and it leaves your hair softly scented after your hair is dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>stuff is wonderful, I was surprised how large this jar is, it will last me forever and the scent is great; tropical flowers, scent of Jasmine blooming in moonlight, just delicious.</li>
            <li>Love what this product does for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this hair lotion...</li>
            <li>This is ok</li>
            <li>Love the smell and no buildup</li>
            <li>It is light and has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>a side note, I&#x27;ve also been using Fekkai Glossing Cream on the ends of my hair, to keep my hair glossy &amp; healthy looking, for years.</li>
            <li>The Shea Pot de Creme ( I love that name</li>
            <li>Works so much better than conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping too</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how much I love this hair creme.</li>
            <li>I sure don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>so you might as well use the shampoo as it doesn’t have sulfates in it which many of us know by now sulfates will strip your hair.  </li>
            <li>so honestly I’m asking a lot from this product to give me smooth , bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li>Hair is more tamed but not as defined as I would love for my hair to be without some sort of product.  </li>
            <li>Most make me gag.</li>
            <li>Hair has more control and weight provided to help with frizz than with shampoo  or shampoo + rinse out conditioner alone</li>
            <li>Most make me gag.</li>
            <li>Hair has more control and weight provided to help with frizz than with shampoo  or shampoo + rinse out conditioner alone</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It helps the ends feel more defined and in control during blow drying.</li>
            <li>It feels more like a leave in conditioner than a styling aide.</li>
            <li>I work that through, put three drops of Christophe Serum in my palms and run that over the top hair, and then i style.</li>
            <li>And then I&#x27;m going to buy more.</li>
            <li>It improved the texture, reduced fly-away and gave a bit more control.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most hair serums and glosses it did not make my hair look too greasy.  </li>
            <li>just for me, I wish it didn&#x27;t smell or that the smell would fade more</li>
            <li>The more you use this leave-in Cream the better it gets.</li>
            <li>This product really smells great.  </li>
            <li>recommend putting on after shower and not on the top of your scalp just on bottoms.</li>
            <li>This product works much better as a leave in conditioner instead of a styling product.</li>
            <li>Love this for my hear.</li>
            <li>So I have found this product really works great with hair that is acting up or is getting to frizzy for its own good.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not really all that impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li>I have a cupboard full of products that try to combat this, and most are okay.</li>
            <li>My hair dries with a soft curl (kind of like 1 or 2 natural ringlets) and has a wonderful texture and shine.</li>
            <li>I think for you lush, curly haired lasses will find it worth the money because it will make your curls even more beautiful</li>
            <li>This is a must for anyone with hair that has length to it due to damage that eventually happens, even the best shampoo and conditioner can benefit from a finishing creme like this one, I apply it after I wash and towel</li>
            <li>and it does frizz easily.</li>
            <li>Though I consider it more of a conditioner than a styling, aid, it does act as a light styling product, like a light mousse would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This scent is strong in my opinion but not gag me strong.  </li>
            <li>This scent is strong in my opinion but not gag me strong.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, for another &amp;#34;hair goop&amp;#34; (as my husband refers to them), it&#x27;s a pretty nice one.  </li>
            <li>have fine, bleached, colored hair with just a bit of curl (that frizzes when you comb it).</li>
            <li>It feels nice and slippery which isn’t really helpful since the shampoo doesn’t tangle your hair.  </li>
            <li>I use the Pot de Creme 2-3 times a week, primarily as a leave-in conditioner (ie on damp hair).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;+ Smells fantastic, like all Fekkai</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure at first what the heck</li>
            <li>I have tried a Fekkai shampoo in the past and wasn&#x27;t overly impressed</li>
            <li>Nothing that&#x27;s going to hold a style w/o some product, but perfectly fine for running around the house looking like I have healthy hair (that also smells really good)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing that&#x27;s going to hold a style w/o some product, but perfectly fine for running around the house looking like I have healthy hair (that also smells really good)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Possibly might be better for someone with curlier hair than my own.</li>
            <li>but it just wasn&#x27;t anything special for me.</li>
            <li>This has a nice creamy consistency and leaves the hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I liked how this product made my hair feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>really makes the hair soft and silky and has a nice scent - would like it better in a squeeze tube though</li>
            <li>Did not do much for me in terms of making my wavy hair better looking or reducing frizz.  </li>
            <li>It smells really nice and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Absolutely lovely, and a very generous size.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about the scent is that is didn&#x27;t seem to stick with you--once it was on your hair and you washed your hands</li>
            <li>Hair is soft, soft, soft-- and smells great!</li>
            <li>It also keeps my hair looking healthy, which is especially awesome when my straight and thin hair is prone to dryness.</li>
            <li>You have the tool right at home to make every day a special occasion</li>
            <li>Then once I managed the amount being the size of a quarter for my long hair, it actually worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+ Makes your hair very very soft and healthy feeling.  </li>
            <li>It makes my yucky hair so pretty!  </li>
            <li>As each person is really different, this could be spectacular for you</li>
            <li>So, it would be nice if they could fix that in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on both wet and damp hair, and it does a good job at taming my wavy frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>Fekkai essential Shea  pot of creme is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have sexy soft shiny waves when you take the braid out.serious styling aid.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have sexy soft shiny waves when you take the braid out.</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for every day use as it is rather pricey, but when you want to look nice and have your hair hold up with out the frizz fry for more than half an hour, this will do the trick!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a little strong and since I use it more for going out and special occasions when I like to wear perfume</li>
            <li>and I was thrilled at how long I stayed un-frizzed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a fresh scent that is light and not overpowering, but in my opinion its holding power really isn&#x27;t strong enough, though I&#x27;m sure your personal hair texture has a lot to do with it.</li>
            <li>Nice pre blow dry product.</li>
            <li>I have been loving FF products lately, and this is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li>Shea Butter is one of the best things for you hair you can use, but pure shea can be hard to apply and leaves hair kind of stiff.</li>
            <li>Very luxurious!</li>
            <li>It leaves hair soft and smooth without a residue type feeling.  </li>
            <li>and it never failed me.</li>
            <li>pretty good).&lt;br</li>
            <li>but not because it leaves my hair completely frizz free.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways I enjoy the smell of the products where I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to the smell of perfumes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways I enjoy the smell of the products where I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to the smell of perfumes.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really takes care of my frizzies!</li>
            <li>The softness and control last for most of the day.  </li>
            <li>The instructions say to use a generous amount, and the first time I used it, I used about a walnut-sized amount.</li>
            <li>just a finger dab into the jar, then rub between hands and scruch into hair, then brush and wait for it to settle into a soft, frizz free</li>
            <li>I reviewed a Pantene product that I could barely use in the shower because it smelled so strong.  </li>
            <li>I reviewed a Pantene product that I could barely use in the shower because it smelled so strong.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s rather fine, and this didn&#x27;t provide a whole lot of hold or control for wearing my hair natural.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li>This product was made for people with thick, coarse or curly hair but it works great for us non curly girls as well!!!  </li>
            <li>It takes a little trial and error to figure out the right amount to use for your own hair.</li>
            <li>so I am reluctant to claim that my hair is actually healthier, but it seems to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used some Fekkai products and on my fine hair it left a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look, but I am pleased to say that this product does not do that.  </li>
            <li>flatironing I love how this helps my hair lay flat and flowing over my shoulders, not sticking straight out like sticks, as some curly hair does</li>
            <li>flatironing I love how this helps my hair lay flat and flowing over my shoulders, not sticking straight out like sticks, as some curly hair does</li>
            <li>My hair smells AMAZING, and it tames and moisturizes without weighing my hair down at all.</li>
            <li>and I was thrilled at how easy it was to distribute this luxe, thick, creamy conditioner!  </li>
            <li>The top is dry and coarse but the sides are silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>It did very well taming the frizz and helped make brushing a lot easier.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair (type 3b-3c) and my hair has really responded to this creme.</li>
            <li>The Pot De Cr&amp;egrave;me now is what you really need in the end .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really do like this product</li>
            <li>It can look really scraggy, ugh.  </li>
            <li>It really disappears into your hair.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still getting used to figuring out how much to use at a time.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of it.</li>
            <li>try my hair ( gently)</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant and subtle.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty upset about it and went on a search for a new product that would define my curls and keep frizz at bay.</li>
            <li>Does NOT weigh your hair down (and I have very fine hair), or feel sticky.  </li>
            <li>My long straight fine hair has plenty of frizz in this Florida humidity.</li>
            <li>Decent hair cream.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>From the first use I had hair that looked healthier and was far more manageable on the hot, humid July and August days of late.</li>
            <li>am so happy to recommend Fekkai Essential Shea Pot De Creme that I jumped over four products I plan to review&lt;br /&gt;in order to let readers know that the outlay of money for this conditioner is very small considering the immediate results you get.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Just a little bit of this clams it all down and also adds a great shine and softness.  </li>
            <li>I also blow dried my hair after using and it was so much better than not using it.</li>
            <li>Most of the time that involves blowdrying and flatironing, and then I put just a few dabs of the Shea Creme in my palms and touch up the ends of my hair to give it cohesiveness.  </li>
            <li>If you want something to smooth through your hair to let it air dry and be soft w/o frizz, then this will do that for you.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always in search of a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but also gives those dry ends a good soft feel once it rinses out.  </li>
            <li>This product is nice for those days when I don&#x27;t want to blow-dry or style my hair, I put a little into my freshly washed hair and let my hair air-dry; it took away some of the frizzes and left my hair soft and smelling good, leaving my hair looking very natural and casual.  </li>
            <li>I love cremes like this one, Ojon makes my other favorite one, and fear not, Fekkai&#x27;s is not greasy, I don&#x27;t recommend going overboard and applying too much, start small and see how much you need, but this makes any hair really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not too strong and it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>I live in a humid city</li>
            <li>After applying a tiny amount after the shower and letting it air dry, it was even more soft</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle yet warm and inviting.</li>
            <li>The other products in this collection is nice , I mean you need something to clean your hair</li>
            <li>use this after using my cleansing conditioner, and just a dab on the ends of my hair makes it very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>company does it all for you.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Fekkai Essential Shea Pot De Creme is the first product you might consider trying,&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>I then &amp;#34;plop&amp;#34; my hair with an old cotton t-shirt (if you don&#x27;t know plopping for your curly hair, you need to start doing it!)</li>
            <li>At first I put too much and it made my hair have too much volume and weighed down.</li>
            <li>I also like that the texture is easy to work with, just a little drop in palm, rub between hands, and use my fingers to brush through my hair</li>
            <li>Lightly smooths hair w out weighing it down</li>
            <li>I put a dab of this in my damp hair, then use it to smooth down any flyaways after styling.</li>
            <li>I have bleached blonde hair (dark underneath and not damaged but damaged on top).</li>
            <li>Not too heavy but strongly scented.</li>
            <li>The list price is a little steep for me as I am on a limited budget, but it would be a nice splurge every once in a while in order to pamper myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tracey S.</li>
            <li>&#x27;nt say enough about how soft my hair use to be very dry ad coarse not any more</li>
            <li>Makes my curls soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>We have soft water and it dries out my hair and takes away the shine.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair soft, but put together.</li>
            <li>It naturally creates S shaped waves but doesn&#x27;t curl</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair very silky feeling and possibly even healthier.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not such an issue if you use a bit too much.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>This smelled good and conditioned, but no better than a typical rinse in/out conditioner like Pantene.</li>
            <li>Very rich and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s well worth the price as it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>I have found it works best if I put a small amount, about dime size, in while it is wet and then work another small amount, about dime size, through when it is dry.</li>
            <li>I was afraid that would be way too much, but surprisingly my hair didn&#x27;t feel greasy or particularly weighed down.</li>
            <li>I have fine yet thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li>It does leave a little something on the hair for a while until it gets absorbed in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>feel the Pot De Cr&amp;egrave;me is really the star of Fekkai Essential Shea collection especially if you have hair similar to mine.  </li>
            <li>You DO have to be careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way - if you use too much, your hair will look very greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that I like to let air dry naturally due to the harsh effects of heat products.  </li>
            <li>The other reason is I really don&#x27;t like the scent.</li>
            <li>If you wash your hair daily (I don&#x27;t--color treated and I only need to shampoo every 3rd day, normally)</li>
            <li>The creme is thick and rich feeling.</li>
            <li>love it as a daily cream to add to my daughter&#x27;s very thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair down to my bra strap in back, you might need more or less.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s very thick it does absorb very quickly.</li>
            <li>barely use any so the pot will last and last.</li>
            <li>This worked okay on my long thin hair.  </li>
            <li>For me, it weighed my hair down a bit too much even with a tiny amount.  </li>

            <li> I just finished reviewing the shampoo, which wasn&#x27;t overly impressive</li>

            <li> I am so in love with this Shea Pot de Creme!!!!  </li>
            <li> For awesome hair, rub this into your damp hair before you ride, braid it, and when you get there you won&#x27;t have helmet hair.</li>

            <li> Great product from Fekkai.</li>

            <li> I still had some fly away -</li>
            <li> I still had some fly away - frizz.</li>
            <li> Great time saver.</li>
            <li> weddings, family parties, ect...and this Fekkai Essentail Shea works great for these times.</li>
            <li> But it does do a great job during the day when at work, keeps everything manageable and the smell is great.  </li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant but not obtrusive.  </li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this product for my hair to help with frizz, it works and I always get compliments on my hair smelling good.</li>
            <li> so I know it would be good so wanted to see what it could do for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love Fekkai hair products - they have a hair mask that is incredible - and this Pot de Creme product is no exception.  </li>
            <li> It smells so good by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does smell really good...</li>
            <li> Smells good and works effectivity.</li>
            <li> It does give a nice sheen and handles frizz very nicely.</li>
            <li> The product has an amazing smell to start with, a great smooth floral smell with a predominant smell of jasmine, really great.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this creme!</li>
            <li> That saves money and precious time, because you don&#x27;t have to go anywhere to look your best, and you don&#x27;t have to keep buying some hair product over and over for special occasions.</li>
            <li> It has a great smell and goes on easy.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and dose not freeze your hair.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest, who keeps the box that products come in?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like creamy bananas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it out before straightening my hair, so I kind of wonder what results I would get if I did that.</li>
            <li> As a styling cream this isn&#x27;t that kind of animal.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect curls with any kind of maintainable</li>
            <li> I find products in a tub to be kind of . . .</li>
            <li> There are times though when I want it to look nice, going out to dinner,</li>
            <li> So, that is nice.</li>
            <li> First thing: it smells strongly og honeysuckle, the greatest scent ever.</li>
            <li> This scent is best described as &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and it leaves your hair softly scented after your hair is dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This scent is best described as &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and it leaves your hair softly scented after your hair is dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> stuff is wonderful, I was surprised how large this jar is, it will last me forever and the scent is great; tropical flowers, scent of Jasmine blooming in moonlight, just delicious.</li>
            <li> Love what this product does for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this hair lotion...</li>
            <li> This is ok</li>
            <li> Love the smell and no buildup</li>
            <li> It is light and has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> a side note, I&#x27;ve also been using Fekkai Glossing Cream on the ends of my hair, to keep my hair glossy &amp; healthy looking, for years.</li>
            <li> The Shea Pot de Creme ( I love that name</li>
            <li> Works so much better than conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping too</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how much I love this hair creme.</li>
            <li> I sure don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> so you might as well use the shampoo as it doesn’t have sulfates in it which many of us know by now sulfates will strip your hair.  </li>
            <li> so honestly I’m asking a lot from this product to give me smooth , bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li> Hair is more tamed but not as defined as I would love for my hair to be without some sort of product.  </li>
            <li> Most make me gag.</li>
            <li> Hair has more control and weight provided to help with frizz than with shampoo  or shampoo + rinse out conditioner alone</li>
            <li> Most make me gag.</li>
            <li> Hair has more control and weight provided to help with frizz than with shampoo  or shampoo + rinse out conditioner alone</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It helps the ends feel more defined and in control during blow drying.</li>
            <li> It feels more like a leave in conditioner than a styling aide.</li>
            <li> I work that through, put three drops of Christophe Serum in my palms and run that over the top hair, and then i style.</li>
            <li> And then I&#x27;m going to buy more.</li>
            <li> It improved the texture, reduced fly-away and gave a bit more control.  </li>
            <li> Unlike most hair serums and glosses it did not make my hair look too greasy.  </li>
            <li> just for me, I wish it didn&#x27;t smell or that the smell would fade more</li>
            <li> The more you use this leave-in Cream the better it gets.</li>
            <li> This product really smells great.  </li>
            <li> recommend putting on after shower and not on the top of your scalp just on bottoms.</li>
            <li> This product works much better as a leave in conditioner instead of a styling product.</li>
            <li> Love this for my hear.</li>
            <li> So I have found this product really works great with hair that is acting up or is getting to frizzy for its own good.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not really all that impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I have a cupboard full of products that try to combat this, and most are okay.</li>
            <li> My hair dries with a soft curl (kind of like 1 or 2 natural ringlets) and has a wonderful texture and shine.</li>
            <li> I think for you lush, curly haired lasses will find it worth the money because it will make your curls even more beautiful</li>
            <li> This is a must for anyone with hair that has length to it due to damage that eventually happens, even the best shampoo and conditioner can benefit from a finishing creme like this one, I apply it after I wash and towel</li>
            <li> and it does frizz easily.</li>
            <li> Though I consider it more of a conditioner than a styling, aid, it does act as a light styling product, like a light mousse would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This scent is strong in my opinion but not gag me strong.  </li>
            <li> This scent is strong in my opinion but not gag me strong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, for another &amp;#34;hair goop&amp;#34; (as my husband refers to them), it&#x27;s a pretty nice one.  </li>
            <li> have fine, bleached, colored hair with just a bit of curl (that frizzes when you comb it).</li>
            <li> It feels nice and slippery which isn’t really helpful since the shampoo doesn’t tangle your hair.  </li>
            <li> I use the Pot de Creme 2-3 times a week, primarily as a leave-in conditioner (ie on damp hair).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;+ Smells fantastic, like all Fekkai</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first what the heck</li>
            <li> I have tried a Fekkai shampoo in the past and wasn&#x27;t overly impressed</li>
            <li> Nothing that&#x27;s going to hold a style w/o some product, but perfectly fine for running around the house looking like I have healthy hair (that also smells really good)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing that&#x27;s going to hold a style w/o some product, but perfectly fine for running around the house looking like I have healthy hair (that also smells really good)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Possibly might be better for someone with curlier hair than my own.</li>
            <li> but it just wasn&#x27;t anything special for me.</li>
            <li> This has a nice creamy consistency and leaves the hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I liked how this product made my hair feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> really makes the hair soft and silky and has a nice scent - would like it better in a squeeze tube though</li>
            <li> Did not do much for me in terms of making my wavy hair better looking or reducing frizz.  </li>
            <li> It smells really nice and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Absolutely lovely, and a very generous size.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about the scent is that is didn&#x27;t seem to stick with you--once it was on your hair and you washed your hands</li>
            <li> Hair is soft, soft, soft-- and smells great!</li>
            <li> It also keeps my hair looking healthy, which is especially awesome when my straight and thin hair is prone to dryness.</li>
            <li> You have the tool right at home to make every day a special occasion</li>
            <li> Then once I managed the amount being the size of a quarter for my long hair, it actually worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+ Makes your hair very very soft and healthy feeling.  </li>
            <li> It makes my yucky hair so pretty!  </li>
            <li> As each person is really different, this could be spectacular for you</li>
            <li> So, it would be nice if they could fix that in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on both wet and damp hair, and it does a good job at taming my wavy frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> Fekkai essential Shea  pot of creme is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have sexy soft shiny waves when you take the braid out.serious styling aid.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have sexy soft shiny waves when you take the braid out.</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for every day use as it is rather pricey, but when you want to look nice and have your hair hold up with out the frizz fry for more than half an hour, this will do the trick!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little strong and since I use it more for going out and special occasions when I like to wear perfume</li>
            <li> and I was thrilled at how long I stayed un-frizzed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a fresh scent that is light and not overpowering, but in my opinion its holding power really isn&#x27;t strong enough, though I&#x27;m sure your personal hair texture has a lot to do with it.</li>
            <li> Nice pre blow dry product.</li>
            <li> I have been loving FF products lately, and this is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li> Shea Butter is one of the best things for you hair you can use, but pure shea can be hard to apply and leaves hair kind of stiff.</li>
            <li> Very luxurious!</li>
            <li> It leaves hair soft and smooth without a residue type feeling.  </li>
            <li> and it never failed me.</li>
            <li> pretty good).&lt;br</li>
            <li> but not because it leaves my hair completely frizz free.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways I enjoy the smell of the products where I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to the smell of perfumes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways I enjoy the smell of the products where I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to the smell of perfumes.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really takes care of my frizzies!</li>
            <li> The softness and control last for most of the day.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say to use a generous amount, and the first time I used it, I used about a walnut-sized amount.</li>
            <li> just a finger dab into the jar, then rub between hands and scruch into hair, then brush and wait for it to settle into a soft, frizz free</li>
            <li> I reviewed a Pantene product that I could barely use in the shower because it smelled so strong.  </li>
            <li> I reviewed a Pantene product that I could barely use in the shower because it smelled so strong.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s rather fine, and this didn&#x27;t provide a whole lot of hold or control for wearing my hair natural.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> This product was made for people with thick, coarse or curly hair but it works great for us non curly girls as well!!!  </li>
            <li> It takes a little trial and error to figure out the right amount to use for your own hair.</li>
            <li> so I am reluctant to claim that my hair is actually healthier, but it seems to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used some Fekkai products and on my fine hair it left a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look, but I am pleased to say that this product does not do that.  </li>
            <li> flatironing I love how this helps my hair lay flat and flowing over my shoulders, not sticking straight out like sticks, as some curly hair does</li>
            <li> flatironing I love how this helps my hair lay flat and flowing over my shoulders, not sticking straight out like sticks, as some curly hair does</li>
            <li> My hair smells AMAZING, and it tames and moisturizes without weighing my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> and I was thrilled at how easy it was to distribute this luxe, thick, creamy conditioner!  </li>
            <li> The top is dry and coarse but the sides are silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> It did very well taming the frizz and helped make brushing a lot easier.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair (type 3b-3c) and my hair has really responded to this creme.</li>
            <li> The Pot De Cr&amp;egrave;me now is what you really need in the end .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really do like this product</li>
            <li> It can look really scraggy, ugh.  </li>
            <li> It really disappears into your hair.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to figuring out how much to use at a time.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> try my hair ( gently)</li>
            <li> The fragrance is pleasant and subtle.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty upset about it and went on a search for a new product that would define my curls and keep frizz at bay.</li>
            <li> Does NOT weigh your hair down (and I have very fine hair), or feel sticky.  </li>
            <li> My long straight fine hair has plenty of frizz in this Florida humidity.</li>
            <li> Decent hair cream.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> From the first use I had hair that looked healthier and was far more manageable on the hot, humid July and August days of late.</li>
            <li> am so happy to recommend Fekkai Essential Shea Pot De Creme that I jumped over four products I plan to review&lt;br /&gt;in order to let readers know that the outlay of money for this conditioner is very small considering the immediate results you get.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of this clams it all down and also adds a great shine and softness.  </li>
            <li> I also blow dried my hair after using and it was so much better than not using it.</li>
            <li> Most of the time that involves blowdrying and flatironing, and then I put just a few dabs of the Shea Creme in my palms and touch up the ends of my hair to give it cohesiveness.  </li>
            <li> If you want something to smooth through your hair to let it air dry and be soft w/o frizz, then this will do that for you.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always in search of a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but also gives those dry ends a good soft feel once it rinses out.  </li>
            <li> This product is nice for those days when I don&#x27;t want to blow-dry or style my hair, I put a little into my freshly washed hair and let my hair air-dry; it took away some of the frizzes and left my hair soft and smelling good, leaving my hair looking very natural and casual.  </li>
            <li> I love cremes like this one, Ojon makes my other favorite one, and fear not, Fekkai&#x27;s is not greasy, I don&#x27;t recommend going overboard and applying too much, start small and see how much you need, but this makes any hair really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too strong and it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I live in a humid city</li>
            <li> After applying a tiny amount after the shower and letting it air dry, it was even more soft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle yet warm and inviting.</li>
            <li> The other products in this collection is nice , I mean you need something to clean your hair</li>
            <li> use this after using my cleansing conditioner, and just a dab on the ends of my hair makes it very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> company does it all for you.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Fekkai Essential Shea Pot De Creme is the first product you might consider trying,&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> I then &amp;#34;plop&amp;#34; my hair with an old cotton t-shirt (if you don&#x27;t know plopping for your curly hair, you need to start doing it!)</li>
            <li> At first I put too much and it made my hair have too much volume and weighed down.</li>
            <li> I also like that the texture is easy to work with, just a little drop in palm, rub between hands, and use my fingers to brush through my hair</li>
            <li> Lightly smooths hair w out weighing it down</li>
            <li> I put a dab of this in my damp hair, then use it to smooth down any flyaways after styling.</li>
            <li> I have bleached blonde hair (dark underneath and not damaged but damaged on top).</li>
            <li> Not too heavy but strongly scented.</li>
            <li> The list price is a little steep for me as I am on a limited budget, but it would be a nice splurge every once in a while in order to pamper myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tracey S.</li>
            <li> &#x27;nt say enough about how soft my hair use to be very dry ad coarse not any more</li>
            <li> Makes my curls soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> We have soft water and it dries out my hair and takes away the shine.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair soft, but put together.</li>
            <li> It naturally creates S shaped waves but doesn&#x27;t curl</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair very silky feeling and possibly even healthier.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not such an issue if you use a bit too much.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> This smelled good and conditioned, but no better than a typical rinse in/out conditioner like Pantene.</li>
            <li> Very rich and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s well worth the price as it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I have found it works best if I put a small amount, about dime size, in while it is wet and then work another small amount, about dime size, through when it is dry.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that would be way too much, but surprisingly my hair didn&#x27;t feel greasy or particularly weighed down.</li>
            <li> I have fine yet thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It does leave a little something on the hair for a while until it gets absorbed in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> feel the Pot De Cr&amp;egrave;me is really the star of Fekkai Essential Shea collection especially if you have hair similar to mine.  </li>
            <li> You DO have to be careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way - if you use too much, your hair will look very greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that I like to let air dry naturally due to the harsh effects of heat products.  </li>
            <li> The other reason is I really don&#x27;t like the scent.</li>
            <li> If you wash your hair daily (I don&#x27;t--color treated and I only need to shampoo every 3rd day, normally)</li>
            <li> The creme is thick and rich feeling.</li>
            <li> love it as a daily cream to add to my daughter&#x27;s very thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair down to my bra strap in back, you might need more or less.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s very thick it does absorb very quickly.</li>
            <li> barely use any so the pot will last and last.</li>
            <li> This worked okay on my long thin hair.  </li>
            <li> For me, it weighed my hair down a bit too much even with a tiny amount.  </li>

            <li> But I&#x27;ve also worked the Shea Creme through my hair at bedtime while it was damp, put it up, and pulled down very soft curls the next day.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve also worked the Shea Creme through my hair at bedtime while it was damp, put it up, and pulled down very soft curls the next day.</li>
            <li> tiny bit of this goes a long way, so I&#x27;ll have this tub awhile.</li>
            <li> The only one minor thing I will say is that while I like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> My hair is color treated and pretty thick</li>
            <li> when my hair actually does dry, it doesn&#x27;t look frizzy at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally not bothered by scents, but there was just something strange about this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and creamy and although I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent</li>
            <li> Just wish Fekkai would bring back the All Day Hair Fluff.  </li>
            <li> It does NOT seem to last all day, however, which is partially why I&#x27;ve docked a star.</li>
            <li> but this is a little bit nicer and it works just as well if you use different shampoo and conditioner outside this brand/product line.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to overuse as it can make your hair flat.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using it with the other products in this line ( the Essential Shea Shampoo and Conditioner ) and I have also tried it alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally dry hair</li>
            <li> I am middle-aged, with dry middle-aged, over processed hair.  </li>
            <li> I use dry shampoo on my scalp also, and could have gone four days with no shampoo</li>
            <li> I would say this one is slightly above average in that</li>
            <li> This helped to put it back in and keep some of the frizz down.</li>
            <li> I still practice this while using Essential Shea Pot De Cr&amp;egrave;me and my hair still isn&#x27;t weighed down.</li>
            <li> It has a very soft, neutral scent ad has a thick creamy consistency.</li>
            <li> but this Shea Pot De Cream is a real winner to say the least!</li>
            <li> I am a little concerned it will create scalp buildup, so I will keep up on my occasional clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> For a little boost I sometimes put a tiny dab of the Fekkai Glossing Cream in with the Shea Creme before working through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And while it provides some hold and styling, it makes my hair look very natural rather than stiff or heavily styled.</li>
            <li> This product is like manna from heaven for anyone who tends to have more &#x27;bad hair days&#x27; than you would care to.</li>
            <li> When my hair is still wet from the shower, I rub in about a quarter sized dollop of this, maybe nickel sized.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and this stuff is the only thing that allows me to actually comb it after a shower.</li>
            <li> And it can feel stiff and cotton-candyish, double ugh.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of undesirable residue on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I’ve been using this before June 30, 2014 when I did a review on the other products in the collection.  </li>
            <li> I use Fekkai products already butI don&#x27;t have thick, coarse or curly hair.</li>
            <li> Both left disappointing results - Ouidad&#x27;s left my hair semi-crunchy; Paul Mitchell&#x27;s left my hair feeling a bit weighed down (</li>
            <li> It takes all the frizz out without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I style my hair using this cream in less than 2 min.</li>
            <li> my hair shines and is less frizzy.</li>
            <li> In the summer, I just wear my hair up, less hassle</li>
            <li> My hair has less damage to it and relaxes the curls a bit but not where it looks greasy or  </li>
            <li> Packaging was not good - container was open and product was oozing out.</li>
            <li> Sometimes shea butter products are so heavy that they weight down your hair, but when I use this product, I keep my style all day.</li>
            <li> It defines my curls wonderfully (no crunch!), makes them silky soft, doesn&#x27;t weigh them down, keeps frizz at bay, and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps to “weigh” my hair down a bit ( think fluffy poodle hair otherwise ) but there are always a few strands of hair sticking out.  </li>
            <li> and I do like this little pot de creme.  </li>
            <li> - my hair felt a little sticky and it didn&#x27;t help keep the style at all.  </li>
            <li> Helps Eliminate frizz, allowing hair to air dry without looking ridiculous.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really missing Fekkai as my go-to product, so I went to their website and used their &amp;#34;Consult Frederic&amp;#34; survey.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to pin this product down into one category, so let me tell you what I use it for.</li>
            <li> If you experience dry and frizzy hair and don&#x27;t like the way conditioners weigh your hair down--especially if you have thin hair</li>
            <li> I use just a small amount of this when my hair is damp, concentrating on the ends.</li>
            <li> I have just past my shoulders course</li>
            <li> You put a small amount in the hair after shampooing--just before drying/styling.</li>
            <li> icky</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, curly, and shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I have lots of medium, thick and semi-coarse, shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I have medium length thick wavy hair that can get quite frizzy in the summertime.  </li>
            <li> me feel like tossing my hair in slow motion as I run through a field of daisies.  </li>
            <li> mean</li>
            <li> I consider it a serious styling aid.</li>
            <li> Knowing that it was Fekkai, I figured I&#x27;d at the very least LIKE it for something.</li>
            <li> The humidity hasn&#x27;t been too horrible here this year, but we did go to one outdoor family party on a very humid day</li>
            <li> I have not found a bad apple yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> why do you hate</li>
            <li> For me sulfates gave me terrible dandruff</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I like it and I don&#x27;t mind the smell.  Just wish Fekkai would bring back the All Day Hair Fluff.  Nothing replaces the way that product makes my hair look, feel, and smell.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Love what this product does for my hair. I have naturally dry hair and this product does a great job smoothing out my hair and adding control. Have recommended to multiple people!</li>
            <li> Great product from Fekkai. I style my hair using this cream in less than 2 min. It smells amazing and dose not freeze your hair. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this hair lotion... my hair shines and is less frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this product for my hair to help with frizz, it works and I always get compliments on my hair smelling good. Just a dab&#x27;l do ya!</li>
            <li> &#x27;nt say enough about how soft my hair use to be very dry ad coarse not any more</li>
            <li> This is ok but I&#x27;m not really all that impressed with this product.  I prefer the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing creme.</li>
            <li> love it as a daily cream to add to my daughter&#x27;s very thick curly hair.  It softens it.  Love the smell and no buildup</li>
            <li> Really like this product. It is light and has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for thick coarse hair. It takes all the frizz out without weighing my hair down. Makes my curls soft and manageable. Very luxurious!</li>
            <li> Fekkai Essential Shea Pot De Creme! Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fekkai is the best health/beauty haircare line Amazon carries, in my opinion..&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to say this.&lt;br /&gt;I mean it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying every Fekkai product Amazon offers,so that I can become thoroughly informed concerning Amazon&#x27;s Fekkai lineup.  I have not found a bad apple yet.&lt;br /&gt;This company does it all for you.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Fekkai Essential Shea Pot De Creme is the first product you might consider trying,&lt;br /&gt;Once you get it you will understand why.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t make a mistake with this hair conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never looked or felt better.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to recommend Fekkai Essential Shea Pot De Creme that I jumped over four products I plan to review&lt;br /&gt;in order to let readers know that the outlay of money for this conditioner is very small considering the immediate results you get.&lt;br /&gt;You barely use any so the pot will last and last. That saves money and precious time, because you don&#x27;t have to go anywhere to look your best, and you don&#x27;t have to keep buying some hair product over and over for special occasions. You have the tool right at home to make every day a special occasion effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;jean</li>
            <li> Product very good. Packaging was not good - container was open and product was oozing out. Decided to keep instead of return, and I do like the stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product for all hair types!</li>
            <li> We have soft water and it dries out my hair and takes away the shine. This helped to put it back in and keep some of the frizz down. It has a great smell and goes on easy. It takes a little trial and error to figure out the right amount to use for your own hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this along with the Fekkai Essential Shea shampoo and I do like this little pot de creme.  It leaves hair soft and smooth without a residue type feeling.  I just finished reviewing the shampoo, which wasn&#x27;t overly impressive but this is a little bit nicer and it works just as well if you use different shampoo and conditioner outside this brand/product line.</li>
            <li> My long straight fine hair has plenty of frizz in this Florida humidity. I used this after using the Fekkai essential shea shampoo and conditioner. After applying a tiny amount after the shower and letting it air dry, it was even more soft and I didn&#x27;t think that was possible. It did very well taming the frizz and helped make brushing a lot easier. I also blow dried my hair after using and it was so much better than not using it. It&#x27;s very thick and creamy and although I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent it&#x27;s not too strong and it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Although it&#x27;s very thick it does absorb very quickly. A tiny amount is key.</li>
            <li> I used to use Fekkai&#x27;s Perfectly Luscious Curls Cr&amp;egrave;me...until recently, when I found out they discontinued the entire line! I&#x27;d been using it for years and it never failed me. I was pretty upset about it and went on a search for a new product that would define my curls and keep frizz at bay. I tried Ouidad&#x27;s Moisture Lock Define &amp; Shine Curl Styling Gel-Cr&amp;egrave;me, and Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Curls Twirl Around Crunch-Free Curl Definer. Both left disappointing results - Ouidad&#x27;s left my hair semi-crunchy; Paul Mitchell&#x27;s left my hair feeling a bit weighed down (though I have to admit, it smelled pretty good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really missing Fekkai as my go-to product, so I went to their website and used their &amp;#34;Consult Frederic&amp;#34; survey. Lo &amp; behold, it recommended their Essential Shea Pot De Cr&amp;egrave;me. Bought it, used it and haven&#x27;t looked back! It defines my curls wonderfully (no crunch!), makes them silky soft, doesn&#x27;t weigh them down, keeps frizz at bay, and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I&#x27;ve also been using Fekkai Glossing Cream on the ends of my hair, to keep my hair glossy &amp; healthy looking, for years. I still practice this while using Essential Shea Pot De Cr&amp;egrave;me and my hair still isn&#x27;t weighed down.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, curly, and shoulder length. The top is dry and coarse but the sides are silky smooth. I was really not impressed by this product; I had much better luck with deep conditioner by Nexxus in a tub. This smelled good and conditioned, but no better than a typical rinse in/out conditioner like Pantene. As each person is really different, this could be spectacular for you but it just wasn&#x27;t anything special for me.</li>
            <li> The Shea Pot de Creme ( I love that name lol) Product is used when hair is damp before styling. Very rich and a little goes a long way. I have short hair, so a jar this size will last for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protects hair and provides moisturizing effect to prevent damage from styling. Helps prevent flyaways and frizzies.Be careful not to overuse as it can make your hair flat.</li>
            <li> I recieved Fekkai Essential Shea Pot De Creme as a Vine review. I use Fekkai products already butI don&#x27;t have thick, coarse or curly hair. Since it&#x27;s Fekkai so I know it would be good so wanted to see what it could do for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, bleached, colored hair with just a bit of curl (that frizzes when you comb it). This product was made for people with thick, coarse or curly hair but it works great for us non curly girls as well!!!  I am so in love with this Shea Pot de Creme!!!!  I&#x27;ve been using this a weekly deep conditioner. I put it on at bed time and work it into my hair.  In the morning I get up and shampoo and my hair is so soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you open the container, the smell is heavenly!!! The creme is thick and rich feeling. I wish they had a body moisturizer version. Where can I get a perfume version!  I think it&#x27;s well worth the price as it will last me a long time. I think for you lush, curly haired lasses will find it worth the money because it will make your curls even more beautiful</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and this stuff is the only thing that allows me to actually comb it after a shower. Works so much better than conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping too</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how much I love this hair creme. I have curly hair (type 3b-3c) and my hair has really responded to this creme. I use a bit of it after my shower, finger combing it through my hair. I then &amp;#34;plop&amp;#34; my hair with an old cotton t-shirt (if you don&#x27;t know plopping for your curly hair, you need to start doing it!) for about 20 minutes. I diffuse my roots with my blow dryer and I&#x27;m done! This product leaves my hair soft, but put together. I still experience a bit of a &amp;#34;curl halo&amp;#34; but it isn&#x27;t as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only quibble with this product has to do with packaging. There isn&#x27;t anywhere on the actual product that lists the ingredients - that&#x27;s on the box it comes in. Let&#x27;s be honest, who keeps the box that products come in? I sure don&#x27;t. So, it would be nice if they could fix that in the future.</li>
            <li> I finally feel I can review the Fekkai Essential Shea Pot De Cr&amp;egrave;me ( misspelled it seems on Amazon as Shea Pot De Crme)  I received.  I’ve been using it with the other products in this line ( the Essential Shea Shampoo and Conditioner ) and I have also tried it alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I go into the review of the product I think it will help to describe my hair type. I have lots of medium, thick and semi-coarse, shoulder length hair. It naturally creates S shaped waves but doesn&#x27;t curl and it does frizz easily. My hair isn&#x27;t damaged to my knowledge. It&#x27;s not colored, permed etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel the Pot De Cr&amp;egrave;me is really the star of Fekkai Essential Shea collection especially if you have hair similar to mine.  The other products in this collection is nice , I mean you need something to clean your hair so you might as well use the shampoo as it doesn’t have sulfates in it which many of us know by now sulfates will strip your hair.  For me sulfates gave me terrible dandruff but that’s another story.  The rinse out conditioner in my opinion could be omitted.  It feels nice and slippery which isn’t really helpful since the shampoo doesn’t tangle your hair.  The Pot De Cr&amp;egrave;me now is what you really need in the end .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So back to the Pot De Cr&amp;egrave;me.  I’ve been using this before June 30, 2014 when I did a review on the other products in the collection.  I really do like this product and I’m close to being inlove with it but not because it leaves my hair completely frizz free.  I live in a humid city so honestly I’m asking a lot from this product to give me smooth , bouncy curls.  Without something else that’s just not going to happen.  However I do see a difference when I use it.  It helps to “weigh” my hair down a bit ( think fluffy poodle hair otherwise ) but there are always a few strands of hair sticking out.  Hair is more tamed but not as defined as I would love for my hair to be without some sort of product.  Dang genetics why do you hate me?!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I enjoy the smell of the products where I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to the smell of perfumes.  Most make me gag. I reviewed a Pantene product that I could barely use in the shower because it smelled so strong.  This scent is strong in my opinion but not gag me strong.  This scent is best described as &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and it leaves your hair softly scented after your hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summarizing everything here is the Good vs Bad for the Pot De Cr&amp;egrave;me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;* Hair has more control and weight provided to help with frizz than with shampoo  or shampoo + rinse out conditioner alone&lt;br /&gt;*  Scent is perfumed but not over whelming.&lt;br /&gt;* Replaces the rinse out conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;* Hair is soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD:&lt;br /&gt;* For my hair I still had some fly away - frizz.hate me?!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I enjoy the smell of the products where I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to the smell of perfumes.

            <li> I LOVE the smell of this stuff.  It&#x27;s kind of like creamy bananas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, for another &amp;#34;hair goop&amp;#34; (as my husband refers to them), it&#x27;s a pretty nice one.  I&#x27;ve used it on both wet and damp hair, and it does a good job at taming my wavy frizzy hair.  A little bit goes a long way, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of undesirable residue on my hair.  I haven&#x27;t tried it out before straightening my hair, so I kind of wonder what results I would get if I did that.</li>
            <li> Decent hair cream. Not too heavy but strongly scented. Diminishes w time, but takes a while. Lightly smooths hair w out weighing it down</li>
            <li> I have medium length thick wavy hair that can get quite frizzy in the summertime.  This product is nice for those days when I don&#x27;t want to blow-dry or style my hair, I put a little into my freshly washed hair and let my hair air-dry; it took away some of the frizzes and left my hair soft and smelling good, leaving my hair looking very natural and casual.  This product did not work well for me when I used it before styling my hair by blow-drying - my hair felt a little sticky and it didn&#x27;t help keep the style at all.  Overall, I will use this product but probably only on the weekend when I want to refrain from a styled hair style.</li>
            <li> Fekkai essential Shea  pot of creme is a nice product.  I have very fine hair that I like to let air dry naturally due to the harsh effects of heat products.  This product leaves my hair very silky feeling and possibly even healthier.  I have been using it for 1 and 1/2 weeks so I am reluctant to claim that my hair is actually healthier, but it seems to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used some Fekkai products and on my fine hair it left a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look, but I am pleased to say that this product does not do that.  My hair dries with a soft curl (kind of like 1 or 2 natural ringlets) and has a wonderful texture and shine. The list price is a little steep for me as I am on a limited budget, but it would be a nice splurge every once in a while in order to pamper myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tracey S.</li>
            <li> Very nice!  A little goes a long way - if you use too much, your hair will look very greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this after using my cleansing conditioner, and just a dab on the ends of my hair makes it very soft and manageable.  The fragrance is pleasant and subtle.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This seems to be a thicker version of the styling creme in a tube. I have fine yet thick wavy hair. I use just a small amount of this when my hair is damp, concentrating on the ends. It helps the ends feel more defined and in control during blow drying. It has a very soft, neutral scent ad has a thick creamy consistency. It feels more like a leave in conditioner than a styling aide. I am a little concerned it will create scalp buildup, so I will keep up on my occasional clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> Shea Butter is one of the best things for you hair you can use, but pure shea can be hard to apply and leaves hair kind of stiff. This has a nice creamy consistency and leaves the hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love Fekkai hair products - they have a hair mask that is incredible - and this Pot de Creme product is no exception.  I am middle-aged, with dry middle-aged, over processed hair.  It can look really scraggy, ugh.  And it can feel stiff and cotton-candyish, double ugh.  I use the Pot de Creme 2-3 times a week, primarily as a leave-in conditioner (ie on damp hair).  It makes my yucky hair so pretty!  And it isn&#x27;t greasy.  Love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+ Smells fantastic, like all Fekkai products.&lt;br /&gt;+ Makes your hair very very soft and healthy feeling.  Suddenly I can run my fingers through my hair!&lt;br /&gt;+ Does NOT weigh your hair down (and I have very fine hair), or feel sticky.  (Note - I have a chin-length bob and I use a quarter-sized amount, and start about 2&amp;#34; below the roots...)  It really disappears into your hair.&lt;br /&gt;+ Tames the East Coast Humidity Frizzies&lt;br /&gt;+ Though I consider it more of a conditioner than a styling, aid, it does act as a light styling product, like a light mousse would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;None yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:&lt;br /&gt;Makes me feel like tossing my hair in slow motion as I run through a field of daisies.  Hair is soft, soft, soft-- and smells great!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first what the heck this stuff was, when I got it. Knowing that it was Fekkai, I figured I&#x27;d at the very least LIKE it for something. It smells so good by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking at this as a &#x27;curl cream&#x27;, as in styling cream, don&#x27;t get it for that. You want Deva Curl. As a styling cream this isn&#x27;t that kind of animal. It doesn&#x27;t give curls enough holding power to hold a curl in a style. If you want something to smooth through your hair to let it air dry and be soft w/o frizz, then this will do that for you. Just don&#x27;t expect curls with any kind of maintainable structure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to pin this product down into one category, so let me tell you what I use it for. I have bleached blonde hair (dark underneath and not damaged but damaged on top). When my hair is still wet from the shower, I rub in about a quarter sized dollop of this, maybe nickel sized. I have long hair down to my bra strap in back, you might need more or less. I work that through, put three drops of Christophe Serum in my palms and run that over the top hair, and then i style. Most of the time that involves blowdrying and flatironing, and then I put just a few dabs of the Shea Creme in my palms and touch up the ends of my hair to give it cohesiveness.  The next day I might do a tiny bit of Shea Creme in my hair again and do a touchup flatiron job. I use dry shampoo on my scalp also, and could have gone four days with no shampoo If I hadn&#x27;t had to leave the house on day four. This stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to build up at all----but I also keep it away from my scalp. For a little boost I sometimes put a tiny dab of the Fekkai Glossing Cream in with the Shea Creme before working through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tiny bit of this goes a long way, so I&#x27;ll have this tub awhile. And then I&#x27;m going to buy more. With the three products I mentioned, I get silky flowing hair for days from just one flatiron session--silky and flowing, not poufy, strawlike, damaged! I consider it a serious styling aid. But I&#x27;ve also worked the Shea Creme through my hair at bedtime while it was damp, put it up, and pulled down very soft curls the next day. Nothing that&#x27;s going to hold a style w/o some product, but perfectly fine for running around the house looking like I have healthy hair (that also smells really good)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For flatironing I love how this helps my hair lay flat and flowing over my shoulders, not sticking straight out like sticks, as some curly hair does when you flatiron it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if you ride a motorcycle without a helmet or don&#x27;t put your hair up into your helmet or ponytail, work some of this through your ends before you ride. NO TANGLES. For awesome hair, rub this into your damp hair before you ride, braid it, and when you get there you won&#x27;t have helmet hair. You&#x27;ll have sexy soft shiny waves when you take the braid out.serious styling aid.

            <li> I liked how this product made my hair feel soft and silky. You DO have to be careful not to use too much. I&#x27;m still getting used to figuring out how much to use at a time. It does give a nice sheen and handles frizz very nicely. If you wash your hair daily (I don&#x27;t--color treated and I only need to shampoo every 3rd day, normally), it&#x27;s not such an issue if you use a bit too much. All in all a very good product that delivers.</li>
            <li> This worked okay on my long thin hair.  It improved the texture, reduced fly-away and gave a bit more control.  Unlike most hair serums and glosses it did not make my hair look too greasy.  The smell is pleasant but not obtrusive.  I find products in a tub to be kind of . . . icky and I would prefer a tube.</li>
            <li> Great time saver. Helps Eliminate frizz, allowing hair to air dry without looking ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Love this creme! This stuff really takes care of my frizzies! I have just past my shoulders course curly hair and I dread the humidity because it just frizzes it all up...you know what I&#x27;m talking about. In the summer, I just wear my hair up, less hassle and I just don&#x27;t have the time to fool with it every day. There are times though when I want it to look nice, going out to dinner, weddings, family parties, ect...and this Fekkai Essentail Shea works great for these times. I have found it works best if I put a small amount, about dime size, in while it is wet and then work another small amount, about dime size, through when it is dry. The humidity hasn&#x27;t been too horrible here this year, but we did go to one outdoor family party on a very humid day and I was thrilled at how long I stayed un-frizzed. Same results at a wedding where there was lots of dancing. I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for every day use as it is rather pricey, but when you want to look nice and have your hair hold up with out the frizz fry for more than half an hour, this will do the trick! It even helped add a day or two to my blow outs. The only one minor thing I will say is that while I like the smell of it. It does smell really good...just for me, I wish it didn&#x27;t smell or that the smell would fade more, it&#x27;s a little strong and since I use it more for going out and special occasions when I like to wear perfume and sometimes it clashes.</li>
            <li> The product has an amazing smell to start with, a great smooth floral smell with a predominant smell of jasmine, really great. So I have found this product really works great with hair that is acting up or is getting to frizzy for its own good.  Just a little bit of this clams it all down and also adds a great shine and softness.  It does leave a little something on the hair for a while until it gets absorbed in my opinion.  But it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling or rub off on anything.  The softness and control last for most of the day.  But I wouldn&#x27;t expect to put it on in the morning and expect to still have control when you go out at night for drinks.  But it does do a great job during the day when at work, keeps everything manageable and the smell is great.  If you have a question about the product leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.</li>
            <li> This product is like manna from heaven for anyone who tends to have more &#x27;bad hair days&#x27; than you would care to. If you experience dry and frizzy hair and don&#x27;t like the way conditioners weigh your hair down--especially if you have thin hair like I do then this the the hair care product you&#x27;ve been looking for. Fist off it smells divine. You put a small amount in the hair after shampooing--just before drying/styling. From the first use I had hair that looked healthier and was far more manageable on the hot, humid July and August days of late. The more you use this leave-in Cream the better it gets. I have tried a Fekkai shampoo in the past and wasn&#x27;t overly impressed but this Shea Pot De Cream is a real winner to say the least! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. Try it!</li>
            <li> Nice pre blow dry product.</li>
            <li> Holy grail conditioner</li>
            <li> really makes the hair soft and silky and has a nice scent - would like it better in a squeeze tube though</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for curly hair!!</li>
            <li> This product really smells great.  Did not do much for me in terms of making my wavy hair better looking or reducing frizz.  For me, it weighed my hair down a bit too much even with a tiny amount.  I also felt as though my hair was sticky.  Possibly might be better for someone with curlier hair than my own.</li>
            <li> Sometimes shea butter products are so heavy that they weight down your hair, but when I use this product, I keep my style all day.</li>
            <li> This hair cream softens hair with a silky texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hold a style well in humid weather.  Also, it can tend to feel sticky and leave hair feeling coated or filmy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a fresh scent that is light and not overpowering, but in my opinion its holding power really isn&#x27;t strong enough, though I&#x27;m sure your personal hair texture has a lot to do with it.</li>
            <li> At first I put too much and it made my hair have too much volume and weighed down. (In unison with Fekkai shampoo &amp; conditioner). Then once I managed the amount being the size of a quarter for my long hair, it actually worked perfectly. My hair has less damage to it and relaxes the curls a bit but not where it looks greasy or  weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend putting on after shower and not on the top of your scalp just on bottoms.</li>
            <li> This product works much better as a leave in conditioner instead of a styling product. I have naturally curly hair that&#x27;s rather fine, and this didn&#x27;t provide a whole lot of hold or control for wearing my hair natural. However, if I used a small amount of this product with a curl cream like Not Your Mother&#x27;s Kinky Moves, it works pretty well.  It smells really nice and leaves my hair soft. The instructions say to use a generous amount, and the first time I used it, I used about a walnut-sized amount. I was afraid that would be way too much, but surprisingly my hair didn&#x27;t feel greasy or particularly weighed down. However, I cut back on the amount quite a bit, and I still get the same benefits.</li>
            <li> Wow…. the fragrance is so pleasing and I was thrilled at how easy it was to distribute this luxe, thick, creamy conditioner!  My hair is color treated and pretty thick so I&#x27;m always in search of a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but also gives those dry ends a good soft feel once it rinses out.  Rinsing out is a breeze and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or greasiness.  Happy!</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of it. It&#x27;s subtle yet warm and inviting. People sometimes ask me what perfume I use when it&#x27;s actually my hair. So, that is nice. I also like that the texture is easy to work with, just a little drop in palm, rub between hands, and use my fingers to brush through my hair however you want. And while it provides some hold and styling, it makes my hair look very natural rather than stiff or heavily styled. It also keeps my hair looking healthy, which is especially awesome when my straight and thin hair is prone to dryness.</li>
            <li> I have been loving FF products lately, and this is probably my favorite. First thing: it smells strongly og honeysuckle, the greatest scent ever. I put a dab of this in my damp hair, then use it to smooth down any flyaways after styling. My hair smells AMAZING, and it tames and moisturizes without weighing my hair down at all. Absolutely lovely, and a very generous size.</li>
            <li> This is a must for anyone with hair that has length to it due to damage that eventually happens, even the best shampoo and conditioner can benefit from a finishing creme like this one, I apply it after I wash and towel try my hair ( gently) just a finger dab into the jar, then rub between hands and scruch into hair, then brush and wait for it to settle into a soft, frizz free style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is wonderful, I was surprised how large this jar is, it will last me forever and the scent is great; tropical flowers, scent of Jasmine blooming in moonlight, just delicious. I love cremes like this one, Ojon makes my other favorite one, and fear not, Fekkai&#x27;s is not greasy, I don&#x27;t recommend going overboard and applying too much, start small and see how much you need, but this makes any hair really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have just-past-shoulder-length wavy hair that gets frizzy upon drying. I have a cupboard full of products that try to combat this, and most are okay. I would say this one is slightly above average in that when my hair actually does dry, it doesn&#x27;t look frizzy at all. It does NOT seem to last all day, however, which is partially why I&#x27;ve docked a star. The other reason is I really don&#x27;t like the scent. I&#x27;m generally not bothered by scents, but there was just something strange about this one. The only good thing about the scent is that is didn&#x27;t seem to stick with you--once it was on your hair and you washed your hands it was unnoticeable. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this for my hear. Smells good and works effectivity.</li>
