            <li>and it gets better after couple of hours in.  </li>

            <li>I remember smelling this cologne a long time ago and loved it but now tried it again and didn&#x27;t think it was that great.  </li>
            <li>Very clean smell and not over powering.</li>
            <li>but it again, for the price I  can get another good smelling summer scent that will last longer on my skin, the good thing about this one is that not too many people will be smelling like you.</li>
            <li>I always look for that special design which is unique and almost no one wears!</li>
            <li>Nice, clean smell on me and REALLY inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I wear very unique garments special ordered online, very fashionable and very unique suits, dress shirts, jewelry, watches ..... and colognes.</li>
            <li>All well worth it!</li>
            <li>I wear extremely unique and fashionable designs.</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh, smooth and unique.</li>
            <li>I love unique scents, but this smells like something I could have purchased at CVS, and I&#x27;m very upset that I can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I started wearing Quasar when I was in the Navy back in the 90&#x27;s and have loved it ever since.</li>
            <li>This cool, crisp unique scent is well worth it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, Halloween for women from same designer is simply amazing..</li>
            <li>Nice european fresh smell...</li>
            <li>The prelude is fruity with fresh aquatic presence.</li>
            <li>I was given this Eau De Toilette a few years ago &amp; liked it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Was really pleased when i saw it on Amazon &amp; ordered it right away</li>
            <li>Just right</li>
            <li>This essence is neither too strong nor too soft.</li>
            <li>The cost is very cheap compared to any perfumania store or similar stores.</li>
            <li>Got it years back and had sooooo many compliments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I gave this a try as I will probably buy another bottle in the future.</li>
            <li>after that he brag about the perfumes to my other cousin&#x27;s who experienced the same thing like he did, which is couldn&#x27;t find it everywhere.</li>
            <li>It lasts for a long of time on the skin and more if you spray your clothing.</li>
            <li>I am a very particular perfectionist.</li>
            <li>It gets me in trouble, but I still love it!</li>
            <li>This cologne is a classic that every men should try!</li>
            <li>When my wife wears it I really notice it ;-</li>
            <li>I usually keep 16 bottles of top colognes in stock but almost none of them came close to this!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is in my mind more of a evening/nighttime scent than your average daytime \\&quot;citrus\\&quot; cologne.</li>
            <li>After all, Jesus Del Pozo was a Spanish designer (he passed away a while back) and if one cannot find it anywhere, then he has to be able to find it in Spain.</li>
            <li>The funny thing is that a while back when I first ran out of them, they could not be found anywhere in States.</li>
            <li>It smells different than most of my other colognes I usually buy and I have already got good compliments from people I work with.</li>
            <li>I have used this product over many years and then changed to another fragrance a few years ago.</li>
            <li>If you have never tried Quasar but are looking for a great mature summer type cologne you will never go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li>I am a fan!&lt;br /&gt;Knowing that every fragrance is different for everyone I suggest trying it out first.</li>
            <li>get me wrong, it&#x27;s good... but</li>
            <li>Cannot deny that its artificial, but its pleasantly so, and I would not expect anything natural for 30 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Its not aggressive and definitely suited for all occasions.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>its a rare perfume and hard to find in stores.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This scent is slightly different than the last time I bought it. This scent is stronger than I remember it. My husband also says it seems stronger.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a classic that every men should try!</li>
            <li> I have been using this fragrance for years until it seem discontinued everywhere.  My wife just noticed it displayed at Dillard&#x27;s last Saturday so to my pleasant surprise I re-discovered it here at Amazon.  I will buy a couple of bottles this time to stock up.  This essence is neither too strong nor too soft. Just right and it gets better after couple of hours in.  Try it you won&#x27;t regret it.  What a great bargain too.. Also, Halloween for women from same designer is simply amazing.. When my wife wears it I really notice it ;-</li>
            <li> I started wearing Quasar when I was in the Navy back in the 90&#x27;s and have loved it ever since. It is nice to see that it is still available through Amazon. If you have never tried Quasar but are looking for a great mature summer type cologne you will never go wrong with this one. Enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> It gets me in trouble, but I still love it! Went through 3 girlfriends and 1 boyfriend before finishing the bottle! All well worth it! People just grab you! It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Very good fresh summer scent but longevity is about 3 hrs on my skin, I probably wont but it again, for the price I  can get another good smelling summer scent that will last longer on my skin, the good thing about this one is that not too many people will be smelling like you.</li>
            <li> I have used this product over many years and then changed to another fragrance a few years ago. When I saw it listed on Amazon,I thought to try it once more.     I have now purchased three (3) bottles during the past few weeks, intent on using the product again for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many colognes and this stands out among the rest.  The best part is anybody I talk to about it has never heard of it unlike Eternity or Escape, which everybody else uses.  You want to stand out, then wear Quasar, but stick with the cologne instead of the aftershave...the scent lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne! Got it years back and had sooooo many compliments. Paid $50 for it back then and found it on here for nearly half that price. When I run out I will buy another bottle. Very clean smell and not over powering. Give it a try I promise youll get told how good you smell!</li>
            <li> This cologne has a nice woody undertone.  I know my wife likes it a lot when I wear it.  I&#x27;ve ordered this cologne twice after it ran out.</li>
            <li> I was given this Eau De Toilette a few years ago &amp; liked it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Was really pleased when i saw it on Amazon &amp; ordered it right away (it&#x27;s a bargain!).&lt;br /&gt;The scent is in my mind more of a evening/nighttime scent than your average daytime \\&quot;citrus\\&quot; cologne.</li>
            <li> Nice, clean smell on me and REALLY inexpensive.  $35 for 4.2 oz of a quality cologne?  Amazing.</li>
            <li> I love it,smells like citricus and wood,i always buy it,my girlfriend also love that i used this parfume,so just try it</li>
            <li> This cologne is the best smelling cologne ever. Nice european fresh smell... Good for always, I will keep buying this product! The cost is very cheap compared to any perfumania store or similar stores.</li>
            <li> I am a very particular perfectionist. I wear very unique garments special ordered online, very fashionable and very unique suits, dress shirts, jewelry, watches ..... and colognes. I do not follow the hype of the day or fashion updates but I make my own getup disregarding the trend of the day or month. For instance I wear band neck or Nehru suits and band color shirts with triple pleaded trousers with suspenders. I always look for that special design which is unique and almost no one wears! I wear extremely unique and fashionable designs. Quasar by Jesus Del Pozo is one of those items. Long time ago I purchased a bottle in USA and once I smelled it on my skin, I just fell in love with it. I usually keep 16 bottles of top colognes in stock but almost none of them came close to this! When I finished this bottle, I could not find it anywhere in USA. When travelling to Latin Europe and North Africa, I put it on my list to purchase Quasar in Spain. After all, Jesus Del Pozo was a Spanish designer (he passed away a while back) and if one cannot find it anywhere, then he has to be able to find it in Spain. Once in Spain, I purchased a few bottles in the department store and brought them back to America. The second time I ran out, it was no problem because Amazon started to bring them. The funny thing is that a while back when I first ran out of them, they could not be found anywhere in States. So just recently I have purchased another 2 bottles from Amazon. I assure you that at this price, you cannot go wrong! No one sells you Quasar at this price. If you want to dress different and smell different, if you want to make a statement, if you walk against the trend and if you swim against the wave, this is your cologne. This fragrance will make people stop and smell you and wonder what it is! It smells so fresh, smooth and unique. You want to be different? Then Jesus Del Pozo is your man!</li>
            <li> Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it would be dynamic and different.  I was wrong on both accounts.  I love unique scents, but this smells like something I could have purchased at CVS, and I&#x27;m very upset that I can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34; material. Come on Amazon...</li>
            <li> I remember smelling this cologne a long time ago and loved it but now tried it again and didn&#x27;t think it was that great.  Maybe my taste has changed.</li>
            <li> This cool, crisp unique scent is well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Created and made in Spain...I am a fan!&lt;br /&gt;Knowing that every fragrance is different for everyone I suggest trying it out first.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband because of the great reviews. That, and I LOVE the halloween perfume for myself!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s good... but probably not one that I&#x27;d buy again. It didn&#x27;t give me the same feel as when I smell Aqua Di Gio for instance...</li>
            <li> I accidentally know this perfume cause my cousin&#x27;s has been looking for it for quite sometimes but he couldn&#x27;t find it everywhere. he asked for my help so i browsed &amp; find it on amazon. Without hesitation, i ordered 3 of them. When i passed it to my cousins, he gave me the most happy smile i ever saw him had it. he said &amp;#34;now, i feel the most hansom man in the world&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And after that he brag about the perfumes to my other cousin&#x27;s who experienced the same thing like he did, which is couldn&#x27;t find it everywhere. Funny..... :D</li>
            <li> Very nice cologne for men.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  Tried to purchase a while ago, but it was very expensive.  Thanks to Amazon I got and with a great price.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne. I blind bought this in hopes that I would like the smell. It smells different than most of my other colognes I usually buy and I have already got good compliments from people I work with. I&#x27;m glad I gave this a try as I will probably buy another bottle in the future. It lasts for a long of time on the skin and more if you spray your clothing. I&#x27;m a fan of affordable fragrances that don&#x27;t break the bank and this one is a good scent, good price, and a large bottle.</li>
            <li> since the late nineties I have been using Quasar. its a rare perfume and hard to find in stores. The prelude is fruity with fresh aquatic presence. A combination of rosemary and lavender followed by basenotes of patchouli and cedarwood. this one is a gourmand. Cannot deny that its artificial, but its pleasantly so, and I would not expect anything natural for 30 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Its not aggressive and definitely suited for all occasions.&lt;br /&gt;5 out of 5</li>
