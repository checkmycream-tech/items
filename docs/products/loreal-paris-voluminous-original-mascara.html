            <li>good product with great price ...</li>
            <li>Got an excellent price on an excellent product and it was sent ultra fast with AMZ Prime... will buy again.</li>
            <li>good mascara.</li>
            <li>Nothing to write home about or life changing, but just good mascara.</li>
            <li>Some people on here have given it good reviews, which is why I tried it, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not savvy with make-up, so when something works well for me, that&#x27;s a good sign.</li>
            <li>It is a good product but tends to clump.  </li>
            <li>The brush (once it&#x27;s wiped off that is) does build volume and does a fair job of separating lashes.  </li>
            <li>Like this mascara, does a good job of providing volume without that heave, brittle, clumpyness.  </li>
            <li>I think its waterproof good.</li>
            <li>I workout after working all day and its still good after no reapplying.</li>
            <li>The reviews for this product were so good that I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>This is just as good as any premium brand from Sephora or Ulta.</li>
            <li>loved it</li>
            <li>The price is fair, no complaints there.</li>
            <li>Loved how it made eyelashes look thicker and fuller.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to spend $40 a tube to get good mascara.</li>
            <li>Good mascara for the price.</li>
            <li>Has nice lash definition and great coverage.</li>
            <li>Price was good, looks good when I put it on.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a good purchase for</li>

            <li>I think the brush is great, perfect shape for lengthening lashes and separating them just right.</li>
            <li>(this is awesome during finals when you fall asleep in your text book and don&#x27;t have time to do a full re-do on your make up.</li>

            <li>it gives my eyelashes amazing volume.</li>
            <li>This mascara goes on nicely, but from the time I put it on in the morning to the time I get to work</li>
            <li>Nice brand.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal is a good product and am always pleased.</li>
            <li>and thought, based on so many good reviews, that I would try it.</li>
            <li>The absolute best mascara!!</li>
            <li>Does clump a good bit at first...be sure to have tissues/</li>
            <li>im really loving this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this mascara because I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things about it.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice mascara.  </li>
            <li>An ophthalmologist told me to use baby shampoo on a warm wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>Initially, I liked this mascara because it was not clumpy when applied.</li>
            <li>Nice mascara</li>
            <li>This mascara IS nice.  </li>
            <li>I have bought every kind of mascara under the sun.</li>
            <li>Honestly speaking, if you want to get mascara all over yourself and your vanity area get this stuff.</li>
            <li>Nice but flakes off.</li>
            <li>Our eyelashes diminish in thickness and length as we get older, and this mascara does the best job of any I have tried.</li>
            <li>Good product but can clump lashes quite easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and looks gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Best mascara ever such a good price</li>
            <li>My absolute most favorite mascara!!!!</li>
            <li>Its a super great mascara, 100% recommended, it makes your lashes appear longer and fuller.</li>
            <li>This was a good price also, and with free prime shipping it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>This is supposed to be amazing, but I find it flakes off my eyelashes more than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Nice, but I need something that adds a bit more vollume</li>
            <li>Gives that perfect old hollywood glam coloring</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, lasts all day, is a great color and comes off easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal mascara for many years and it is an excellent product and does not irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>easy to wash out!</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this mascara!</li>
            <li>Works really well, makes your lashes look so good!</li>
            <li>I found that for the first week or so of using this mascara, my eyelashes looked great.</li>
            <li>The mascara has been clumpy and does not apply very smoothly.</li>
            <li>Once the wand got satuated good, it give full coverage on the eyelashes real quick.  </li>
            <li>I like the non-waterproof kind too because it stays on all day and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>While I love this mascara I returned it because of the packaging.</li>
            <li>I love L&#x27;Oreal and I will look around for more mascaras I give this product a 4-star</li>
            <li>but i ended up just curving the brush because i feel like it grabs the lashes better.</li>
            <li>One of the better mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>If the brush has a lot of product on it when you take it out of the tube, brush the excess off onto the top of the container or use a paper towel to wipe it off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to last through the day, and I&#x27;ve been happy with it!</li>
            <li>My favorite store bought mascara</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to love this one.</li>
            <li>I was trying to save a buck or two but paying more at Target would be better.</li>
            <li>i know for sure</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had one to many troubles with it.</li>
            <li>My FAVORITE mascara, probably of all time.  </li>
            <li>I have used tons and tons of different brands of mascara, and this one is still the best and my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it is my FAVORITE mascara, yet I never hear anything about</li>
            <li>Overall I think this is an excellent mascara.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>that part isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>It coats my eyelashes better and no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I like to try the newest and greatest, but I keep going back to this.  </li>
            <li>Still not my favorite.</li>
            <li>i love this mascara, its my go to</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years and never had the problems mentioned in so many reviews of difficulties removing it, smudging, etc..</li>
            <li>I am giving this mascara 3 stars because I love it</li>
            <li>One of my favorite mascaras of all time.</li>
            <li>I think there has to be better mascara in the universe than this stuff.</li>
            <li>For all mascara, I like this brand the most because of the wand.  </li>
            <li>Except for the inevitable flaking, this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I am pleased, and don&#x27;t think a $25 or $30 department store brand mascara could do the job any better.</li>
            <li>This mascara paired with L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous Power Collagen 24-hour is my favorite mascara combination.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite, go to mascara for years.</li>
            <li>Adding more volume to my lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on my lashes since I started using this mascara.  </li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>I love the brush and the formula combination</li>
            <li>Stunning.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Nothing could be better than L&#x27;Oreal when it comes to mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara</li>
            <li>I have used better.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>I thinks it&#x27;s a great product for how much you spend.</li>
            <li>:) Not clumpy.</li>
            <li>This is also a more favorable price on Amazon and it was delivered at once.</li>
            <li>Without doubt my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>Wish all mascara was like this :)</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Eh  this mascara is ok</li>
            <li>I know many people love it  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara, it&#x27;s one of my favorites</li>
            <li>most for this step.</li>
            <li>I use this mascara on top.</li>
            <li>This mascara was just okay in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It was nice that it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>’s got a curved brush that is thicker than many I’ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Works better than Lancôme .</li>
            <li>For the price and history of L&#x27;Oreal I did expect better from them.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>One of my favorite lashes for volume and darkness.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will ever love a mascara more than I love this guy.</li>
            <li>Even better than the mascara?</li>
            <li>L&#x27;oreal can do much better than this.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is okay...</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I once read an article in a women&#x27;s magazine listing the top 5 mascaras with no price limit.  </li>
            <li>im guessing itll be better the more</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>My all time favorite mascara</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it looked like I was giving myself lasik eye surgery...).  </li>
            <li>and it is now my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>One thing I love is that it stays on and doesn&#x27;t smudge</li>
            <li>I used to spend $$ on Dior, but I save money and have better looking lashes with L&#x27;oreal.</li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>Delivered on time I love this mascara and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it one more delivery, just in case this was a fluke, before canceling my subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product, but still I am giving 4 stars only because it smudges at my bottom lash line.</li>
            <li>not my favorite</li>
            <li>this alone has given me more compliments on my eyes and eyelashes than anything else.</li>
            <li>more than</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many over the years</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>, i&#x27;m very much enjoying this product</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>MY FAVORITE MASCARA</li>
            <li>have so many mascaras, that it takes a lot for one to stand out to me.</li>
            <li>Since I have a faster degree of turnover than most that helps avoid the clumping that comes with most mascara.</li>
            <li>This is OK mascara.</li>
            <li>Better than most mascaras.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product</li>
            <li>This is one of the better mascaras I have tried.</li>
            <li>Additionally, do not pump the wand to get more product on the wand - this creates air bubbles that causes mascara to clump.</li>
            <li>most products,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have SO MANY in my arsenal, I don&#x27;t have time to get attached, but I may have shed a tear or two when this one no longer graced the shelves or my lashes.</li>
            <li>I WILL update if something tarnishes the reputation I just confirmed (in my own  mind)</li>
            <li>Make sure you are prepared to wipe under your eyes a couple of times per day.</li>
            <li>I like the one with the gold tube much better.  </li>
            <li>Excellent coverage, no clumping or flaking, and feels relatively lightweight.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>But at more than 3 times the price it should.</li>
            <li>If you are going for a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product.</li>
            <li>I honestly love it thought.</li>
            <li>I have found my favorite combination</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>Love the price and product.</li>
            <li>after being stuck on one one brand for years I took a chance with this and am so glad I did as my lashes have never looked longer.  </li>
            <li>but I feel this mascara is more meant for length</li>
            <li>One of my top favorite mascaras and for the price</li>
            <li>this is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>This is even better than some of the department store brands.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>The volume is impressive though, especially with two coats.</li>
            <li>anything more than that</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS MASCARA</li>
            <li>It has been a favorite for quite some time  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara of all time.</li>
            <li>Have tried many brands</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to many friends and they became hooked.</li>
            <li>Works OK</li>
            <li>So I wipe the brush on the top of the mascara container until it&#x27;s all off, then I use it.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It def helps with volume :)</li>
            <li>Ok if you don&#x27;t use drops.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many mascara&#x27;s over the years, $3 to $30.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Loreal mascara for almost 20 years and it&#x27;s still my top pick.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than any of the cover girl mascaras.</li>
            <li>Hands down, this is the best mascara I have ever used, and I have tried MANY of them!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the color is very rich.</li>
            <li>Wish they would invent some kind of thing they could put INSIDE the tube that would clean the brush off as you take it out</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are already said to be long, but this emphasizes them beautifully!</li>
            <li>It gives pretty good volume and length and can be built on.</li>
            <li>for awhile, but decided to try this first, as I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s a good dupe.</li>
            <li>Pretty good for L&amp;#34;Oreal product.</li>
            <li>No other mascara lengthens, adds volume and makes my lashes look as good!  </li>
            <li>This mascara, like so many others, smudges easily and gives me raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li>Just as good if not then better than high end mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy Amazon offers it on a subscription basis making it convenient to re-stock.  </li>
            <li>Great volume and length, looks really natural.</li>
            <li>Works great so far.</li>
            <li>Glides on smoothly and makes my eyelashes look so much more fuller without it looking cakey.</li>
            <li>My eyes are fairly sensitive, if your eyes are not, then this is a great mascara to try.  </li>
            <li>And,  more importantly,  it doesn&#x27;t clump... at all.</li>
            <li>from $2 Wet&#x27;nwild to $35 Dior and this drug store mascara is the BEST.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it holds a curl really well even as good as waterproof formulas tend</li>
            <li>The mascara is very pretty but it smudges very easily.</li>
            <li>I like the original much better.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands but have discovered this brand is the best.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>This mascara went on easily, didn&#x27;t gob or flake.  </li>
            <li>Removes easily.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and does not flake.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily</li>
            <li>It is so easy to apply and lasts all day and night.  </li>
            <li>Wife says that it is clumpy and runs easily</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t clump, goes on easy, comes off easy too</li>
            <li>Easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Its really easy to apply</li>
            <li>to do.&lt;br /&gt;cleans of easy, but</li>
            <li>Easy to remove using eye makeup removers.</li>
            <li>, I found an easy solution.</li>
            <li>comes off easily at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on really easy and does not clump.</li>
            <li>Removes easily with baby oil or petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li>You can easily make your eyes &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; if you don&#x27;t do it properly&lt;br</li>
            <li>It washes of easily.</li>
            <li>I got three different mascaras and honestly this is really good.</li>
            <li>Best mascara hands down</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easily removed (I use fragrance free baby wipes).  </li>
            <li>Smooth and easy to apply</li>
            <li>This is the best black mascara.  </li>
            <li>and I forget how quickly it dries up!</li>
            <li>I no longer need a primer because it&#x27;s more than adequate by itself.</li>
            <li>It was quite quick that this mascara got clumpy!</li>
            <li>Very surprised at the good reviews here.</li>
            <li>The lasting is really great, the lashes gain an excellent shape e dark color.</li>
            <li>Looks good as far as volume but runs easily.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it provide great thickness and length for my lashes, it doesn&#x27;t smudge easily or bother my eyes.</li>
            <li>I use another mascara (&amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; by Benefit) first that has very strong bristles to separate my lashes</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a huge blob of mascara.  </li>
            <li>If you enjoy clumpy lashes than this is your product.</li>
            <li>I do enjoy clumpy lashes but not to the point where all of them are sticking together.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great mascara, but there&#x27;s definitely a learning curve that goes with</li>
            <li>Smooth finish.</li>
            <li>Same great mascara,</li>
            <li>I bought it because a YouTuber seemed to enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I chose this as a cheap add on thinking it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try but not expecting to commit.</li>
            <li>I have very short lashes, so this is a great help.</li>
            <li>The mascara goes on fairly smooth, although it does thicken up in the tube over time.  </li>
            <li>I follow with this L&#x27;Oreal Mascara, which goes on smooth and gives the illusion that I have some lashes.  </li>
            <li>While it creates nice volume, it doesn&#x27;t really help with length.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap mascara for a reason.  </li>
            <li>I only had to wash the wand once, and since then it has been great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect thing to use everyday</li>
            <li>It really is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>and I feel comfortable when using this.</li>
            <li>For a cheap drug store mascara I like this</li>
            <li>nice product, fast shipping</li>
            <li>Light colored eyes and even eyelids may darken with use and who needs that?</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth without clumping.</li>
            <li>But this time I purchased it off Amazon and they had the &amp;#34;carbon black&amp;#34; available.  </li>
            <li>Most of the reviews are good and everyone loves it, but for me it&#x27;s being the opposite.</li>
            <li>Jenn Falik wrote that she loved this mascara - going so far as to say it was a beauty staple in her makeup bag.</li>
            <li>The price &amp; quality is much appreciated!!!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem like I&#x27;m getting a very fresh product.</li>
            <li>I search high and low for the perfect mascaras.</li>
            <li>I enjoy convenience of subscribe and save... never was able to run into store for one item and come out with less than 5, so this is a savings and great mascara, doesn&#x27;t smudge</li>
            <li>When first applying this product I was very pleased with the volume and definition it added to my lashes: exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It also washes off super easily with my face wash.</li>
            <li>good - it makes my top lashes look like very long and voluminous.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll stick to the L&#x27;Oreal original in the gray bottle.</li>
            <li>I originally gave this 4 stars, but just downgraded it to 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>I originally gave this 4 stars, but just downgraded it to 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>It adds significant volume.  </li>
            <li>because, you guessed it, I&#x27;m Worth It!</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t unique to L&#x27;Oreal mascara - I haven&#x27;t found a mascara which doesn&#x27;t do this.</li>
            <li>and it never disappointed me.</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t have sensitivity issues, this mascara would be a great bargain.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for significantly improved lashes I would look to Youngique.</li>
            <li>I love it that much!</li>
            <li>And a rich, velvet-like mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it so much!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try a mascara that was contact lens friendly.  </li>
            <li>It amplifies the length of my lashes, which are already somewhat long, but, best of all, it adds volume to my thinning lashes (getting older kinda</li>
            <li>I think the Voluminous Million Lashes in the gold tube works best on my lashes which are short and not very thick.</li>
            <li>the brush separates the lashes well and goes on clean, not lumpy.</li>
            <li>I use baby shampoo (it is really cheap compared to eye makeup remover and it is safe and gentle to use on my eyes).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a shame, because this mascara looks very nice as soon as it is applied, but it does not hold well for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why there are so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite mascara!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good buy, and I&#x27;m pleased to have found a mascara I really like for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Great Product.......have used this for a long time!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;But it&#x27;s been the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used for rich color saturation and a thick look.</li>
            <li>in fact I haven&#x27;t had to use anything special to get it off.</li>
            <li>The brush is nothing special.</li>
            <li>and it arrived right on time!</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, great black color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought high end mascaras and tried many samples of high end brands and find that they don&#x27;t go on nearly as nicely.  </li>
            <li>I have had a hard time finding a good mascara, and this is probably the second best I have found.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreals Paris allows my lashes to reach amazing heights and its nice and dark.</li>
            <li>I have never been a impressed by grocery store brand mascaras in the past but this one is worth the bairly $6 price tag.</li>
            <li>It actually adds not just volume but pretty great length.</li>
            <li>This is good, basic mascara.</li>
            <li>For a much cheaper price, the mascara is better.  </li>
            <li>After many uses and there is not as much mascara on the brush</li>
            <li>Soooo good, not going back to Clinique....</li>
            <li>made from real organic materials that will surely prevent adverse reactions from your body.</li>
            <li>After applying it, my lashes look so much longer, I love it.  </li>
            <li>so it works well especially on someone with good lashes...</li>
            <li>It is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>My lashes seem full and I don&#x27;t need to use tons.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite mascara of all time.</li>
            <li>one is full inside,&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li>I love it si much.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product</li>
            <li>Too much mascara gets on the brush most of the time&lt;br</li>
            <li>It elongates the lashes and applies a good enough amount of mascara coat by coat, which you can build up for the volume of your preference.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it really extends my lashes but they tend to smear</li>
            <li>Everything about this mascara holds true to what is described.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not bad once you get the hang of it, and it makes for the deepest, darkest lashes you can imagine.  </li>
            <li>It is very volumizing, and I don&#x27;t get any black smudges under my eyes, which is the best part.</li>
            <li>goes on easily stays on pretty well</li>
            <li>This mascara goes on easily and with minimal clumps (which is unfortunately more user-error than the product&#x27;s fault, I&#x27;m sure).</li>
            <li>It worked fine for the first week or so</li>
            <li>overall, love the color, love the wet/thin-ish formula, love the simple packaging, love the price.</li>
            <li>I use this product and am a loyal fan.  </li>
            <li>Bold</li>
            <li>Quick drying&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s super clumpy...</li>
            <li>I have used many high end brands</li>
            <li>Dupe for high end mascara, true by its word very voluminous worth buying from amazon than stores for much better price and delivered to home!</li>
            <li>love this mascars, my only with is that there was so kind of control on the product, it just seems to come out to much</li>
            <li>Quality of the mascara is so good, lasts in the eyes for a long time.</li>
            <li>This goes on very nicely, fine, light application, not gooey or thick.. very nice.</li>
            <li>This mascara came on time and it became my new favorite.</li>
            <li>its just great really black mascara.</li>
            <li>The reviews on this mascara seemed to be overall pretty good.</li>
            <li>Washed the applicator twice and wiped out the throat of the tube with a cotton swab more than once, but the applicator consistently comes out of the tube with too much product.  </li>
            <li>Can get very clumpy easily</li>
            <li>This mascara always gives me a nice full last.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this mascara before and tried others since but went back to it because I remembered it as being pretty good.</li>
            <li>When I tried it for the first time, my husband thought I was wearing falsies!</li>
            <li>It definitely makes my lashes look longer and fuller, more voluminous!  </li>
            <li>my favorite mascara so far!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Voluminous Mascara not only lengthens your lashes, it also gives it a nice bold coat of color.  </li>
            <li>It is great for everyday way, consistent and not clumpy!  </li>
            <li>So out of most products I use which goes from very high end to the low low end this is one of the best so far.</li>
            <li>This stuff looks amazing on second day wear just by adding a touch-up to the ends of your lashes)&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if applied proper, will make your eyelashes look AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This mascara really makes your eyes pop, it is clump free and non-irritating to my contact lenses.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth any price.</li>
            <li>The only mascara that I have liked.</li>
            <li>It stays fresh for about three months.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are as fresh at 10pm as they were at 7:30am.  </li>
            <li>This product is great if you want Beautiful,  Dark,  thick Lashes..  </li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m looking to do a more natural look, I&#x27;ll use this mascara by itself.</li>
            <li>Will probably never buy a different kind again.</li>
            <li>this product is agreat and well worth the buy.</li>
            <li>when I apply it, it coats every strand with its dark, beautiful goop that makes my eyelashes look sexy, long, and full.</li>
            <li>I have tried many others and don&#x27;t like them nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>I love how much this coats and it doesn&#x27;t take much...</li>
            <li>Love having it shipped directly to my home.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so worth buying.</li>
            <li>Its very easy to apply and the color doesn&#x27;t really spread out in a very wild way</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I wish more drugstore mascaras had this deep, rich color.  </li>
            <li>I keep repurchasing this mascara because it is a perfect basic mascara and is super black.  </li>
            <li>However, I think this mascara would be better suited to someone with a more normal length and volume to their lashes as it does not give mine enough of this.  </li>
            <li>I used and old brush for an empty bottle of mascara that has the thinner wand and it distributes the mascara on my eyelashes beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and makes lots of big lashes with no clumping.  </li>
            <li>:) its like creamy and really black:)</li>
            <li>I tried other products but wind up coming back to this one because it applies easily, evenly and makes my lashes look great.</li>
            <li>It started out as a great deal, but the past two deliveries have not been satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Voluminous products are great, this is my usual mascara,nothing else compares</li>
            <li>But it does not smell, which I like, it stays on my lashes all day long, and it has nice color.</li>
            <li>very easy to apply+ pretty color+long lasting</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve dropped some eye drops in the tube to refresh it every couple months) but 8 months later its still my go-to mascara and still going strong!</li>
            <li>The only drug store brand I liked this much was Maybelline &amp;#34;Lash Stylist&amp;#34;..</li>
            <li>I love the dark black color that I get, even application and good coverage without clumps!  </li>
            <li>I started using this mascara many years ago, but as new and cool looking mascaras come out (seems daily) of promises of just about every nature, no clumping, millions of lashes, super volumizing, etc, etc...</li>
            <li>Last all day &amp; washes off pretty easily!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t flake off randomly throughout the day, is perfect when layered, and comes off easily (as long as you don&#x27;t get the waterproof kind) at the end of the night.</li>
            <li>However, from the very first use, too much mascara comes on the wand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice true black.</li>
            <li>This mascara is fantastic in price and the color is deep and rich.  </li>
            <li>Good mascara, but clumps a little.  </li>
            <li>With all the options for mascara out there, this is not my first choice.</li>
            <li>no matter how many times I tried this, still same results.</li>
            <li>People think my lashes are much longer because of this mascara!  </li>
            <li>This one never fails me.</li>
            <li>This is the first mascara that I&#x27;ve used that I don&#x27;t have to worry about checking on.</li>
            <li>then your gonna get funny clumpy looking lashes.</li>
            <li>sucks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried SO many mascaras over the years and always come back to this one!</li>
            <li>I never buy beauty products without reading some reviews first.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real!</li>
            <li>She will be ordering more of this in the future.</li>
            <li>This really does give Voluminous lashes!</li>
            <li>Had my doubts, but it really works!</li>
            <li>I literally couldn&#x27;t believe the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>On my first application, my lashes were fuller nad longer.</li>
            <li>I love L&#x27;Oreal products especially the mascara.</li>
            <li>This mascara is very affordable compare to a lot of mascara and it works!  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping..excellent product!</li>
            <li>It used to be my favorite among the low cost mascaras.</li>
            <li>Lasted thru the evening &amp; really enhanced my lashes!</li>
            <li>I was hopeful that this lower cost mascara wouldn&#x27;t cause me the same problem that so many do, but it did:  </li>
            <li>First, I use a lash serum.  </li>
            <li>Better than most mascaras I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really flake - I like it !</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my go to and has never failed.</li>
            <li>First time using it..</li>
            <li>You can always tell from the consistency when it is first opened.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, when I apply one handed while holding a baby and trying to hold the tube away from the baby, I don&#x27;t have perfect application.</li>
            <li>Very clumpy!</li>
            <li>plus, this was also the first l&#x27;oreal mascara i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Once it sets, I can last 12+ hours flake and smudge free!</li>
            <li>does the trick ;-)</li>
            <li>when within its first week of use it made my lashes clumpy</li>
            <li>If you are on a budget you simply will not find a better mascara, whether you buy it here or at the store</li>
            <li>love this brush, I would definitely purchase this brand again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to first say that I love how deep the color is of this mascara.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t compare to higher end brands whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I bought many brands of mascara through the last 30 years and kept trying different ones because I wasn&#x27;t that pleased with each one that I tried.</li>
            <li>When I use this mascara, people ask me if my lashes are real!</li>
            <li>I was going for specifically length and got exactly what I asked for.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>After five hours or more, I would simply end up looking like a racoon.</li>
            <li>I have used just a few times and loved every time.</li>
            <li>, i was very sceptical buying this, but when i eventually did, my instinct was right.</li>
            <li>I go back to the tried and true L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Original Mascara.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s a volumizing mascara, it won&#x27;t do much in the way of length, but really makes your lashes look super lush and full.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of not clumping and keeping my eyelashes soft but the time it takes to dry is too much for me.</li>
            <li>It dries so fast that when you try to apply more, it simply clumps up.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Get the Maybelline Pump or Colossal volume express ones, those are incredible and get every lash, making mine look fake</li>
            <li>Like I said, my lashes are pretty long already, but this lengthens them even more so that it looks like I&#x27;m wearing falsies.</li>
            <li>The morning application provides good coverage and last the entire day.</li>
            <li>If I could change one thing, it would be to make it less flaky - by the end of the day, I need to swab my undereyes with Cetaphil moisturizer (that seems to remove and clean this mascara off more gently than anything else) to fix my raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>The Carbon Black formula is excellent if you&#x27;re seeking a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li>Great product as it is what she uses, OUr Austrailian shepard pppie tried to eat the other one but got it back,  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t flake at all, and the color is fantastic, feels were rich and wet going on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really nice dark formula and doesn&#x27;t cause my lashes to clump.</li>
            <li>It made them really full and they were soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>BUT.... I pefer the more natural long and fairly full look</li>
            <li>Have a dramatic look in your eyes, beautiful and real voluminous mascara!</li>
            <li>This mascara reminds me of Mally Mascara only it comes off easier, my favorite is Lancome Definicils High def</li>
            <li>Big, plump, full lashes!</li>
            <li>but I am loving the carbon black.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that I did not like about this mascara is that the wand clumps easily - however</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to remove with facial soap and water.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump and can look natural or bold depending on how you apply.</li>
            <li>the large screen computer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d certainly recommend.</li>
            <li>So I just never stuck to a certain brand until I found L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Mascara.</li>
            <li>Spend a few more bucks and get the baby doll mascara by YSL, you wont regret it!</li>
            <li>I would expect it toward delivery time, but one delivery it arrived that way and the last delivery it was fine for a week, but then got clumpy.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminious Mascara in carbon black is my favorite mascara on the formula right now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer less on the brush, having more control, and starting out light but being able to apply multiple coats, if desired.</li>
            <li>The top of the mascara was smashed and the top of the packaging looks like it had been open a little.</li>
            <li>It got very clumpy by the 6th use or so.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very pigmented, but</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really liquidy and gives you spidery lashes.  </li>
            <li>I really really wanted to like this mascara</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy if you have really oily skin--all the mascara will be off your lashes and you&#x27;ll have racoon eyes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real mascara.  </li>
            <li>but it came with the curved wand, rather than the straight wand that is pictured.</li>
            <li>so you end up really wiping it around.</li>
            <li>I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Mascara ever since I was in High School!</li>
            <li>However, the brush leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li>Thanks to family life I had to cut corners.</li>
            <li>this is very comparable to the two face mascaras.</li>
            <li>My tube became very goopy within a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>This is a very clumpy mascara.</li>
            <li>I really disn&#x27;t get much with this.</li>
            <li>It really helps with volume as well.  </li>
            <li>Good everyday mascara that is easily layerable for a more dramatic look at night.</li>
            <li>Goes on without clonking and stays on the whole day without needing to reapply.  </li>
            <li>I really like the formula</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m much happier.</li>
            <li>This mascara leaves me lashes very voluminous and glamorous.</li>
            <li>Its clumps SO MUCH do NOT get this you will need to spend a lot of time on your makeup if you do.</li>
            <li>But its very clumpy.</li>
            <li>so this was very convenient for me.</li>
            <li>I tried to use this mascara with a wand that I REALLY like (CoverGirl Lash Blast) --</li>
            <li>Really makes my lashes appear thicker and blacker.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>once I have been asked if my eyelashes were real or not.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it does not wear off throughout the day, does not smear, and even stayed put through a very vigorous workout in a non air conditioned place.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel I get as much from them as I use to.  </li>
            <li>I am very picky about mascara</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;With regard to &amp;#34;too much product on the brush&amp;#34</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real&#x27; by Benefit:</li>
            <li>Date is really close to expiration each time.</li>
            <li>So much I decided to write a review.</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch.</li>
            <li>but after 1 month it often comes out too much on the brush and applies clumpy to my lashes.</li>
            <li>if you put too much on, you will have tarantella eyes that flakes off.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely my go to mascara.</li>
            <li>It clumped way too much for me.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about mine and this blew me away.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to toss it...</li>
            <li>As someone cursed with short, light, sparse eyelashes that do not like mascara I have been combating this problem for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li>and it is easier to use than some of the really fat ones.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I switched to the younique brand and I am much happier with that for volumizing.</li>
            <li>Thanks for cooperating</li>
            <li>I tend to buy very exspensive make up</li>
            <li>there is so much product on the brush and the Brussels don&#x27;t balance.</li>
            <li>I did not care for this mascara as much as some of the others I tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clumpy and too much product gets applied onto the brush when dipped.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to add a lot of volume and length to their lashes but be carefull it does have a tendancy to glob up with the wand they provide.</li>
            <li>very full.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara</li>
            <li>Really sucks because I LOVED this mascara/</li>
            <li>The product is dark and applies easily without too much clumping, but I have the same problem with this as I do many mascaras</li>
            <li>As long as you only use it 3 months or less really excellent product</li>
            <li>far as I can tell, Wayne Goss was right.</li>
            <li>This is a good mascara and one I seem to fall back to after I try other brands.</li>
            <li>This also crimps very nicely if you give it a few minutes to dry, or crimp first and then apply.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, however it seemed to dry out very quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although this mascara seems like a pain to use (and the reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it requires a bit more work than other mascaras)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve then started testing drug-store brands and after trying many of them (even other l&#x27;oreal mascaras)</li>
            <li>I usually do two coats and my lashes look stunning!</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is that if you try to double coat more than .235 seconds after you applied the first coat</li>
            <li>I just love her eyes and imitated it through this mascara and other stuff.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Mascara from L&#x27;Oreal, even though its cheaper than their other mascaras.  </li>
            <li>, I got irritation with many other mascaras, but this one never irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li>going back to volminous original.</li>
            <li>but this is better then any other brand I have tried.</li>
            <li>I tried all different, drug store, top rated brands (Maybelline/NYX/etc) and have not found anything that could compare to Lancôme Definicils or Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>Was also available here on Amazon for less than at my local stores + free shipping!</li>
            <li>It gives me long looking lashes that are clump free and its so much cheaper than anything you buy at the mall.</li>
            <li>Still, this is the one to wear if you want serious drama and gorgeous eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Not the best when it comes to length, but it makes your lashes look thick, plush and dark.</li>
            <li>mascara doesn&#x27;t clump hardly at all (tip: scrape off excess mascara and go lightly over each eye lid a couple of times), it lasts forever, coats every lash, comes off easily...</li>
            <li>Really makes lashes look longer and darker, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I keep coming back to this one, and the price is right!</li>
            <li>Love the dark black color, this is my absolute favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>Dark and lovely.</li>
            <li>I use water first to dissolve it and then use remover to remove it completely.</li>
            <li>and I love how the dark color makes my eyes stand out.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the most black of any mascara I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>It used to be so easy to wash off in the shower with minimal soap or makeup remover.</li>
            <li>&amp; i love the carbon black color</li>
            <li>It is noticeably better than the maybelline products Ive used previously.</li>
            <li>also, i needed to wipe off some of the product during initial use because it would have gotten real clumpy, real fast.</li>
            <li>Decently waterproof, but then again I have yet to try a truly waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>classic mascara.</li>
            <li>is very black, gives nice volume and length without being too much on the first coat or two, but definitely buildable if you desire</li>
            <li>Get yourself a decent waterproof mascara instead.</li>
            <li>Recently bought this mascara at my local cvs and when i used it, i fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>This made them big and bold.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t purchase this particular brand again.</li>
            <li>This is a classic.</li>
            <li>I also get coupons to be able to purchase this mascara at a lower cost as it is more expensive than Cover Girl and Maybelline varieties.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different mascaras and I always come back to this one.  </li>
            <li>This particular brand is one I return to time and time again.</li>
            <li>Not only that theirs alway a ton of product over flowing on top of the container when I open it.</li>
            <li>maybe not a word someone uses to describe mascara, but it is very creamy, not dry like some mascaras are (even when first opened).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this mascara since I was in high school, which was 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used a lot of high end mascaras.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Compared to the high brand mascaras I&#x27;ve used in the past...for the price and quality you can not beat it.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this for a drugstore mascara.</li>
            <li>and I have used all the high end brands and everything in between.</li>
            <li>Given the raving reviews, I had high expectations for this mascara.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Its truly a deep black and such a great product.</li>
            <li>Long lasting beautiful black mascara.</li>
            <li>I can be sensitive to certain products.</li>
            <li>totaly old like my used one from 1 year ago!!</li>
            <li>For nighttime I use something a little more jazzy</li>
            <li>The color is an intense shade of black, and I can easily get away with doing just one coat of mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very loyal and will never try any other brand.</li>
            <li>Very dark, I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Voluminous Mascara - it really causes my lashes to seem thicker and longer, which is no mean feat for my sixty year old eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite brand by far - even over the more expensive options out there.  </li>
            <li>which normally doesn&#x27;t happen with just one brand of mascara.</li>
            <li>But when you have to pick and choose where your money is going, the extra price isn’t worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump, and it leave my eyelashes looking full and long.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, but this bottle dried up in about a month.  </li>
            <li>After a few hours, I can see my lashes getting thinner and more sparse.</li>
            <li>Creates nice long lashes with minimal effort.</li>
            <li>The wand is nice and thick to plump up your lashes.  </li>
            <li>Nice thick lashes, but it is sticky to take off.</li>
            <li>The wand is nice and thick too.</li>
            <li>, this is very good and is only $5.00 something, I feel better buying the less expensive one...</li>
            <li>When removing this it required twice as many eye makeup remover pads than with my regular mascara, other than that it&#x27;s okay, just an average drugstore mascara</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product that I use everyday!</li>
            <li>This mascara does not dry out with normal use in less than three months, which is the maximum amount of time you are able to keep using mascara for hygiene reasons.in less than three months, which is the maximum amount of time you are able to keep using mascara for hygiene reasons.</li>
            <li>It clumped a little too easily, and was kind of hard to take off, even in the shower.</li>
            <li>I was looking for new mascara and the girl that works for me has eyelashes that hit her eyebrows</li>
            <li>so I can get a new one every 6 months, since I always forget to date the bottle, and forget when I bought them, and forget to toss them in 6 months.</li>
            <li>i never stick with products i always want something new, but with this product, i dont want anything new</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying department store mascaras the last few years, and, in an effort to cut back on my spending, decided to try this mascara since my favorite on-line makeup artist Makeup Geek has recommended it several times as her favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>Great for volume, length and that natural glam-lash look without having to use fake lashes.</li>
            <li>This is a decent mascara for the price, but I should have known it would cause irritation with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>so when I try to just lightly go over the inner or outer corners, I get a big clump.</li>
            <li>Strong black color.</li>
            <li>I love the super dark black color.</li>
            <li>It gives you extremely long lashes and if you get regular (not waterproof) it comes off easily.</li>
            <li>You gotta move fast like a ninja if you want those bad boys to look good!</li>
            <li>I think the original lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t clump so much in such a short period of time.</li>
            <li>First time ordering online, and probably last.</li>
            <li>One of the only mascaras I buy consistently.  </li>
            <li>In order to use this up I have used it in conjunction with other wands that offer more separation such as The Rocket.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow if you YouTube this product its supposed to be off the hook!</li>
            <li>I had an open tube to finish first.  </li>
            <li>when I take it out, the tip contains a tiny bit of mascara on it or in other words, the tip contains more of the &#x27;goop&#x27;.</li>
            <li>with this mascara, 1-2 coats is enough because with the first coat, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>But once you get past that stage, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Wow, now these are some lashes!  </li>
            <li>I think I actually like it better than the other ones.  </li>
            <li>only use it on my upper lashes as I don’t look good with the heavily lined and lashed look.  </li>
            <li>but they are thin and very light colored, so the &amp;#34;Voluminous&amp;#34; part in the name is exactly what you get.</li>
            <li>Is an OK mascara I don&#x27;t love it or hate it .. is just all right</li>
            <li>but since I have black roots with the rest of my eyelashes being a light blonde, I need a mascara or my lashes look pretty nonexistent.</li>
            <li>The color is a very rich, deep black--more so than any other drugstore mascara I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>You absolutely cannot beat the price for such a high quality mascara.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used a number of different drug store and high end mascaras, and this one is definitely high on my list!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apply your first coat very slowly from the bottom of the lashes to the top.  </li>
            <li>It looks great, doesn&#x27;t clump too bad and really adds volume!</li>
            <li>Obviously I haven&#x27;t used Tarte LCL, so I&#x27;m not sure how this compares, but I have no interest in trying it anymore, this is so amazing for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>While I already have fairly long eyelashes, it really lengthens them &amp; makes them look so much fuller.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for thickening and lengthening your lashes, and it doesn&#x27;t break down during the day like some mascaras that leave little pieces of crumbled mascara under your eyes by the middle of the day.</li>
            <li>dark rich black&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Regular black works better.</li>
            <li>only downside is, the wet formula takes awhile to dry, so it&#x27;s easy to smudge right after you put it on.</li>
            <li>I love that this mascara doesn&#x27;t make your lashes hard or clumpy.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, stay clear.</li>
            <li>I have pretty long natural lashes already</li>
            <li>can produce very spidery lashes if you aren&#x27;t careful, but is VERY volumizing</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was old or just the formula.  </li>
            <li>Too clogged, and it doesnt look so professional</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my only beef, really.</li>
            <li>May not seem like a big deal, but I prefer the straight wand.</li>
            <li>I am now almost 50 years old</li>
            <li>It helps me pull off that Natural look</li>
            <li>so when the package comes, I know it&#x27;s time to throw out the old one.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was old?  </li>
            <li>a natural look?  </li>
            <li>so I can always swap out when they are getting old.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like it and will repurchase.</li>
            <li>You can put multiple layers on and it doesn&#x27;t really get clumpy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so busy</li>
            <li>I use a soap-free body wash in the shower and have no trouble getting if off.  </li>
            <li>I am a complete make up junkie and do not mind spending money on quality</li>
            <li>This product was old.</li>
            <li>and it is obviously an old tube.</li>
            <li>Amazon offers sale prices sometimes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is because they are stored in a hot place, stored too long, or if the manufacture has gotten skimpier on the product.  </li>
            <li>I think the mascara is old as it bothers my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have used a multitude of mascaras in my life (I&#x27;m almost 35 years old)</li>
            <li>Probably old</li>
            <li>It clumps considerably, though.</li>
            <li>It is for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>It makes your eyelashes look pretty long and thick &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different mascaras and this one definitely is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It covers well, is nice and thick, and the brush is simple and uncomplicated.</li>
            <li>I use a thick formula to plump lashes, scraping the sides of the brush to make sure excess product does not cause clumping and spider-y lashes.</li>
            <li>I thought it was kind of thin.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite mascaras, hands down sultry and long lashes and not a beastly removal process.</li>
            <li>I ordered ORIGINAL and this is not ORIGINAL</li>
            <li>And every single time the same thing happens-I think, &amp;#34;I should have just stayed with my tried and true L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous Mascara-damn it!&amp;#34; MONEY IN THE TRASH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t found anything better though and at least once I&#x27;ve had the same problem buying from my local drug store, so I&#x27;m still willing to purchase this way.  </li>
            <li>Only negative is that it dries quickly so you can only apply once meaning that if you go back to apply more it will clump your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>But due to some new year budgeting my $20 mascara was one of the first things to go.</li>
            <li>Since it dries quickly, I&#x27;ve found that I can&#x27;t alternate between eyes for a second coat, but stay with one eye to do two coats, before moving on to the second</li>
            <li>Is super black and matte.  </li>
            <li>(I used to purchase much more expensive brands like Christian Dior and didn&#x27;t get any benefit from them) and it isn&#x27;t super cakey nor does it contribute to spider lashes.  </li>
            <li>Super pigmented black color.  </li>
            <li>Super black.</li>
            <li>First let me say that I have been applying various drugstore mascaras over ten years.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s you build to create nice thick long lashes</li>
            <li>Clumps a little but not bad.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the high end brands (bobbi brown, dior, nars) but always come back to this.</li>
            <li>The carbon black is great dark black.</li>
            <li>I love it at first, but it was very irritating to my eyes.  </li>
            <li>This makes my lashed look much thicker and stays on well all day long</li>
            <li>When you first use this, the formula is a bit on the wet, runny side...</li>
            <li>It will hardly budge in the rain, but it comes off easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I forget to pick up a new tube of different mascara,</li>
            <li>It is very watery and takes forever to dry</li>
            <li>I have to carefully smooth out the clumps with an eyebrow comb after applying, which takes way too long and is not worth the effort.</li>
            <li>I really like L&#x27;Oreal but would probably choose a different product next time.</li>
            <li>….. is that this product can be kind of difficult to completely remove.</li>
            <li>It is does not add much volume to my lashes and only moderate amount of length.  </li>
            <li>With that being said, this does not deserve a strong negative mark against it, but a note of caution before purchasing it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff , if you want them thick put multiple coat on</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewer, the first week I did have spider lashes.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;oreal makes a number of mascara products, but the Voluminous (5X the fullness) is it, bare none!</li>
            <li>The first few days that this mascara is brand new</li>
            <li>I normally like this brand, but those I get through amazon seem dry like they are old.</li>
            <li>Great for a few weeks, but clumps quickly and badly.</li>
            <li>I would expect any mascara to hold decently under such basic scenarios.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a classic mascara--more expensive ones from the  L&#x27;Oreal line flake more than this one.</li>
            <li>I generally have to wipe up some smudge that makes it to my lower lid as the day goes on.</li>
            <li>Totally clumpy and felt old.</li>
            <li>It does require some focused attention to completely remove (just cleanser on hands isn&#x27;t enough).</li>
            <li>I bought it back near Christmas, its august</li>
            <li>Forget what the &amp;#34;make up artists&amp;#34; say as they apparently have never tried this product.</li>
            <li>This Loreal mascara is actually closer in quality and performance to the expensive department store brands (most of which cost four or five times as much).</li>
            <li>Then barely apply to your lower lashes......  </li>
            <li>This goes on wet and clumpy, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem at all with it running and it stays on the whole day.</li>
            <li>This product looks nice, but it clumps terribly on the brush, such that every now and then you have to clean the bristle with hot water to get all the excess mascara off of it and then re-insert it to apply the mascara.</li>
            <li>What a dissapointment knowing I could have spent a few dollars more for the REAL thing that would have lasted me a few months.</li>
            <li>For some crazy reason, it works better now 5 months later than it did the first week.</li>
            <li>This mascara does the job well, and it is very affordable compared to some other mascaras out there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Loreal&#x27;s Original is thick.</li>
            <li>I prefer a more dramatic look.  </li>
            <li>If your mascara is very clumpy, simply wash the wand with soap and water and allow to dry before putting it back in the tube.</li>
            <li>It was a little clumpy at first</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my fiance who was having trouble finding this locally in the right color/shade.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous first, either this one or regular black, then finishing with a coat of Benefit</li>
            <li>I really like how this mascara makes my lashes look but by noon it has been leaving dark smudges under my eyes leaving me with raccoon eyes for the rest of my day.</li>
            <li>As to if I would purchase this product again--no, I would probably give another mascara a try or possibly use this with a base coat of Maybelline Great Lash Clear Mascara.&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes look long and lush</li>
            <li>I waited until my Covergirl lash blast dried out before buying - was very eager!</li>
            <li>I love that I get long and thick lashes without clumping and with long wear.</li>
            <li>I sometimes do two coats for really thick and full lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Certainly, I did get sufficient use out of the previous ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is true that the formula starts out very thin when you first open it and thickens over time, so you have to wait and recoat the first few times you use</li>
            <li>Serves me right, since I am ordering items on my phone ( not able to see ) verses</li>
            <li>It smudges, it&#x27;s clunky, I have to brush my eye lashes because they will be stuck and my natural eye lashes are very long.</li>
            <li>I have very long natural lashes, but they are light-colored.  </li>
            <li>This mascara made my lashes look so much thicker and longer than my previous mascara.</li>
            <li>mascara was old and dry</li>
            <li>This stuff really is carbon black.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really darker than blackest black.</li>
            <li>My eyes look so thick and full after only one coat.</li>
            <li>Really like this mascara the only down fall after using it for about two weeks</li>
            <li>As a Caucasian female with blonde eyelashes, it is often hard to find a mascara that makes my stubby lashes look full.</li>
            <li>For a less dramatic daytime effect use only one coat,  I am very satisfied</li>
            <li>The Carbon Black color is really deep and intense, and it can be tricky to remove it from your lashes at night.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s such an intense black.</li>
            <li>I think it works a little better than other mascaras, but it&#x27;s average for me..</li>
            <li>Good drug store mascara, very little clumping, adds dramatic lashes.  </li>
            <li>I do find that when you get a new tube, there in an excessive amount on the brush, but I always keep my tube that&#x27;s getting low and use the two together until the new tube is manageable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super dark black</li>
            <li>Make my eyelashes huge and is very is very thick.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> My wife is very happy with it. :)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump, and for a mascara addict, I think it works perfectly :)</li>
            <li> Best in class for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this product,&lt;br /&gt;It is the best mascara that I have&lt;br /&gt;ever</li>
            <li> The price is a dollar or more cheaper then at any retail store I&#x27;ve found and the automatic ordering is awesome!</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever made in my opinion and now Amazon has it available as a subscribe and save option!</li>
            <li> good product with great price ...</li>
            <li> Got an excellent price on an excellent product and it was sent ultra fast with AMZ Prime... will buy again.</li>
            <li> good mascara.</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about or life changing, but just good mascara.</li>
            <li> Some people on here have given it good reviews, which is why I tried it, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not savvy with make-up, so when something works well for me, that&#x27;s a good sign.</li>
            <li> It is a good product but tends to clump.  </li>
            <li> The brush (once it&#x27;s wiped off that is) does build volume and does a fair job of separating lashes.  </li>
            <li> Like this mascara, does a good job of providing volume without that heave, brittle, clumpyness.  </li>
            <li> I think its waterproof good.</li>
            <li> I workout after working all day and its still good after no reapplying.</li>
            <li> The reviews for this product were so good that I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> This is just as good as any premium brand from Sephora or Ulta.</li>
            <li> loved it</li>
            <li> The price is fair, no complaints there.</li>
            <li> Loved how it made eyelashes look thicker and fuller.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to spend $40 a tube to get good mascara.</li>
            <li> Good mascara for the price.</li>
            <li> Has nice lash definition and great coverage.</li>
            <li> Price was good, looks good when I put it on.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a good purchase for</li>
            <li> I have always loved voluminous mascara by Loreal</li>

            <li> I also follow it up with a good scrubbing using face wash, as well.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Good color, stayability.</li>
            <li> Good coverage.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a good price and applies well.  </li>
            <li> I think the brush is great, perfect shape for lengthening lashes and separating them just right.</li>
            <li> (this is awesome during finals when you fall asleep in your text book and don&#x27;t have time to do a full re-do on your make up.</li>
            <li> nothing exceptional, i&#x27;d rather buy a maybelline one for the price</li>
            <li> Amazon shipped quickly wich impressed me also,</li>

            <li> This mascara is amazing.  </li>
            <li> it gives my eyelashes amazing volume.</li>
            <li> This mascara goes on nicely, but from the time I put it on in the morning to the time I get to work</li>
            <li> Nice brand.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal is a good product and am always pleased.</li>
            <li> and thought, based on so many good reviews, that I would try it.</li>
            <li> The absolute best mascara!!</li>
            <li> Does clump a good bit at first...be sure to have tissues/</li>
            <li> im really loving this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this mascara because I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things about it.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice mascara.  </li>
            <li> An ophthalmologist told me to use baby shampoo on a warm wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> Initially, I liked this mascara because it was not clumpy when applied.</li>
            <li> Nice mascara</li>
            <li> This mascara IS nice.  </li>
            <li> I have bought every kind of mascara under the sun.</li>
            <li> Honestly speaking, if you want to get mascara all over yourself and your vanity area get this stuff.</li>
            <li> Nice but flakes off.</li>
            <li> Our eyelashes diminish in thickness and length as we get older, and this mascara does the best job of any I have tried.</li>
            <li> Good product but can clump lashes quite easily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and looks gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever such a good price</li>
            <li> My absolute most favorite mascara!!!!</li>
            <li> Its a super great mascara, 100% recommended, it makes your lashes appear longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> This was a good price also, and with free prime shipping it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be amazing, but I find it flakes off my eyelashes more than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Nice, but I need something that adds a bit more vollume</li>
            <li> Gives that perfect old hollywood glam coloring</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, lasts all day, is a great color and comes off easily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal mascara for many years and it is an excellent product and does not irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> easy to wash out!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this mascara!</li>
            <li> Works really well, makes your lashes look so good!</li>
            <li> I found that for the first week or so of using this mascara, my eyelashes looked great.</li>
            <li> The mascara has been clumpy and does not apply very smoothly.</li>
            <li> Once the wand got satuated good, it give full coverage on the eyelashes real quick.  </li>
            <li> I like the non-waterproof kind too because it stays on all day and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> While I love this mascara I returned it because of the packaging.</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal and I will look around for more mascaras I give this product a 4-star</li>
            <li> but i ended up just curving the brush because i feel like it grabs the lashes better.</li>
            <li> One of the better mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> If the brush has a lot of product on it when you take it out of the tube, brush the excess off onto the top of the container or use a paper towel to wipe it off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to last through the day, and I&#x27;ve been happy with it!</li>
            <li> My favorite store bought mascara</li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to love this one.</li>
            <li> I was trying to save a buck or two but paying more at Target would be better.</li>
            <li> i know for sure</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had one to many troubles with it.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE mascara, probably of all time.  </li>
            <li> I have used tons and tons of different brands of mascara, and this one is still the best and my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it is my FAVORITE mascara, yet I never hear anything about</li>
            <li> Overall I think this is an excellent mascara.</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> that part isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> It coats my eyelashes better and no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I like to try the newest and greatest, but I keep going back to this.  </li>
            <li> Still not my favorite.</li>
            <li> i love this mascara, its my go to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years and never had the problems mentioned in so many reviews of difficulties removing it, smudging, etc..</li>
            <li> I am giving this mascara 3 stars because I love it</li>
            <li> One of my favorite mascaras of all time.</li>
            <li> I think there has to be better mascara in the universe than this stuff.</li>
            <li> For all mascara, I like this brand the most because of the wand.  </li>
            <li> Except for the inevitable flaking, this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I am pleased, and don&#x27;t think a $25 or $30 department store brand mascara could do the job any better.</li>
            <li> This mascara paired with L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous Power Collagen 24-hour is my favorite mascara combination.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite, go to mascara for years.</li>
            <li> Adding more volume to my lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on my lashes since I started using this mascara.  </li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> I love the brush and the formula combination</li>
            <li> Stunning.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Nothing could be better than L&#x27;Oreal when it comes to mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara</li>
            <li> I have used better.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I thinks it&#x27;s a great product for how much you spend.</li>
            <li> :) Not clumpy.</li>
            <li> This is also a more favorable price on Amazon and it was delivered at once.</li>
            <li> Without doubt my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li> Wish all mascara was like this :)</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Eh  this mascara is ok</li>
            <li> I know many people love it  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it&#x27;s one of my favorites</li>
            <li> most for this step.</li>
            <li> I use this mascara on top.</li>
            <li> This mascara was just okay in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It was nice that it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> ’s got a curved brush that is thicker than many I’ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Works better than Lancôme .</li>
            <li> For the price and history of L&#x27;Oreal I did expect better from them.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> One of my favorite lashes for volume and darkness.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever love a mascara more than I love this guy.</li>
            <li> Even better than the mascara?</li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal can do much better than this.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is okay...</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I once read an article in a women&#x27;s magazine listing the top 5 mascaras with no price limit.  </li>
            <li> im guessing itll be better the more</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> My all time favorite mascara</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it looked like I was giving myself lasik eye surgery...).  </li>
            <li> and it is now my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> One thing I love is that it stays on and doesn&#x27;t smudge</li>
            <li> I used to spend $$ on Dior, but I save money and have better looking lashes with L&#x27;oreal.</li>
            <li> and I still love it.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> Delivered on time I love this mascara and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it one more delivery, just in case this was a fluke, before canceling my subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, but still I am giving 4 stars only because it smudges at my bottom lash line.</li>
            <li> not my favorite</li>
            <li> this alone has given me more compliments on my eyes and eyelashes than anything else.</li>
            <li> more than</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many over the years</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> , i&#x27;m very much enjoying this product</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE MASCARA</li>
            <li> have so many mascaras, that it takes a lot for one to stand out to me.</li>
            <li> Since I have a faster degree of turnover than most that helps avoid the clumping that comes with most mascara.</li>
            <li> This is OK mascara.</li>
            <li> Better than most mascaras.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product</li>
            <li> This is one of the better mascaras I have tried.</li>
            <li> Additionally, do not pump the wand to get more product on the wand - this creates air bubbles that causes mascara to clump.</li>
            <li> most products,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have SO MANY in my arsenal, I don&#x27;t have time to get attached, but I may have shed a tear or two when this one no longer graced the shelves or my lashes.</li>
            <li> I WILL update if something tarnishes the reputation I just confirmed (in my own  mind)</li>
            <li> Make sure you are prepared to wipe under your eyes a couple of times per day.</li>
            <li> I like the one with the gold tube much better.  </li>
            <li> Excellent coverage, no clumping or flaking, and feels relatively lightweight.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> But at more than 3 times the price it should.</li>
            <li> If you are going for a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product.</li>
            <li> I honestly love it thought.</li>
            <li> I have found my favorite combination</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the color</li>
            <li> Love the price and product.</li>
            <li> after being stuck on one one brand for years I took a chance with this and am so glad I did as my lashes have never looked longer.  </li>
            <li> but I feel this mascara is more meant for length</li>
            <li> One of my top favorite mascaras and for the price</li>
            <li> this is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> This is even better than some of the department store brands.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> The volume is impressive though, especially with two coats.</li>
            <li> anything more than that</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS MASCARA</li>
            <li> It has been a favorite for quite some time  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara of all time.</li>
            <li> Have tried many brands</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to many friends and they became hooked.</li>
            <li> Works OK</li>
            <li> So I wipe the brush on the top of the mascara container until it&#x27;s all off, then I use it.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> It def helps with volume :)</li>
            <li> Ok if you don&#x27;t use drops.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many mascara&#x27;s over the years, $3 to $30.  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Loreal mascara for almost 20 years and it&#x27;s still my top pick.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than any of the cover girl mascaras.</li>
            <li> Hands down, this is the best mascara I have ever used, and I have tried MANY of them!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the color is very rich.</li>
            <li> Wish they would invent some kind of thing they could put INSIDE the tube that would clean the brush off as you take it out</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are already said to be long, but this emphasizes them beautifully!</li>
            <li> It gives pretty good volume and length and can be built on.</li>
            <li> for awhile, but decided to try this first, as I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s a good dupe.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for L&amp;#34;Oreal product.</li>
            <li> No other mascara lengthens, adds volume and makes my lashes look as good!  </li>
            <li> This mascara, like so many others, smudges easily and gives me raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li> Just as good if not then better than high end mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy Amazon offers it on a subscription basis making it convenient to re-stock.  </li>
            <li> Great volume and length, looks really natural.</li>
            <li> Works great so far.</li>
            <li> Glides on smoothly and makes my eyelashes look so much more fuller without it looking cakey.</li>
            <li> My eyes are fairly sensitive, if your eyes are not, then this is a great mascara to try.  </li>
            <li> And,  more importantly,  it doesn&#x27;t clump... at all.</li>
            <li> from $2 Wet&#x27;nwild to $35 Dior and this drug store mascara is the BEST.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it holds a curl really well even as good as waterproof formulas tend</li>
            <li> The mascara is very pretty but it smudges very easily.</li>
            <li> I like the original much better.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands but have discovered this brand is the best.</li>
            <li> Easy to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> This mascara went on easily, didn&#x27;t gob or flake.  </li>
            <li> Removes easily.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and does not flake.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easily</li>
            <li> It is so easy to apply and lasts all day and night.  </li>
            <li> Wife says that it is clumpy and runs easily</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t clump, goes on easy, comes off easy too</li>
            <li> Easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Its really easy to apply</li>
            <li> to do.&lt;br /&gt;cleans of easy, but</li>
            <li> Easy to remove using eye makeup removers.</li>
            <li> , I found an easy solution.</li>
            <li> comes off easily at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on really easy and does not clump.</li>
            <li> Removes easily with baby oil or petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li> You can easily make your eyes &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; if you don&#x27;t do it properly&lt;br</li>
            <li> It washes of easily.</li>
            <li> I got three different mascaras and honestly this is really good.</li>
            <li> Best mascara hands down</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easily removed (I use fragrance free baby wipes).  </li>
            <li> Smooth and easy to apply</li>
            <li> This is the best black mascara.  </li>
            <li> and I forget how quickly it dries up!</li>
            <li> I no longer need a primer because it&#x27;s more than adequate by itself.</li>
            <li> It was quite quick that this mascara got clumpy!</li>
            <li> Very surprised at the good reviews here.</li>
            <li> The lasting is really great, the lashes gain an excellent shape e dark color.</li>
            <li> Looks good as far as volume but runs easily.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it provide great thickness and length for my lashes, it doesn&#x27;t smudge easily or bother my eyes.</li>
            <li> I use another mascara (&amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; by Benefit) first that has very strong bristles to separate my lashes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a huge blob of mascara.  </li>
            <li> If you enjoy clumpy lashes than this is your product.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy clumpy lashes but not to the point where all of them are sticking together.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great mascara, but there&#x27;s definitely a learning curve that goes with</li>
            <li> Smooth finish.</li>
            <li> Same great mascara,</li>
            <li> I bought it because a YouTuber seemed to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I chose this as a cheap add on thinking it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try but not expecting to commit.</li>
            <li> I have very short lashes, so this is a great help.</li>
            <li> The mascara goes on fairly smooth, although it does thicken up in the tube over time.  </li>
            <li> I follow with this L&#x27;Oreal Mascara, which goes on smooth and gives the illusion that I have some lashes.  </li>
            <li> While it creates nice volume, it doesn&#x27;t really help with length.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap mascara for a reason.  </li>
            <li> I only had to wash the wand once, and since then it has been great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect thing to use everyday</li>
            <li> It really is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> and I feel comfortable when using this.</li>
            <li> For a cheap drug store mascara I like this</li>
            <li> nice product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Light colored eyes and even eyelids may darken with use and who needs that?</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth without clumping.</li>
            <li> But this time I purchased it off Amazon and they had the &amp;#34;carbon black&amp;#34; available.  </li>
            <li> Most of the reviews are good and everyone loves it, but for me it&#x27;s being the opposite.</li>
            <li> Jenn Falik wrote that she loved this mascara - going so far as to say it was a beauty staple in her makeup bag.</li>
            <li> The price &amp; quality is much appreciated!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like I&#x27;m getting a very fresh product.</li>
            <li> I search high and low for the perfect mascaras.</li>
            <li> I enjoy convenience of subscribe and save... never was able to run into store for one item and come out with less than 5, so this is a savings and great mascara, doesn&#x27;t smudge</li>
            <li> When first applying this product I was very pleased with the volume and definition it added to my lashes: exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It also washes off super easily with my face wash.</li>
            <li> good - it makes my top lashes look like very long and voluminous.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll stick to the L&#x27;Oreal original in the gray bottle.</li>
            <li> I originally gave this 4 stars, but just downgraded it to 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> I originally gave this 4 stars, but just downgraded it to 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> It adds significant volume.  </li>
            <li> because, you guessed it, I&#x27;m Worth It!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t unique to L&#x27;Oreal mascara - I haven&#x27;t found a mascara which doesn&#x27;t do this.</li>
            <li> and it never disappointed me.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t have sensitivity issues, this mascara would be a great bargain.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for significantly improved lashes I would look to Youngique.</li>
            <li> I love it that much!</li>
            <li> And a rich, velvet-like mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it so much!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try a mascara that was contact lens friendly.  </li>
            <li> It amplifies the length of my lashes, which are already somewhat long, but, best of all, it adds volume to my thinning lashes (getting older kinda</li>
            <li> I think the Voluminous Million Lashes in the gold tube works best on my lashes which are short and not very thick.</li>
            <li> the brush separates the lashes well and goes on clean, not lumpy.</li>
            <li> I use baby shampoo (it is really cheap compared to eye makeup remover and it is safe and gentle to use on my eyes).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a shame, because this mascara looks very nice as soon as it is applied, but it does not hold well for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why there are so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good buy, and I&#x27;m pleased to have found a mascara I really like for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Great Product.......have used this for a long time!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;But it&#x27;s been the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used for rich color saturation and a thick look.</li>
            <li> in fact I haven&#x27;t had to use anything special to get it off.</li>
            <li> The brush is nothing special.</li>
            <li> and it arrived right on time!</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, great black color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought high end mascaras and tried many samples of high end brands and find that they don&#x27;t go on nearly as nicely.  </li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding a good mascara, and this is probably the second best I have found.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreals Paris allows my lashes to reach amazing heights and its nice and dark.</li>
            <li> I have never been a impressed by grocery store brand mascaras in the past but this one is worth the bairly $6 price tag.</li>
            <li> It actually adds not just volume but pretty great length.</li>
            <li> This is good, basic mascara.</li>
            <li> For a much cheaper price, the mascara is better.  </li>
            <li> After many uses and there is not as much mascara on the brush</li>
            <li> Soooo good, not going back to Clinique....</li>
            <li> made from real organic materials that will surely prevent adverse reactions from your body.</li>
            <li> After applying it, my lashes look so much longer, I love it.  </li>
            <li> so it works well especially on someone with good lashes...</li>
            <li> It is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li> My lashes seem full and I don&#x27;t need to use tons.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite mascara of all time.</li>
            <li> one is full inside,&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li> I love it si much.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product</li>
            <li> Too much mascara gets on the brush most of the time&lt;br</li>
            <li> It elongates the lashes and applies a good enough amount of mascara coat by coat, which you can build up for the volume of your preference.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it really extends my lashes but they tend to smear</li>
            <li> Everything about this mascara holds true to what is described.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not bad once you get the hang of it, and it makes for the deepest, darkest lashes you can imagine.  </li>
            <li> It is very volumizing, and I don&#x27;t get any black smudges under my eyes, which is the best part.</li>
            <li> goes on easily stays on pretty well</li>
            <li> This mascara goes on easily and with minimal clumps (which is unfortunately more user-error than the product&#x27;s fault, I&#x27;m sure).</li>
            <li> It worked fine for the first week or so</li>
            <li> overall, love the color, love the wet/thin-ish formula, love the simple packaging, love the price.</li>
            <li> I use this product and am a loyal fan.  </li>
            <li> Bold</li>
            <li> Quick drying&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s super clumpy...</li>
            <li> I have used many high end brands</li>
            <li> Dupe for high end mascara, true by its word very voluminous worth buying from amazon than stores for much better price and delivered to home!</li>
            <li> love this mascars, my only with is that there was so kind of control on the product, it just seems to come out to much</li>
            <li> Quality of the mascara is so good, lasts in the eyes for a long time.</li>
            <li> This goes on very nicely, fine, light application, not gooey or thick.. very nice.</li>
            <li> This mascara came on time and it became my new favorite.</li>
            <li> its just great really black mascara.</li>
            <li> The reviews on this mascara seemed to be overall pretty good.</li>
            <li> Washed the applicator twice and wiped out the throat of the tube with a cotton swab more than once, but the applicator consistently comes out of the tube with too much product.  </li>
            <li> Can get very clumpy easily</li>
            <li> This mascara always gives me a nice full last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this mascara before and tried others since but went back to it because I remembered it as being pretty good.</li>
            <li> When I tried it for the first time, my husband thought I was wearing falsies!</li>
            <li> It definitely makes my lashes look longer and fuller, more voluminous!  </li>
            <li> my favorite mascara so far!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Voluminous Mascara not only lengthens your lashes, it also gives it a nice bold coat of color.  </li>
            <li> It is great for everyday way, consistent and not clumpy!  </li>
            <li> So out of most products I use which goes from very high end to the low low end this is one of the best so far.</li>
            <li> This stuff looks amazing on second day wear just by adding a touch-up to the ends of your lashes)&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if applied proper, will make your eyelashes look AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This mascara really makes your eyes pop, it is clump free and non-irritating to my contact lenses.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth any price.</li>
            <li> The only mascara that I have liked.</li>
            <li> It stays fresh for about three months.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are as fresh at 10pm as they were at 7:30am.  </li>
            <li> This product is great if you want Beautiful,  Dark,  thick Lashes..  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m looking to do a more natural look, I&#x27;ll use this mascara by itself.</li>
            <li> Will probably never buy a different kind again.</li>
            <li> this product is agreat and well worth the buy.</li>
            <li> when I apply it, it coats every strand with its dark, beautiful goop that makes my eyelashes look sexy, long, and full.</li>
            <li> I have tried many others and don&#x27;t like them nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> I love how much this coats and it doesn&#x27;t take much...</li>
            <li> Love having it shipped directly to my home.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so worth buying.</li>
            <li> Its very easy to apply and the color doesn&#x27;t really spread out in a very wild way</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I wish more drugstore mascaras had this deep, rich color.  </li>
            <li> I keep repurchasing this mascara because it is a perfect basic mascara and is super black.  </li>
            <li> However, I think this mascara would be better suited to someone with a more normal length and volume to their lashes as it does not give mine enough of this.  </li>
            <li> I used and old brush for an empty bottle of mascara that has the thinner wand and it distributes the mascara on my eyelashes beautifully.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and makes lots of big lashes with no clumping.  </li>
            <li> :) its like creamy and really black:)</li>
            <li> I tried other products but wind up coming back to this one because it applies easily, evenly and makes my lashes look great.</li>
            <li> It started out as a great deal, but the past two deliveries have not been satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Voluminous products are great, this is my usual mascara,nothing else compares</li>
            <li> But it does not smell, which I like, it stays on my lashes all day long, and it has nice color.</li>
            <li> very easy to apply+ pretty color+long lasting</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve dropped some eye drops in the tube to refresh it every couple months) but 8 months later its still my go-to mascara and still going strong!</li>
            <li> The only drug store brand I liked this much was Maybelline &amp;#34;Lash Stylist&amp;#34;..</li>
            <li> I love the dark black color that I get, even application and good coverage without clumps!  </li>
            <li> I started using this mascara many years ago, but as new and cool looking mascaras come out (seems daily) of promises of just about every nature, no clumping, millions of lashes, super volumizing, etc, etc...</li>
            <li> Last all day &amp; washes off pretty easily!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t flake off randomly throughout the day, is perfect when layered, and comes off easily (as long as you don&#x27;t get the waterproof kind) at the end of the night.</li>
            <li> However, from the very first use, too much mascara comes on the wand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice true black.</li>
            <li> This mascara is fantastic in price and the color is deep and rich.  </li>
            <li> Good mascara, but clumps a little.  </li>
            <li> With all the options for mascara out there, this is not my first choice.</li>
            <li> no matter how many times I tried this, still same results.</li>
            <li> People think my lashes are much longer because of this mascara!  </li>
            <li> This one never fails me.</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara that I&#x27;ve used that I don&#x27;t have to worry about checking on.</li>
            <li> then your gonna get funny clumpy looking lashes.</li>
            <li> sucks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried SO many mascaras over the years and always come back to this one!</li>
            <li> I never buy beauty products without reading some reviews first.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real!</li>
            <li> She will be ordering more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> This really does give Voluminous lashes!</li>
            <li> Had my doubts, but it really works!</li>
            <li> I literally couldn&#x27;t believe the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> On my first application, my lashes were fuller nad longer.</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal products especially the mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara is very affordable compare to a lot of mascara and it works!  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping..excellent product!</li>
            <li> It used to be my favorite among the low cost mascaras.</li>
            <li> Lasted thru the evening &amp; really enhanced my lashes!</li>
            <li> I was hopeful that this lower cost mascara wouldn&#x27;t cause me the same problem that so many do, but it did:  </li>
            <li> First, I use a lash serum.  </li>
            <li> Better than most mascaras I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really flake - I like it !</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my go to and has never failed.</li>
            <li> First time using it..</li>
            <li> You can always tell from the consistency when it is first opened.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I apply one handed while holding a baby and trying to hold the tube away from the baby, I don&#x27;t have perfect application.</li>
            <li> Very clumpy!</li>
            <li> plus, this was also the first l&#x27;oreal mascara i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Once it sets, I can last 12+ hours flake and smudge free!</li>
            <li> does the trick ;-)</li>
            <li> when within its first week of use it made my lashes clumpy</li>
            <li> If you are on a budget you simply will not find a better mascara, whether you buy it here or at the store</li>
            <li> love this brush, I would definitely purchase this brand again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to first say that I love how deep the color is of this mascara.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t compare to higher end brands whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I bought many brands of mascara through the last 30 years and kept trying different ones because I wasn&#x27;t that pleased with each one that I tried.</li>
            <li> When I use this mascara, people ask me if my lashes are real!</li>
            <li> I was going for specifically length and got exactly what I asked for.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> After five hours or more, I would simply end up looking like a racoon.</li>
            <li> I have used just a few times and loved every time.</li>
            <li> , i was very sceptical buying this, but when i eventually did, my instinct was right.</li>
            <li> I go back to the tried and true L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Original Mascara.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a volumizing mascara, it won&#x27;t do much in the way of length, but really makes your lashes look super lush and full.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of not clumping and keeping my eyelashes soft but the time it takes to dry is too much for me.</li>
            <li> It dries so fast that when you try to apply more, it simply clumps up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Get the Maybelline Pump or Colossal volume express ones, those are incredible and get every lash, making mine look fake</li>
            <li> Like I said, my lashes are pretty long already, but this lengthens them even more so that it looks like I&#x27;m wearing falsies.</li>
            <li> The morning application provides good coverage and last the entire day.</li>
            <li> If I could change one thing, it would be to make it less flaky - by the end of the day, I need to swab my undereyes with Cetaphil moisturizer (that seems to remove and clean this mascara off more gently than anything else) to fix my raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> The Carbon Black formula is excellent if you&#x27;re seeking a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li> Great product as it is what she uses, OUr Austrailian shepard pppie tried to eat the other one but got it back,  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t flake at all, and the color is fantastic, feels were rich and wet going on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice dark formula and doesn&#x27;t cause my lashes to clump.</li>
            <li> It made them really full and they were soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> BUT.... I pefer the more natural long and fairly full look</li>
            <li> Have a dramatic look in your eyes, beautiful and real voluminous mascara!</li>
            <li> This mascara reminds me of Mally Mascara only it comes off easier, my favorite is Lancome Definicils High def</li>
            <li> Big, plump, full lashes!</li>
            <li> but I am loving the carbon black.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I did not like about this mascara is that the wand clumps easily - however</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to remove with facial soap and water.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump and can look natural or bold depending on how you apply.</li>
            <li> the large screen computer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d certainly recommend.</li>
            <li> So I just never stuck to a certain brand until I found L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Mascara.</li>
            <li> Spend a few more bucks and get the baby doll mascara by YSL, you wont regret it!</li>
            <li> I would expect it toward delivery time, but one delivery it arrived that way and the last delivery it was fine for a week, but then got clumpy.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminious Mascara in carbon black is my favorite mascara on the formula right now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer less on the brush, having more control, and starting out light but being able to apply multiple coats, if desired.</li>
            <li> The top of the mascara was smashed and the top of the packaging looks like it had been open a little.</li>
            <li> It got very clumpy by the 6th use or so.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very pigmented, but</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really liquidy and gives you spidery lashes.  </li>
            <li> I really really wanted to like this mascara</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy if you have really oily skin--all the mascara will be off your lashes and you&#x27;ll have racoon eyes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real mascara.  </li>
            <li> but it came with the curved wand, rather than the straight wand that is pictured.</li>
            <li> so you end up really wiping it around.</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Mascara ever since I was in High School!</li>
            <li> However, the brush leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li> Thanks to family life I had to cut corners.</li>
            <li> this is very comparable to the two face mascaras.</li>
            <li> My tube became very goopy within a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> This is a very clumpy mascara.</li>
            <li> I really disn&#x27;t get much with this.</li>
            <li> It really helps with volume as well.  </li>
            <li> Good everyday mascara that is easily layerable for a more dramatic look at night.</li>
            <li> Goes on without clonking and stays on the whole day without needing to reapply.  </li>
            <li> I really like the formula</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m much happier.</li>
            <li> This mascara leaves me lashes very voluminous and glamorous.</li>
            <li> Its clumps SO MUCH do NOT get this you will need to spend a lot of time on your makeup if you do.</li>
            <li> But its very clumpy.</li>
            <li> so this was very convenient for me.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this mascara with a wand that I REALLY like (CoverGirl Lash Blast) --</li>
            <li> Really makes my lashes appear thicker and blacker.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> once I have been asked if my eyelashes were real or not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it does not wear off throughout the day, does not smear, and even stayed put through a very vigorous workout in a non air conditioned place.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel I get as much from them as I use to.  </li>
            <li> I am very picky about mascara</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;With regard to &amp;#34;too much product on the brush&amp;#34</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real&#x27; by Benefit:</li>
            <li> Date is really close to expiration each time.</li>
            <li> So much I decided to write a review.</li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch.</li>
            <li> but after 1 month it often comes out too much on the brush and applies clumpy to my lashes.</li>
            <li> if you put too much on, you will have tarantella eyes that flakes off.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely my go to mascara.</li>
            <li> It clumped way too much for me.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about mine and this blew me away.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to toss it...</li>
            <li> As someone cursed with short, light, sparse eyelashes that do not like mascara I have been combating this problem for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li> and it is easier to use than some of the really fat ones.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> I switched to the younique brand and I am much happier with that for volumizing.</li>
            <li> Thanks for cooperating</li>
            <li> I tend to buy very exspensive make up</li>
            <li> there is so much product on the brush and the Brussels don&#x27;t balance.</li>
            <li> I did not care for this mascara as much as some of the others I tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clumpy and too much product gets applied onto the brush when dipped.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to add a lot of volume and length to their lashes but be carefull it does have a tendancy to glob up with the wand they provide.</li>
            <li> very full.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara</li>
            <li> Really sucks because I LOVED this mascara/</li>
            <li> The product is dark and applies easily without too much clumping, but I have the same problem with this as I do many mascaras</li>
            <li> As long as you only use it 3 months or less really excellent product</li>
            <li> far as I can tell, Wayne Goss was right.</li>
            <li> This is a good mascara and one I seem to fall back to after I try other brands.</li>
            <li> This also crimps very nicely if you give it a few minutes to dry, or crimp first and then apply.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, however it seemed to dry out very quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this mascara seems like a pain to use (and the reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it requires a bit more work than other mascaras)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve then started testing drug-store brands and after trying many of them (even other l&#x27;oreal mascaras)</li>
            <li> I usually do two coats and my lashes look stunning!</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that if you try to double coat more than .235 seconds after you applied the first coat</li>
            <li> I just love her eyes and imitated it through this mascara and other stuff.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Mascara from L&#x27;Oreal, even though its cheaper than their other mascaras.  </li>
            <li> , I got irritation with many other mascaras, but this one never irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> going back to volminous original.</li>
            <li> but this is better then any other brand I have tried.</li>
            <li> I tried all different, drug store, top rated brands (Maybelline/NYX/etc) and have not found anything that could compare to Lancôme Definicils or Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> Was also available here on Amazon for less than at my local stores + free shipping!</li>
            <li> It gives me long looking lashes that are clump free and its so much cheaper than anything you buy at the mall.</li>
            <li> Still, this is the one to wear if you want serious drama and gorgeous eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Not the best when it comes to length, but it makes your lashes look thick, plush and dark.</li>
            <li> mascara doesn&#x27;t clump hardly at all (tip: scrape off excess mascara and go lightly over each eye lid a couple of times), it lasts forever, coats every lash, comes off easily...</li>
            <li> Really makes lashes look longer and darker, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to this one, and the price is right!</li>
            <li> Love the dark black color, this is my absolute favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> Dark and lovely.</li>
            <li> I use water first to dissolve it and then use remover to remove it completely.</li>
            <li> and I love how the dark color makes my eyes stand out.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the most black of any mascara I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> It used to be so easy to wash off in the shower with minimal soap or makeup remover.</li>
            <li> &amp; i love the carbon black color</li>
            <li> It is noticeably better than the maybelline products Ive used previously.</li>
            <li> also, i needed to wipe off some of the product during initial use because it would have gotten real clumpy, real fast.</li>
            <li> Decently waterproof, but then again I have yet to try a truly waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> classic mascara.</li>
            <li> is very black, gives nice volume and length without being too much on the first coat or two, but definitely buildable if you desire</li>
            <li> Get yourself a decent waterproof mascara instead.</li>
            <li> Recently bought this mascara at my local cvs and when i used it, i fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> This made them big and bold.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t purchase this particular brand again.</li>
            <li> This is a classic.</li>
            <li> I also get coupons to be able to purchase this mascara at a lower cost as it is more expensive than Cover Girl and Maybelline varieties.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different mascaras and I always come back to this one.  </li>
            <li> This particular brand is one I return to time and time again.</li>
            <li> Not only that theirs alway a ton of product over flowing on top of the container when I open it.</li>
            <li> maybe not a word someone uses to describe mascara, but it is very creamy, not dry like some mascaras are (even when first opened).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara since I was in high school, which was 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used a lot of high end mascaras.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Compared to the high brand mascaras I&#x27;ve used in the past...for the price and quality you can not beat it.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this for a drugstore mascara.</li>
            <li> and I have used all the high end brands and everything in between.</li>
            <li> Given the raving reviews, I had high expectations for this mascara.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Its truly a deep black and such a great product.</li>
            <li> Long lasting beautiful black mascara.</li>
            <li> I can be sensitive to certain products.</li>
            <li> totaly old like my used one from 1 year ago!!</li>
            <li> For nighttime I use something a little more jazzy</li>
            <li> The color is an intense shade of black, and I can easily get away with doing just one coat of mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very loyal and will never try any other brand.</li>
            <li> Very dark, I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> Voluminous Mascara - it really causes my lashes to seem thicker and longer, which is no mean feat for my sixty year old eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite brand by far - even over the more expensive options out there.  </li>
            <li> which normally doesn&#x27;t happen with just one brand of mascara.</li>
            <li> But when you have to pick and choose where your money is going, the extra price isn’t worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump, and it leave my eyelashes looking full and long.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, but this bottle dried up in about a month.  </li>
            <li> After a few hours, I can see my lashes getting thinner and more sparse.</li>
            <li> Creates nice long lashes with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> The wand is nice and thick to plump up your lashes.  </li>
            <li> Nice thick lashes, but it is sticky to take off.</li>
            <li> The wand is nice and thick too.</li>
            <li> , this is very good and is only $5.00 something, I feel better buying the less expensive one...</li>
            <li> When removing this it required twice as many eye makeup remover pads than with my regular mascara, other than that it&#x27;s okay, just an average drugstore mascara</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product that I use everyday!</li>
            <li> This mascara does not dry out with normal use in less than three months, which is the maximum amount of time you are able to keep using mascara for hygiene reasons.in less than three months, which is the maximum amount of time you are able to keep using mascara for hygiene reasons.</li>
            <li> It clumped a little too easily, and was kind of hard to take off, even in the shower.</li>
            <li> I was looking for new mascara and the girl that works for me has eyelashes that hit her eyebrows</li>
            <li> so I can get a new one every 6 months, since I always forget to date the bottle, and forget when I bought them, and forget to toss them in 6 months.</li>
            <li> i never stick with products i always want something new, but with this product, i dont want anything new</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying department store mascaras the last few years, and, in an effort to cut back on my spending, decided to try this mascara since my favorite on-line makeup artist Makeup Geek has recommended it several times as her favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li> Great for volume, length and that natural glam-lash look without having to use fake lashes.</li>
            <li> This is a decent mascara for the price, but I should have known it would cause irritation with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> so when I try to just lightly go over the inner or outer corners, I get a big clump.</li>
            <li> Strong black color.</li>
            <li> I love the super dark black color.</li>
            <li> It gives you extremely long lashes and if you get regular (not waterproof) it comes off easily.</li>
            <li> You gotta move fast like a ninja if you want those bad boys to look good!</li>
            <li> I think the original lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t clump so much in such a short period of time.</li>
            <li> First time ordering online, and probably last.</li>
            <li> One of the only mascaras I buy consistently.  </li>
            <li> In order to use this up I have used it in conjunction with other wands that offer more separation such as The Rocket.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow if you YouTube this product its supposed to be off the hook!</li>
            <li> I had an open tube to finish first.  </li>
            <li> when I take it out, the tip contains a tiny bit of mascara on it or in other words, the tip contains more of the &#x27;goop&#x27;.</li>
            <li> with this mascara, 1-2 coats is enough because with the first coat, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> But once you get past that stage, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Wow, now these are some lashes!  </li>
            <li> I think I actually like it better than the other ones.  </li>
            <li> only use it on my upper lashes as I don’t look good with the heavily lined and lashed look.  </li>
            <li> but they are thin and very light colored, so the &amp;#34;Voluminous&amp;#34; part in the name is exactly what you get.</li>
            <li> Is an OK mascara I don&#x27;t love it or hate it .. is just all right</li>
            <li> but since I have black roots with the rest of my eyelashes being a light blonde, I need a mascara or my lashes look pretty nonexistent.</li>
            <li> The color is a very rich, deep black--more so than any other drugstore mascara I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> You absolutely cannot beat the price for such a high quality mascara.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a number of different drug store and high end mascaras, and this one is definitely high on my list!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apply your first coat very slowly from the bottom of the lashes to the top.  </li>
            <li> It looks great, doesn&#x27;t clump too bad and really adds volume!</li>
            <li> Obviously I haven&#x27;t used Tarte LCL, so I&#x27;m not sure how this compares, but I have no interest in trying it anymore, this is so amazing for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> While I already have fairly long eyelashes, it really lengthens them &amp; makes them look so much fuller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for thickening and lengthening your lashes, and it doesn&#x27;t break down during the day like some mascaras that leave little pieces of crumbled mascara under your eyes by the middle of the day.</li>
            <li> dark rich black&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Regular black works better.</li>
            <li> only downside is, the wet formula takes awhile to dry, so it&#x27;s easy to smudge right after you put it on.</li>
            <li> I love that this mascara doesn&#x27;t make your lashes hard or clumpy.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, stay clear.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long natural lashes already</li>
            <li> can produce very spidery lashes if you aren&#x27;t careful, but is VERY volumizing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was old or just the formula.  </li>
            <li> Too clogged, and it doesnt look so professional</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only beef, really.</li>
            <li> May not seem like a big deal, but I prefer the straight wand.</li>
            <li> I am now almost 50 years old</li>
            <li> It helps me pull off that Natural look</li>
            <li> so when the package comes, I know it&#x27;s time to throw out the old one.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was old?  </li>
            <li> a natural look?  </li>
            <li> so I can always swap out when they are getting old.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like it and will repurchase.</li>
            <li> You can put multiple layers on and it doesn&#x27;t really get clumpy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so busy</li>
            <li> I use a soap-free body wash in the shower and have no trouble getting if off.  </li>
            <li> I am a complete make up junkie and do not mind spending money on quality</li>
            <li> This product was old.</li>
            <li> and it is obviously an old tube.</li>
            <li> Amazon offers sale prices sometimes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is because they are stored in a hot place, stored too long, or if the manufacture has gotten skimpier on the product.  </li>
            <li> I think the mascara is old as it bothers my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used a multitude of mascaras in my life (I&#x27;m almost 35 years old)</li>
            <li> Probably old</li>
            <li> It clumps considerably, though.</li>
            <li> It is for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> It makes your eyelashes look pretty long and thick &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different mascaras and this one definitely is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It covers well, is nice and thick, and the brush is simple and uncomplicated.</li>
            <li> I use a thick formula to plump lashes, scraping the sides of the brush to make sure excess product does not cause clumping and spider-y lashes.</li>
            <li> I thought it was kind of thin.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite mascaras, hands down sultry and long lashes and not a beastly removal process.</li>
            <li> I ordered ORIGINAL and this is not ORIGINAL</li>
            <li> And every single time the same thing happens-I think, &amp;#34;I should have just stayed with my tried and true L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous Mascara-damn it!&amp;#34; MONEY IN THE TRASH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t found anything better though and at least once I&#x27;ve had the same problem buying from my local drug store, so I&#x27;m still willing to purchase this way.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is that it dries quickly so you can only apply once meaning that if you go back to apply more it will clump your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> But due to some new year budgeting my $20 mascara was one of the first things to go.</li>
            <li> Since it dries quickly, I&#x27;ve found that I can&#x27;t alternate between eyes for a second coat, but stay with one eye to do two coats, before moving on to the second</li>
            <li> Is super black and matte.  </li>
            <li> (I used to purchase much more expensive brands like Christian Dior and didn&#x27;t get any benefit from them) and it isn&#x27;t super cakey nor does it contribute to spider lashes.  </li>
            <li> Super pigmented black color.  </li>
            <li> Super black.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have been applying various drugstore mascaras over ten years.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s you build to create nice thick long lashes</li>
            <li> Clumps a little but not bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the high end brands (bobbi brown, dior, nars) but always come back to this.</li>
            <li> The carbon black is great dark black.</li>
            <li> I love it at first, but it was very irritating to my eyes.  </li>
            <li> This makes my lashed look much thicker and stays on well all day long</li>
            <li> When you first use this, the formula is a bit on the wet, runny side...</li>
            <li> It will hardly budge in the rain, but it comes off easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I forget to pick up a new tube of different mascara,</li>
            <li> It is very watery and takes forever to dry</li>
            <li> I have to carefully smooth out the clumps with an eyebrow comb after applying, which takes way too long and is not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I really like L&#x27;Oreal but would probably choose a different product next time.</li>
            <li> ….. is that this product can be kind of difficult to completely remove.</li>
            <li> It is does not add much volume to my lashes and only moderate amount of length.  </li>
            <li> With that being said, this does not deserve a strong negative mark against it, but a note of caution before purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff , if you want them thick put multiple coat on</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer, the first week I did have spider lashes.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal makes a number of mascara products, but the Voluminous (5X the fullness) is it, bare none!</li>
            <li> The first few days that this mascara is brand new</li>
            <li> I normally like this brand, but those I get through amazon seem dry like they are old.</li>
            <li> Great for a few weeks, but clumps quickly and badly.</li>
            <li> I would expect any mascara to hold decently under such basic scenarios.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a classic mascara--more expensive ones from the  L&#x27;Oreal line flake more than this one.</li>
            <li> I generally have to wipe up some smudge that makes it to my lower lid as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> Totally clumpy and felt old.</li>
            <li> It does require some focused attention to completely remove (just cleanser on hands isn&#x27;t enough).</li>
            <li> I bought it back near Christmas, its august</li>
            <li> Forget what the &amp;#34;make up artists&amp;#34; say as they apparently have never tried this product.</li>
            <li> This Loreal mascara is actually closer in quality and performance to the expensive department store brands (most of which cost four or five times as much).</li>
            <li> Then barely apply to your lower lashes......  </li>
            <li> This goes on wet and clumpy, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem at all with it running and it stays on the whole day.</li>
            <li> This product looks nice, but it clumps terribly on the brush, such that every now and then you have to clean the bristle with hot water to get all the excess mascara off of it and then re-insert it to apply the mascara.</li>
            <li> What a dissapointment knowing I could have spent a few dollars more for the REAL thing that would have lasted me a few months.</li>
            <li> For some crazy reason, it works better now 5 months later than it did the first week.</li>
            <li> This mascara does the job well, and it is very affordable compared to some other mascaras out there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Loreal&#x27;s Original is thick.</li>
            <li> I prefer a more dramatic look.  </li>
            <li> If your mascara is very clumpy, simply wash the wand with soap and water and allow to dry before putting it back in the tube.</li>
            <li> It was a little clumpy at first</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my fiance who was having trouble finding this locally in the right color/shade.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous first, either this one or regular black, then finishing with a coat of Benefit</li>
            <li> I really like how this mascara makes my lashes look but by noon it has been leaving dark smudges under my eyes leaving me with raccoon eyes for the rest of my day.</li>
            <li> As to if I would purchase this product again--no, I would probably give another mascara a try or possibly use this with a base coat of Maybelline Great Lash Clear Mascara.&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look long and lush</li>
            <li> I waited until my Covergirl lash blast dried out before buying - was very eager!</li>
            <li> I love that I get long and thick lashes without clumping and with long wear.</li>
            <li> I sometimes do two coats for really thick and full lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Certainly, I did get sufficient use out of the previous ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is true that the formula starts out very thin when you first open it and thickens over time, so you have to wait and recoat the first few times you use</li>
            <li> Serves me right, since I am ordering items on my phone ( not able to see ) verses</li>
            <li> It smudges, it&#x27;s clunky, I have to brush my eye lashes because they will be stuck and my natural eye lashes are very long.</li>
            <li> I have very long natural lashes, but they are light-colored.  </li>
            <li> This mascara made my lashes look so much thicker and longer than my previous mascara.</li>
            <li> mascara was old and dry</li>
            <li> This stuff really is carbon black.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really darker than blackest black.</li>
            <li> My eyes look so thick and full after only one coat.</li>
            <li> Really like this mascara the only down fall after using it for about two weeks</li>
            <li> As a Caucasian female with blonde eyelashes, it is often hard to find a mascara that makes my stubby lashes look full.</li>
            <li> For a less dramatic daytime effect use only one coat,  I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> The Carbon Black color is really deep and intense, and it can be tricky to remove it from your lashes at night.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s such an intense black.</li>
            <li> I think it works a little better than other mascaras, but it&#x27;s average for me..</li>
            <li> Good drug store mascara, very little clumping, adds dramatic lashes.  </li>
            <li> I do find that when you get a new tube, there in an excessive amount on the brush, but I always keep my tube that&#x27;s getting low and use the two together until the new tube is manageable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super dark black</li>
            <li> Make my eyelashes huge and is very is very thick.</li>
            <li> , my lashes look so thick and full and long after using this product.</li>
            <li> Although the color is good and the product lasts a long time, it&#x27;s very difficult to apply without looking like I have spiders for eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara really does the trick of building up fine lashes, giving a dramatic look if you work it a little before it dries.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this mascara, because the wand looks like it would fluff out lashes and lengthen them, but I felt like this mascara was dry and flaked a lot.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes super long and thick.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer noted, the mascara is also difficult to remove with just facial cleanser (I even have one that is intended to remove makeup and does remove other mascara nicely).  </li>
            <li> The ONLY complaint I have is when you first use it, a little too much product comes out on the wand</li>
            <li> Every morning, I pull out a new chunk of black mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have light, thin, but long lashes, and what I got was a clump fest.</li>
            <li> However, it became thick and gross after using it for that first week.</li>
            <li> It may dry out sooner than I would like, i.e., with 2 weeks of daily use, that is possible.</li>
            <li> Dark and lush and thickens my lashes, but a bit smudgy by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> My regular brand and color for a long time now.</li>
            <li> Also, the mascara doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> do a second coat BUT don&#x27;t forget to wiggle the brush and to not wait too long in between coats.</li>
            <li> My lashes are long and touch my upper eyelid giving me the transfer smudge that drives me up a wall.</li>
            <li> I love Voluminous Mascara, but this particular one appears to be thick, and it&#x27;s application applies too heavy and thick, almost, but not, clumpy.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is a really dark deep black, which I really like.  </li>
            <li> I really want my money back but think it&#x27;s probably too late.</li>
            <li> They became so dry and red that my coworkers felt the need to comment on them..</li>
            <li> Full, long, thick lashes are always in style, but applying false lashes daily isn’t always practical and is very time consuming.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried ALMOST every single mascara at my local drugstores &amp; this</li>
            <li> - Put 2 drops of lavender essential oil in each new tube and watch your lashes get longer within a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I usually keep a few on hand, since I go through them so quickly.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous other brands in all different price ranges.</li>
            <li> I still prefer other more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> It makes my lashes super dark, thick, and long without looking spidery or clumpy.</li>
            <li> I have tried using as little as possible and only applying to my upper lashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for 3 years now, sometimes I try other stuff, but after a few applications of a new brand I always end up throwing it in the make-up junk drawer and coming back to this stuff instead.</li>
            <li> I really have nothing negative to say.</li>
            <li> Like it was sitting on the warehouse shelf WAY TOO LONG.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mascara for a long time, and when it runs out, I&#x27;d probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> I wish it was easier to remove, and it will smudge after a long work day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for as long as I can remember and nothing comes close to it.</li>
            <li> This product is not natural....  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my long lashes from women and the truth</li>
            <li> is my lashes are not that long, it&#x27;s the mascara.  </li>
            <li> they are so long.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I already have long lashes -- but truly this does add volume</li>
            <li> Makes lashes long, and potion is not too sticky-</li>
            <li> Definitely not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as long as I can remember (and that&#x27;s a long, long time) and there is nothing that compares to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a thin or thick formula</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s thick, makes my lashes longer and doesn&#x27;t flake off much or at all.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to use two different removers each time I use it to get it off, and even then I&#x27;m still left with lots of black streaks around my eyes that I can&#x27;t seem to get off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to use two different removers each time I use it to get it off, and even then I&#x27;m still left with lots of black streaks around my eyes that I can&#x27;t seem to get off.  </li>
            <li> With this mascara, I have to use a total of 3 pads (one pad, front and back for each eye, and a follow-up pad for the black smudges I&#x27;ve created on my face).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake and it doesn&#x27;t leave my lashes stiff and so far, no raccoon eyes at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> it takes me two make-up remover pads to get it all off, where I&#x27;ve only used one for every other mascara I have tried.</li>
            <li> I usually wear waterproof mascara, simply because my eyes tear up occasionally and the last thing I want are raccoon eyes!  </li>
            <li> I rather have the more expensive brands like IT AND LANCOME!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend ANY OTHER MASCARA and won&#x27;t &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; a different ones</li>
            <li> Bought this but don&#x27;t support the brand anymore due to its political affiliations.</li>
            <li> I write a lot of amazon reviews, and i think this is my first negative review, but OH MY this product DID NOT work for me!  </li>
            <li> This made my lashes long !</li>
            <li> Use one layer, allow to dry (will dry when applying on the other eye) then apply a second layer.</li>
            <li> I have very long lashes</li>
            <li> lashes are very long, so I dont need any help there.</li>
            <li> I have very long lashes, so volume is a must for me.</li>
            <li> I think it beats the department store brands hands down and with the price of L&#x27;Oreal being so affordable, there&#x27;s no excuse for not changing out your mascara every month as is recommended.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m expecting it to dry out somewhat.  </li>
            <li> dry too crunchy</li>
            <li> It take a bit to dry</li>
            <li> If you can make it past those first few uses, the formula</li>
            <li> After several hours, you will possibly get a few.</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara, not too thin, not too thick.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had a single problem with clumping.</li>
            <li> But in reality it was just single one.</li>
            <li> Still, it works above average for a drugstore mascara.</li>
            <li> The mascara is probably above average as mascara goes.</li>
            <li> DRY AND CLUMPY!</li>
            <li> I do like the deep black color</li>
            <li> My only problems are that it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look any fuller, which is what you&#x27;d expect from a mascara named &amp;#34;Voluminous&amp;#34;, and at the end of the day I sometimes see black smudges under my eyes.</li>
            <li> makes lashes look really long, thick and natural  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I typically have to wipe quite a bit of the product off the brush prior to application because you get a ton!</li>
            <li> The package is intact but the ink inside is dry and so not much of it.  </li>
            <li> I prefer that regular Voluminous mascara in black over this.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal Voluminous Mascara Carbon Black was on sale at my local Walgreen&#x27;s for $5.99</li>
            <li> It is very dry</li>
            <li> Only down side is after using it for about 2 weeks on a daily basic mascara gets thick and clumps.</li>
            <li> Love this, keep coming back to it after trying other mascaras and being disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is also extremely hard to completely remove even after repeated scrubbing and it&#x27;s not even water proof.</li>
            <li> After a few days it does get clumpy, but you can just wipe the excess back in the tube.  </li>
            <li> The mascara is somewhat wet</li>
            <li> I have thin lashes and there is so much mascara on the brush that it clumped when I put it on.</li>
            <li> once it&#x27;s wet it just slides off onto a cloth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really tired of companies charging so much for mascara</li>
            <li> and they just don&#x27;t meet the standards expected by a woman.</li>
            <li> It comes in multiple shads, and goes on heavily without being clumpy.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday along with my L&#x27;Oreal double extended mascara.  </li>
            <li> This is the second tube that has arrived so dried out it was not usable</li>
            <li> not as expected; clumpy</li>
            <li> but i guess that is expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my thin lashes very full.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be careful to wipe off the applicator on the edges of the tube</li>
            <li> but after a couple coats you have to be careful about clumping.</li>
            <li> Not very voluminous and doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes stand out.</li>
            <li> buit have minimal luck.</li>
            <li> Must be careful so they do not clump</li>
            <li> Try this mascara if you want thick, lush lashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara really makes your eyelashes stand out, it almost looks like you&#x27;re wearing false lashes</li>
            <li> it really does add volume to your lashes and gives you that \\&quot;i&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes\\&quot; effect.</li>
            <li> I got fake eyelashes right after I bought this</li>
            <li> Although this mascara is really black and it does make your lashes longer it tends to dry out through out the day</li>
            <li> (as this also happens with time with other brands and other formula).</li>
            <li> This mascara never irritates my eyes like other.</li>
            <li> I am currently using this mascara vs my usual Clinique.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> On a whim, while ordering some other beauty products from Amazon, I read the reviews for this</li>
            <li> I try other brands once in a while</li>
            <li> I will be trying out other mascara products before I consider buying this one again.</li>
            <li> I will be experimenting with other drug store brands.</li>
            <li> Not as much as other mascara I have tried.</li>
            <li> never used anything other than this product.</li>
            <li> All of the other store brands (Revlon, Almay, CoverGirl, Nautrogena, Maybelline) do not even come close.</li>
            <li> Then go to your other eye and repeat on that side.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much a useless purchase.</li>
            <li> Could be because it is a little dry.</li>
            <li> Takes a little longer to dry than I&#x27;m used to, but I have no issues with it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little bit dry...</li>
            <li> it will dry a little and not be too clumpy.</li>
            <li> Within an hour its running down my face and making me look like I had a rough night on the town.</li>
            <li> like a very wet formula, so</li>
            <li> BUT it goes on very WET and it clumps up on the wand.</li>
            <li> This is a very wet mascara.  </li>
            <li> this is one of the very very few mascaras that does not give me upper lid smudge.</li>
            <li> that I have new glasses that mean that I cannot wear mascara that makes my eyelashes too long because my lenses are so thick.  </li>
            <li> so it takes a few minutes to dry, which means that additional coats can be done.  </li>
            <li> that it leaves black wet smuge anywhere in its path</li>
            <li> usually get the black, didn&#x27;t notice that this was different until I used it.</li>
            <li> And my natural lashes are very thin and short.</li>
            <li> Just be careful applying it on your lower lashes, as the wand can be a little bulky and it is a pain to remove if it gets on your skin.</li>
            <li> so this one smears much less than other products</li>
            <li> Less clumps than other brands but smears and runs.  </li>
            <li> But the thing about a waterproof formula is it&#x27;s hard to add several coats.  </li>
            <li> Long lashes, but very little clumping.</li>
            <li> It blotches and leave dark under eye tint.</li>
            <li> Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> This flakes and leaves dark smudges around my eye as I apply it.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long this sat in a warehouse, but I&#x27;ve gotten clearance mascaras at a grocery store that were fresher.</li>
            <li> but it is a think dark color</li>
            <li> -- it comes off and leaves dark shadows under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Clumps and is so dark it makes your eyes look awful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the mascara could be too thick and glob my eyelashes into one big thick lash especially if I use the wand it comes with.  </li>
            <li> I think that this would be a really smart buy for anyone who craves really dramatic lashes but either can’t wear false lashes, or don’t have the time to apply falsies in their daily routine.</li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend with contact lens because if you had to use eye drops, this mascara would run all over down your face.  </li>
            <li> I will never use any other mascara!</li>
            <li> When I accidently got it on my skin it required soap and water to remove, unlike some other brands I&#x27;ve tried that just needed a little spit on a fingertip.</li>
            <li> Do the other side and WAIT!  </li>
            <li> Also it rubs off onto your face so it made me look like I had dark under eye circles because of black being rubbed off.  </li>
            <li> I layer mine with other types in order to create thick, long lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that is does get a little clumpy as it ages.</li>
            <li> The carbon black makes your lashes really thick, which makes it a little trickier to use because the same thickening fibers have a tendency to clump.</li>
            <li> The other tubes did not go bad as quick.</li>
            <li> it flakes off and leaves black dots all over my undereyes and nose.</li>
            <li> brush is typical, nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had black smudges on my lower eyelid</li>
            <li> I buy the carbon black and it doesn&#x27;t clump on my lashes at all.</li>
            <li> I had black smudges under my eyes.</li>
            <li> black smudges below my eyes well before the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Lengthening and Volumizing Mascara, Black, 0.24 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I come home with black under my eyes every time I wear it.  </li>
            <li> And it is black as coal.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;OREAL PARIS -  TELESCOPIC- carbon black mascara, and</li>
            <li> Half way thru the bottle, the brush comes out globed up with mascara.</li>
            <li> I was always looking for a really black mascara</li>
            <li> leaves black circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s less product on</li>
            <li> because mascara is a serious matter and if my review helps only one girl (or guy..</li>
            <li> I use the small makeup remover pads from Almay, and usually I can use one pad (front and back) for both eyes.  </li>
            <li> Even when I think I&#x27;ve removed it all, sometimes I wake up with black mascara residue/streaks around my eyes.</li>
            <li> After two or three hours I would notice black spots at the outer side of my eyes.</li>
            <li> so if you blink or mess up you end up with the mascara all over.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time because it does not get all thick and clumpy on my lashes.  </li>
            <li> now I&#x27;m on the hunt for a new mascara since this one has failed me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I have to wash my eyes twice (once with cold cream) to really remove this mascara, or else I have black smudges that look like black eyes all around my eye</li>
            <li> It smudges as crazy under my eyes in a first few hours after applying.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, but something to think about if you&#x27;re less than diligent about removing your makeup at night</li>
            <li> However, they also cause my lashes to stick together, so now I&#x27;ve had to buy a little eyelash brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this and was a little nervous.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump, but it does flake a little.  </li>
            <li> I use this with a small sample mascara that I get from lancome when purchasing face moisturizers and other things.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I use the lancome to separate since this can get a little clumpy.</li>
            <li> I just want my lashes to look a little thicker and fuller.</li>
            <li> If you put too little on you will feel like &amp;#34;eh&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> It separates lashes will  little to no clumping and elongates them like spider legs.</li>
            <li> After wearing it for a few hours, I can expect to see dark residue on the bottom of my eyes, and I usually need to forcefully wipe it off with my fingers.</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t dried out AT ALL.</li>
            <li> So when I got around to opening it, the mascara was dried out.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s used this for a few years now with no complaints.</li>
            <li> In everyday wear, smudges under the eye by evening.</li>
            <li> They sometimes seem dried out a bit</li>
            <li> My go to mascara is a green Cover Girl (not w/p).</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few months now</li>
            <li> It gets somewhat clumpy after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I end up with raccoon eyes after a few hours.</li>
            <li> For everyday, this is untouchable.</li>
            <li> Wait a few seconds and look your lashes over.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, a few hours into use, I had two raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is so damn messy.</li>
            <li> It took me a few days to like this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been asked several times if my lashes were false.</li>
            <li> , the only complaint is that the mascara comes out really thick on the wand</li>
            <li> This creates dark, thick, black lashes like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have long thick lashes, but this makes me look like I do for a fraction of the price of designer brands!</li>
            <li> this one is very black....</li>
            <li> I love this mascara because it&#x27;s dark, doesn&#x27;t clump and stays on all day, but it leaves terrible raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> and I have to keep scraping some off the brush, but color is very black and think, would recommend.</li>
            <li> And by this i mean i got somethimg in my eye, teared a little and had so much of a mess i had to remove my make up.</li>
            <li> , doesnt clump, makes your lashes look so dark and thick.</li>
            <li> Sometimes  it is hard to find the Carbon Black in stores</li>
            <li> I say that because nothing is worse than a dry mascara.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it&#x27;s a little too thick for my taste.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I had avoided using any mascara on my lower lashes because it usually turned me into a racoon at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I usually use 2 mascaras to get the effect that I want (I like using a</li>
            <li> I decided to take advantage of the \\&quot;Subscribe and Save\\&quot; price and purchase on Amazon, rather than my usual Target.</li>
            <li> I am not able to leave seller feedback because I would say this is a bait and switch.  </li>
            <li> This has been my go-to mascara for the past 3 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Voluminous mascara for the past 20 years.  </li>
            <li> You’ll probably find a small mass of it at the tip of the brush after you’ve been using it for awhile.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the shelf life for this type of product is, but I guess I&#x27;m out my $6, because it&#x27;s past the return window.  </li>
            <li> No volume at all..a big fail.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s user error or the design</li>
            <li> and I usually use the black/brown</li>
            <li> I bought this once when the store was out of the mascara I&#x27;d usually use</li>
            <li> (Target usually has it on sale for example).</li>
            <li> I keep buying expensive mascaras and always go back to this.</li>
            <li> So finding a way to get the look of fake lashes without actually having to take the time to glue them on is life changing!</li>
            <li> The wand is also difficult to manipulate to ensure it gets every one of my tiny</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again because of that,</li>
            <li> I usually get the &amp;#34;very black&amp;#34; or &amp;</li>
            <li> A little bit sad because I could have spent my money on smth else.</li>
            <li> i really was disappointed.</li>
            <li> (My lashes have to stand out behind glasses and black cat eye eyeliner).  </li>
            <li> I like the fullness it gives my lashes, without clumpy mess that some mascaras leave behind.</li>
            <li> so bored of new mascaras with weird brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say.  </li>
            <li> I was a die hard fan of a well known brand for years.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter how hard you try, it will leave some product on your lash line.</li>

            <li> Sticky and hard to wash off.  </li>
            <li> This one has a thin consistency, so it is a little easier to apply, before it eventually ends up under your eyes.  </li>
            <li> It sometimes get tricky after you&#x27;ve used it for a while as the formula thickens (naturally), you&#x27;d end up having to scrape the excess on the tip and so on, but it doesn&#x27;t make it a bad product</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it for at least five years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another type of mascara for at least 30 years and have never swayed from it.</li>

            <li> applying a second coat on dried lashes is a BAD IDEA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really am not loving this mascara.</li>
            <li> AGAIN AT LEAST FROM HERE</li>
            <li> Or someone who is looking for a less dramatic look.  </li>
            <li> This mascara sucks</li>
            <li> maybe because it goes on so thick</li>
            <li> You need to work *slowly* with this mascara.  </li>
            <li> Then, slowly work it up through your lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too thick and don&#x27;t get clumps.</li>
            <li> This mascara may work well for those with thick lashed.</li>
            <li> I was expecting lots of volume but this will do, not amazing</li>
            <li> The wand is thick and plentiful bristle to stroke my lashes and volumize it.  </li>
            <li> It works well in making my lashes appear fuller and longer (no clumping too despite the watery and thick formula).</li>
            <li> it makes them so thick.</li>
            <li> The brush sucks the mascara is extremely thick</li>
            <li> I already have fairly thick lashes</li>
            <li> Repeat but this time not as slowly.  </li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes thick and it separates them.</li>
            <li> Thick.</li>
            <li> I hate the idea of tugging on the delicate skin around my eyes to remove this, so I won&#x27;t be re-purchasing.his instead of those more expensive brands that I had been using!      </li>
            <li> Makes them very dramatic and long.</li>
            <li> Not sure why!</li>
            <li> While I really like this mascara, it&#x27;s practically impossible to remove!  </li>
            <li> While I really like this mascara, it&#x27;s practically impossible to remove!  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m very disappointed to find that after only a few hours it will flake and leave dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> A ridiculous amount of product built up on the brush</li>
            <li> Once it sheds the lil black specks of mascara will fall in your eye which is extremely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> As for the bad ratings they probably didn&#x27;t put enough coats on or didn&#x27;t apply it correctly.</li>
            <li> So much so that I thew away this mascara before it was finished because I hated the curved wand.</li>
            <li> but quality was not good.</li>
            <li> The wand is bad to make your eyelashes look long, it just clumps.  </li>
            <li> I definitely suggest ordering this mascara, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I am a big animal lover and learned after I bought it that loreal does test on animals. :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed big time.</li>
            <li> The volume isn&#x27;t insane, but that&#x27;s not what I was interested in.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for at least 15 years!  </li>
            <li> I noticed it starting to get clumpy :(</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and coarser lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and provides quite a bit of volume to your lashes.  </li>
            <li> you take it out of the tube&lt;br /&gt;leaky, wet, and gets black all over your hands, your towels, just&lt;br /&gt;leaky garbage, too thick when it comes out of the tube but worst thing</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the recipe must have changed because the last one I bought clumped so bad it was unusable.</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> I put on make-up at around 7:30am every morning and remove it at approximately 10:00pm every evening.  </li>
            <li> I have been addicted to Tarte&#x27;s Lights, Camera, Lashes mascara forever.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced it being clumpy like</li>
            <li> Poor product.</li>
            <li> Every day I used it, it smeared all over under my eyes, irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li> There they are!&amp;#34; I get asked if I wear false lashes...</li>
            <li> I am not looking to get the look of false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> don’t want to wear false eyelashes because I would feel that my eyes are heavy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, every single time I have tried to use it, I end up noticing that after a couple of hours it runs down terribly.</li>
            <li> From time to time, I will stray and buy an expensive brand like Dior or Benefit, however I am always disappointed and mad at myself for spending so much.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t so horrible that I felt the need to throw it away and get a new tube (it does add volume to your lashes like the tube says), but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this mascara again.</li>
            <li> It does give somewhat of a dramatic lash if used with eye lash curler.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes so dramatic.</li>
            <li> but it did run a little in the bad humidity in S C or when I cried at a wedding</li>
            <li> Maybe I got an old batch, but this mascara was just awful!</li>
            <li> , I just hate having to replace the tube faster than I do with other mascaras.</li>
            <li> But also looks as dramatic as fake lashes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I just got a bad one</li>
            <li> Disappointed and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Wears just like expensive mascara</li>
            <li> This smudges and runs and is impossible to wipe off without using serious amounts of cleanser.</li>
            <li> It separates my thin eyelashes and make them look fuller after I apply it twice or sometimes 3 times!</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I still have my expensive mascaras, but nothing beats this price and the results you get.</li>
            <li> My friends even think i&#x27;m wearing fake lashes.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong mascara.</li>
            <li> The brush is lame, every time you pull it out of the tube</li>
            <li> It is also difficult to take of.</li>
            <li> [sad face]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, it outperforms some of the high-end expensive brands you can purchase at places like Sephora.  </li>
            <li> but this mascara out does any expensive mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It gives me length and volume, people have asked me if my eyelashes are fake before&lt;</li>
            <li> but I guess I got the wrong ones.  </li>
            <li> i have even been asked if i have false lashes on!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like it.it‘s hard to  remover，soooooo hard!!!!</li>
            <li> Start by wiggling it into the base of your lashes really slowly and coat the bases well.  </li>
            <li> I hate the idea of tugging on the delicate skin around my eyes to remove this, so I won&#x27;t be re-purchasing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been using high-end products and would end up either unhappy with the formula, or get allergies, or it just wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> i dont know why all bloggers and youtubers are just crazy about this mascara,</li>
            <li> I was so SAD :-(</li>
            <li> I tried some on and my family members thought that i was wearing false lashes!!</li>

            <li> It blotches and leave dark under eye tint.</li>
            <li> While I love this mascara I returned it because of the packaging. It stated that it came in a four pack but when I received it there was only one. I would buy again if the packaging information is correct.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy clumpy lashes than this is your product.I do enjoy clumpy lashes but not to the point where all of them are sticking together. I love L&#x27;Oreal and I will look around for more mascaras I give this product a 4-star</li>
            <li> good mascara. wetter formula especially if you are used to waterproof mascaras. i know they come in a curved brush but i ended up just curving the brush because i feel like it grabs the lashes better. also, i needed to wipe off some of the product during initial use because it would have gotten real clumpy, real fast. overall, love the color, love the wet/thin-ish formula, love the simple packaging, love the price.</li>
            <li> I didnt like this product. It got very clumpy by the 6th use or so.</li>
            <li> This mascara made my lashes look so much thicker and longer than my previous mascara. However, they also cause my lashes to stick together, so now I&#x27;ve had to buy a little eyelash brush.</li>
            <li> As described. Promptly delivered.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t lI&#x27;ve this, I bought it in a pinch when I needed mascara and this was one of the cheaper ones, it&#x27;s very pigmented, but in a bad way. When removing this it required twice as many eye makeup remover pads than with my regular mascara, other than that it&#x27;s okay, just an average drugstore mascara</li>
            <li> does not stay on your lashes and  ends up under my eyes.disappointing</li>
            <li> This mascara goes on nicely, but from the time I put it on in the morning to the time I get to work I have smudges below my lower lashes.  I tried putting powder below my lashes, but this only minimized the problem - I still continued to have smudges.  As another reviewer noted, the mascara is also difficult to remove with just facial cleanser (I even have one that is intended to remove makeup and does remove other mascara nicely).  If you use a separate makeup remover regularly, this wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  With all the options for mascara out there, this is not my first choice.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it clumps a bit. I like the original much better. I think the original lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t clump so much in such a short period of time. It doesn&#x27;t spread out my lashes like I want it to. You have to use a brush to spread them out. I think I&#x27;ll stick to the L&#x27;Oreal original in the gray bottle.</li>
            <li> This is good, basic mascara. One of the better mascaras I&#x27;ve tried. Nothing to write home about or life changing, but just good mascara.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this mascara, because the wand looks like it would fluff out lashes and lengthen them, but I felt like this mascara was dry and flaked a lot. I don&#x27;t know if it was old or just the formula.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again. I will still be on the lookout for the perfect drugstore mascara, because once I find it, it will hopefully be cheaper than the department store $32 mascaras.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed with this mascara. Most of the reviews are good and everyone loves it, but for me it&#x27;s being the opposite. It leaves a bunch of mascara on my lashes and it looks terrible. Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> This mascara, like so many others, smudges easily and gives me raccoon eyes.  This one has a thin consistency, so it is a little easier to apply, before it eventually ends up under your eyes.  Some people on here have given it good reviews, which is why I tried it, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> perfect eyelashes after try this cosmetic.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. It helps my eyelashes have definition, and it does not flake. I find it a bit of a pain to wash it off...maybe because it goes on so thick it takes me two make-up remover pads to get it all off, where I&#x27;ve only used one for every other mascara I have tried. I will buy it again though, as the price cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! My fav! I don&#x27;t have long thick lashes, but this makes me look like I do for a fraction of the price of designer brands!</li>
            <li> Good product but can clump lashes quite easily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying department store mascaras the last few years, and, in an effort to cut back on my spending, decided to try this mascara since my favorite on-line makeup artist Makeup Geek has recommended it several times as her favorite mascara.  It&#x27;s a great mascara, but there&#x27;s definitely a learning curve that goes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading about it online, I&#x27;ve found some tricks that have helped me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The first few days that this mascara is brand new, it&#x27;s really liquidy and gives you spidery lashes.  If you can make it past those first few uses, the formula thickens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* If the brush has a lot of product on it when you take it out of the tube, brush the excess off onto the top of the container or use a paper towel to wipe it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  You need to work *slowly* with this mascara.  Start by wiggling it into the base of your lashes really slowly and coat the bases well.  Then, slowly work it up through your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Since it dries quickly, I&#x27;ve found that I can&#x27;t alternate between eyes for a second coat, but stay with one eye to do two coats, before moving on to the second eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The Carbon Black color is really deep and intense, and it can be tricky to remove it from your lashes at night.  I&#x27;ve found that I have to wash my eyes twice (once with cold cream) to really remove this mascara, or else I have black smudges that look like black eyes all around my eye socket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this mascara seems like a pain to use (and the reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it requires a bit more work than other mascaras), it&#x27;s not bad once you get the hang of it, and it makes for the deepest, darkest lashes you can imagine.  Since it&#x27;s a volumizing mascara, it won&#x27;t do much in the way of length, but really makes your lashes look super lush and full.  It&#x27;s perfect for a smokey eye look, or even with lighter eye makeup, if you like more noticeable lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already ordered this on Subscribe and Save, and will definitely be re-purchasing this instead of those more expensive brands that I had been using!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 3/23/11:  I originally gave this 4 stars, but just downgraded it to 3 stars.  While I really like this mascara, it&#x27;s practically impossible to remove!  I&#x27;ve had to use two different removers each time I use it to get it off, and even then I&#x27;m still left with lots of black streaks around my eyes that I can&#x27;t seem to get off.  I hate the idea of tugging on the delicate skin around my eyes to remove this, so I won&#x27;t be re-purchasing.his instead of those more expensive brands that I had been using!

            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t separate lashes well and I get a lot of clumping.</li>
            <li> I love Voluminous Mascara, but this particular one appears to be thick, and it&#x27;s application applies too heavy and thick, almost, but not, clumpy.  First time ordering online, and probably last.</li>
            <li> Best mascara hands down I&#x27;ve tried them all!!!</li>
            <li> Good mascara, but clumps a little.  Could be because it is a little dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for years and years. Unfortunately the recipe must have changed because the last one I bought clumped so bad it was unusable. My mother in law used this mascara forever too and she also had the same issue with the last one she purchased. Really sucks because I LOVED this mascara/ now I&#x27;m on the hunt for a new mascara since this one has failed me.</li>
            <li> Too clogged, and it doesnt look so professional no matter how many times I tried this, still same results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not savvy with make-up, so when something works well for me, that&#x27;s a good sign. This mascara goes on easily and with minimal clumps (which is unfortunately more user-error than the product&#x27;s fault, I&#x27;m sure). It covers well, is nice and thick, and the brush is simple and uncomplicated. It seems to last through the day, and I&#x27;ve been happy with it!</li>
            <li> My favorite store bought mascara</li>
            <li> I buy this regularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal mascara for many years and it is an excellent product and does not irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara since I was in high school, which was 10 years ago.  I personally LOVE it, and will never in my life, ever use another mascara!  After a few days it does get clumpy, but you can just wipe the excess back in the tube.  It is a heavier mascara and does add volume and thinkness, but not length.  I goes excellent with a smokey eye look!</li>
            <li> People think my lashes are much longer because of this mascara!  I love it!  Definitely worth any price. Use one layer, allow to dry (will dry when applying on the other eye) then apply a second layer. You will see your lashes multiply and grow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for about two years now and I just love it. I&#x27;ve always been using high-end products and would end up either unhappy with the formula, or get allergies, or it just wouldn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve then started testing drug-store brands and after trying many of them (even other l&#x27;oreal mascaras) I&#x27;ve come to love this one. It sometimes get tricky after you&#x27;ve used it for a while as the formula thickens (naturally), you&#x27;d end up having to scrape the excess on the tip and so on, but it doesn&#x27;t make it a bad product (as this also happens with time with other brands and other formula). I&#x27;d give every tube a max of 2-2.5 months if you are not a daily user (I use it daily, sometimes reapply twice and it lasts me about 1.5-2 months). You&#x27;ll have to test it yourself as not every products works for everyone the same.</li>
            <li> Great drugstore mascara!  Takes a little longer to dry than I&#x27;m used to, but I have no issues with it.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and lasts all day!  I feel like it helps define my lashes and make them look longer, too.  I keep coming back to this one, and the price is right!</li>
            <li> It is a good product but tends to clump.  Best when first opening, but becomes clumpier as it ages.</li>
            <li> This mascara is a really dark deep black, which I really like.  It adds significant volume.  However, the brush comes out with a ton of product on it and I have to wipe it off to use it.  I usually wear waterproof mascara, simply because my eyes tear up occasionally and the last thing I want are raccoon eyes!  But the thing about a waterproof formula is it&#x27;s hard to add several coats.  It dries so fast that when you try to apply more, it simply clumps up.  So I decided to try Loreal&#x27;s Voluminous formula, which reviews have said doesn&#x27;t smudge.  The mascara is somewhat wet so it takes a few minutes to dry, which means that additional coats can be done.  I do two coats and then use the waterproof formula for a third coat which seals everything.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy this mascara again.  It&#x27;s hard to say.  I don&#x27;t wear mascara every day so I&#x27;m expecting it to dry out somewhat.  The brush (once it&#x27;s wiped off that is) does build volume and does a fair job of separating lashes.  I do like the deep black color, it&#x27;s the most black of any mascara I&#x27;ve used.  I do recommend it for those who want volume and don&#x27;t mind a nonwaterproof formula.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara a lot and I&#x27;ve been using it for at least five years. It makes your eyelashes look pretty long and thick &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, great black color. Not too thick and don&#x27;t get clumps.</li>
            <li> Love it!. Strong black color. Makes my lashes appear longer which I like.</li>
            <li> Wears just like expensive mascara</li>
            <li> Totally clumpy and felt old. Like it was sitting on the warehouse shelf WAY TOO LONG. I really want my money back but think it&#x27;s probably too late. I will never buy it on Amazon again. I was trying to save a buck or two but paying more at Target would be better. At least it&#x27;s fresh because they rotate stock quicker.</li>
            <li> it flakes off and leaves black dots all over my undereyes and nose.</li>
            <li> Great Mascara. Decently waterproof, but then again I have yet to try a truly waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> very easy to apply+ pretty color+long lasting</li>
            <li> Excellent product ...</li>
            <li> read 1 star review! mascara was old and dry i am sure it was after expiration date! dont buy from this comp! i know for sure it was old!!&lt;br /&gt;but totaly old like my used one from 1 year ago!!</li>
            <li> Dark and lovely. Definitely a volume-boosting mascara vs. a lengthening, but it does it&#x27;s job. Works best when layered with a lengthening formula.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like it.it‘s hard to  remover，soooooo hard!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used. I have used others, but this is the best since 2000 calorie by max factor. Long lashes, but very little clumping. This was a good price also, and with free prime shipping it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to like this mascara but I&#x27;ve had one to many troubles with it. It is very watery and takes forever to dry so if you blink or mess up you end up with the mascara all over. Even if I don&#x27;t accidentally blink I still end up with the mascara on my eyelids. Having to wipe off the mascara from my face then try to re-apply it makes my makeup routine longer than it should. It does a good job of not clumping and keeping my eyelashes soft but the time it takes to dry is too much for me.</li>
            <li> This is a good mascara and one I seem to fall back to after I try other brands.</li>
            <li> Worked great until my eyelashes started falling off.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE mascara, probably of all time.  I have used tons and tons of different brands of mascara, and this one is still the best and my favorite.  It makes my lashes super long and thick. The brush is great and applies the product perfectly. Highly recommend. This one never fails me.</li>
            <li> Great service AAAAAAA+++++</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Nice brand.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy if you have really oily skin--all the mascara will be off your lashes and you&#x27;ll have racoon eyes.</li>
            <li> Smooth finish. No clumps. No &amp;#34;leakage.&amp;#34; Can add additional coats to boost drama in the evening. Easy to remove at the end of the day. My perfect mascara. Caution...DO NOT accidentally buy the waterproof version - it&#x27;s crap.</li>
            <li> Leaves chunks of mascara on the eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Jenn Falik wrote that she loved this mascara - going so far as to say it was a beauty staple in her makeup bag. I waited until my Covergirl lash blast dried out before buying - was very eager! Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good - it makes my top lashes look like very long and voluminous. I can get through the day without it wearing off even though it&#x27;s not waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad - chunky, goopy, yuck. Every morning, I pull out a new chunk of black mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ugly - even though I don&#x27;t wear mascara on the bottom lashes, I get raccoon eyes underneath my bottom lashes halfway through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend either buying a waterproof formula or buying a different mascara. \\&quot;The good\\&quot; isn&#x27;t so great that it outweighs the negatives.</li>
            <li> Love it. I use another mascara (&amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; by Benefit) first that has very strong bristles to separate my lashes and then this covers them beautifully.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of the rave reviews from youtube gurus, but I hate this mascara!&lt;br /&gt;It made my lashes clumpy and did NOTHING to add volume or length.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is typical, nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Avon SuperShock mascara over any I have ever tried! Honestly, it is my FAVORITE mascara, yet I never hear anything about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip this mascara if you have one that you&#x27;re happy with already.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. The only mascara that I have liked. It lasts, it goes on well and it stays put. Doesn&#x27;t clump in the container. Best &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; mascara I have found.</li>
            <li> Great mascara. Only a couple of swipes and all set to go.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used a lot of high end mascaras. This mascara never irritates my eyes like other. It stays on my lashes and doesn&#x27;t smudge. It also doesn&#x27;t clump my eyelashes together. My eyes look so thick and full after only one coat. I usually do two coats and my lashes look stunning! I will never use any other mascara!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mascara for a long time, and when it runs out, I&#x27;d probably buy it again. It instantly makes my lashes look longer and I&#x27;ve never had a single problem with clumping. It lasts all day as well. My only problems are that it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look any fuller, which is what you&#x27;d expect from a mascara named &amp;#34;Voluminous&amp;#34;, and at the end of the day I sometimes see black smudges under my eyes. But that&#x27;s after 12+ hours of wear, so not that big of a deal. Overall I think this is an excellent mascara.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I keep coming back to this dang mascara and I forget how quickly it dries up! That&#x27;s my only beef, really. I like the color and how it thickens my lashes, I just hate having to replace the tube faster than I do with other mascaras.</li>
            <li> Get this mascara, you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve been using it for years and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> This mascara is my holy grail mascara. It lengthens, volumizes, and separates the lashes.</li>
            <li> Okay. I rather have the more expensive brands like IT AND LANCOME!</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with it. :)</li>
            <li> This mascara went on easily, didn&#x27;t gob or flake.  When I accidently got it on my skin it required soap and water to remove, unlike some other brands I&#x27;ve tried that just needed a little spit on a fingertip.</li>
            <li> Favorite mascara! Have used it for years! It&#x27;s the best quality for the price!!</li>
            <li> Finally, I have found a mascara that I can keep coming back to! When you first use this, the formula is a bit on the wet, runny side...that part isn&#x27;t my favorite. But after a while, it becomes drier and easier to work with. The color is an intense shade of black, and I can easily get away with doing just one coat of mascara. It is very volumizing, and I don&#x27;t get any black smudges under my eyes, which is the best part. For the longest time I had avoided using any mascara on my lower lashes because it usually turned me into a racoon at the end of the day. This is the first mascara that I&#x27;ve used that I don&#x27;t have to worry about checking on. It will hardly budge in the rain, but it comes off easily with makeup remover. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I adore this mascara! I have been using it for years. It works great.</li>
            <li> 10/10 WOULD RECCOMEND</li>
            <li> Great staple item.  If I only put on one makeup item, this is it.</li>
            <li> I am currently using this mascara vs my usual Clinique.  For a much cheaper price, the mascara is better.  It coats my eyelashes better and no irritation.  Maybelline use to cause me irritation.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every brand of mascara out there.  I like to try the newest and greatest, but I keep going back to this.  I have even tried the newer Volulminous options and none work as well as this does.  It makes my eyes absolutley pop!</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for years.  It is great for everyday way, consistent and not clumpy!  It stays fresh for about three months.  For nighttime I use something a little more jazzy but this is a great deal!</li>
            <li> This mascara may work well for those with thick lashed. I have thin lashes and there is so much mascara on the brush that it clumped when I put it on. After many uses and there is not as much mascara on the brush it works well. Still not my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice product and makes my lashes look fuller and longer which normally doesn&#x27;t happen with just one brand of mascara. The only problem I have is that if you try to double coat more than .235 seconds after you applied the first coat then your gonna get funny clumpy looking lashes. You gotta move fast like a ninja if you want those bad boys to look good! Other than that though it&#x27;s a great mascara, will purchase again when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> One of the only mascaras I buy consistently.  Has great volume and wear.  Is super black and matte.  Removes easily.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to mascara, I always have it in my makeup kit.  I usually use 2 mascaras to get the effect that I want (I like using a L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous first, either this one or regular black, then finishing with a coat of Benefit They&#x27;re Real mascara.  But if I am in a hurry or not going full-face on the make-up, I just use this one). It is always reliable in how it applies, without clumping, sticking or smearing, and it lasts all day.  It amplifies the length of my lashes, which are already somewhat long, but, best of all, it adds volume to my thinning lashes (getting older kinda sucks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried SO many mascaras over the years and always come back to this one!</li>
            <li> This mascara came on time and it became my new favorite. It wasn&#x27;t ruined during shipping and I still use it every day. I definitely suggest ordering this mascara, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> goes on well .. lasts about an hour then continually flakes off.  You must check yourself out in a mirror when using this product every thirty minutes and carry Qtips at all times.</li>
            <li> Looked great when I put it on. By the time I got to work. I had black smudges on my lower eyelid</li>
            <li> this mascara is really great, doesnt clump, makes your lashes look so dark and thick. i love this mascara, its my go to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always worn Maybelline and tried the more expensive brands but none of these mascara&#x27;s compare. L&#x27;Oreals Paris allows my lashes to reach amazing heights and its nice and dark. My eyes are absolutely beautiful. This will be my only mascara from now on,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years and never had the problems mentioned in so many reviews of difficulties removing it, smudging, etc.. in fact I haven&#x27;t had to use anything special to get it off. In the shower, I just use water and wipe it off with a bath cloth, since it&#x27;s not waterproof- once it&#x27;s wet it just slides off onto a cloth.  If there are any streaks on my face (from the shower), I just wash my cheeks with soap/water and off it comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is true that the formula starts out very thin when you first open it and thickens over time, so you have to wait and recoat the first few times you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s been the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used for rich color saturation and a thick look. I&#x27;ve been asked several times if my lashes were false.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for years and LOVE it! I decided to take advantage of the \\&quot;Subscribe and Save\\&quot; price and purchase on Amazon, rather than my usual Target. Same great mascara, but it came with the curved wand, rather than the straight wand that is pictured. May not seem like a big deal, but I prefer the straight wand. So much so that I thew away this mascara before it was finished because I hated the curved wand. I am giving this mascara 3 stars because I love it, just hate that Amazon sent something not pictured!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  From time to time, I will stray and buy an expensive brand like Dior or Benefit, however I am always disappointed and mad at myself for spending so much.  I go back to the tried and true L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Original Mascara. Try this mascara if you want thick, lush lashes.</li>
            <li> Goes on well and looks great, but flakes all over the place and I never touch my eyes.</li>
            <li> This mascara is crap. I bought it because a YouTuber seemed to enjoy it. This stuff clumps up and gets all underneath your eyes throughout the day. Worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used tbh and I&#x27;m not picky about mascara either I always do drug store eye makeup. Save your money ladies.</li>
            <li> This is awful mascara. I already threw it away. I would put it on in the morning and by noon I would look like a racking at work. Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> This smudges and runs and is impossible to wipe off without using serious amounts of cleanser. NOT a fan.</li>
            <li> I was expecting lots of volume but this will do, not amazing but I am used to another brand but I like this. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite mascaras of all time.</li>
            <li> I have read the reviews about wiping the excess mascara off before use, but that is more difficult than it sounds. There are clumps within the brush so you end up really wiping it around. Also at night I use make up remover, but the next morning I still wake up with raccoon eyes. I think there has to be better mascara in the universe than this stuff.</li>
            <li> quality was bad.Bought it in amazon for its low price but quality was not good.I will not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> For all mascara, I like this brand the most because of the wand.  It separates my thin eyelashes and make them look fuller after I apply it twice or sometimes 3 times!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal is a good product and am always pleased.</li>
            <li> I chose this as a cheap add on thinking it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try but not expecting to commit. I&#x27;ve tried a bazillion drugstore brands as well as spendier brands without ever finding &amp;#34;the one.&amp;#34; I suspect I will jump around again at some point, but I plan to stick with this for awhile. The carbon black is great dark black. Lashes look fuller and longer. I&#x27;ve had no gloppy blobs, no running (not waterproof formula). It does require some focused attention to completely remove (just cleanser on hands isn&#x27;t enough).</li>
            <li> Leaves clumps. Doesn&#x27;t separate well.</li>
            <li> I never buy beauty products without reading some reviews first. The reviews on this mascara seemed to be overall pretty good. I found that for the first week or so of using this mascara, my eyelashes looked great. However, it became thick and gross after using it for that first week. I had to throw it out. Disappointed and a waste of money. Will go back to using Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real! Mascara.</li>
            <li> This is a classic mascara--more expensive ones from the  L&#x27;Oreal line flake more than this one. It&#x27;s a nice true black.</li>
            <li> I use this whenever I&#x27;m going to a party and I am able to achieve Lily Collin&#x27;s eye makeup! No joke here! I just love her eyes and imitated it through this mascara and other stuff. Does the trick.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara for my wife and she says this is the best mascara she has ever used. It goes on easy and does not flake.  She will be ordering more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Mascara ever since I was in High School! I am now almost 50 years old and I still get compliments on my eyelashes! I&#x27;ve tried others and ALWAYS come back to L&#x27;Oreal...because, you guessed it, I&#x27;m Worth It! lol</li>
            <li> The formula of this mascara is awesome. However, the brush leaves much to be desired. The bristles are way too spread out and this causes clumps. In order to use this up I have used it in conjunction with other wands that offer more separation such as The Rocket.</li>
            <li> I ordered ORIGINAL and this is not ORIGINAL it is 2X.  I am not able to leave seller feedback because I would say this is a bait and switch.  Not happy</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS MASCARA!  This stuff is the best.</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to mascara for the past 3 years. Every time I try a different mascara, I always end up coming back to this. It makes my lashes super dark, thick, and long without looking spidery or clumpy.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Mascara - it really causes my lashes to seem thicker and longer, which is no mean feat for my sixty year old eyelashes. Our eyelashes diminish in thickness and length as we get older, and this mascara does the best job of any I have tried. If I could change one thing, it would be to make it less flaky - by the end of the day, I need to swab my undereyes with Cetaphil moisturizer (that seems to remove and clean this mascara off more gently than anything else) to fix my raccoon eyes. This isn&#x27;t unique to L&#x27;Oreal mascara - I haven&#x27;t found a mascara which doesn&#x27;t do this. The company who comes out with a flake-free mascara will have the women of the world beating a path to their doors! Except for the inevitable flaking, this is a wonderful product. I am pleased, and don&#x27;t think a $25 or $30 department store brand mascara could do the job any better. Thank you, L&#x27;Oreal!</li>
            <li> Wow! This really does give Voluminous lashes! Had my doubts, but it really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another type of mascara for at least 30 years and have never swayed from it. On a whim, while ordering some other beauty products from Amazon, I read the reviews for this (always how I make my purchasing decisions on Amazon!) and thought, based on so many good reviews, that I would try it. I literally couldn&#x27;t believe the first time I used it. It&#x27;s fabulous!! Goes on easily, great coverage--I no longer need a primer because it&#x27;s more than adequate by itself. I&#x27;m telling all my girlfriends about this beauty find!</li>
            <li> Just started using, but I can already tell that I will like this product.  Glides on and doesn&#x27;t clump like others.  I have very short lashes, so this is a great help.</li>
            <li> This mascara paired with L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous Power Collagen 24-hour is my favorite mascara combination. My lashes look thicker/fuller. I receive compliments and am asked how I get my lashes to look like they do.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite, go to mascara for years. I&#x27;ve tried several brands of department and retail mascaras, but I always come back to this one. No other mascara lengthens, adds volume and makes my lashes look as good!  I buy the carbon black and it doesn&#x27;t clump on my lashes at all.</li>
            <li> i have been using this mascara for years. it is wonderful for adding both length and volume. i have even been asked if i have false lashes on!</li>
            <li> omg!!, i was very sceptical buying this, but when i eventually did, my instinct was right. On my first application, my lashes were fuller nad longer. Adding more volume to my lashes. It gave me that beautiful celebrity look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on my lashes since I started using this mascara.  It is so easy to apply and lasts all day and night.  I put on make-up at around 7:30am every morning and remove it at approximately 10:00pm every evening.  My lashes are as fresh at 10pm as they were at 7:30am.  No lie...just fact.  It doesn&#x27;t chip or burn my eyes and it&#x27;s easily removed (I use fragrance free baby wipes).  This one is a keeper!!!</li>
            <li> Like this mascara, does a good job of providing volume without that heave, brittle, clumpyness.  Would buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> I have a subscription for this and I really love it. I highly recommend it. I think it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> I started using this mascara many years ago, but as new and cool looking mascaras come out (seems daily) of promises of just about every nature, no clumping, millions of lashes, super volumizing, etc, etc...I try them. And every single time the same thing happens-I think, &amp;#34;I should have just stayed with my tried and true L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous Mascara-damn it!&amp;#34; MONEY IN THE TRASH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara doesn&#x27;t clump hardly at all (tip: scrape off excess mascara and go lightly over each eye lid a couple of times), it lasts forever, coats every lash, comes off easily...If you fall asleep w/o taking it off you are not raccoon eyed. If you plan on getting in the water the water-proof formula is FANTASTIC-what do ya know? It&#x27;s ACTUALLY WATER PROOF even if I touch my eyes! Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend ANY OTHER MASCARA and won&#x27;t &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; a different ones any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW I have very long lashes but they are thin and very light colored, so the &amp;#34;Voluminous&amp;#34; part in the name is exactly what you get. &amp;#34;Hmmmm, where are my eye lashes??? OH! There they are!&amp;#34; I get asked if I wear false lashes...Hee, hee, hee. Nope, it&#x27;s $8 drug store/$5 Amazon mascara. BAM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminious Mascara in carbon black is my favorite mascara on the formula right now. I love the brush and the formula combination, my lashes look so thick and full and long after using this product. Does not clump which is a plus. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara on the market. Been using this brand forover a decade and have always gotten compliments.. It helps me pull off that Natural look</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal products especially the mascara. I bought this and was a little nervous. Its great for work. Don&#x27;t clump. I think its waterproof good. I workout after working all day and its still good after no reapplying.</li>
            <li> I always use Voluminous for my lashes. I tried other products but wind up coming back to this one because it applies easily, evenly and makes my lashes look great.</li>
            <li> Too clumpy and spidered eye for my taste.</li>
            <li> Probably the best mascara on the market for volume.  Stunning.  I wish it was easier to remove, and it will smudge after a long work day.  Still, this is the one to wear if you want serious drama and gorgeous eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Great product. Clumps a little but not bad.</li>
            <li> Love it. Long lasting beautiful black mascara.</li>
            <li> Its very easy to apply and the color doesn&#x27;t really spread out in a very wild way</li>
            <li> Nothing could be better than L&#x27;Oreal when it comes to mascara. Quality of the mascara is so good, lasts in the eyes for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mascara for years and years.  I try other brands once in a while but I always go back to the Voluminous.  I think it beats the department store brands hands down and with the price of L&#x27;Oreal being so affordable, there&#x27;s no excuse for not changing out your mascara every month as is recommended.  I use the auto ship on Amazon so when the package comes, I know it&#x27;s time to throw out the old one.</li>
            <li> So clumpy.  Throwing this one away after one month&#x27;s use.  Washed the applicator twice and wiped out the throat of the tube with a cotton swab more than once, but the applicator consistently comes out of the tube with too much product.  Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> Horrible! Wife says that it is clumpy and runs easily</li>
            <li> Thanks to family life I had to cut corners. I tried all different, drug store, top rated brands (Maybelline/NYX/etc) and have not found anything that could compare to Lancôme Definicils or Bare Minerals. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Va Va Boom lashes is what I get with this mascara... Soooo good, not going back to Clinique....</li>
            <li> I really like how this mascara makes my lashes look but by noon it has been leaving dark smudges under my eyes leaving me with raccoon eyes for the rest of my day. I have tried using as little as possible and only applying to my upper lashes but I always end up with the same result. It is also extremely hard to completely remove even after repeated scrubbing and it&#x27;s not even water proof. I will be trying out other mascara products before I consider buying this one again.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara but I am a big animal lover and learned after I bought it that loreal does test on animals. :( this is very comparable to the two face mascaras. It was a little clumpy at first but it evens out. For some crazy reason, it works better now 5 months later than it did the first week. Makes them very dramatic and long. I agree with the other reviewer, the first week I did have spider lashes. But that went away! I recommend this, just not the test on animals. :(</li>
            <li> I really have nothing negative to say. It doesn&#x27;t clump, and for a mascara addict, I think it works perfectly :)</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  The reviews for this product were so good that I ordered it.  My tube became very goopy within a couple of weeks.  Maybe it was old?  Spider lashes and clumps, not a fan.</li>
            <li> This is a very clumpy mascara. If that&#x27;s the look you like, then this is the mascara for you. Otherwise, stay clear.</li>
            <li> I really disn&#x27;t get much with this. I have used better.</li>
            <li> easy to wash out! made from real organic materials that will surely prevent adverse reactions from your body. amazing product!</li>
            <li> Great for a few weeks, but clumps quickly and badly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for as long as I can remember and nothing comes close to it. I still have my expensive mascaras, but nothing beats this price and the results you get. I usually keep a few on hand, since I go through them so quickly. Great for volume, length and that natural glam-lash look without having to use fake lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve known this mascara forever and it never disappointed me. The lasting is really great, the lashes gain an excellent shape e dark color. My friends even think i&#x27;m wearing fake lashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara is very affordable compare to a lot of mascara and it works!  This is my favorite Mascara from L&#x27;Oreal, even though its cheaper than their other mascaras.  The wand is thick and plentiful bristle to stroke my lashes and volumize it.  This mascara does make my lashes thicker.</li>
            <li> I was looking for new mascara and the girl that works for me has eyelashes that hit her eyebrows and she used this mascara.  I tried this and I haven&#x27;t used anything since. It really helps with volume as well.  It made my eyelashes thicker looking and I needed that.</li>
            <li> Bought this but don&#x27;t support the brand anymore due to its political affiliations.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping..excellent product!</li>
            <li> I used to like this mascara a lot. It&#x27;s easy to apply and looks gorgeous. But did they change the formula? It used to be so easy to wash off in the shower with minimal soap or makeup remover. Water alone removed a lot of it. Now I have to use remover twice, and even that sometimes leaves some of the racoon effect and I have to finish up with baby oil, which I don&#x27;t like using on my eyes. I am not using the waterproof formula, but the regular &amp;#34;washable.&amp;#34; What gives?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Voluminous mascara for the past 20 years.  It is my favorite brand by far - even over the more expensive options out there.  The Carbon Black formula is excellent if you&#x27;re seeking a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li> makes lashes look really long, thick and natural  doesn&#x27;t clump, goes on easy, comes off easy too and i like it</li>
            <li> This goes on very nicely, fine, light application, not gooey or thick.. very nice. I have it on subscribe and save so I can get a new one every 6 months, since I always forget to date the bottle, and forget when I bought them, and forget to toss them in 6 months.</li>
            <li> The absolute best mascara!! Let&#x27;s you build to create nice thick long lashes</li>
            <li> If you want clumpy eyelashes that smear and run and flake, this product is for you.  There is no way to put it on without clumping.  Don&#x27;t cry - it runs.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wear it for eight hours - it flakes on your cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;Want a natural look?  This product is not natural....  Keep looking.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Makes my lashes seem longer. Does not clump. Easy to remove.</li>
            <li> This is just as good as any premium brand from Sephora or Ulta. I have this auto shipped so I can always swap out when they are getting old.</li>
            <li> Does clump a good bit at first...be sure to have tissues/q-tips on hand!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase, thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different mascaras and this one definitely is my favorite. It goes on smoothly, lasts all day, is a great color and comes off easily.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Even make up artists swear by this! Good everyday mascara that is easily layerable for a more dramatic look at night. I thinks it&#x27;s a great product for how much you spend. Best in class for sure.</li>
            <li> Why did they change the formulation and wand? It used to be my favorite among the low cost mascaras. This flakes and leaves dark smudges around my eye as I apply it. It also goops on the wand.  I also find smudges when I get home from work. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Wow if you YouTube this product its supposed to be off the hook! I got three different mascaras and honestly this is really good. Smooth and easy to apply I can&#x27;t complain! :) Not clumpy.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are already said to be long, but this emphasizes them beautifully! Wonderful product, I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara, not too thin, not too thick. the brush separates the lashes well and goes on clean, not lumpy. I think the brush is great, perfect shape for lengthening lashes and separating them just right. I have no complaints</li>
            <li> BEST MASCARA EVER. I love this mascara and hope they never discontinue it! I don&#x27;t know how but I get fuller and longer lashes.</li>
            <li> so awesome beyond words really:) for now on im using this one!! :) its like creamy and really black:) loved it</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!  Doesn&#x27;t smear and stays on all day and night.  Really makes lashes look longer and darker, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time because it does not get all thick and clumpy on my lashes.  This is also a more favorable price on Amazon and it was delivered at once.</li>
            <li> When first applying this product I was very pleased with the volume and definition it added to my lashes: exactly what I was looking for. But I&#x27;m very disappointed to find that after only a few hours it will flake and leave dark circles under my eyes. Perhaps the waterproof formula would solve this problem? I will be experimenting with other drug store brands.</li>
            <li> Its really easy to apply and I have no problem with it, its just so perfect!</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing.  Goes on without clonking and stays on the whole day without needing to reapply.  After applying it, my lashes look so much longer, I love it.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Voluminous Mascara not only lengthens your lashes, it also gives it a nice bold coat of color.  The best part is that it does not uncurl your lashes!</li>
            <li> Without doubt my favorite mascara.  It offers excellent volume at a great price (I used to purchase much more expensive brands like Christian Dior and didn&#x27;t get any benefit from them) and it isn&#x27;t super cakey nor does it contribute to spider lashes.  I&#x27;m happy Amazon offers it on a subscription basis making it convenient to re-stock.  It also acts as a reminder to throw it out after three months when it&#x27;s recommended one does so for health reasons.</li>
            <li> My very favorite mascara!  I love the dark black color that I get, even application and good coverage without clumps!  Wish all mascara was like this :)</li>
            <li> This is the best black mascara.  Super pigmented black color.  The wand is nice and thick to plump up your lashes.  My go-to mascara.</li>
            <li> It was quite quick that this mascara got clumpy! Not sure why! In all honesty, this has been my mascara of choice. The other tubes did not go bad as quick. Certainly, I did get sufficient use out of the previous ones. So, I will try another brand for now. But in all fairness, it is not to say that I will not return back to L’OREAL, giving it another try. The price is fair, no complaints there. It does not flake but smudges are another matter. After several hours, you will possibly get a few. Not as much as other mascara I have tried. With that being said, this does not deserve a strong negative mark against it, but a note of caution before purchasing it.</li>
            <li> This is great, been using it for a while now. The mascara doesn&#x27;t smear and it makes my eyelashes actually look bigger</li>
            <li> My wife loves this mascara and swears by it.</li>
            <li> classic mascara. i love it!  so bored of new mascaras with weird brushes. its just great really black mascara. thx to seller</li>
            <li> This product is great if you want Beautiful,  Dark,  thick Lashes..  Love it</li>
            <li> Been using this mascara for years. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Great mascara! Lasted thru the evening &amp; really enhanced my lashes! I would definitely buy this product again. Very impressed!</li>
            <li> Eh  this mascara is ok I know many people love it  but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. It gets clumpy I like the loreal million lashes much better!</li>
            <li> I purchased my tube locally at an Ulta store. I really like the formula, it goes on my lashes like butter. It gives pretty good volume and length and can be built on. It&#x27;s a really nice dark formula and doesn&#x27;t cause my lashes to clump. It doesn&#x27;t flake and it doesn&#x27;t leave my lashes stiff and so far, no raccoon eyes at the end of the day. Overall I really like it and will repurchase.</li>
            <li> i dont know why all bloggers and youtubers are just crazy about this mascara, nothing exceptional, i&#x27;d rather buy a maybelline one for the price</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be amazing, but I find it flakes off my eyelashes more than I&#x27;d like. Switched to Maybelline The Falsies and I&#x27;m much happier.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Creamy&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t dry too crunchy&lt;br /&gt;Good dark rich black&lt;br /&gt;Good curved brush shape that fits eye well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very clumpy.  A ridiculous amount of product built up on the brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I won&#x27;t buy again because it&#x27;s just too clumpy coming out of the tube.  I&#x27;d prefer less on the brush, having more control, and starting out light but being able to apply multiple coats, if desired.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this again as by the end of the day I had black smudges under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dedicated L&#x27;Oreal mascara user....this one is very black....I think also conditioning...so it works well especially on someone with good lashes...I use different ones bit I think the Voluminous Million Lashes in the gold tube works best on my lashes which are short and not very thick.</li>
            <li> too clumpy for my liking</li>
            <li> I was hopeful that this lower cost mascara wouldn&#x27;t cause me the same problem that so many do, but it did:  black smudges below my eyes well before the end of the day.  I will go back to the more expensive but non-smudging NYX Doll Eye Mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it&#x27;s one of my favorites and I&#x27;ve been using it for years with no problems. I layer mine with other types in order to create thick, long lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I use [[ASIN:B002B4I8SO e.l.f. Lengthening and Volumizing Mascara, Black, 0.24 Ounce]] to define the lashes. This has a teensy brush and gets each and every lash on bottom and top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I use a thick formula to plump lashes, scraping the sides of the brush to make sure excess product does not cause clumping and spider-y lashes. I like to use [[ASIN:B001GNBW0W Max Factor 2000 Calorie Dramatic Volume Mascara Black]] most for this step. I sometimes do two coats for really thick and full lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I use this mascara on top. It&#x27;s not a thin or thick formula and it adds thickness and length. If I&#x27;m looking to do a more natural look, I&#x27;ll use this mascara by itself. I don&#x27;t ever experience flaking or running.</li>
            <li> This is terrible. Within an hour its running down my face and making me look like I had a rough night on the town.</li>
            <li> This mascara was just okay in my opinion. It clumped a little too easily, and was kind of hard to take off, even in the shower. It wasn&#x27;t so horrible that I felt the need to throw it away and get a new tube (it does add volume to your lashes like the tube says), but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this mascara again. It was nice that it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> The combination of results and price has had me coming back to this L’Oreal mascara for years now.  It’s not perfect – I’ve had better results with more expensive mascara.  But when you have to pick and choose where your money is going, the extra price isn’t worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s got a curved brush that is thicker than many I’ve tried.  The mascara goes on fairly smooth, although it does thicken up in the tube over time.  You’ll probably find a small mass of it at the tip of the brush after you’ve been using it for awhile.  You can play with it to get it back in the tube or on your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use it on my upper lashes as I don’t look good with the heavily lined and lashed look.  I generally have to wipe up some smudge that makes it to my lower lid as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> This stuff really is carbon black. It lives up to its name. You can put multiple layers on and it doesn&#x27;t really get clumpy. But also looks as dramatic as fake lashes. Love this, keep coming back to it after trying other mascaras and being disappointed. Will probably never buy a different kind again. Works better than Lancôme .</li>
            <li> I think it works a little better than other mascaras, but it&#x27;s average for me..</li>
            <li> Very good, I like it.</li>
            <li> I have always adored L&#x27;Oreals cosmetics but this mascara takes the cake for me. This mascara leaves me lashes very voluminous and glamorous. Compared to the high brand mascaras I&#x27;ve used in the past...for the price and quality you can not beat it.</li>
            <li> My regular brand and color for a long time now.</li>
            <li> I am a senior.  First, I use a lash serum.  I follow with this L&#x27;Oreal Mascara, which goes on smooth and gives the illusion that I have some lashes.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> i really was disappointed. it hurt my eyes and made my vision blurry. For the price and history of L&#x27;Oreal I did expect better from them.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it did smear some. I&#x27;m really tired of companies charging so much for mascara and they just don&#x27;t meet the standards expected by a woman.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite lashes for volume and darkness. Not the best when it comes to length, but it makes your lashes look thick, plush and dark.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  Great service.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara that I ever used in my life! It smudges, it&#x27;s clunky, I have to brush my eye lashes because they will be stuck and my natural eye lashes are very long.</li>
            <li> This is the best drugstore mascara I have ever bought! Great volume and length, looks really natural. I highly suggest this for a drugstore mascara.</li>
            <li> Its clumps SO MUCH do NOT get this you will need to spend a lot of time on your makeup if you do.</li>
            <li> The mascara is very pretty but it smudges very easily. I feel like I was constantly wiping eyes. But it does look beautiful on the lashes!</li>
            <li> this has been my go-to mascara for years. ever since &amp;#34;illegal lengths&amp;#34; was discontinued (my former go-to). it lengthens, thickens and darkens all without clumping. I&#x27;ve tried the high end brands (bobbi brown, dior, nars) but always come back to this. it&#x27;s my mainstay.</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for years as my every day mascara. It doesn&#x27;t clump, and it leave my eyelashes looking full and long. Better than most mascaras I have used in the past. Will continue buying this!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really flake - I like it !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever love a mascara more than I love this guy. It gives you the blackest, most voluminous lashes ever! Just be careful applying it on your lower lashes, as the wand can be a little bulky and it is a pain to remove if it gets on your skin.</li>
            <li> love this mascara! it&#x27;s my go to and has never failed. Keeps lashes in place all day.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this mascara! It makes my lashes look longer and thicker without clumping them.</li>
            <li> From luxury to drugstore, this is the best mascara I have ever used. It comes in multiple shads, and goes on heavily without being clumpy. Even better than the mascara? The fact that I can get in on Amazon for about 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li> One of the best I used.</li>
            <li> This is a decent mascara for the price, but I should have known it would cause irritation with my sensitive skin.  As long as you don&#x27;t have sensitivity issues, this mascara would be a great bargain.</li>
            <li> Loved how it made eyelashes look thicker and fuller.</li>
            <li> If it were possible I would have given it no stars.  It rubs off everywhere.  I have never had a mascara do that.  I come home with black under my eyes every time I wear it.  I&#x27;m so busy I forget to pick up a new tube of different mascara, but I think I&#x27;m just going to throw this out and force myself to stop &amp; get some.  L&#x27;oreal can do much better than this.  This is a product disaster.</li>
            <li> I have been addicted to Tarte&#x27;s Lights, Camera, Lashes mascara forever. But due to some new year budgeting my $20 mascara was one of the first things to go. This mascara is okay... I only have to take the brush out once to coat both of my eyes. But its very clumpy.</li>
            <li> Hated it. I use eye lash primer and face primer from oiling. It still gave me the panda look. What a shame...</li>
            <li> I use this mascara all the time and I love it. Sometimes  it is hard to find the Carbon Black in stores so this was very convenient for me.</li>
            <li> Gives my lashes mega volume and length. I bought it back near Christmas, its august and it hasn&#x27;t dried out AT ALL. (I&#x27;ve dropped some eye drops in the tube to refresh it every couple months) but 8 months later its still my go-to mascara and still going strong!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, but this bottle dried up in about a month.  I&#x27;ll only buy from the drug store now.</li>
            <li> Clumpy, will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday along with my L&#x27;Oreal double extended mascara.  Love this product.  Very happy</li>
            <li> I think this is the best mascara, and not just for the price.  I&#x27;ve bought high end mascaras and tried many samples of high end brands and find that they don&#x27;t go on nearly as nicely.  I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my long lashes from women and the truth is my lashes are not that long, it&#x27;s the mascara.  This also crimps very nicely if you give it a few minutes to dry, or crimp first and then apply.  Washing off is a breeze.  I use a soap-free body wash in the shower and have no trouble getting if off.  I once read an article in a women&#x27;s magazine listing the top 5 mascaras with no price limit.  This was one of the 5 listed and it didn&#x27;t surprise me one bit.</li>
            <li> im really loving this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;it is very black, gives nice volume and length without being too much on the first coat or two, but definitely buildable if you desire more.&lt;br /&gt;it holds a curl really well even as good as waterproof formulas tend to do.&lt;br /&gt;cleans of easy, but only when wanted so it doesnt just come off during the time you want to wear it.&lt;br /&gt;seems like a very wet formula, so im guessing itll be better the more it dries out a bit.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  It is my absolute favorite.  It does not clump and it does add a lot of volume to your lashes.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite mascara and I have used all the high end brands and everything in between. I often get asked what mascara I use however it doesn&#x27;t look the same on everyone because all lashes are not the same. I have very thick hair and coarser lashes.</li>
            <li> I would give this zero stars if possible!  I write a lot of amazon reviews, and i think this is my first negative review, but OH MY this product DID NOT work for me!  I buy a lot of items on amazon and base my buying decisions on reviews.  This has great reviews, and I needed some mascara, so I went for it.  I have very long natural lashes, but they are light-colored.  So I need a mascara that is volumizing to some degree and basically will just make my lashes show up.  This mascara had the consistency of road oil.  It is so gloppy, all of my lashes immediately stuck together and for the life of me, I could NOT get them un-clumped  (I tried everything...I&#x27;m sure it looked like I was giving myself lasik eye surgery...).  Let&#x27;s use eye makeup remover and try this again. It has to be the wand.  I tried to use this mascara with a wand that I REALLY like (CoverGirl Lash Blast) -- still, no.  Not even close.  I will admit, I am a mascara junkie, I have tried them ALL.  There are some that I like, some are so-so.  I have never (til this point) tried one that was so bad I had to just toss it.  Maybe it works if your eyelashes are not like mine...?</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and so do my lashes!  Great product!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to spend $40 a tube to get good mascara. I was a die hard fan of a well known brand for years. When I was on a trip and forgot my mascara, I bought this as an interim fix. It is now my go to mascara.</li>
            <li> First time using it.. and it is now my favorite mascara. I like the fullness it gives my lashes, without clumpy mess that some mascaras leave behind.</li>
            <li> clumpy...hard to apply</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever such a good price</li>
            <li> I buy it all the time</li>
            <li> Regular black works better.</li>
            <li> Good mascara for the price.</li>
            <li> I am a complete make up junkie and do not mind spending money on quality goods-- but this mascara beats some of the big names Ive tried (and Ive tried a lot!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes are very long, so I dont need any help there. This mascara helps my lashes look lush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically have to wipe quite a bit of the product off the brush prior to application because you get a ton!</li>
            <li> I purchased this mascara, but didn&#x27;t open it immediately, which was a mistake.  I had an open tube to finish first.  So when I got around to opening it, the mascara was dried out.  I don&#x27;t know what the shelf life for this type of product is, but I guess I&#x27;m out my $6, because it&#x27;s past the return window.  I won&#x27;t be ordering it online again.  If I had bought it locally, I would have taken it back to the store for a refund.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal Voluminous Mascara is the best mascara on the planet. Forget what the &amp;#34;make up artists&amp;#34; say as they apparently have never tried this product. I&#x27;ve been using it as long as I can remember (and that&#x27;s a long, long time) and there is nothing that compares to it. L&#x27;oreal makes a number of mascara products, but the Voluminous (5X the fullness) is it, bare none!</li>
            <li> this product is agreat and well worth the buy. it gives my eyelashes amazing volume. i never stick with products i always want something new, but with this product, i dont want anything new it is great.</li>
            <li> 5 stars because it is great for the price. It lengthens without being clumpy. One thing I love is that it stays on and doesn&#x27;t smudge, I have oily skin and nothing budges this mascara. Use an oil based makeup remover to take it off.</li>
            <li> This is awful mascara.  The wand is bad to make your eyelashes look long, it just clumps.  It also pulls your eyelashes out trying to get it off.  Doooon&#x27;t buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get the Maybelline Pump or Colossal volume express ones, those are incredible and get every lash, making mine look fake they are so long.</li>
            <li> Of all the mascara&#x27;s I have ever used this is my very favorite.</li>
            <li> I thought mabelines falsies mascara was the best, but this is even better! It gives you extremely long lashes and if you get regular (not waterproof) it comes off easily. This is one oft favorite mascaras, and I have literally tried them all!</li>
            <li> This mascara is wonderful! While I already have fairly long eyelashes, it really lengthens them &amp; makes them look so much fuller. And it is black as coal. Last all day &amp; washes off pretty easily!</li>
            <li> I use this product and am a loyal fan.  It is inexpensive yet affective and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Wish I could subscribe</li>
            <li> Best mascara you could dream of!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this mascara because I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things about it.  However, as stated in the title, I found it to be clumpy, stringy and goopy.  Maybe I got an old batch, but this mascara was just awful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with thi</li>
            <li> Great mascara, liquid, not plastic-y, stays on lashes and builds.</li>
            <li> Was announced as pack of 5. But in reality it was just single one. Great lying for great sales.</li>
            <li> It is great!  I used to spend $$ on Dior, but I save money and have better looking lashes with L&#x27;oreal.</li>
            <li> Works great so far. My lashes seem full and I don&#x27;t need to use tons.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite mascara of all time. I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for almost 20 years and I still love it. Has nice lash definition and great coverage. I do find that when you get a new tube, there in an excessive amount on the brush, but I always keep my tube that&#x27;s getting low and use the two together until the new tube is manageable. :)</li>
            <li> I think this is the only mascara I&#x27;ve ever repurchased over &amp; over again! This DOES smudge/transfer on me from time to time if I fall asleep/take a nap in it or am in the heat/sweating.. On \\&quot;normal\\&quot; days however, it&#x27;s perfect. It gives insane legnth plus volume on my lashes. I&#x27;ve tried ALMOST every single mascara at my local drugstores &amp; this is the ONLY one I&#x27;ve ever gone back to &amp; repurchased several times! Was also available here on Amazon for less than at my local stores + free shipping! A steal!</li>
            <li> This product was old. The top of the mascara was smashed and the top of the packaging looks like it had been open a little.</li>
            <li> No volume at all..a big fail.</li>
            <li> Works really good! Just as good if not then better than high end mascara. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> This mascara is the one I carry around in my handbag and also take on vacations. Really makes my lashes appear thicker and blacker.</li>
            <li> Love it! Doesn&#x27;t clump. It spreads my lashes and makes them longer!</li>
            <li> Great Product.......have used this for a long time!!</li>
            <li> Got an excellent price on an excellent product and it was sent ultra fast with AMZ Prime... will buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong mascara. I was so SAD :-( when I opened the package and saw it. Serves me right, since I am ordering items on my phone ( not able to see ) verses the large screen computer.&lt;br /&gt;I love L&#x27;OREAL PARIS -  TELESCOPIC- carbon black mascara, and I won&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite mascara! Works better than my $30 mascaras that I used to buy!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time I love this mascara and can&#x27;t beat the price. Will be buying more</li>
            <li> I wore this just once and believe me, that was enough to keep me away from it for the rest of my existence. Product smudged ALL OVER MY FACE. Get yourself a decent waterproof mascara instead.</li>
            <li> I like all of the L&#x27;oreal Voluminous mascaras I&#x27;ve tried. The carbon black makes your lashes really thick, which makes it a little trickier to use because the same thickening fibers have a tendency to clump. I&#x27;m giving this four stars because I ordered this and it is obviously an old tube. Not sure how long this sat in a warehouse, but I&#x27;ve gotten clearance mascaras at a grocery store that were fresher. You can always tell from the consistency when it is first opened. I&#x27;m giving it one more delivery, just in case this was a fluke, before canceling my subscribe and save. You really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my fiance who was having trouble finding this locally in the right color/shade. She&#x27;s used this for a few years now with no complaints. No complaints from here means no complaints from me.</li>
            <li> Price was good, looks good when I put it on. Nice thick lashes, but it is sticky to take off. I have to use several makeup wipes and still have smudges under my eyes in the morning. Half way thru the bottle, the brush comes out globed up with mascara. Smudges terribly when I cry. In everyday wear, smudges under the eye by evening. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, but still I am giving 4 stars only because it smudges at my bottom lash line. But I can handle that somehow. I am happy about this mascara. Amazon offers sale prices sometimes. So it&#x27;s a good purchase for me.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I got irritation with many other mascaras, but this one never irritated my eyes. Easy to remove using eye makeup removers. I use water first to dissolve it and then use remover to remove it completely.</li>
            <li> This is the worst eye shadow ever!  Wanna look like you got soccer punched in the face... then this is for you! :0)</li>
            <li> I like the larger applicator</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s user error or the design but I keep getting smudges when I apply this. It take a bit to dry so if I blink too soon I get a smudge. It comes out think on the wand so when I try to just lightly go over the inner or outer corners, I get a big clump. not my favorite but it is a think dark color so if I have a perfect application day then it looks good.  Unfortunately, when I apply one handed while holding a baby and trying to hold the tube away from the baby, I don&#x27;t have perfect application. I&#x27;ll likely go back to using my clinique.</li>
            <li> Given the raving reviews, I had high expectations for this mascara. It works well in making my lashes appear fuller and longer (no clumping too despite the watery and thick formula). HOWEVER, the biggest problem is smudging. After wearing it for a few hours, I can expect to see dark residue on the bottom of my eyes, and I usually need to forcefully wipe it off with my fingers. Also, the mascara doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as I&#x27;d hoped. After a few hours, I can see my lashes getting thinner and more sparse. The wand is also very big, so applying often results in smudges on my lids. While it creates nice volume, it doesn&#x27;t really help with length. Still, it works above average for a drugstore mascara. However, beware that you may need to reapply and/or check for under-eye smudging after several hours.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Amazon should take this out of best mascara for contact wearers&amp;#34; search! This mascara is great for length and thickness but should NEVER be listed for contact wearers. It fakes and gets in your eyes every time.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this mascara, 3rd time ordering it.</li>
            <li> Is an OK mascara I don&#x27;t love it or hate it .. is just all right .. gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Loreal mascara is absolutely great, it&#x27;s the best out there</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this mascara and felt like I had to put my two cents in. I have tried just about every L&#x27;Oreal mascara. this is by far the best. this alone has given me more compliments on my eyes and eyelashes than anything else. more than once I have been asked if my eyelashes were real or not. thank you L&#x27;Oreal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the color is very rich. when I apply it, it coats every strand with its dark, beautiful goop that makes my eyelashes look sexy, long, and full. maybe not a word someone uses to describe mascara, but it is very creamy, not dry like some mascaras are (even when first opened). when I take it out, the tip contains a tiny bit of mascara on it or in other words, the tip contains more of the &#x27;goop&#x27;. this works for me because I use that to apply it to the edges, making my eyelashes appear even fuller and resulting in a wing tip sort of look (for the eyelashes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in beginner hands, I can see how that would pose a problem. I have never had an issue with clumping or my eyelashes looking like they have fused into two pointy lashes. we all know that when applying mascara, you have to wiggle it all the way through to avoid clumps. with this mascara, 1-2 coats is enough because with the first coat, it gets the job done. want even fuller darker lashes? do a second coat BUT don&#x27;t forget to wiggle the brush and to not wait too long in between coats. applying a second coat on dried lashes is a BAD IDEA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as for makeup remover not removing the mascara. again, that was not a problem for me. I don&#x27;t use eye makeup remover to remove my eye makeup. I use baby shampoo (it is really cheap compared to eye makeup remover and it is safe and gentle to use on my eyes). it removes all traces of my makeup, mascara and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it does not wear off throughout the day, does not smear, and even stayed put through a very vigorous workout in a non air conditioned place. my face sweats a lot, compared to the people around me (even in 75 degree weather), and never has my mascara smeared or came off as a result of that. take it from someone who applies mascara every day, has fallen asleep in it (by accident!), has worked out, cried, and hooked up in it. it is aaaamazing.ather), and never has my mascara smeared or came off as a result of that. take it from someone who applies mascara every day, has fallen asleep in it (by accident!), has worked out, cried, and hooked up in it. it is aaaamazing.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite mascaras, hands down sultry and long lashes and not a beastly removal process. I keep coming back to this over and over, it beats out clinque, chanel, avon...everyone.</li>
            <li> Got two for her and saved about halfthe price also. Great product as it is what she uses, OUr Austrailian shepard pppie tried to eat the other one but got it back,  Amazon shipped quickly wich impressed me also,</li>
            <li> Works very well, however it seemed to dry out very quickly.</li>
            <li> My absolute most favorite mascara!!!! This makes my lashed look much thicker and stays on well all day long</li>
            <li> This mascara really makes your eyelashes stand out, it almost looks like you&#x27;re wearing false lashes it makes them so thick.</li>
            <li> Great mascara with all day coverage!!</li>
            <li> I have always loved voluminous mascara by Loreal and I usually use the black/brown but I am loving the carbon black.  This mascara is really good and I love how the dark color makes my eyes stand out.</li>
            <li> I threw this away it was so bad.  I bought it after seeing all the great reviews.  The brush is lame, every time you pull it out of the tube it&#x27;s just a huge blob of mascara.  Also it rubs off onto your face so it made me look like I had dark under eye circles because of black being rubbed off.  Hated it and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a month or so already.  It does thicken your lashes..but occasional clumping.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I can use.  I&#x27;ve tried many over the years and I always come back to this one.  The only reason this is not 5 stars is because each time I buy it, it&#x27;s a gamble.  They sometimes seem dried out a bit and I don&#x27;t feel I get as much from them as I use to.  I don&#x27;t know if this is because they are stored in a hot place, stored too long, or if the manufacture has gotten skimpier on the product.  I still haven&#x27;t found anything better though and at least once I&#x27;ve had the same problem buying from my local drug store, so I&#x27;m still willing to purchase this way.  I buy it with my subscribe and save items and the savings can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> The product is dark and applies easily without too much clumping, but I have the same problem with this as I do many mascaras -- it comes off and leaves dark shadows under my eyes.  Sigh, not for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for years.  I have tried many others and don&#x27;t like them nearly as well.  I love that I get long and thick lashes without clumping and with long wear.</li>
            <li> This mascara is so goopy and clumpy! I don&#x27;t understand why there are so many positive reviews. Although the color is good and the product lasts a long time, it&#x27;s very difficult to apply without looking like I have spiders for eyelashes. I have to carefully smooth out the clumps with an eyebrow comb after applying, which takes way too long and is not worth the effort. Also, sometimes the mascara flakes off and gets in my eyes. I gave it about a week and finally had to switch to another brand.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!!!  Excellent quality. Love it</li>
            <li> Nothing like the drug store brand. What a dissapointment knowing I could have spent a few dollars more for the REAL thing that would have lasted me a few months.</li>
            <li> absolutely perfect!! good price and it arrived right on time! i like the longer brush, i&#x27;m very much enjoying this product</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have got waterproof, maybe not. It smudges as crazy under my eyes in a first few hours after applying. My go to mascara is a green Cover Girl (not w/p). A little bit sad because I could have spent my money on smth else. It is also difficult to take of. Doesn&#x27;t matter how hard you try, it will leave some product on your lash line.</li>
            <li> Think, inexpensive. My favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mascara.  I like the fact that is does not clump and goes on well.</li>
            <li> Awesome mascara !  Length and volume !</li>
            <li> Dont like it. Very clumpy!</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE MASCARA AT SUCH A BARGAIN! I WILL NEVER GO ANYWHERE ELSE FOR IT!!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU!!</li>
            <li> Recently bought this mascara at my local cvs and when i used it, i fell in love with it. it really does add volume to your lashes and gives you that \\&quot;i&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes\\&quot; effect. plus, this was also the first l&#x27;oreal mascara i&#x27;ve ever used. very good mascara.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! &amp; i love the carbon black color it&#x27;s really darker than blackest black.I was always looking for a really black mascara and i found it.I love that this mascara doesn&#x27;t make your lashes hard or clumpy.It made them really full and they were soft to the touch.I tried some on and my family members thought that i was wearing false lashes!! And my natural lashes are very thin and short.This made them big and bold.This is the best drugstore mascara ever!!!! As for the bad ratings they probably didn&#x27;t put enough coats on or didn&#x27;t apply it correctly.</li>
            <li> Always a good mascara</li>
            <li> Great mascara even better proce</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap mascara for a reason.  If you are looking for significantly improved lashes I would look to Youngique.</li>
            <li> Dupe for high end mascara, true by its word very voluminous worth buying from amazon than stores for much better price and delivered to home!</li>
            <li> I am on a tri - monthly delivery of this product. It started out as a great deal, but the past two deliveries have not been satisfactory. The mascara has been clumpy and does not apply very smoothly. I would expect it toward delivery time, but one delivery it arrived that way and the last delivery it was fine for a week, but then got clumpy. Doesn&#x27;t seem like I&#x27;m getting a very fresh product. Probably will not continue using it.</li>
            <li> The brush sucks the mascara is extremely thick and I just hated the way it made my lashes look they weren&#x27;t defined at all. It was just horrible</li>
            <li> Although this mascara is really black and it does make your lashes longer it tends to dry out through out the day and it seems to shed. Once it sheds the lil black specks of mascara will fall in your eye which is extremely uncomfortable. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I have it for like 10 years ago and I ever bough it.  Have a dramatic look in your eyes, beautiful and real voluminous mascara! the best!</li>
            <li> leaves black circles under my eyes.  going back to volminous original.</li>
            <li> Dark and lush and thickens my lashes, but a bit smudgy by the end of the day.  I still like it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Big, plump, full lashes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for over 10 years. Its the best! It gives me long looking lashes that are clump free and its so much cheaper than anything you buy at the mall. I&#x27;m very loyal and will never try any other brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Tarte Lights Camera Lashes! for awhile, but decided to try this first, as I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s a good dupe. Obviously I haven&#x27;t used Tarte LCL, so I&#x27;m not sure how this compares, but I have no interest in trying it anymore, this is so amazing for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have so many mascaras, that it takes a lot for one to stand out to me. I have very long lashes, so volume is a must for me. This formula is so, well, voluminous! And the brush will coat every last lash, without clumps! It also works great on lower lashes, and is probably the blackest mascara I own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is, the wet formula takes awhile to dry, so it&#x27;s easy to smudge right after you put it on. Once it sets, I can last 12+ hours flake and smudge free!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little bit dry...</li>
            <li> This mascara is great - it never clumps and it makes my eyelashes look fuller &amp; longer.  I have used this for a few months now and I love it!  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this BUT it goes on very WET and it clumps up on the wand.</li>
            <li> This is the second tube that has arrived so dried out it was not usable and I had to toss it.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about mascara and I like to replace it often. Using the subscribe and save feature with this enables me to do so with a cost savings. The mascara is probably above average as mascara goes. Since I have a faster degree of turnover than most that helps avoid the clumping that comes with most mascara.</li>
            <li> This is OK mascara. It gets somewhat clumpy after a few uses. It does give somewhat of a dramatic lash if used with eye lash curler. I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend. Spend a few more bucks and get the baby doll mascara by YSL, you wont regret it!</li>
            <li> I like this mascara a lot, it&#x27;s thick, makes my lashes longer and doesn&#x27;t flake off much or at all.&lt;br /&gt;It does the trick ;-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been my fave for over 20 years. I&#x27;ve tried others, even the more expensive brands, but always come back to voluminous.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara. You can pay for more expensive versions but this one can&#x27;t be beat for fullness and length.</li>
            <li> only type of mascara I will use&lt;br /&gt;have short eyelashes with drooping lids so this one smears much less than other products</li>
            <li> I love this product,&lt;br /&gt;It is the best mascara that I have&lt;br /&gt;ever bought. I am never using&lt;br /&gt;another mascara again.</li>
            <li> Great reliable mascara.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading reviews here. I have never been a impressed by grocery store brand mascaras in the past but this one is worth the bairly $6 price tag. It actually adds not just volume but pretty great length. I have not experienced it being clumpy like some of the reviews said. Love it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump, but it does flake a little.  Better than most mascaras.  Great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I enjoy convenience of subscribe and save... never was able to run into store for one item and come out with less than 5, so this is a savings and great mascara, doesn&#x27;t smudge</li>
            <li> Hands down, this is the best mascara I have ever used, and I have tried MANY of them!  My un-mascara&#x27;d lashes are terrible ... short, sparse, stick-straight.  I use this mascara and you can actually SEE my eyelashes.  They are longer and thicker.  I have no problem with smudging, smearing, or flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some people discussing problems with removal.  An ophthalmologist told me to use baby shampoo on a warm wash cloth.  It removes all eye makeup for me, although I only use one coat of mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regard to &amp;#34;too much product on the brush&amp;#34;, simply wipe the brush with a tissue.  There usually is enough left on the brush to do the job properly.</li>
            <li> Great value for the amount received.  I got fake eyelashes right after I bought this so I didn&#x27;t have a lot of time to try this out.</li>
            <li> It smudges and doesn&#x27;t last.  I have mascara everywhere but my lashes.  I won&#x27;t get this type again in the future.</li>
            <li> not as expected; clumpy</li>
            <li> Great value~ great application and the color is great!  it is an autoship item now- I love it that much!</li>
            <li> Voluminous products are great, this is my usual mascara,nothing else compares</li>
            <li> This product looks nice, but it clumps terribly on the brush, such that every now and then you have to clean the bristle with hot water to get all the excess mascara off of it and then re-insert it to apply the mascara. I won&#x27;t purchase this particular brand again.</li>
            <li> This mascara is the best I&#x27;ve tried. It is noticeably better than the maybelline products Ive used previously. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love how much this coats and it doesn&#x27;t take much...it&#x27;s hard as he&#x27;ll to get off at night so you know it&#x27;ll stay on.</li>
            <li> One of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used. Glides on smoothly and makes my eyelashes look so much more fuller without it looking cakey. Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this once when the store was out of the mascara I&#x27;d usually use and I have never gone back. I have pretty long natural lashes already but since I have black roots with the rest of my eyelashes being a light blonde, I need a mascara or my lashes look pretty nonexistent. Like I said, my lashes are pretty long already, but this lengthens them even more so that it looks like I&#x27;m wearing falsies. I absolutely love this mascara and I cannot rave about it enough. It&#x27;s great for thickening and lengthening your lashes, and it doesn&#x27;t break down during the day like some mascaras that leave little pieces of crumbled mascara under your eyes by the middle of the day.</li>
            <li> Looks good as far as volume but runs easily.  Seems to contain a lot of product.  Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> this mascara is SO CLUMPY. i was so disappointed when within its first week of use it made my lashes clumpy</li>
            <li> never used anything other than this product. gives nice volume to my lashes and  looks perfect to me.&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
            <li> I do not like this mascara. I end up with raccoon eyes after a few hours. Plus, it clumps. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> You absolutely cannot beat the price for such a high quality mascara. All of the other store brands (Revlon, Almay, CoverGirl, Nautrogena, Maybelline) do not even come close. This Loreal mascara is actually closer in quality and performance to the expensive department store brands (most of which cost four or five times as much). If you are on a budget you simply will not find a better mascara, whether you buy it here or at the store (Target usually has it on sale for example).</li>
            <li> Pretty good for L&amp;#34;Oreal product. Just wish they did not have so much extra product on the wand when using it. Can get very clumpy easily but i guess that is expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product</li>
            <li> This is one of the better mascaras I have tried. As a Caucasian female with blonde eyelashes, it is often hard to find a mascara that makes my stubby lashes look full. This mascara does the job well, and it is very affordable compared to some other mascaras out there. The only thing that I did not like about this mascara is that the wand clumps easily - however, I found an easy solution. If your mascara is very clumpy, simply wash the wand with soap and water and allow to dry before putting it back in the tube. Additionally, do not pump the wand to get more product on the wand - this creates air bubbles that causes mascara to clump. I only had to wash the wand once, and since then it has been great. If you are looking for an affordable, great mascara, then this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> They figured out a way&lt;br /&gt;to combine eye-liner and mascara,&lt;br /&gt;that both go on in one coat.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my thin lashes very full.&lt;br /&gt;It stays on all day&lt;br /&gt;and comes off easily at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike most products,&lt;br /&gt;this one is full inside,&lt;br /&gt;so it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I just start at the tips&lt;br /&gt;where it needs it;&lt;br /&gt;and as I work towards the base,&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27;s less product on the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s A+ mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It goes on really easy and does not clump. It also makes my eyelashes look fuller.</li>
            <li> I came home to find this at my doorstep and immediately went inside to apply. (Make-up wh0re here!) I am so happy with it! I feel about it the way I felt when I applied &#x27;They&#x27;re Real&#x27; by Benefit: AMAZED!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on about all the high-priced mascaras I have tried (They&#x27;re so Big, Definicils, etc.). The only drug store brand I liked this much was Maybelline &amp;#34;Lash Stylist&amp;#34;.. and it was discontinued. I&#x27;ve never been one to cry over discontinued make-up products. I have SO MANY in my arsenal, I don&#x27;t have time to get attached, but I may have shed a tear or two when this one no longer graced the shelves or my lashes. [sad face]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this mascara once. Minutes ago. I may use it tomorrow or the next day and be underwhelmed. I doubt that. It may dry out sooner than I would like, i.e., with 2 weeks of daily use, that is possible. I WILL update if something tarnishes the reputation I just confirmed (in my own  mind) because mascara is a serious matter and if my review helps only one girl (or guy.. no judgement) I will be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can tell, Wayne Goss was right.</li>
            <li> I normally like this brand, but those I get through amazon seem dry like they are old. Date is really close to expiration each time.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara because it&#x27;s dark, doesn&#x27;t clump and stays on all day, but it leaves terrible raccoon eyes. Make sure you are prepared to wipe under your eyes a couple of times per day.</li>
            <li> This mascara reminds me of Mally Mascara only it comes off easier, my favorite is Lancome Definicils High def but I hate to pay $ 27.00 for it, this is very good and is only $5.00 something, I feel better buying the less expensive one...</li>
            <li> Makes lashes longer and thicker. Only down side is after using it for about 2 weeks on a daily basic mascara gets thick and clumps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not voluminous, not on my eyelashes. But it does not smell, which I like, it stays on my lashes all day long, and it has nice color.</li>
            <li> Sticky and hard to wash off.  I like the one with the gold tube much better.  Naturale I think.  That doesn&#x27;t give me raccoon face.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal and Lancôme are same Company so you get a really good buy if you buy the cheaper version. Will buy again. Works great</li>
            <li> Always looks good and doesn&#x27;t clump. Removes easily with baby oil or petroleum jelly.  Love having it shipped directly to my home.</li>
            <li> Clumps and is so dark it makes your eyes look awful.&lt;br /&gt;I usually get the black, didn&#x27;t notice that this was different until I used it. Will not order this shade again.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite mascara! I have tried numerous other brands in all different price ranges. I constantly get compliments and ask what mascara I use</li>
            <li> This mascara is fantastic in price and the color is deep and rich.  I love it at first, but it was very irritating to my eyes.  They became so dry and red that my coworkers felt the need to comment on them.. My eyes are fairly sensitive, if your eyes are not, then this is a great mascara to try.  It didn&#x27;t flake at all, and the color is fantastic, feels were rich and wet going on.  I say that because nothing is worse than a dry mascara.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal make up products are the best and the cost is amazing.  The shipment went great!  I use L&#x27;Oreal and now I am passing on to my daughter.  Thank you</li>
            <li> This product definitely covers and is waterproof but I found it a bit clumpy.  I really like L&#x27;Oreal but would probably choose a different product next time.</li>
            <li> Great mascara. Excellent coverage, no clumping or flaking, and feels relatively lightweight. It&#x27;s easy to remove with facial soap and water. Not too bad on the morning raccoon eyes if not removed before bed. I&#x27;d certainly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for YEARS now. I love it. It makes my eyelashes so dramatic. The ONLY complaint I have is when you first use it, a little too much product comes out on the wand so you&#x27;ll have to wipe it off. But once you get past that stage, you&#x27;ll love it. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for years I love it si much. I keep buying expensive mascaras and always go back to this. Amazing!</li>
            <li> The package is intact but the ink inside is dry and so not much of it.  Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This creates dark, thick, black lashes like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. When I tried it for the first time, my husband thought I was wearing falsies! I&#x27;ve never bought department store mascaras, and with stupendous mascaras like this, I probably won&#x27;t ever will.</li>
            <li> Best drugstore brand mascar there is. Hands down. Super black. And it is so buildable for volume. The only thing that beats this imho is Diorshow blackout. But at more than 3 times the price it should. For everyday, this is untouchable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so happy with this mascara, I bought it based on the reviews but once I apply it it leaves lumps on my lashes.</li>
            <li> goes on easily stays on pretty well but it did run a little in the bad humidity in S C or when I cried at a wedding</li>
            <li> I really am not loving this mascara. So much I decided to write a review. I have light, thin, but long lashes, and what I got was a clump fest. If you are going for a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product. The brush is nothing special. I really hate my lashes looking over done, but I understand how others could like that look. Just not for me.</li>
            <li> love this brush, I would definitely purchase this brand again</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara for the price.  In fact, it outperforms some of the high-end expensive brands you can purchase at places like Sephora.  It&#x27;s very thick and provides quite a bit of volume to your lashes.  Just be careful to wipe off the applicator on the edges of the tube otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with spider lashes (and likely, smudges of mascara on your eyelids).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that even though this product is not waterproof, it does take a bit of extra work (and eye makeup remover) to get off.  I use the small makeup remover pads from Almay, and usually I can use one pad (front and back) for both eyes.  With this mascara, I have to use a total of 3 pads (one pad, front and back for each eye, and a follow-up pad for the black smudges I&#x27;ve created on my face). Not a huge deal, but something to think about if you&#x27;re less than diligent about removing your makeup at night and/or you&#x27;re trying to conserve your makeup removing products.  I also follow it up with a good scrubbing using face wash, as well.</li>
            <li> I prefer that regular Voluminous mascara in black over this.</li>
            <li> I use this with a small sample mascara that I get from lancome when purchasing face moisturizers and other things.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great mascara and has lots of volume. I use the lancome to separate since this can get a little clumpy. Im hoping that&lt;br /&gt;with continuous use it will dry a little and not be too clumpy. I honestly love it thought. I have found my favorite combination so far.&lt;br /&gt;My sister says my eye lashes look like falsies !</li>
            <li> Pretty good for the price!! It doesn&#x27;t flake all over the place like some. And,  more importantly,  it doesn&#x27;t clump... at all.</li>
            <li> I think the mascara is old as it bothers my eyes. I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, compared to the 15+ mascara&#x27;s out there this does the job</li>
            <li> DRY AND CLUMPY! MAYBE I GOT A MESSED UP ONE BUT THIS ONE WAS ALL BAD! I WOULD NOT ORDER THIS AGAIN AT LEAST FROM HERE</li>
            <li> Wow, now these are some lashes!  Very easy to use and makes lots of big lashes with no clumping.  It&#x27;s a very good buy, and I&#x27;m pleased to have found a mascara I really like for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I have used this for years. Its truly a deep black and such a great product. Thanks a bunch.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a number of different drug store and high end mascaras, and this one is definitely high on my list! I love the color, it&#x27;s such an intense black. It&#x27;s affordable. It definitely makes my lashes look longer and fuller, more voluminous!  It doesn&#x27;t clump.&lt;br /&gt;The only con for me….. is that this product can be kind of difficult to completely remove. Even when I think I&#x27;ve removed it all, sometimes I wake up with black mascara residue/streaks around my eyes. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product that I use everyday!</li>
            <li> I already have long lashes -- but truly this does add volume -- i don&#x27;t need to retouch them --&lt;br /&gt;i add this to my subscription list --&lt;br /&gt;reena</li>
            <li> Nice, but I need something that adds a bit more vollume</li>
            <li> This works for me. I am not looking to get the look of false eyelashes. I just want my lashes to look a little thicker and fuller. For this purpose, this mascara does the job.</li>
            <li> Love the price and product.</li>
            <li> after being stuck on one one brand for years I took a chance with this and am so glad I did as my lashes have never looked longer.  I often get compliments!</li>
            <li> This made my lashes long ! I love this stuff , if you want them thick put multiple coat on but I feel this mascara is more meant for length</li>
            <li> As long as you only use it 3 months or less really excellent product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to first say that I love how deep the color is of this mascara. Gives that perfect old hollywood glam coloring everyone is looking for! What I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it&#x27;s a little too thick for my taste. I already have fairly thick lashes so it makes them look clumped and spidery. Overall a good product but it doesn&#x27;t compare to higher end brands whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I have used all the mascaras one can imagine. Bobbi Brown, Este Lauder, Lancome. Laura Mericier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also come back to Loreal and can&#x27;t figure out why I even bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loreal&#x27;s Original is thick. Non clumpy.  Big plush brush. And a rich, velvet-like mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It both beats all others and is 4 xs cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Win-win!</li>
            <li> This mascara was clumpy from day one and I could never apply it without clumps!  I was disappointed big time.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, have tried others but keep going back to the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34;..</li>
            <li> One of my top favorite mascaras and for the price it&#x27;s so worth buying. This mascara always gives me a nice full last.</li>
            <li> I bought many brands of mascara through the last 30 years and kept trying different ones because I wasn&#x27;t that pleased with each one that I tried. So I just never stuck to a certain brand until I found L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Mascara. I&#x27;ve been using this brand of mascara and this brand only for the last 10 years. Not only does it provide great thickness and length for my lashes, it doesn&#x27;t smudge easily or bother my eyes. I can be sensitive to certain products. The price is a dollar or more cheaper then at any retail store I&#x27;ve found and the automatic ordering is awesome!</li>
            <li> When I use this mascara, people ask me if my lashes are real! It&#x27;s the perfect thing to use everyday</li>
            <li> It was not waterfroof</li>
            <li> this is my favorite mascara. will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY expensive mascaras, and I always come back to this. Perfection. What else can I say? Try it.</li>
            <li> this crap leaks&lt;br /&gt;beware of anything you are wearing or of anything in your vicinity&lt;br /&gt;when you take it out of the tube&lt;br /&gt;leaky, wet, and gets black all over your hands, your towels, just&lt;br /&gt;leaky garbage, too thick when it comes out of the tube but worst thing&lt;br /&gt;is that it leaves black wet smuge anywhere in its path</li>
            <li> it started out great but after 1 month it often comes out too much on the brush and applies clumpy to my lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years. It gives volume and length. You can build it up but after a couple coats you have to be careful about clumping. I like the formula though, no flaking. The wand is nice and thick too.</li>
            <li> This really is a great mascara!  I have used a multitude of mascaras in my life (I&#x27;m almost 35 years old) and this one is one of the best I have used.  (I have used &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;extremely expensive&amp;#34; over the years)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- Bold&lt;br /&gt;  Quick drying&lt;br /&gt;  Truly adds volume&lt;br /&gt;  Great brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- Too much mascara gets on the brush most of the time&lt;br /&gt;  You can easily make your eyes &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; if you don&#x27;t do it properly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply your first coat very slowly from the bottom of the lashes to the top.  ONE COAT.  Then go to your other eye and repeat on that side.  Wait a few seconds and look your lashes over.  Repeat but this time not as slowly.  Do the other side and WAIT!  This should be enough mascara!  Then barely apply to your lower lashes......  if you put too much on, you will have tarantella eyes that flakes off.  If you put too little on you will feel like &amp;#34;eh&amp;#34;....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it and I recommend it!</li>
            <li> This goes on wet and clumpy, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem at all with it running and it stays on the whole day. I&#x27;m not nuts about it. I would not order this again.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely my go to mascara. It makes my eyelashes thick and it separates them. This is even better than some of the department store brands. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a classic. Buy it. You&#x27;ll not regret it!. Great color, great volume, it&#x27;s not clumpy... my favorite mascara so far!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I&#x27;m a makeup snob but this mascara out does any expensive mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Full, long, thick lashes are always in style, but applying false lashes daily isn’t always practical and is very time consuming.  So finding a way to get the look of fake lashes without actually having to take the time to glue them on is life changing! I think that this would be a really smart buy for anyone who craves really dramatic lashes but either can’t wear false lashes, or don’t have the time to apply falsies in their daily routine. Visit my site and message me for details, I am more than happy to share my before and afters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Okay!  I still prefer other more expensive brands.  It clumped way too much for me.</li>
            <li> I search high and low for the perfect mascaras. I am very picky about mine and this blew me away. Plus, I didn&#x27;t react to it at all! It separates lashes will  little to no clumping and elongates them like spider legs. The volume isn&#x27;t insane, but that&#x27;s not what I was interested in. The volume is impressive though, especially with two coats. anything more than that and things start to clump. I was going for specifically length and got exactly what I asked for. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Excellent, 100% recommended</li>
            <li> Not sure if I just got a bad one but it&#x27;s super clumpy...I&#x27;ve only had this mascara for a couple of weeks and I&#x27;m ready to toss it...</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS MASCARA SO MUCH! I rather use this mascara than my mac mascara ! Love it so much!</li>
            <li> Initially, I liked this mascara because it was not clumpy when applied. However, every single time I have tried to use it, I end up noticing that after a couple of hours it runs down terribly. After two or three hours I would notice black spots at the outer side of my eyes. After five hours or more, I would simply end up looking like a racoon. All these times I wasn&#x27;t really exposed to harsh conditions like sun or sweat, but was simply at home or having dinner with friends... I would expect any mascara to hold decently under such basic scenarios.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a shame, because this mascara looks very nice as soon as it is applied, but it does not hold well for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> love this mascars, my only with is that there was so kind of control on the product, it just seems to come out to much and I have to keep scraping some off the brush, but color is very black and think, would recommend.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have been applying various drugstore mascaras over ten years.  Doing my makeup is a daily routine for me.  As someone cursed with short, light, sparse eyelashes that do not like mascara I have been combating this problem for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Since L&#x27;oreal Voluminous Mascara Carbon Black was on sale at my local Walgreen&#x27;s for $5.99 and I had a $1.00 off coupon, I decided to give them a try.  This is a very wet mascara.  As such, it does not clump at all.  The color is a very rich, deep black--more so than any other drugstore mascara I have ever tried.  However, the wand is terrible.  It is does not add much volume to my lashes and only moderate amount of length.  I prefer a more dramatic look.  The end of the wand collects mascara that gets all over my face if I don&#x27;t wipe it off.  The wand is also difficult to manipulate to ensure it gets every one of my tiny lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I wish more drugstore mascaras had this deep, rich color.  It really is fabulous.  However, I think this mascara would be better suited to someone with a more normal length and volume to their lashes as it does not give mine enough of this.  Or someone who is looking for a less dramatic look.  (My lashes have to stand out behind glasses and black cat eye eyeliner).  As to if I would purchase this product again--no, I would probably give another mascara a try or possibly use this with a base coat of Maybelline Great Lash Clear Mascara.&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have new glasses that mean that I cannot wear mascara that makes my eyelashes too long because my lenses are so thick.  Once I have gotten used to the wand and it is easier to use than some of the really fat ones.  I keep repurchasing this mascara because it is a perfect basic mascara and is super black.  This is what I&#x27;m going to keep buying.  I also get coupons to be able to purchase this mascara at a lower cost as it is more expensive than Cover Girl and Maybelline varieties.  This mascara does not dry out with normal use in less than three months, which is the maximum amount of time you are able to keep using mascara for hygiene reasons.in less than three months, which is the maximum amount of time you are able to keep using mascara for hygiene reasons.</li>
            <li> Nice mascara but it prints on my eyelids and underneath :-(</li>
            <li> Very impressed by the quality of this mascara. I have used just a few times and loved every time. It elongates the lashes and applies a good enough amount of mascara coat by coat, which you can build up for the volume of your preference.</li>
            <li> Like the mascara.  Good price.</li>
            <li> Great mascara. Good color, stayability.</li>
            <li> I like L&#x27;Oreal mascara.  It has been a favorite for quite some time  and I will continue to buy one when needed.  Good coverage.</li>
            <li> Not waterproof. And by this i mean i got somethimg in my eye, teared a little and had so much of a mess i had to remove my make up. Would not buy again. The lashes are not voluminous at all either.</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever made in my opinion and now Amazon has it available as a subscribe and save option! I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Não h&amp;aacute; o que falar de L&#x27;Oreal. Seus produtos sempre superam as expectativas. Comprei de presente para minha esposa e ela adorou.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara of all time. It washes of easily. However, it has lasting wear. My top pick for mascara!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this mascara! My only complaint is that is does get a little clumpy as it ages. Great value for the money!</li>
            <li> Poor product. Thick. Goopy. Probably old</li>
            <li> Have used L&#x27;oreal Voluminous Mascara for 6 plus years. The morning application provides good coverage and last the entire day. I have tried other brands but have discovered this brand is the best. The price &amp; quality is much appreciated!!! Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different mascaras and I always come back to this one.  Doesn&#x27;t flake off randomly throughout the day, is perfect when layered, and comes off easily (as long as you don&#x27;t get the waterproof kind) at the end of the night.</li>
            <li> Love the dark black color, this is my absolute favorite mascara. I am SO glad Amazon started offering it on subscribe and save, and at a lower price than the drug store too! I am VERY Pleased with this find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this mascara before and tried others since but went back to it because I remembered it as being pretty good. Not anymore! It worked fine for the first week or so and then every time I pull the wand out, it&#x27;s got tons of gloppy wads of product stuck on it. I have to wipe it off repeatedly before I can put any on my eyelashes. Very surprised at the good reviews here. Maybe I got a bad batch?</li>
            <li> Works really well, makes your lashes look so good!</li>
            <li> Not very voluminous and doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes stand out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good mascara to lengthen and thicken, this is it.  It&#x27;s a good price and applies well.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Good drug store mascara, very little clumping, adds dramatic lashes.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great mascara. Doesn&#x27;t clump and can look natural or bold depending on how you apply. Have tried many brands but I keep coming back to this mascara. I have recommended it to many friends and they became hooked.</li>
            <li> Makes lashes long, and potion is not too sticky- lashes stay apart and dont clump.</li>
            <li> This is my VERY favorite mascara!! I have used many high end brands and I always go back to this one. Stays put all day with no smudging or flaking. I wear contacts and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I love the super dark black color. It lengthens and adds tons of volume. It also washes off super easily with my face wash.</li>
            <li> It is very dry and I&#x27;m disappointed.  I just needed some (didn&#x27;t feel like going shopping), so I added it to my order.  I&#x27;ll not do that again.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  Works OK</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding a good mascara, and this is probably the second best I have found. It clumps considerably, though. I switched to the younique brand and I am much happier with that for volumizing.</li>
            <li> good product with great price ... Thanks for cooperating</li>
            <li> this is one of the very very few mascaras that does not give me upper lid smudge. My lashes are long and touch my upper eyelid giving me the transfer smudge that drives me up a wall. I have used eyelid primer eye lash primer etc etc. buit have minimal luck. So out of most products I use which goes from very high end to the low low end this is one of the best so far. I am always lookin!</li>
            <li> It is for sensitive eyes. I had surgery on my eyes and I feel comfortable when using this. However, don&#x27;t go to bed with it, my eyes hurt in the morning if I do so.</li>
            <li> Its a super great mascara, 100% recommended, it makes your lashes appear longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m against loreal, it&#x27;s used on animals.</li>
            <li> This mascara IS nice.  Creates nice long lashes with minimal effort. However, from the very first use, too much mascara comes on the wand.  If I ever used it like that, I would have one big clump instead of separated eyelashes. So I wipe the brush on the top of the mascara container until it&#x27;s all off, then I use it.  Wish they would invent some kind of thing they could put INSIDE the tube that would clean the brush off as you take it out so it wouldn&#x27;t all come out like that.  YUCK!  Not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again because of that, but I DO like it once I get it on.</li>
            <li> I have bought every kind of mascara under the sun. from $2 Wet&#x27;nwild to $35 Dior and this drug store mascara is the BEST. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;#1 It&#x27;s super dark black&lt;br /&gt;#2 It gives me length and volume, people have asked me if my eyelashes are fake before&lt;br /&gt;#3 It layers great! (this is awesome during finals when you fall asleep in your text book and don&#x27;t have time to do a full re-do on your make up. This stuff looks amazing on second day wear just by adding a touch-up to the ends of your lashes)&lt;br /&gt;#4 It doesn&#x27;t smudge&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s fricken 6 or 7 bucks! Great stuff. I&#x27;ve been wearing this for 3 years now, sometimes I try other stuff, but after a few applications of a new brand I always end up throwing it in the make-up junk drawer and coming back to this stuff instead.</li>
            <li> One of the worst mascaras I&#x27;ve used in regards to smearing.  Makes my lashes look long and lush so I like them for that but terrible at smearing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara since I was 16. That&#x27;s almost 3 decades of faithful use. This mascara adds great length and volume.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara~! Make my eyelashes huge and is very is very thick. Must be careful so they do not clump but if applied proper, will make your eyelashes look AMAZING. I always use this over any Sephora or MAC brand mascara.</li>
            <li> For a cheap drug store mascara I like this :) It def helps with volume :)</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it really extends my lashes but they tend to smear and I end up with big panda eyes (smudges underneath my eyes).  I thought I was purchasing the waterproof ones but I guess I got the wrong ones.  If they don&#x27;t smudge, I&#x27;d rate them 5 stars1</li>
            <li> This and loreal&#x27;s butterfly mascara are the best mascaras I have ever used. I tend to buy very exspensive make up but this is better then any other brand I have tried. I like the curved brush - it&#x27;s an option or like color.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try a mascara that was contact lens friendly.  Unfortunately, a few hours into use, I had two raccoon eyes.  Definitely not what I expected.  Less clumps than other brands but smears and runs.  I would not recommend with contact lens because if you had to use eye drops, this mascara would run all over down your face.  Ok if you don&#x27;t use drops.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many mascara&#x27;s over the years, $3 to $30.  This particular brand is one I return to time and time again. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> nice product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Love the packaging sleek and expensive looking..... BUT.... I pefer the more natural long and fairly full look and this is SO CLUMPY. there is so much product on the brush and the Brussels don&#x27;t balance.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are short.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara helped me to make my eyelashes look longer.&lt;br /&gt;I don’t want to wear false eyelashes because I would feel that my eyes are heavy.&lt;br /&gt;I adore this mascara because it usually last for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I did not care for this mascara as much as some of the others I tried. I thought it was kind of thin.</li>
            <li> This mascara is so damn messy. It&#x27;s clumpy and too much product gets applied onto the brush when dipped. Not only that theirs alway a ton of product over flowing on top of the container when I open it. I&#x27;ve tried shaking the mascara and warming up the product (container) before opening it  but that does nothing. Honestly speaking, if you want to get mascara all over yourself and your vanity area get this stuff. This mascara sucks it doesn&#x27;t even add volume all it does is clump your lashes. Stick to Maybellin guys!</li>
            <li> Favorite mascara ever!!!  I have been using it for at least 15 years!  Was just as described when I received it.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  My lashes are short and blonde and this mascara lengthens and darkens them.  It doesn&#x27;t smear or smudge off during the day.</li>
            <li> Meh.... Nice but flakes off.</li>
            <li> Really like this mascara the only down fall after using it for about two weeks I noticed it starting to get clumpy :(</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner. It looks great, doesn&#x27;t clump too bad and really adds volume!</li>
            <li> Makes my girlfriend happy &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Love love love this mascara, very good price and amazing quality</li>
            <li> Thickens lashes.  I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect mascara that thickens, lengthens, and stays put.</li>
            <li> It took me a few days to like this.  Once the wand got satuated good, it give full coverage on the eyelashes real quick.  I don&#x27;t find that it smears under my eyes like some do.  Overall, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Lashes become fewer and thinner as we age, but I will not chance my eyes&#x27; health by using claimed lash regrowth products. It seems that they do not regrow our youthful lash quality, but only flimsy, often downward-curving lashes that may even grow into the eyes. Light colored eyes and even eyelids may darken with use and who needs that? This mascara really does the trick of building up fine lashes, giving a dramatic look if you work it a little before it dries. For a less dramatic daytime effect use only one coat,  I am very satisfied and so is my daughter.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my daughter.</li>
            <li> This mascara really makes your eyes pop, it is clump free and non-irritating to my contact lenses.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth without clumping.</li>
            <li> can produce very spidery lashes if you aren&#x27;t careful, but is VERY volumizing</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara on the market.</li>
            <li> Everything about this mascara holds true to what is described. I founnd the mascara could be too thick and glob my eyelashes into one big thick lash especially if I use the wand it comes with.  I used and old brush for an empty bottle of mascara that has the thinner wand and it distributes the mascara on my eyelashes beautifully.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to add a lot of volume and length to their lashes but be carefull it does have a tendancy to glob up with the wand they provide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Loreal mascara for almost 20 years and it&#x27;s still my top pick.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my lashes clumpy looking at all.</li>
            <li> Very dark, I love this mascara. Only negative is that it dries quickly so you can only apply once meaning that if you go back to apply more it will clump your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Only mascara I use! Great coverage and zero clumps, doesn&#x27;t flake. The brush is great too... very full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - Put 2 drops of lavender essential oil in each new tube and watch your lashes get longer within a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years.  I usually get the &amp;#34;very black&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;blackest black.&amp;#34;  But this time I purchased it off Amazon and they had the &amp;#34;carbon black&amp;#34; available.  I think I actually like it better than the other ones.  I like this brand because you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get a lot of volume.  I like the non-waterproof kind too because it stays on all day and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> This mascara refused to stay on my eyelashes. Every day I used it, it smeared all over under my eyes, irritating my eyes. Pretty much a useless purchase.</li>
            <li> I do like this product; however, I feel that I would need to purchase the water proof type because I find that it smudges throughout the day because my eyes get quite watery,</li>
            <li> I had a bad experience with this mascara. It flaked within an hour since application. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara, the only complaint is that the mascara comes out really thick on the wand and I have to scrape some of it off before applying it. But it is lengthening and creates volume. I like it better than any of the cover girl mascaras.</li>
