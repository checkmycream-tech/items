            <li>I also bought foundation in this line, and I didn&#x27;t like the sponge applicator with it, but with this eye concealer, this sponge applicator is the best to spread under eye area.</li>

            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts on the tops of my cheeks (where the product gets blended into) which I was worried about, so I&#x27;m very happy about that.</li>
            <li>my 24 yo daughter tried mine and loved it also!</li>
            <li>/&gt;He makes beautiful makeup and&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good coverage and great color!</li>
            <li>It does a great job of erasing my undereye</li>
            <li>It is great for an all-over foundation in a pinch, and GREAT as a blemish coverup.  </li>

            <li>great coverage</li>
            <li>I am so happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job.</li>
            <li>This is a great drugstore concealer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up, so I&#x27;m happy it blends so well into my skin.</li>
            <li>Great cover-up and not drying.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this product to be of great help for minimizing under eye circles, however the concealer (powder I think) never came out of the container.</li>
            <li>It brightens underneath my eyes and works great as a highlighter underneath the brow arch.  </li>
            <li>I use it when I contour it works great.</li>
            <li>A great neutral for peaches and cream complexions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great.</li>
            <li>This was a great choice for me .</li>
            <li>Great cover up make up  to hide  bruises</li>
            <li>I also use it as a concealer on blemishes, it works great.</li>
            <li>But best of all it gives the right amount of coverage without looking cakey, and the color perfectly matches my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I love it, clair matches my skin tone perfectly since i&#x27;m an NC20.</li>
            <li>I just use my fingers to tap it out - and then it looks perfect, without getting into fine lines at all.</li>
            <li>It makes my under eye area so bright and stays long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>fair..</li>
            <li>and I got the fair 110 color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just too watery to do any good there for me.  </li>
            <li>This product is a good value.</li>
            <li>The concealer inside the tube is really good.</li>
            <li>I like the applicator and the coverage is good.</li>
            <li>so smooth, blends perfectly, disappears and doesn&#x27;t settle into my lines.</li>
            <li>The color is good, the product when usable is good.  </li>
            <li>use the fair.</li>
            <li>I think this concelear is good....</li>
            <li>I have no idea if it&#x27;s good or not because I didn&#x27;t get to try it out.  </li>
            <li>They could improve on this packaging, but the product is so good, that won&#x27;t keep me from buying and using it.  </li>
            <li>concealer (in FAIR) is a good match for fair people with red/blue undertones and blue/purple circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li>I love this concealer, it conceals beautifully, without settling into lines.</li>
            <li>I have one in my purse, makeup kit, car, desk, each medicine chest; it&#x27;s perfect for a quick touch-up.  </li>
            <li>This sponge concealer in fair is amazing.  </li>
            <li>There is a lot of love for this product on YouTube, so I thought I would order one in Fair (not for highlighting, I actually am fair skinned), and it does do the job.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love it for an under-eye highlight!</li>
            <li>i love this concealer!</li>
            <li>magical!  </li>
            <li>Love my product! A+++</li>
            <li>And I would say this is my favorite Concealer!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It is great for concealing darkness under your eyes and it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It works amazing.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Light and airy, yet provides a great coverage.</li>
            <li>*** is amazing in every way.</li>
            <li>This product is not returnable according to Amazon when I clicked on \\&quot;replace\\&quot; - something about hazardous materials.  </li>
            <li>I have a light peaches and cream complexion with medium copper haircolor and light colored eyes and the color is perfect.</li>
            <li>After using up &#x27;Bobby Brown&#x27;s concealer in cream type, I bought this to give it a try because I heard so many good things about</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this!!  </li>
            <li>It goes on so quickly and easily that before I know it I&#x27;ve used it as foundation, though it works perfectly as concealer.  </li>
            <li>I love the easy applicator and the coverage is great.</li>
            <li>This product has good coverage, but feels nice and light on your face.  </li>
            <li>It blends very easily and is buildable.</li>
            <li>very easy to use, but it didnt make any difference in fines lines on the skin.</li>
            <li>I rarely give cosmetic products a five star review, but I would be happy to give this one six stars if I could.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to apply and does the job just as well!</li>
            <li>It comes in many good shades light..</li>
            <li>I love the applicator sponge because it distributes the makeup evenly.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s applied.  </li>
            <li>I love the color.  </li>
            <li>and I find this is often all I need to look more awake and</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite concealer.</li>
            <li>I love the application</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li>I see now why this concealer gets so much love from reviewers.</li>
            <li>I do love to use this product.</li>
            <li>I love this concealer.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much I love this product.</li>
            <li>I would say it covers about 60%, which is okay.</li>
            <li>And I work 13 hour work days :)</li>
            <li>I love it a lot.</li>
            <li>I always end up taking the top off and using a q-tip for the balance of the tube.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li>I love this concealer.</li>
            <li>It could do better at concealing.</li>
            <li>Seems more like a highlighter than concealer.</li>
            <li>love it&lt;</li>
            <li>Love the applicator.  </li>
            <li>I really love this under eye concealer.  </li>
            <li>I like it and will order more.</li>
            <li>I think Maybelline should have done a better job with quality control on this product.</li>
            <li>had I been able to apply the product.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>As someone who has many acne scars (pigmentations) on their face, this s</li>
            <li>This is contrary to how most concealers work but for some reason it happens with this one.</li>
            <li>I really love that it&#x27;s a concealer that isn&#x27;t a wand, like a mascara.</li>
            <li>You can even layer it to get more coverage.</li>
            <li>I do love the product</li>
            <li>but I have bought many products ..</li>
            <li>Beauty guru&#x27;s love this, so I had to try it.</li>
            <li>Love this concealer.</li>
            <li>I have so many imperfections that I just keep rolling it on.  </li>
            <li>I love the application.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t even able to use it.</li>
            <li>I love the spongy brush thing on the tip, it really does apply the concealer very nicely.  </li>
            <li>It does go on great with the sponge applicator and its super for quick touchups.</li>
            <li>It provides decent coverage and is also great for highlighting.</li>
            <li>The makeup applies very smoothly and is easily blended out.</li>
            <li>This one does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s covered perfect, has a very fine structure, easily to remove, very gentle, the eyes look so natural.</li>
            <li>It took a bit to get the liquid up to the foam top, but once it was there, it applied easily.</li>
            <li>The staying power and amazing coverage make it totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Add a light colored shadow over the top to just &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; it so that your mascara or eyeshadow do not &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to it.  </li>
            <li>It went on like a liquid, but when I went to smooth it, it felt more like a powder.</li>
            <li>It really is quite good.</li>
            <li>I like to use it to touch up because it&#x27;s not very heavy and still looks great when you reapply during the day.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t crease and is easily removed at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Blends easily,</li>
            <li>It does apply easily and blend well.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t go on too strongly, making you look as if you are wearing a couple of crescents of beige paint under your eyes.</li>
            <li>My favorite under eye concealer so far :) Love it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t settle into any fine lines and doesn&#x27;t need a setting powder.</li>
            <li>It covered well and didn&#x27;t settle into the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>but this goes on easy and smooth...</li>
            <li>Pay less than $8.00 for this excellent product, or pay $45 for Touche eclat.  </li>
            <li>I try everything and enjoy the simplicity of the applicatior with this concealer.</li>
            <li>I cannot vouch for reducing puffiness because I do not have that problem, fortunately.</li>
            <li>Great concealer, especially for on the go.  </li>
            <li>It seems to smooth out effortlessly -</li>
            <li>It has a light sheen to it</li>
            <li>Anyway,  this maybelline sponge concealer is perfect for my everyday polished routine.  </li>
            <li>It almost seems like a light foundation consistency rather than a concealer.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, drugstore is cheap, and this is what you receive with cheap products.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic as an all over foundation or spot concealer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and goes on your skin evenly.</li>
            <li>The concealer itself is nice -- light, covers well, doesn&#x27;t dissipate much over the course of a day.</li>
            <li>A great, very lightweight yet high coverage concealer.</li>
            <li>The applicator makes it really easy to quickly sweep and cover under your eyes.</li>
            <li>Perfect and quick for my everyday look</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>it makes me look so .. fresh!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the sponge on this thing just breeds germs and nastiness.</li>
            <li>Also excellent for small blemish cover ups.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to get and try this product.  </li>
            <li>You have to prime the sponge when you first get it by twisting the top until you start to see product appear on the sponge.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived pretty quickly, even though the size is smaller than I thought it would be, this is a very good product.  </li>
            <li>I read so many good reviews on various sites, I decided to give it a try because it&#x27;s pretty cheap.  </li>
            <li>use  fair ,she uses light because it has a bit of yellow .</li>
            <li>The fair shade matches my pale redhead skin beautifully, and it blends seamlessly!  </li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and blends very evenly.</li>
            <li>I wonder how much Yahoo got paid to list this as the best dark circle cover.  </li>
            <li>It is true to color and stays put all day.</li>
            <li>It was just a hint too yellow for my skin, so I ordered Fair from here.</li>
            <li>Way better than lots of high end makeup!</li>
            <li>It makes you look a whole lot more than $10 better, and comes in enough shades that many of us can share in this not just for the wrinkled treat.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this at Target, and they didn&#x27;t have Fair left, so I instead got Light.</li>
            <li>It does have a mild tightening effect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li>I obviously have fair skin so this is the right tone for me.  </li>
            <li>This is great for dark circles.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of lightening any dark areas that you may have.  </li>
            <li>so great for brightening and shine but not for coverage of dark circles...</li>
            <li>Not the best for staying power, but I set it with powder, and it lasts long enough for me.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and does a nice job if you are careful to use it sparingly . . .</li>
            <li>They were quick to send me the right product but when it arrived it broke</li>
            <li>I am very fair with red/blue undertones, it&#x27;s flu season and have two toddlers so undereyes are especially dark</li>
            <li>Instant Age Rewind concealer is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple brands (from Mary Kay to Smashbox to Covergirl) and this stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This magic wand is perfect for covering dark spots or even dark circles.</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;d still say this concealer is worth.</li>
            <li>Is it worth it?  </li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve only used this under my eyes and around my nose to combat redness and am really happy with it.</li>
            <li>Blends well, however need to fresh it if going out at night.</li>
            <li>I tap it in lightly right below lower lashes with my ring finger</li>
            <li>every word was right about this concealer.</li>
            <li>I have two toddlers and a newborn and it perfectly covers my dark circles from not enough sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it does not &amp;#34;erase&amp;#34; my dark under eye circles, I&#x27;ve tried much better concealers than this that give much better coverage.</li>
            <li>My sister is dark haired but fair skinned</li>
            <li>It is so soft and the liquid comes through in just the right amount to easily blend in a circular motion.  </li>
            <li>The soft sponge applicator easily and evenly applies the concealer.</li>
            <li>I received this order very fast with no problems.</li>
            <li>I also have a baby on my hands, so my makeup routine has to be very, very streamlined.  </li>
            <li>Compact enough for purse - very nice overall.</li>
            <li>We both use these products daily or more than 1xy day if going out in evenings .</li>
            <li>It provides great cover without being too thick.</li>
            <li>It REALLY is like an eraser!</li>
            <li>and I expect the coloring to be an exact match in winter.</li>
            <li>i mostly use department store cosmetics such as Lancome and Chanel ...</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon !</li>
            <li>My skin actually feels better after using this.  </li>
            <li>I have seen countless YouTube &amp;#34;beauty gurus&amp;#34; using this product for their under-eye concealer and even as a highlighter on other parts of their face, and the finish always looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the color is nice and neutral - I am super pale and don&#x27;t need orangey correction on my complexion because then it just looks like I have orangey junk under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have age spots under my eyes, just below my dark circles (make sure to wear your sunscreen people!).  </li>
            <li>I have spent so much money on under eye concealers and for just $6.00 this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>The best use for me is to put it on top of my base foundation and use it as a highlighter.  </li>
            <li>Other concealers are a little bit drying, and since i already have dry-ish skin this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it claims and is so much better than than Touche eclat - which tends to look dry and powdery and DOES settle into lines.  </li>
            <li>On a positive note, it does brighten the area.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much for going the extra mile to satisfied me as a customer.</li>
            <li>I just lightly buff over it with a bit of bare essentials powder foundation to set it.</li>
            <li>It kind of works to help with my dark circles, but is not the &#x27;miracle&#x27; product I was thinking it would be.</li>
            <li>This one covers my dark circles kind of.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used tons of drug store concealers and some high end ones (most recently Cle De Peau)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to try this, get it locally so you can easily return it if it&#x27;s a dud.  </li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t cover them completely but it does a decent job and just as good as any other concealer I have tried.  </li>
            <li>light is for us white.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>/&gt;Interestingly, it looks MUCH darker in the tube than on skin, so I recommend looking around for images of someone close to your skin color using it before buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased!&lt;br</li>
            <li>too much</li>
            <li>I work it into my under eyes and lids then blend it gently with my ring finger.  </li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>I still really like it</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is really an &amp;#34;age rewinder&amp;#34; but it does work as a cover stick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent more money than I care to admit.  </li>
            <li>how much I turn it.  </li>
            <li>a also tap some on the whole area below my eyes.</li>
            <li>Reduces wrinkles very well</li>
            <li>I expected this to be a full-coverage concealer, however, it is much more transcent.  </li>
            <li>This is very light,not the color</li>
            <li>I really like the applicator on this.  </li>
            <li>I found the Maybelline concealer to cover just as much</li>
            <li>, so why pay the high price?!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s REALLY good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So unless you&#x27;re getting free shipping, I would just buy it at your local grocery store/drug store and save yourself the shipping fee.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m left with smooth radiant under eye skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Maybelline!!!!&lt;br /&gt;xoxo</li>
            <li>, it sticks too much and won&#x27;t blend well.  </li>
            <li>Very frusterating.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing under the eye, covers darkness and brightens.  </li>
            <li>works so much better than any other under eye concealer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many undereye concealers over the years that it&#x27;s not funny.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perhaps slightly more yellow tinted than I would like, but just barely.  </li>
            <li>apply the product following the directions, then I blend out the line with a clean makeup sponge</li>
            <li>this really covers up dark circles i am glad that have something like this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a larger surface for distribution of product, and really provides good coverage without having to go back in and swipe under your eyes 3 or 4 times in order to get enough product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;it doesn&#x27;t come out of the tube too quickly as long as you follow the directions on the package, the product has no unpleasant or lasting smell, and the application if creamy and blends easily and dries without any greasing or caked on feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is not only reasonably priced but lasts ages, applies easily due to the soft tip and a tube lasts a good while.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup because it covers my dark circles and age spots well</li>
            <li>and I love it ... not willing to give it up!  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin and is slightly tanned right now, but I&#x27;m used to concealers being too dark for my skin.</li>
            <li>Okay, so obviously i was expecting a bit bigger from what i ordered</li>
            <li>but if my dark circles are particularly present that day or I am taking professional photos I use ELF cosmetics mineral foundation in fair.  </li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t found anything perfect for my dark circles, but I would recommend this concealer, especially if your under eye circles aren&#x27;t extremely dark.</li>
            <li>I find so many concealers in that type of packaging and they tend to dry out from forcing air into the bottle, much the same way mascara does.</li>
            <li>All of my red dots, dark spots and circles dissapear quickly and so easily.  </li>
            <li>or (if you really need to lock it down) use a clean concealer brush to gently pat powder under your eye with no tugging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any luck applying my normal powder foundation over it</li>
            <li>Maybelline New York</li>
            <li>(I was surprised!)</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive to anything new.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use, the color matches me well, and the sponge applicator is really gentle on delicate under eye skin.</li>
            <li>certainly I&#x27;d buy it again in the future!</li>
            <li>Maybe be a little to light in color for me</li>
            <li>I actually would not mind to pay a few bucks more if you get the container fixed!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and fuzzy.</li>
            <li>This concealer came today, and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Age Rewinder\\&quot; name is misleading: my twenty year old daughter grabbed it, and it worked as well on her youthfully-perfect skin as on my not-so-youthful skin.</li>
            <li>Completely makes that under eye area and check bones look youthful in photos without photoshop.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t crease for me either and it looks natural, espacialy if you use a damp sponge to blend it in.</li>
            <li>My blush goes on over it with no trouble and my mineral foundation</li>
            <li>I like this product because it covers well and looks natural without caking, but gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the dispensing packaging doesn&#x27;t always work well, or evenly, or let you use all of the product.  </li>
            <li>It creates a good liquid base and blends in smoothly.</li>
            <li>and that is a flawless base for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>texture is good, it doesnt leave  that fake apperence that some makeups do.</li>
            <li>B004Y9GTYE Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind Eraser Dark Circles Treatment Concealer, Light 20, 0.2-fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li>and I can tell this product going to be used up fast due to how much is lost in the sponge versus what makes it on my face.</li>
            <li>The formula covers well, doesn&#x27;t look artificial, and blends incredibly easily with the help of the tiny sponge on top of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes the twist top will last for half of the product and sometimes only a week.</li>
            <li>In fact, I have even used it to smooth out the top of my nose where sometimes my foundation wants to sit in my pores and look like weird little dots.</li>
            <li>Product doesn&#x27;t completely cover some dark spots but does a better job than any other concealer I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough not to clump or bunch (and this 36 year old new mom has eye wrinkles) but covers my pretty heavy dark circles.</li>
            <li>and I usually have to smooth it out once or twice.</li>
            <li>Helps cover my dark circles better than any other make up I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I opened the package and was so disappointed to see that it was nearly identical to Light, but once applying it, I was so pleased to see that the slight color difference in the tube actually made a HUGE difference on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done some \\&quot;blind tests\\&quot; with other concealers in day light, asking my husband to judge which one looks better, and he picked this one every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This does cover up my dark circles pretty decently, although I feel like my concealer stick does just about the same job.</li>
            <li>It seems to last pretty long, too, and with no creasing.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin around my eyes with dark circles and the beginning of fine lines in the outer corners.</li>
            <li>I inherited under eye circles pretty badly, but this as i just recieved and love!</li>
            <li>its a little on the skinny side but its so worth it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Cle De Peau is amazing</li>
            <li>Covers my dark circles pretty well.</li>
            <li>you can barely tell you have applied it.. not  a fan...</li>
            <li>but I was already annoyed because when I first received it it wasn&#x27;t even the right product</li>
            <li>The only thing I would say negatively was that the seller was offering it at a price that is pretty much the same as if you were buying it at the store.</li>
            <li>the texture,it doesn&#x27;t do much to hide the dark circles,I don&#x27;t know how it will work to fade them,but,I need a concealer also, which this is not..</li>
            <li>Just not sure it&#x27;s worth all the hassle.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Dark Circle Eraser many times over the past three years or so.  </li>
            <li>I have age/sun spots, red spots, brown spots, dark under eye circles and large pores on my nose.  </li>
            <li>pretty pale</li>
            <li>I have super dark circles under my eyes due to a variety of factors, including insomnia, toddlers, work and school.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely cover my dark circles but it hides them well enough that I look rested and alive.</li>
            <li>so many people like it (youtube gurus), but it was not great for me, i have a dry skin, and it looks powdery on my.</li>
            <li>This covers my very dark circles really well.</li>
            <li>It is goes on smoothly, requires very little blending and minimizes the appearance of my dark circles.  </li>

            <li> Great cover-up and not drying.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this product to be of great help for minimizing under eye circles, however the concealer (powder I think) never came out of the container.</li>
            <li> It brightens underneath my eyes and works great as a highlighter underneath the brow arch.  </li>
            <li> I use it when I contour it works great.</li>
            <li> A great neutral for peaches and cream complexions.</li>

            <li> This was a great choice for me .</li>
            <li> Great cover up make up  to hide  bruises</li>
            <li> I also use it as a concealer on blemishes, it works great.</li>
            <li> But best of all it gives the right amount of coverage without looking cakey, and the color perfectly matches my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love it, clair matches my skin tone perfectly since i&#x27;m an NC20.</li>
            <li> I just use my fingers to tap it out - and then it looks perfect, without getting into fine lines at all.</li>
            <li> It makes my under eye area so bright and stays long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> fair..</li>
            <li> and I got the fair 110 color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too watery to do any good there for me.  </li>
            <li> This product is a good value.</li>
            <li> The concealer inside the tube is really good.</li>
            <li> I like the applicator and the coverage is good.</li>
            <li> so smooth, blends perfectly, disappears and doesn&#x27;t settle into my lines.</li>
            <li> The color is good, the product when usable is good.  </li>
            <li> use the fair.</li>
            <li> I think this concelear is good....</li>
            <li> I have no idea if it&#x27;s good or not because I didn&#x27;t get to try it out.  </li>
            <li> They could improve on this packaging, but the product is so good, that won&#x27;t keep me from buying and using it.  </li>
            <li> concealer (in FAIR) is a good match for fair people with red/blue undertones and blue/purple circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer, it conceals beautifully, without settling into lines.</li>
            <li> I have one in my purse, makeup kit, car, desk, each medicine chest; it&#x27;s perfect for a quick touch-up.  </li>
            <li> This sponge concealer in fair is amazing.  </li>
            <li> There is a lot of love for this product on YouTube, so I thought I would order one in Fair (not for highlighting, I actually am fair skinned), and it does do the job.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love it for an under-eye highlight!</li>
            <li> i love this concealer!</li>
            <li> magical!  </li>
            <li> Love my product! A+++</li>
            <li> And I would say this is my favorite Concealer!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> It is great for concealing darkness under your eyes and it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It works amazing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Light and airy, yet provides a great coverage.</li>
            <li> *** is amazing in every way.</li>
            <li> This product is not returnable according to Amazon when I clicked on \\&quot;replace\\&quot; - something about hazardous materials.  </li>
            <li> I have a light peaches and cream complexion with medium copper haircolor and light colored eyes and the color is perfect.</li>
            <li> After using up &#x27;Bobby Brown&#x27;s concealer in cream type, I bought this to give it a try because I heard so many good things about</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this!!  </li>
            <li> It goes on so quickly and easily that before I know it I&#x27;ve used it as foundation, though it works perfectly as concealer.  </li>
            <li> I love the easy applicator and the coverage is great.</li>
            <li> This product has good coverage, but feels nice and light on your face.  </li>
            <li> It blends very easily and is buildable.</li>
            <li> very easy to use, but it didnt make any difference in fines lines on the skin.</li>
            <li> I rarely give cosmetic products a five star review, but I would be happy to give this one six stars if I could.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to apply and does the job just as well!</li>
            <li> It comes in many good shades light..</li>
            <li> I love the applicator sponge because it distributes the makeup evenly.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s applied.  </li>
            <li> I love the color.  </li>
            <li> and I find this is often all I need to look more awake and</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite concealer.</li>
            <li> I love the application</li>
            <li> I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> I see now why this concealer gets so much love from reviewers.</li>
            <li> I do love to use this product.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> I would say it covers about 60%, which is okay.</li>
            <li> And I work 13 hour work days :)</li>
            <li> I love it a lot.</li>
            <li> I always end up taking the top off and using a q-tip for the balance of the tube.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li> I love this concealer.</li>
            <li> It could do better at concealing.</li>
            <li> Seems more like a highlighter than concealer.</li>
            <li> love it&lt;</li>
            <li> Love the applicator.  </li>
            <li> I really love this under eye concealer.  </li>
            <li> I like it and will order more.</li>
            <li> I think Maybelline should have done a better job with quality control on this product.</li>
            <li> had I been able to apply the product.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> As someone who has many acne scars (pigmentations) on their face, this s</li>
            <li> This is contrary to how most concealers work but for some reason it happens with this one.</li>
            <li> I really love that it&#x27;s a concealer that isn&#x27;t a wand, like a mascara.</li>
            <li> You can even layer it to get more coverage.</li>
            <li> I do love the product</li>
            <li> but I have bought many products ..</li>
            <li> Beauty guru&#x27;s love this, so I had to try it.</li>
            <li> Love this concealer.</li>
            <li> I have so many imperfections that I just keep rolling it on.  </li>
            <li> I love the application.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t even able to use it.</li>
            <li> I love the spongy brush thing on the tip, it really does apply the concealer very nicely.  </li>
            <li> It does go on great with the sponge applicator and its super for quick touchups.</li>
            <li> It provides decent coverage and is also great for highlighting.</li>
            <li> The makeup applies very smoothly and is easily blended out.</li>
            <li> This one does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s covered perfect, has a very fine structure, easily to remove, very gentle, the eyes look so natural.</li>
            <li> It took a bit to get the liquid up to the foam top, but once it was there, it applied easily.</li>
            <li> The staying power and amazing coverage make it totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Add a light colored shadow over the top to just &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; it so that your mascara or eyeshadow do not &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to it.  </li>
            <li> It went on like a liquid, but when I went to smooth it, it felt more like a powder.</li>
            <li> It really is quite good.</li>
            <li> I like to use it to touch up because it&#x27;s not very heavy and still looks great when you reapply during the day.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t crease and is easily removed at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Blends easily,</li>
            <li> It does apply easily and blend well.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t go on too strongly, making you look as if you are wearing a couple of crescents of beige paint under your eyes.</li>
            <li> My favorite under eye concealer so far :) Love it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t settle into any fine lines and doesn&#x27;t need a setting powder.</li>
            <li> It covered well and didn&#x27;t settle into the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> but this goes on easy and smooth...</li>
            <li> Pay less than $8.00 for this excellent product, or pay $45 for Touche eclat.  </li>
            <li> I try everything and enjoy the simplicity of the applicatior with this concealer.</li>
            <li> I cannot vouch for reducing puffiness because I do not have that problem, fortunately.</li>
            <li> Great concealer, especially for on the go.  </li>
            <li> It seems to smooth out effortlessly -</li>
            <li> It has a light sheen to it</li>
            <li> Anyway,  this maybelline sponge concealer is perfect for my everyday polished routine.  </li>
            <li> It almost seems like a light foundation consistency rather than a concealer.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, drugstore is cheap, and this is what you receive with cheap products.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic as an all over foundation or spot concealer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and goes on your skin evenly.</li>
            <li> The concealer itself is nice -- light, covers well, doesn&#x27;t dissipate much over the course of a day.</li>
            <li> A great, very lightweight yet high coverage concealer.</li>
            <li> The applicator makes it really easy to quickly sweep and cover under your eyes.</li>
            <li> Perfect and quick for my everyday look</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> it makes me look so .. fresh!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the sponge on this thing just breeds germs and nastiness.</li>
            <li> Also excellent for small blemish cover ups.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to get and try this product.  </li>
            <li> You have to prime the sponge when you first get it by twisting the top until you start to see product appear on the sponge.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived pretty quickly, even though the size is smaller than I thought it would be, this is a very good product.  </li>
            <li> I read so many good reviews on various sites, I decided to give it a try because it&#x27;s pretty cheap.  </li>
            <li> use  fair ,she uses light because it has a bit of yellow .</li>
            <li> The fair shade matches my pale redhead skin beautifully, and it blends seamlessly!  </li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and blends very evenly.</li>
            <li> I wonder how much Yahoo got paid to list this as the best dark circle cover.  </li>
            <li> It is true to color and stays put all day.</li>
            <li> It was just a hint too yellow for my skin, so I ordered Fair from here.</li>
            <li> Way better than lots of high end makeup!</li>
            <li> It makes you look a whole lot more than $10 better, and comes in enough shades that many of us can share in this not just for the wrinkled treat.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this at Target, and they didn&#x27;t have Fair left, so I instead got Light.</li>
            <li> It does have a mild tightening effect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> I obviously have fair skin so this is the right tone for me.  </li>
            <li> This is great for dark circles.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of lightening any dark areas that you may have.  </li>
            <li> so great for brightening and shine but not for coverage of dark circles...</li>
            <li> Not the best for staying power, but I set it with powder, and it lasts long enough for me.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and does a nice job if you are careful to use it sparingly . . .</li>
            <li> They were quick to send me the right product but when it arrived it broke</li>
            <li> I am very fair with red/blue undertones, it&#x27;s flu season and have two toddlers so undereyes are especially dark</li>
            <li> Instant Age Rewind concealer is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple brands (from Mary Kay to Smashbox to Covergirl) and this stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This magic wand is perfect for covering dark spots or even dark circles.</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;d still say this concealer is worth.</li>
            <li> Is it worth it?  </li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve only used this under my eyes and around my nose to combat redness and am really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Blends well, however need to fresh it if going out at night.</li>
            <li> I tap it in lightly right below lower lashes with my ring finger</li>
            <li> every word was right about this concealer.</li>
            <li> I have two toddlers and a newborn and it perfectly covers my dark circles from not enough sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it does not &amp;#34;erase&amp;#34; my dark under eye circles, I&#x27;ve tried much better concealers than this that give much better coverage.</li>
            <li> My sister is dark haired but fair skinned</li>
            <li> It is so soft and the liquid comes through in just the right amount to easily blend in a circular motion.  </li>
            <li> The soft sponge applicator easily and evenly applies the concealer.</li>
            <li> I received this order very fast with no problems.</li>
            <li> I also have a baby on my hands, so my makeup routine has to be very, very streamlined.  </li>
            <li> Compact enough for purse - very nice overall.</li>
            <li> We both use these products daily or more than 1xy day if going out in evenings .</li>
            <li> It provides great cover without being too thick.</li>
            <li> It REALLY is like an eraser!</li>
            <li> and I expect the coloring to be an exact match in winter.</li>
            <li> i mostly use department store cosmetics such as Lancome and Chanel ...</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon !</li>
            <li> My skin actually feels better after using this.  </li>
            <li> I have seen countless YouTube &amp;#34;beauty gurus&amp;#34; using this product for their under-eye concealer and even as a highlighter on other parts of their face, and the finish always looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the color is nice and neutral - I am super pale and don&#x27;t need orangey correction on my complexion because then it just looks like I have orangey junk under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have age spots under my eyes, just below my dark circles (make sure to wear your sunscreen people!).  </li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on under eye concealers and for just $6.00 this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> The best use for me is to put it on top of my base foundation and use it as a highlighter.  </li>
            <li> Other concealers are a little bit drying, and since i already have dry-ish skin this is perfect.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it claims and is so much better than than Touche eclat - which tends to look dry and powdery and DOES settle into lines.  </li>
            <li> On a positive note, it does brighten the area.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much for going the extra mile to satisfied me as a customer.</li>
            <li> I just lightly buff over it with a bit of bare essentials powder foundation to set it.</li>
            <li> It kind of works to help with my dark circles, but is not the &#x27;miracle&#x27; product I was thinking it would be.</li>
            <li> This one covers my dark circles kind of.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used tons of drug store concealers and some high end ones (most recently Cle De Peau)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to try this, get it locally so you can easily return it if it&#x27;s a dud.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t cover them completely but it does a decent job and just as good as any other concealer I have tried.  </li>
            <li> light is for us white.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> /&gt;Interestingly, it looks MUCH darker in the tube than on skin, so I recommend looking around for images of someone close to your skin color using it before buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased!&lt;br</li>
            <li> too much</li>
            <li> I work it into my under eyes and lids then blend it gently with my ring finger.  </li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> I still really like it</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is really an &amp;#34;age rewinder&amp;#34; but it does work as a cover stick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent more money than I care to admit.  </li>
            <li> how much I turn it.  </li>
            <li> a also tap some on the whole area below my eyes.</li>
            <li> Reduces wrinkles very well</li>
            <li> I expected this to be a full-coverage concealer, however, it is much more transcent.  </li>
            <li> This is very light,not the color</li>
            <li> I really like the applicator on this.  </li>
            <li> I found the Maybelline concealer to cover just as much</li>
            <li> , so why pay the high price?!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s REALLY good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So unless you&#x27;re getting free shipping, I would just buy it at your local grocery store/drug store and save yourself the shipping fee.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m left with smooth radiant under eye skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Maybelline!!!!&lt;br /&gt;xoxo</li>
            <li> , it sticks too much and won&#x27;t blend well.  </li>
            <li> Very frusterating.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing under the eye, covers darkness and brightens.  </li>
            <li> works so much better than any other under eye concealer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many undereye concealers over the years that it&#x27;s not funny.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perhaps slightly more yellow tinted than I would like, but just barely.  </li>
            <li> apply the product following the directions, then I blend out the line with a clean makeup sponge</li>
            <li> this really covers up dark circles i am glad that have something like this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a larger surface for distribution of product, and really provides good coverage without having to go back in and swipe under your eyes 3 or 4 times in order to get enough product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t come out of the tube too quickly as long as you follow the directions on the package, the product has no unpleasant or lasting smell, and the application if creamy and blends easily and dries without any greasing or caked on feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is not only reasonably priced but lasts ages, applies easily due to the soft tip and a tube lasts a good while.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup because it covers my dark circles and age spots well</li>
            <li> and I love it ... not willing to give it up!  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin and is slightly tanned right now, but I&#x27;m used to concealers being too dark for my skin.</li>
            <li> Okay, so obviously i was expecting a bit bigger from what i ordered</li>
            <li> but if my dark circles are particularly present that day or I am taking professional photos I use ELF cosmetics mineral foundation in fair.  </li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t found anything perfect for my dark circles, but I would recommend this concealer, especially if your under eye circles aren&#x27;t extremely dark.</li>
            <li> I find so many concealers in that type of packaging and they tend to dry out from forcing air into the bottle, much the same way mascara does.</li>
            <li> All of my red dots, dark spots and circles dissapear quickly and so easily.  </li>
            <li> or (if you really need to lock it down) use a clean concealer brush to gently pat powder under your eye with no tugging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any luck applying my normal powder foundation over it</li>
            <li> Maybelline New York</li>
            <li> (I was surprised!)</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive to anything new.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use, the color matches me well, and the sponge applicator is really gentle on delicate under eye skin.</li>
            <li> certainly I&#x27;d buy it again in the future!</li>
            <li> Maybe be a little to light in color for me</li>
            <li> I actually would not mind to pay a few bucks more if you get the container fixed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and fuzzy.</li>
            <li> This concealer came today, and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Age Rewinder\\&quot; name is misleading: my twenty year old daughter grabbed it, and it worked as well on her youthfully-perfect skin as on my not-so-youthful skin.</li>
            <li> Completely makes that under eye area and check bones look youthful in photos without photoshop.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t crease for me either and it looks natural, espacialy if you use a damp sponge to blend it in.</li>
            <li> My blush goes on over it with no trouble and my mineral foundation</li>
            <li> I like this product because it covers well and looks natural without caking, but gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the dispensing packaging doesn&#x27;t always work well, or evenly, or let you use all of the product.  </li>
            <li> It creates a good liquid base and blends in smoothly.</li>
            <li> and that is a flawless base for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> texture is good, it doesnt leave  that fake apperence that some makeups do.</li>
            <li> B004Y9GTYE Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind Eraser Dark Circles Treatment Concealer, Light 20, 0.2-fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li> and I can tell this product going to be used up fast due to how much is lost in the sponge versus what makes it on my face.</li>
            <li> The formula covers well, doesn&#x27;t look artificial, and blends incredibly easily with the help of the tiny sponge on top of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes the twist top will last for half of the product and sometimes only a week.</li>
            <li> In fact, I have even used it to smooth out the top of my nose where sometimes my foundation wants to sit in my pores and look like weird little dots.</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t completely cover some dark spots but does a better job than any other concealer I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough not to clump or bunch (and this 36 year old new mom has eye wrinkles) but covers my pretty heavy dark circles.</li>
            <li> and I usually have to smooth it out once or twice.</li>
            <li> Helps cover my dark circles better than any other make up I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I opened the package and was so disappointed to see that it was nearly identical to Light, but once applying it, I was so pleased to see that the slight color difference in the tube actually made a HUGE difference on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done some \\&quot;blind tests\\&quot; with other concealers in day light, asking my husband to judge which one looks better, and he picked this one every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This does cover up my dark circles pretty decently, although I feel like my concealer stick does just about the same job.</li>
            <li> It seems to last pretty long, too, and with no creasing.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin around my eyes with dark circles and the beginning of fine lines in the outer corners.</li>
            <li> I inherited under eye circles pretty badly, but this as i just recieved and love!</li>
            <li> its a little on the skinny side but its so worth it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Cle De Peau is amazing</li>
            <li> Covers my dark circles pretty well.</li>
            <li> you can barely tell you have applied it.. not  a fan...</li>
            <li> but I was already annoyed because when I first received it it wasn&#x27;t even the right product</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say negatively was that the seller was offering it at a price that is pretty much the same as if you were buying it at the store.</li>
            <li> the texture,it doesn&#x27;t do much to hide the dark circles,I don&#x27;t know how it will work to fade them,but,I need a concealer also, which this is not..</li>
            <li> Just not sure it&#x27;s worth all the hassle.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Dark Circle Eraser many times over the past three years or so.  </li>
            <li> I have age/sun spots, red spots, brown spots, dark under eye circles and large pores on my nose.  </li>
            <li> pretty pale</li>
            <li> I have super dark circles under my eyes due to a variety of factors, including insomnia, toddlers, work and school.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely cover my dark circles but it hides them well enough that I look rested and alive.</li>
            <li> so many people like it (youtube gurus), but it was not great for me, i have a dry skin, and it looks powdery on my.</li>
            <li> This covers my very dark circles really well.</li>
            <li> It is goes on smoothly, requires very little blending and minimizes the appearance of my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I always have high hopes for every concealer I buy for some odd reason.  </li>
            <li> not easy to apply...too much hassle for me</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything as far a the &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; aspect goes; my dark circles look the same when I take my makeup off a the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The main difference I see between them is that the Age Rewind doesn&#x27;t feel as heavy on my skin, like my concealer stick does.  </li>
            <li> A dab of this - a very small amount - will fix that right up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great base of blemishes on the face or covering spider veins but it barely touches the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I wrangled with this for a long time before I realized that the only way to get the concealer to the spongy tip was to shake the bottle as if there were no tomorrow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is thin, but provides medium to full coverage.</li>
            <li> The product does last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Major pro is that it can be \\&quot;rebuilt\\&quot; half way through the day by dabbing off any extra oils around the eye and reapplying.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve spent as much as $38 for a tiny amount of under eye concealer.  </li>
            <li> The applicator sponge is a bit large, making it hard to apply the concealer.  </li>
            <li> my Nars concealer last longer, since sometimes I only conceal under my eyes and have to do so 2x a day due to workouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now it has NOT completely erased them,  but it does lesson the look of them quite a bit</li>
            <li> This was a tiny bit lighter than I expected.</li>
            <li> Definitely not completely.  </li>
            <li> For buying a product online, and for the price, Im not surprised.</li>
            <li> Not too yellow or pink.</li>
            <li> The other problem is the 2nd of of these that I ordered - the stuff isn&#x27;t coming out no matter</li>
            <li> I did read other reviews on different sites and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be an isolated problem.</li>
            <li> Only problem is that you can see some of the product is left behind on this new sistem...</li>
            <li> I will not live without this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what I&#x27;ve spent on probably a couple dozen different brands over last few years.  </li>
            <li> No 7 Translucent loose powder</li>
            <li> Another thing, do not set it with loose powder.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve purchased a loose powder to try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a loose powder to use when I want to use this as a foundation.  </li>
            <li> I would only recommend to people with slight undereye darkness.</li>
            <li> But the only cons is that it smears a little.</li>
            <li> I have really bad purple under eye circles and this product conceals it better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this concealer because I have moderate  to dark  circles under my eyes, I&#x27;m fair/light skinned and my dark circles are a&lt;br /&gt;bluish purple/maroon color, so they do stand out.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the initial turning of the knob to get the product out..</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of trouble finding a concealer that actually hides them.</li>
            <li> But I saw immediate lightening in the darkness under and in the inner corners my eyes after useing it just a few times.</li>
            <li> I also hate that, with the mascara-style ones, you have to keep going back to get more product because one dip is almost never enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that the direction arrows (you have to twist the top to bring the makeup into the spone application) are very difficult to see!</li>

            <li> I have tried a lot of under eye concealers including some pretty expensive brands.  </li>

            <li> I won&#x27;t buy this again - too bad because the product itself does a nice job of covering the under-eye area - but the container sucks and you can&#x27;t get it out -</li>

            <li> Then I take a black sharpie and draw the arrow</li>

            <li> and I am not even half way through the container yet.</li>
            <li> Provides little coverage for dark circles.</li>
            <li> The sponge &amp;#34;applicator&amp;#34; is a horrid mess of bacteria, though.</li>
            <li> I put it on in a heavy upside down triangle, pat in and blend out the edges.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Maybelline Dark Circles Treatment caused my sensitive eyes to burn.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a little disconcerting in itself.  </li>
            <li> I use it for everyday and on the weekends.</li>
            <li> I had to wash it off just a few minutes after applying it.  </li>
            <li> w/no trouble.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I ordered in it the lightest shade, as I&#x27;m slightly pale but wanted an under-eye highlight.</li>
            <li> and I see the MOST AWFUL under-eye circles, I&#x27;m talking raccoon eyes people.</li>
            <li> It works no better than others</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale, but the shade works for me.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use a really thick concealer for those.</li>
            <li> and I mean TOTALLY, blew out all of my power, I mean, even the lightbulb in my refrigerator burnt out, WTF</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least.  </li>
            <li> I really wasted my money on this junk!!  </li>
            <li> It covers well under my eyes and it&#x27;s not super expensive.</li>
            <li> I have horrible dark circles that nothing seems to cover completely.  </li>
            <li> Using a sponge applicator is never good.</li>
            <li> though the applicator stinks, I do recommend using this for dark circles.</li>
            <li> It goes on thin, yet has a lot of coverage.</li>
            <li> Overall I was very disappointed and threw the product away.</li>
            <li> that* expensive but</li>
            <li> But that may be just my weird self.</li>
            <li> I have used some expensive products over the years that have not worked at all.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> cheep to expensive not all work...</li>
            <li> the packaging was kinda weird, but nothing is wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Gives my Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer a run for its money, and that is expensive!</li>
            <li> Very frustrating!</li>
            <li> There is something very wrong with the applicator.    </li>
            <li> Disappointed, Maybelline...</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> But for under $7 I&#x27;ve found that this Maybelline product blows the expensive stuff outta the water!!</li>
            <li> I will say that It is annoying because it will crease in my under eyes</li>
            <li> the applicator is TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even see how awful my complexion is</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have really bad purple under eye circles and this product conceals it better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m a believer!  I love the applicator sponge because it distributes the makeup evenly.</li>
            <li> I do like this sponge application product for under eye dark circles. It comes in many good shades light..fair..&lt;br /&gt;Medium ..tan. light is for us white.,very fair skin color people. My sister is dark haired but fair skinned and I am blond.&lt;br /&gt;I use  fair ,she uses light because it has a bit of yellow . We both use these products daily or more than 1xy day if going out in evenings . It has lasted over 6 months. And the coverage is excellent. I try everything and enjoy the simplicity of the applicatior with this concealer.</li>
            <li> I got this to save on more expensive foundation and concealers I use. This covers my very dark circles really well. I cannot vouch for reducing puffiness because I do not have that problem, fortunately. The applicator makes it really easy to quickly sweep and cover under your eyes. It&#x27;s soft and fuzzy. Love this product.</li>
            <li> This concealer came today, and I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered in it the lightest shade, as I&#x27;m slightly pale but wanted an under-eye highlight. The makeup applies very smoothly and is easily blended out. It doesn&#x27;t settle into any fine lines and doesn&#x27;t need a setting powder. The only thing that I&#x27;m a bit dissatisfied with is the size. I know that it wasn&#x27;t *that* expensive but c&#x27;mon. It&#x27;s about as big as my pointer finger, maybe smaller. All in all, I&#x27;d still say this concealer is worth.</li>
            <li> This concealer is the bomb.  The fair shade matches my pale redhead skin beautifully, and it blends seamlessly!  It&#x27;s perhaps slightly more yellow tinted than I would like, but just barely.  The staying power and amazing coverage make it totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is FANTASTIC! I have two toddlers and a newborn and it perfectly covers my dark circles from not enough sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty pale and I got the fair 110 color and it is perfect. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t erase my dark circles-not even close</li>
            <li> I really like this product-- it&#x27;s easy to use, the color matches me well, and the sponge applicator is really gentle on delicate under eye skin. It does a great job of erasing my undereye circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, it looks MUCH darker in the tube than on skin, so I recommend looking around for images of someone close to your skin color using it before buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with it is that sometimes it comes out looking a bit cakey/powdery and I haven&#x27;t yet figured out why.</li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s applied.  I love the color.  It&#x27;s a great base of blemishes on the face or covering spider veins but it barely touches the dark circles under my eyes.  It&#x27;s just too watery to do any good there for me.  I do have excessively dark circles though.  I usually have to use a really thick concealer for those.</li>
            <li> I purchased this concealer because I have moderate  to dark  circles under my eyes, I&#x27;m fair/light skinned and my dark circles are a&lt;br /&gt;bluish purple/maroon color, so they do stand out.  I purchased this product to see if I could lessen the appearance of my circles and it has done just that! Now it has NOT completely erased them,  but it does lesson the look of them quite a bit and I am very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t come out of the tube too quickly as long as you follow the directions on the package, the product has no unpleasant or lasting smell, and the application if creamy and blends easily and dries without any greasing or caked on feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I apply the product following the directions, then I blend out the line with a clean makeup sponge and I find this is often all I need to look more awake and well rested- certainly I&#x27;d buy it again in the future!</li>
            <li> This product is great!  Goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t crease and is easily removed at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I will not live without this stuff.  I have one in my purse, makeup kit, car, desk, each medicine chest; it&#x27;s perfect for a quick touch-up.  Add a light colored shadow over the top to just &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; it so that your mascara or eyeshadow do not &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to it.  It is great for an all-over foundation in a pinch, and GREAT as a blemish coverup.  Keep making this, Maybelline!!!  It is ALMOST ALWAYS sold out at every Walmart I go to in every town I visit!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! best concealer it makes me look so .. fresh!</li>
            <li> Great concealer, especially for on the go.  Love it for an under-eye highlight!</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite concealer. It works amazing. I love the application</li>
            <li> I rarely give cosmetic products a five star review, but I would be happy to give this one six stars if I could. That&#x27;s because the [[ASIN:B004Y9GTYE Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind Eraser Dark Circles Treatment Concealer, Light 20, 0.2-fluid Ounce]] works so much better than any other under eye concealer I have tried, including those from department stores which cost a ton of money.  The formula covers well, doesn&#x27;t look artificial, and blends incredibly easily with the help of the tiny sponge on top of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concealer itself is great - it covers well, hiding evidence of a sleepless night with ease. But it doesn&#x27;t go on too strongly, making you look as if you are wearing a couple of crescents of beige paint under your eyes. The \\&quot;Age Rewinder\\&quot; name is misleading: my twenty year old daughter grabbed it, and it worked as well on her youthfully-perfect skin as on my not-so-youthful skin. She is the one who recommended the product, saying all of her friends use it and \\&quot;it makes everyone look terrific.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At less than $10, this is a bargain compared to all but the cheapest bottom-of-the-barrel cosmetics. It makes you look a whole lot more than $10 better, and comes in enough shades that many of us can share in this not just for the wrinkled treat.</li>
            <li> not easy to apply...too much hassle for me</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this!!  It conceals and highlights.  Use it every day.</li>
            <li> One word: AMAZING!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is a good value. It is easy to use and does a nice job if you are careful to use it sparingly . . . too much and it can look chalky.</li>
            <li> It took a bit to get the liquid up to the foam top, but once it was there, it applied easily. It went on like a liquid, but when I went to smooth it, it felt more like a powder. It covered well and didn&#x27;t settle into the fine lines around my eyes. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind concealer is amazing. It provides great cover without being too thick. I use it to cover up dark circles and blemishes under my mineral powder. It creates a good liquid base and blends in smoothly. I plan to buy more. Hope they continue to make this one!</li>
            <li> I wrangled with this for a long time before I realized that the only way to get the concealer to the spongy tip was to shake the bottle as if there were no tomorrow. That&#x27;s a pain in the keester. Maybe the bottle I got was defective. The concealer itself is nice -- light, covers well, doesn&#x27;t dissipate much over the course of a day.Just not sure it&#x27;s worth all the hassle.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer, it conceals beautifully, without settling into lines. Not the best for staying power, but I set it with powder, and it lasts long enough for me.</li>
            <li> I see now why this concealer gets so much love from reviewers. It really is quite good. It seems to smooth out effortlessly - I just use my fingers to tap it out - and then it looks perfect, without getting into fine lines at all. In fact, I have even used it to smooth out the top of my nose where sometimes my foundation wants to sit in my pores and look like weird little dots. A dab of this - a very small amount - will fix that right up. Oh, and the color is nice and neutral - I am super pale and don&#x27;t need orangey correction on my complexion because then it just looks like I have orangey junk under my eyes. This corrector doesn&#x27;t do that!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin around my eyes with dark circles and the beginning of fine lines in the outer corners. I&#x27;ve tried multiple brands (from Mary Kay to Smashbox to Covergirl) and this stuff is AMAZING. The soft sponge applicator easily and evenly applies the concealer. I don&#x27;t even have to blend with my fingertips after. But best of all it gives the right amount of coverage without looking cakey, and the color perfectly matches my skin tone. It REALLY is like an eraser! I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> This sponge concealer in fair is amazing.  I obviously have fair skin so this is the right tone for me.  I work it into my under eyes and lids then blend it gently with my ring finger.  Dust it with Boots No 7 Translucent loose powder and that is a flawless base for eyeshadow. Perfect and quick for my everyday look but if my dark circles are particularly present that day or I am taking professional photos I use ELF cosmetics mineral foundation in fair.  It has a light sheen to it so I tap just a small amount of that on a long blending eyeshadow brush and dust it where the darkness is and blend it over the bone that runs under your eye.  Completely makes that under eye area and check bones look youthful in photos without photoshop.  The ELF Concealer funnily enough doesn&#x27;t have any sheen to it, totally matte and doesn&#x27;t work to conceal but that Fari foundation does.  Bought one of those pots of it and have had it for 3 years now.  Anyway,  this maybelline sponge concealer is perfect for my everyday polished routine.  No oil so it works great as an eyeshadow base and won&#x27;t make your liner slip, great coverage if you have the occasional small blemish as well.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for going the extra mile to satisfied me as a customer. I really like the product. The product work well.</li>
            <li> I do love to use this product. There are 2 others I alternate as well but this goes on easy and smooth... My only complaint is the initial turning of the knob to get the product out.. Takes awhile.. pay attention or you end up with a lot of product on your hands ( like me). Blends easily,</li>
            <li> This was a tiny bit lighter than I expected. I have fair skin and is slightly tanned right now, but I&#x27;m used to concealers being too dark for my skin. so this was a bit of a surprise. I still really like it and I expect the coloring to be an exact match in winter. I love the spongy brush thing on the tip, it really does apply the concealer very nicely.  This does cover up my dark circles pretty decently, although I feel like my concealer stick does just about the same job. The main difference I see between them is that the Age Rewind doesn&#x27;t feel as heavy on my skin, like my concealer stick does.  I will likely purchase this again in the future.</li>
            <li> It kind of works to help with my dark circles, but is not the &#x27;miracle&#x27; product I was thinking it would be. Mine are still visible after an application. I&#x27;m giving the benefit of the doubt because I have really dark circles. I will say that It is annoying because it will crease in my under eyes and I usually have to smooth it out once or twice.</li>
            <li> Covers my dark circles pretty well. I have had a lot of trouble finding a concealer that actually hides them. This one does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer. It covers up sooooo well!!</li>
            <li> Helps cover my dark circles better than any other make up I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have super dark circles under my eyes due to a variety of factors, including insomnia, toddlers, work and school.  I have tried a lot of under eye concealers including some pretty expensive brands.  I happened to buy this last week on a whim and I am so glad I did.  It is goes on smoothly, requires very little blending and minimizes the appearance of my dark circles.  I am so happy with the results.  I can&#x27;t believe how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is great for dark circles. I use it all the time. It blends beautifully! The only issue I have is that the direction arrows (you have to twist the top to bring the makeup into the spone application) are very difficult to see! I can&#x27;t see them, even with my glasses on! I put it under a magnifying glass. Then I take a black sharpie and draw the arrow so it&#x27;s easier to see.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the sponge on this thing just breeds germs and nastiness. Haha. But that may be just my weird self. It does apply easily and blend well. I use it as a highlighter.</li>
            <li> Provides little coverage for dark circles. I would say it covers about 60%, which is okay. I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple years. It does a great job. I don&#x27;t know if it is really an &amp;#34;age rewinder&amp;#34; but it does work as a cover stick.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. Only one line needed to be applied, and it lasts ALL DAY. And I work 13 hour work days :)</li>
            <li> The concealer left powder on some area, not smooth very well. And I don&#x27;t like its sponge head design, it feels very unclean after times of uses, and it is unable to wash.</li>
            <li> The concealer inside the tube is really good. I love it a lot. It provides decent coverage and is also great for highlighting. I like to use it to touch up because it&#x27;s not very heavy and still looks great when you reapply during the day. However, I have purchased this product a few times and every single time the packaging breaks. Sometimes the twist top will last for half of the product and sometimes only a week. I always end up taking the top off and using a q-tip for the balance of the tube. Very frustrating! I will give the concealer 5 stars, package 0.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline, please fix! I actually would not mind to pay a few bucks more if you get the container fixed!</li>
            <li> This is a great drugstore concealer. It covers well under my eyes and it&#x27;s not super expensive.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just ok.  I&#x27;ve tried so many undereye concealers over the years that it&#x27;s not funny.  I&#x27;ve spent more money than I care to admit.  I read so many good reviews on various sites, I decided to give it a try because it&#x27;s pretty cheap.  It&#x27;s just ok.  I always have high hopes for every concealer I buy for some odd reason.  This one covers my dark circles kind of.  Definitely not completely.  Is it worth it?  Maybe for those that don&#x27;t have severe issues with their undereyes.  On a positive note, it does brighten the area.  So, you can tell a difference.  That&#x27;s just not enough for me.  I would only recommend to people with slight undereye darkness.</li>
            <li> The sponge is too big for one&#x27;s under-eye area.  Just how big does Maybelline think the space under someone&#x27;s eye is?  The other problem is the 2nd of of these that I ordered - the stuff isn&#x27;t coming out no matter how much I turn it.  I won&#x27;t buy this again - too bad because the product itself does a nice job of covering the under-eye area - but the container sucks and you can&#x27;t get it out - so no point in ordering it!</li>
            <li> I use this every day to cover up the dark circles. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up, so I&#x27;m happy it blends so well into my skin. I received this order very fast with no problems.</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t completely cover some dark spots but does a better job than any other concealer I&#x27;ve tried. Definitely recommend, especially at this price.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve spent as much as $38 for a tiny amount of under eye concealer.  I can&#x27;t imagine what I&#x27;ve spent on probably a couple dozen different brands over last few years.  But for under $7 I&#x27;ve found that this Maybelline product blows the expensive stuff outta the water!! You only have to dab on a tiny bit with sponge applicator.  I tap it in lightly right below lower lashes with my ring finger a also tap some on the whole area below my eyes. I&#x27;m 66, and I swear it takes 10 years off my age! It doesn&#x27;t settle into creases and lasts all day. I just lightly buff over it with a bit of bare essentials powder foundation to set it. My search for the perfect concealer is over!!</li>
            <li> I like the applicator and the coverage is good. It was hard as h3ll to open, though. I could break into King Tut&#x27;s tomb faster than getting this open.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer. It&#x27;s light enough not to clump or bunch (and this 36 year old new mom has eye wrinkles) but covers my pretty heavy dark circles. It is true to color and stays put all day. I have used some expensive products over the years that have not worked at all. This is not only reasonably priced but lasts ages, applies easily due to the soft tip and a tube lasts a good while.</li>
            <li> It could do better at concealing. Seems more like a highlighter than concealer. For buying a product online, and for the price, Im not surprised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alright product.</li>
            <li> gooooood&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello&lt;br /&gt;He makes beautiful makeup and&lt;br /&gt;No dark circles of the eyes&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and non-sticky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;goood</li>
            <li> I have age spots under my eyes, just below my dark circles (make sure to wear your sunscreen people!).  I also have a baby on my hands, so my makeup routine has to be very, very streamlined.  I love this makeup because it covers my dark circles and age spots well and it is a breeze to apply.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this stuff again.</li>
            <li> it does not &amp;#34;erase&amp;#34; my dark under eye circles, I&#x27;ve tried much better concealers than this that give much better coverage. Disappointed, Maybelline...</li>
            <li> Love the applicator.  Wish they had a pale yellow shade for correction.</li>
            <li> Great cover-up and not drying.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is me but these used to work well but as they evolve, it seems like they put less and less product in the container ???l</li>
            <li> i love this concealer! it brighens and conceals in 1 step! it doesn&#x27;t crease for me either and it looks natural, espacialy if you use a damp sponge to blend it in. i recomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Reduces wrinkles very well</li>
            <li> Really impressed with this under eye concealer. I dab it on under my eyes and blend with a damp beauty blender. Gives my Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer a run for its money, and that is expensive! I actually got this concealer to make my Nars concealer last longer, since sometimes I only conceal under my eyes and have to do so 2x a day due to workouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve only used this under my eyes and around my nose to combat redness and am really happy with it. Still using Nars for face spots.</li>
            <li> magical!  so smooth, blends perfectly, disappears and doesn&#x27;t settle into my lines. It does exactly what it claims and is so much better than than Touche eclat - which tends to look dry and powdery and DOES settle into lines.  Pay less than $8.00 for this excellent product, or pay $45 for Touche eclat.  Your decision.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this product to be of great help for minimizing under eye circles, however the concealer (powder I think) never came out of the container. I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really love this under eye concealer.  It brightens underneath my eyes and works great as a highlighter underneath the brow arch.  Also excellent for small blemish cover ups.  Light and airy, yet provides a great coverage.</li>
            <li> It is great for concealing darkness under your eyes and it is easy to use.  I like it and will order more.</li>
            <li> Love my product! A+++</li>
            <li> There is something very wrong with the applicator.    I followed directions religiously, twisting it for what seemed like hours.  Finally I got it to put the concealer on the sponge applicator.  THANK GOD.  Then when I wanted to use it again - nothing came out.  The color is good, the product when usable is good.  The applicator needs to be sent back to the drawing board.   I have a container  I&#x27;ll have to figure out how to break and then dig into with a swab to use.  Is that a quality product?  Not in my book.</li>
            <li> I love it, clair matches my skin tone perfectly since i&#x27;m an NC20. Dries matte and covers effortly. Will definitely be buying again when i run out!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get and try this product.  I opened it up and tried to get the fluid to come through the applicator.  Others said it took them awhile.  I tried for a 1/2 hour and the delivery system just didn&#x27;t work. I tried it again at another time and again at another time.  I had my husband try.  I had my neighbor try.  No luck.  It was a dud.  I think Maybelline should have done a better job with quality control on this product. This product is not returnable according to Amazon when I clicked on \\&quot;replace\\&quot; - something about hazardous materials.  That&#x27;s a little disconcerting in itself.  Very disappointing.  I have no idea if it would have worked had I been able to apply the product.  If you&#x27;re going to try this, get it locally so you can easily return it if it&#x27;s a dud.  I did read other reviews on different sites and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be an isolated problem.</li>
            <li> I expected this to be a full-coverage concealer, however, it is much more transcent.  It almost seems like a light foundation consistency rather than a concealer.  It does go on great with the sponge applicator and its super for quick touchups.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good with this price.</li>
            <li> This is very light,not the color the texture,it doesn&#x27;t do much to hide the dark circles,I don&#x27;t know how it will work to fade them,but,I need a concealer also, which this is not..you can barely tell you have applied it.. not  a fan...</li>
            <li> I really like the applicator on this.  Using fingers to apply makeup can deposit extra oil and cause wrinkles - I use the applicator and don&#x27;t need to resort to my fingers</li>
            <li> I have purchased this Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Dark Circle Eraser many times over the past three years or so.  I have horrible dark circles that nothing seems to cover completely.  This product doesn&#x27;t cover them completely but it does a decent job and just as good as any other concealer I have tried.  You have to prime the sponge when you first get it by twisting the top until you start to see product appear on the sponge.  To apply you can either swipe it across your dark circles or pat it on them.  It does a great job of lightening any dark areas that you may have.  This is one of my staples and I use it every time I apply makeup.  The product does last a very long time.  I purchased this last one six months ago and I am not even half way through the container yet.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. I&#x27;ve used both the highlighting one and the concealing one. I love it!!! I use it when I contour it works great.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of love for this product on YouTube, so I thought I would order one in Fair (not for highlighting, I actually am fair skinned), and it does do the job. It doesn&#x27;t completely cover my dark circles but it hides them well enough that I look rested and alive. It seems to last pretty long, too, and with no creasing. So far I haven&#x27;t found anything perfect for my dark circles, but I would recommend this concealer, especially if your under eye circles aren&#x27;t extremely dark.</li>
            <li> As someone who has many acne scars (pigmentations) on their face, this s*** is amazing in every way. I know a lot of people don&#x27;t prefer the sponge applicator tip.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least.  I actually like it.  It makes application a breeze. I use the applicator tip to smear the concealer all over my face (not just under eyes like intended), and then I use a stippling brush to blend.</li>
            <li> i mostly use department store cosmetics such as Lancome and Chanel ... however, a friend talked me into trying this concealer and I love it ... not willing to give it up!  It is so easy to apply and does the job just as well!</li>
            <li> This product has good coverage, but feels nice and light on your face.  Compact enough for purse - very nice overall.</li>
            <li> This is the best, cheapest concealer I have ever used. I am always going back to it. I use it for everyday and on the weekends. I try everything and this is one of my go to products.&lt;br /&gt;I use the fair. I have a light peaches and cream complexion with medium copper haircolor and light colored eyes and the color is perfect. Not too yellow or pink. A great neutral for peaches and cream complexions.</li>
            <li> The product arrived pretty quickly, even though the size is smaller than I thought it would be, this is a very good product.  The best use for me is to put it on top of my base foundation and use it as a highlighter.  It goes on very smooth and blends very evenly. It does not completely cover dark circles, but it does lighten up the undereye very well. All in all it was a great value!!</li>
            <li> Well, this was quite a surprise. I&#x27;m an under eye concealer junkie because I have dark, dark, DARK circles under my eyes. I am very fair with red/blue undertones, it&#x27;s flu season and have two toddlers so undereyes are especially dark lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used tons of drug store concealers and some high end ones (most recently Cle De Peau) and this one has become my holy grail. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Cle De Peau is amazing but it&#x27;s expensive. I found the Maybelline concealer to cover just as much (I was surprised!), so why pay the high price?! I&#x27;ve done some \\&quot;blind tests\\&quot; with other concealers in day light, asking my husband to judge which one looks better, and he picked this one every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This concealer (in FAIR) is a good match for fair people with red/blue undertones and blue/purple circles under the eyes. It goes on thin, yet has a lot of coverage. It is not \\&quot;cakey\\&quot; and does not seem to settle into creases. It does have a mild tightening effect. I put it on in a heavy upside down triangle, pat in and blend out the edges. It blends very easily and is buildable. Major pro is that it can be \\&quot;rebuilt\\&quot; half way through the day by dabbing off any extra oils around the eye and reapplying. That&#x27;s REALLY good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the negatives... the applicator is TERRIBLE! Using a sponge applicator is never good. I don&#x27;t care if they claim it&#x27;s \\&quot;antimicrobial\\&quot;, I still don&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s also lacks precision in application. It requires about 1000 clicks to get going and I can tell this product going to be used up fast due to how much is lost in the sponge versus what makes it on my face. Another thing, do not set it with loose powder. As soon as you swipe it brush under your eyes it&#x27;s going to make a crease. This is contrary to how most concealers work but for some reason it happens with this one. I recommend leaving it alone or (if you really need to lock it down) use a clean concealer brush to gently pat powder under your eye with no tugging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the applicator stinks, I do recommend using this for dark circles. I&#x27;m going to try layering the illuminator over it for evening makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this product out since seeing one of my fav beauty gurus using it. I really love that it&#x27;s a concealer that isn&#x27;t a wand, like a mascara. I find so many concealers in that type of packaging and they tend to dry out from forcing air into the bottle, much the same way mascara does. I also hate that, with the mascara-style ones, you have to keep going back to get more product because one dip is almost never enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great. It&#x27;s got a larger surface for distribution of product, and really provides good coverage without having to go back in and swipe under your eyes 3 or 4 times in order to get enough product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly and was packaged well. The only thing I would say negatively was that the seller was offering it at a price that is pretty much the same as if you were buying it at the store. So unless you&#x27;re getting free shipping, I would just buy it at your local grocery store/drug store and save yourself the shipping fee. If the price was lower, that would give me a reason to continue ordering online, but... I&#x27;ll probably just buy it when I&#x27;m out grocery shopping next time.</li>
            <li> I have seen countless YouTube &amp;#34;beauty gurus&amp;#34; using this product for their under-eye concealer and even as a highlighter on other parts of their face, and the finish always looks beautiful. I first purchased this at Target, and they didn&#x27;t have Fair left, so I instead got Light. It was just a hint too yellow for my skin, so I ordered Fair from here. I opened the package and was so disappointed to see that it was nearly identical to Light, but once applying it, I was so pleased to see that the slight color difference in the tube actually made a HUGE difference on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is thin, but provides medium to full coverage. You can even layer it to get more coverage. I blend it out with a damp Beauty Blender dupe, and it looks flawless and lasts all day. I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts on the tops of my cheeks (where the product gets blended into) which I was worried about, so I&#x27;m very happy about that. My skin is extremely sensitive to anything new. I can&#x27;t say anything as far a the &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; aspect goes; my dark circles look the same when I take my makeup off a the end of the day. But if it&#x27;s a gradual thing, that&#x27;ll just be an added bonus.</li>
            <li> this really covers up dark circles i am glad that have something like this.  If you have dark circles its a must have</li>
            <li> very easy to use, but it didnt make any difference in fines lines on the skin. texture is good, it doesnt leave  that fake apperence that some makeups do. Skin looks naturaly lighter. Only problem is that you can see some of the product is left behind on this new sistem...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Maybelline Dark Circles Treatment caused my sensitive eyes to burn.  I had to wash it off just a few minutes after applying it.  The applicator sponge is a bit large, making it hard to apply the concealer.  Overall I was very disappointed and threw the product away.</li>
            <li> Great Product! it&#x27;s covered perfect, has a very fine structure, easily to remove, very gentle, the eyes look so natural. Recommended!</li>
            <li> OH EMM GEEEE this under eye concealer truly works wonders!!!! Hurricane Sandy totally, and I mean TOTALLY, blew out all of my power, I mean, even the lightbulb in my refrigerator burnt out, WTF I had no idea that could EVEN HAPPEN! SO I have like, no power, so I can&#x27;t even see how awful my complexion is and I was up all night the evening before getting caught up on Gossip Girl and I glimpse my reflection in a spoon and I see the MOST AWFUL under-eye circles, I&#x27;m talking raccoon eyes people. So I immediately grab this product and immediately my raccoon eyes disappear and I&#x27;m left with smooth radiant under eye skin. Thank goodness I don&#x27;t have anything to worry about anymore! I mean, I do have to get the giant hole in my roof fixed after the hurricane blew a tree through it but at least my raccoon eyes are gone. Thank you so much Maybelline!!!!&lt;br /&gt;xoxo Heather</li>
            <li> This product does highlight underneath your concealer and does brighten but does not cover your under eye circles...I do love the product however I gave it 3 stars because it did not cover the circles which is why I bought it...but I have bought many products ..cheep to expensive not all work... all I ask is that it does as it states....so great for brightening and shine but not for coverage of dark circles...even when used under my $100.00 Cle du peau concealer...</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing a million people rave about it on YouTube. Beauty guru&#x27;s love this, so I had to try it. And I would say this is my favorite Concealer! I will continue to use this product forever!!!  It is amazing for a drugstore brand!!! Way better than lots of high end makeup! Very impressed! Buy it!!!</li>
            <li> Blends well, however need to fresh it if going out at night.</li>
            <li> This was a great choice for me . A little go&#x27;s a long ways for coverage . Maybe be a little to light in color for me I&#x27;m olive completed .  But I saw immediate lightening in the darkness under and in the inner corners my eyes after useing it just a few times.</li>
            <li> Great cover up make up  to hide  bruises</li>
            <li> I Loveeeee this!!! I have spent so much money on under eye concealers and for just $6.00 this stuff is amazing. I love the easy applicator and the coverage is great. I also use it as a concealer on blemishes, it works great.</li>
            <li> did not suit the color of the skin</li>
            <li> Best concelear ever! Even the highend products don&#x27;t cover as well, and for the price, it is a steal! I will be buying again from this seller.</li>
            <li> Love this concealer. It is the best that I have found for the price.</li>
            <li> After using up &#x27;Bobby Brown&#x27;s concealer in cream type, I bought this to give it a try because I heard so many good things about it.&lt;br /&gt;And every word was right about this concealer. It makes my under eye area so bright and stays long.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it forever!  I also bought foundation in this line, and I didn&#x27;t like the sponge applicator with it, but with this eye concealer, this sponge applicator is the best to spread under eye area. it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> so many people like it (youtube gurus), but it was not great for me, i have a dry skin, and it looks powdery on my. Anyway, drugstore is cheap, and this is what you receive with cheap products.</li>
            <li> I am 42.  I have age/sun spots, red spots, brown spots, dark under eye circles and large pores on my nose.  This is fantastic as an all over foundation or spot concealer.  I have so many imperfections that I just keep rolling it on.  It goes on so quickly and easily that before I know it I&#x27;ve used it as foundation, though it works perfectly as concealer.  THE APPLICATOR IS GENIOUS.  It is so soft and the liquid comes through in just the right amount to easily blend in a circular motion.  I haven&#x27;t had any luck applying my normal powder foundation over it, it sticks too much and won&#x27;t blend well.  So, I&#x27;ve purchased a loose powder to try.  My blush goes on over it with no trouble and my mineral foundation goes on over it w/no trouble.  I&#x27;ve ordered a loose powder to use when I want to use this as a foundation.  All of my red dots, dark spots and circles dissapear quickly and so easily.  I love the application.</li>
            <li> I think this concelear is good.... it does itsjob. But the only cons is that it smears a little.</li>
            <li> This broke as soon as I tried to use it. I have no idea if it&#x27;s good or not because I didn&#x27;t get to try it out.  I would have returned it but I was already annoyed because when I first received it it wasn&#x27;t even the right product, it was orange citrus syrup! NOT EVEN MAKEUP. They were quick to send me the right product but when it arrived it broke and I wasn&#x27;t even able to use it. Very frusterating.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and I cann&#x27;t rate this now.  I hope to ask something about this to my friend and then I&#x27;ll rate the product.</li>
            <li> This magic wand is perfect for covering dark spots or even dark circles. It&#x27;s smooth and goes on your skin evenly. Thanks Amazon !</li>
            <li> Okay, so obviously i was expecting a bit bigger from what i ordered but you get what you pay for. I inherited under eye circles pretty badly, but this as i just recieved and love! its a little on the skinny side but its so worth it. the packaging was kinda weird, but nothing is wrong with it.</li>
            <li> U can&#x27;t get anything out of the sponge.  I really wasted my money on this junk!!  do not buy it!!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it covers well and looks natural without caking, but gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the dispensing packaging doesn&#x27;t always work well, or evenly, or let you use all of the product.  When there is still quite a bit in the bottom to use, I have to break open the dispenser and use a long-handled Q-tip type implement to get all the product out.  They could improve on this packaging, but the product is so good, that won&#x27;t keep me from buying and using it.  It&#x27;s not just for age-sensitive people...my 24 yo daughter tried mine and loved it also!</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Color is excellent</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it under my eyes before I apply foundation powder. Good coverage and great color!</li>
            <li> I wonder how much Yahoo got paid to list this as the best dark circle cover.  It works no better than others ( read:  does not cover dark circles).  It took my husband and I about 10 minutes before we could even get it to release anything from the applicator.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My favorite under eye concealer so far :) Love it!</li>
            <li> A great, very lightweight yet high coverage concealer. I&#x27;m very pale, but the shade works for me. Can also be used for highlighting. The sponge &amp;#34;applicator&amp;#34; is a horrid mess of bacteria, though.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing under the eye, covers darkness and brightens.  My skin actually feels better after using this.  Other concealers are a little bit drying, and since i already have dry-ish skin this is perfect.  I&#x27;m on my third tube of this stuff.  I like to blend it by using a damp makeup sponge.</li>
