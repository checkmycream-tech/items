    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>she is very happy with it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this mirror (in case you couldn&#x27;t tell)!</li>
            <li>I have a make-up mirror that has a 15 times mag mirror and for me, it&#x27;s perfect because I don&#x27;t have the best eyesight.</li>
            <li>This mirror is perfect for my daughter to apply her make-up and then flip the mirror if she needs to pluck her eyebrows.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>but she was not too impressed with the product.</li>
            <li>I wear glasses and find the 5x magnification just perfect for detail work.</li>
            <li>was&#x27;nt impressed with it,</li>
            <li>This part is especially amusing, since there ARE no side</li>
            <li>Great purchase!</li>
            <li>Now I have the perfect makeup mirror design again and the lighted unit is bright!  </li>
            <li>Sitting and looking into it without straining would be ideal.  </li>
            <li>So, this version is ideal since it has no side mirrors.</li>
            <li>I loved it!  </li>
            <li>Perfect size, great lighting and the plug in front is great to plug in hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This mirror is great for it&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice feature on the front where you can plug in another appliance</li>
            <li>The idea is good and the product is attractive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for doing makeup or spa treatments that require a good look at your pores.</li>
            <li>The magnified side is perfect for putting on makeup, and I love the 4-light settings.</li>
            <li>It works great and it fit on her Cubie desk perfectly!</li>
            <li>One bright spot:  the 5x magnification.</li>
            <li>lights are really bright.</li>
            <li>The mirror was just as advertised, arrived when promised and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Honestly the evening, daytime, home and office settings just did not seem like any sort of lighting I have experienced.</li>
            <li>It is a very nice mirror with day, evening, office settings a nice magnifying glass</li>
            <li>First of all this would be perfect for a vanity counter top since standing and hunching over isn&#x27;t the best idea.  </li>
            <li>The best part was that later my husband commented that when he was sitting across from me he was struck by how great my face looked!</li>
            <li>in all, I am very pleased with this Jerdon mirror.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it looked good sitting on the bathroom counter, but it just doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>The lighting choices are good and now I put my make up on in good light!</li>
            <li>This lighted mirror has made my life really easy when I am trying to look great in the morning.</li>
            <li>This is good for being able to see every mark and blemish on your face, but it&#x27;s not so good for being able to look in the mirror without straining your eyes.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nice that you can also plug something else into it even though I haven&#x27;t had to yet.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice feature so you can apply your makeup according to whether you are going out at night, during the day, party, etc.  </li>
            <li>mirror has a handy dandy switch that you can go from:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also has a nice plug on the front -</li>
            <li>Probably best used for something that doesn&#x27;t move so much, I wouldn&#x27;t yank things around with the mirror.</li>
            <li>So its nice they designed it to have this option in mind.</li>
            <li>looking for a cost effective replacement I decided that I did not  need the additional two mirror wings that  another Jerdon mirror style offered.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that the 5X magnification would not be sufficient, but it&#x27;s really a good amount of magnification, and I am pleased with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Jerdon mirror is more than adequate, has good lighting and good magnification and is, I believe, a good buy at the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for getting your best face on.</li>
            <li>The adjustable settings for lighting in daytime, evening, home and office environments is hilarious because the selections couldn&#x27;t be more off!  </li>
            <li>Nice mirror until the light bulbs blew within 45 days!</li>
            <li>So for once, it&#x27;s nice to be able to have some control.  </li>
            <li>the lights on the sides don&#x27;t fold in, kind of lights the room better than my face&lt;</li>
            <li>Now days there are so many battery operated fluorescent and LED lights that it would be nice if this item were battery operated also to avoid the hassle of finding a wall</li>
            <li>I will keep looking for a more suitable lighted vanity mirror.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo3VD13G7V0QI4U]]If you&#x27;re looking for an extremely powerful light and a square mirror that has a 5x flip side, then this is a great product.</li>
            <li>This is more of a useable product, rather than something that will look nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be able to see every mark and blemish on your face</li>
            <li>and like it better because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>always found the tri-fold design to be bulky and cumbersome, and I like this compact model better.  </li>
            <li>I think this mirror would be perfect for a teen.  </li>
            <li>Mine spends most of its life in the closet.</li>
            <li>I was able to apply my makeup and the eye makeup</li>
            <li>But truthfully, I&#x27;d try another Jerdon product, just not in this style.  </li>
            <li>I wish the magnify was more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just cheap-looking and not terribly sturdy.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>&quot; This is followed by instructions stating that should they need replacing, the unit must be returned to the factory or installed by \\&quot;competent electrical appliance personnel.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Jerdon Euro Tabletop Two-Sided Lighted Mirror is a favorite with my daughters.</li>
            <li>They like the more sleek design without the side</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s plastic and isn&#x27;t that appealing to look at</li>
            <li>so glad I took the chance.</li>
            <li>I set this one on the bathroom counter top and there was no way I could use it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li>I recommend people to get the mirrors that have the side folding mirrors attached for better lighting.</li>
            <li>The best feature on this mirror is the different lighting.</li>
            <li>How many times have I put on make-up and then go out in florescent lighting and look like a clown?</li>
            <li>Night is more forgiving of course.</li>
            <li>The low-lighting of home is also a bit more forgiving and this mirror showcases this.</li>
            <li>I would have like it better if I could have figured out a way to hang it.</li>
            <li>I like the mirrors but tend to use it in another room that has much better lighting than using the built-in lighting.</li>
            <li>its just okay.</li>
            <li>It feels kind of cheap and plastic-y.  </li>
            <li>ent color filters depending on what kind of light you are going to be in.  </li>
            <li>many tilt adjustments levels.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li>With the Jerdon Euro Style Makeup Mirror, I have makeup that looks great and that I am able to really focus on when</li>
            <li>afterall, surely the technology has improved in 30 years?</li>
            <li>This is a really nice compact cosmetic mirror that would fit on almost any vanity table or shelf.</li>
            <li>The brightest one is my choice most of the time.  </li>
            <li>It feels kind of light to me.</li>
            <li>The side mirrors add more light to the facial area and therefore make applying your skincare and makeup more flawless.</li>
            <li>There are more stylish makeup mirrors out there, fortunately.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight and feels kind of cheap, and the light colors don&#x27;t change easily.</li>
            <li>This mirror is good for a vanity or large surface.</li>
            <li>The Conair wasn&#x27;t as bright and lacked the much needed outlet on the front to plug your blow dryer or curling iron into.</li>
            <li>It has four different color filters, which I thought was cool, so you can pick which color that you like the best.</li>
            <li>Light is bright but doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>Love to tweeze my eyebrows using the magnified side with the light and putting on makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I do not have a lot of natural light in my bathroom, the Daylight works great.  </li>
            <li>easy on/off in the front</li>
            <li>switch is easy to press on and off.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Would have been better just to make the device&#x27;s cord 14 gauge and make the outlet a full grounded 15a outlet, and then no marking would be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the mirror itself is kind of large</li>
            <li>The mirrors are bright and clear, and the magnifier is 5X which gives you a huge, HD quality look at yourself, whether you want it or not.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Powerful light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+The light might be too powerful&lt;</li>
            <li>The lighting itself varies from being too dim to being too bright--</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaply made and rather</li>
            <li>The gimmick was that the mirror had four light settings:  day, office, evening and home which supposedly allowed you to put on your make-up in the light you were going to be seen in.  </li>
            <li>another reviewer mentioned, it&#x27;s a pain that the consumer can&#x27;t change the light bulbs when they go out.  </li>
            <li>On either side of the mirror are lights and there is a slider on the bottom that adjusts a filter over the lights to adjust the color of the light.  </li>
            <li>design is cheap looking and chintzy</li>
            <li>guess this mirror might be liked more than others, but most of the time my mom goes back to to tradtional bathroom mirror.&lt;br /&gt;She does use it once and a while though, when the bathroom is occupied.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>I want magnification, the 5X magnification is not as comfortable for me as 7X magnification</li>
            <li>so I cannot adjust where the light hits my face when I am closer or farther from the mirror.</li>
            <li>Then I fortunately came across this mirror.</li>
            <li>light gradually gets brighter (must be the fluorescent)</li>
            <li>That screams cheap to me.</li>
            <li>But just moves a colored film in front of the light bulbs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this if you can handle seeing yourself in such great detail.</li>
            <li>This mirror is bulky and feels cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>So it is good as far as it goes, but could be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being lighted is good, but the lights on this product are not that strong, and are easily washed out by incidental window light (unless it is a grey cloudy day).  </li>
            <li>find that the lights and mirror on this product - the obvious most important parts - are of pretty good quality from a functional standpoint.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mirror as a worthy successor to the True to Light!!</li>
            <li>The Day, Evening and Home modes were ok, but does not make much difference as she wears light make-up.</li>
            <li>The True to Light was bright and well made, lasting over 30 years, so I hoped I could find another make up mirror that would work as well,</li>
            <li>I think I was right about not needing the extra mirror wings, and I am really happy about the brighter lighting.</li>
            <li>My daughter really loves this mirror and the different light settings are great for deciding how to wear make-up.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase online, but the brand replacement I bought locally was not as bright as the one I had.</li>
            <li>light is extremely powerful.</li>
            <li>and then I decided to purchase something more modern.</li>
            <li>I was super looking forward to trying this mirror.  </li>
            <li>Euro Tabletop Two-Sided Lighted Makeup Mirror has an excellent 5x magnification mirror plus a regular mirror on the opposite side.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They offer different color filters depending on what kind of light you are going to be in.  </li>
            <li>After its warmed up, the brightness level is just right- bright enough to see your pores but not blinding.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Even as a guy, I find these types of mirrors quite useful for putting in contacts and making a quick check to see if I missed a spot shaving or if a nose hair is below where it should</li>
            <li>The Jerdon Euro Tabletop lighted mirror with 4 light settings is a very helpful in applying makeup for any occasion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now for the places it could improve: \\&quot;office\\&quot; light setting is very bluish to me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about it.  </li>
            <li>I am inspired to now actually pluck my own eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too big to fit on most bathroom countertops or dressing tables</li>
            <li>extra plug-in on the front is handy, and the mirror has held up to usage thus far by three college-age girls and one harried mom, so it seems to be doing okay in the sturdiness</li>
            <li>I am doing my makeup for this setting, I rather use the \\&quot;day\\&quot; setting which looks more natural.  </li>
            <li>so that isn&#x27;t that useful for me.</li>
            <li>extra outlet in the front is nice and useful</li>
            <li>I would be nice if they designed it differently to permit the option of wall mounting</li>
            <li>I would be nice if they designed it differently to permit the option of wall mounting</li>
            <li>One nice extra is the electrical outlet on the front of the frame.</li>
            <li>sort of a &#x27;fun house&#x27; effect?)  </li>
            <li>This one of those products that looks better on the picture than it really is.&lt;br /&gt;This was used mainly by my mom and she</li>
            <li>The quality is high, and it looks just fine sitting out on my bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li>I say that because the mirror itself seems to be just right.  </li>
            <li>One thing they did right:  </li>
            <li>lights don&#x27;t seem to be aimed in the right direction.  </li>
            <li>But, like most magnifying mirrors, you have to be in the exact right spot to get a clear picture.</li>
            <li>(I rarely use reading glasses, only if I need to do very fine things like unpick threads from sewing,</li>
            <li>My beloved and trusty Clairol True to Light is starting to die (one of the light bars won&#x27;t come on half of the time)</li>
            <li>My previous U. S.-made mirror worked perfectly for almost ten years</li>
            <li>I had a Jerdon mirror previously and absolutely loved it, but rarely used the side mirrors.</li>
            <li>He says it is very handy for popping his contacts in, especially since he can barely see his hands.</li>
            <li>You can plug your hair dryer or flat iron into it there very easily, without having to dig for the outlet on the wall.</li>
            <li>Im pretty picky and have searched all over the internet for the right one.</li>
            <li>plug in outlet seems useless.&lt;br /&gt;The lever to shift the light filters back and forth is cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This model is slightly smaller than the ones with swing-out doors, which might be nice to save on counter space, but is not so cool when it comes to keeping the mirror clean, especially if you use dusting powder or hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This mirror provides a more accurate light when applying makeup than mirrors that use two small bulbs.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is also kind of clunky and not very modern looking.  </li>
            <li>This is huge for a near sighted person.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a huge difference between the look when I put on my make-up in my well lit but no natural light bathroom and when I get in the car.  </li>
            <li>I had a similar style lighted mirror many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Also, the sides of this mirror do not get hot while your are using it.  </li>
            <li>I love seeing how my makeup looks in the different lighting options.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a really appealing mirror to a teen or for someone in their twenties who goes out at night and perhaps spends time under florescent lighting, they can apply make-up accordingly</li>
            <li>You just plug that mirror in, and move the white button to the setting which you prefer and the mirror turns on with the appropriate lighting.</li>
            <li>This mirror is the first one that allowed me to put on makeup with my contacts inserted.</li>
            <li>I used the magnifying side of the mirror although my first reaction was terror at all the wrinkles and lines that jumped out at me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be interested to see if their hotel style, metal framed flip mirrors have a betterfeel to them.</li>
            <li>Love the extra outlet and lighting.</li>
            <li>Overall, just an okay product.  </li>
            <li>First, it is more relaxing to sit at a table, and secondly you can flip the mirror between unmagnified and 5X magnification.  </li>
            <li>When I move my face closer to see the detail I am looking for, the lights only illuminate the sides of my face, and most of my face is unlighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like most devices made in China, this product is of unacceptably low quality in terms of endurance.</li>
            <li>First I tried Conair</li>
            <li>The magnification is 5X, which is more than enough to see what you need to see in the mirror.</li>
            <li>The Jerdon mirror uses what I consider to the more standard two upright bulbs; one on each side.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, it&#x27;s huge and more than half the size is the plastic frame part.</li>
            <li>and so I chose the one without the &#x27;wings&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;This model has light settings that simulate day light,  office lighting (what a green hued fright!), home lighting and evening light (think a restaurant or date night).</li>
            <li>There is a permanent sticker on the top that says \\&quot;Rotate flat mirror up</li>
            <li>you should make sure that the make-up is light because harsh lighting accentuates all the not-so-happy parts.</li>
            <li>The light is adjustable to four different settings, but I&#x27;ve never found those that useful in doing makeup.</li>
            <li>which means the light bulbs are right next to you, shining in your eyes and not lighting your face</li>
            <li>I am so displeased with this product that I am earnestly baffled that it has any positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brightness is much, much better than other mirrors and similar to that of the True to Light.</li>
            <li>The mirror itself is sort of flimsy looking and although not as bulky as a tri-fold, still a large footprint for valuable bathroom counter real-estate.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, the size of the mirror is a bit large.  </li>
            <li>That being said - it certainly would not,should not, be a deal breaker for anyone.t to me.</li>
            <li>That being said - it certainly would not,should not, be a deal breaker for anyone.</li>
            <li>That pretty much sums up how much it is utilized and appreciated.  </li>
            <li>The girls feel the 4-light settings have been accurate when used for getting ready for nights out versus days at work and days outside at school/the park, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>There is not enough light.</li>
            <li>It takes up too much room on the vanity because of the plastic  kickstand.</li>
            <li>The colors don&#x27;t make too much of a difference, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lights could be focused / angled more toward the center, or adjustable.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be a keeper, but it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I like having some extra light during the early mornings when I don&#x27;t have natural light coming into the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>The changing light option is very helpful as a regular mirror can only reflect the room light.</li>
            <li>mirror is relatively sturdy, and has a two-sided mirror which makes it nice for getting eyelashes out of your eye or plucking your eyebrows or seeing how gross that pimple really looks.  </li>
            <li>But the only light I ever use is the brightest one, which is day.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast, and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Getting ready in the morning can be a stressful time.  </li>
            <li>so even though you plug this one in, you aren&#x27;t losing a much need bathroom plug.</li>
            <li>In the bathroom, I think I&#x27;ve put so much on</li>
            <li>light settings are not really reminiscent of the places they are supposed to mimic, in fact, they are quite off</li>
            <li>magnification looks very distorted and weirded</li>
            <li>The mirror takes up so much space on the countertop and the added outlet on the side would never be used in our household as the mirror isn&#x27;t very sturdy and could fall off the countertop if the wind blew.  </li>
            <li>Also, it has the much needed electrical outlet on the front for your accessories.</li>
            <li>size, you can see your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;The light filters help you with makeup</li>
            <li>It has four different light settings and 2 mirrored sides.  </li>
            <li>I find that the  Jerdon mirror&#x27;s light is a big  improvement; clearer and brighter.</li>
            <li>mirror can take up a lot of counter space - which I don&#x27;t really have to spare.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s there ready to set up when I use</li>
            <li>Quite honestly, although the other lighting modes may be fun to have a look at, the only mode I use is day light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>How many of you girls know the wattages of all your other bathroom appliances?  </li>
            <li>It can be a bit of challenge to store the mirror due to its dimensions, so if the area you plan to use this mirror is constrained, be sure to measure before purchasing.</li>
            <li>But if I had a dressing table that I sat down to use, this would be okay.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, everything else I find less appealing:  </li>
            <li>This mirror is better for the younger set who doesn&#x27;t need the extra magnification to see.</li>
            <li>Ok, I admit I was intrigued with the premise for this product--a makeup mirror with different levels of lighting for different environments, including settings for daytime, office, evening, and home.</li>
            <li>My sister is 8 years older then me</li>
            <li>adequately in a well externally lit space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li>Lighting could be a little better.  </li>
            <li>My daughters have a cute little antique looking</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t give off enough light, and the light selections are poor-they are not true to life and are lacking in brightness.</li>
            <li>My old mirror was another brand oval shaped and, although it had a 7X mirror, it also had very poor(for</li>
            <li>When I was younger, I had a mirror like this with different settings for the light such as night time, and I remember the mirror as being really cool.</li>
            <li>She mentioned that the only useful feature was the 5X magnification to check on the pores of her skin.</li>
            <li>You can flip the mirror from normal magnification to 5X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this as an Amazon item to review and didn&#x27;t waste money on it.</li>
            <li>The mirror is two sided and flips from normal to 5x&#x27;s magnification.  </li>
            <li>short, this might work for a young girl who&#x27;s playing with make-up, but really doesn&#x27;t seem to fit an adult&#x27;s lifestyle, at least not as a product that is prominently displayed.</li>
            <li>He had no idea that I had a new routine with the Jerdon mirror.</li>
            <li>The round pedestal lighted mirrors didn&#x27;t take up much space, but they didn&#x27;t give off much light either.  </li>
            <li>the Jerdon Euro Style rigid Lighted Makeup Mirror does not provide enough light at various distances (we are talking to a varience of inches) to apply my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not find any of the lighting settings to be very natural.  </li>
            <li>Very surprised at this Jerdon lighted makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li>We all look hot in the dark right?</li>
            <li>Interestingly, the mirror has an outlet you can use to connect small beauty</li>
            <li>Jerdon brand seems exactly the same as brand I replaced.</li>
            <li>Personally, I prefer a mirror that attaches to the wall and can be adjusted higher and lower, etc.  </li>
            <li>and when we were younger my parents bought her a mirror EXACTLY like this for her 16th birthday.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li>The knob actually flew off the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>(full pink - flesh)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is very similar to one I had a long time ago except that it has 5X magnification which is very helpful to me since I wear glasses and sometimes cannot see exactly how much coverage I am getting with my makeup.  </li>
            <li>It has the same brightness, makeup lighting function, mirror size,( 6&amp;#34;x7&amp;#34;), and mirror flip feature for magnification, as old one.</li>
            <li>The mirror in the center switched from normal to magnified and the lights switched to different shades of color that were supposed to simulate the light conditions for whatever time of day</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace an old Clairol True to Light that had broken after 30+ years.</li>
            <li>The plastic housing has a general cheaper feel to it, there are no options for wall mounting, the light covers look like they could pop off at any minute, and the light adjustment slide is choppy and rough to slide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The plastic that this is made out of looks a little cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a little slider that is supposed to change the light for day, office, home, etc.</li>
            <li>The light settings are decent, but I usually find the brightest setting and use that.  </li>
            <li>The center mirror flips around from regular to magnified and is fine.  </li>
            <li>I find when I use this make-up mirror, I miss the super mag of my other mirror, I am probably just used to it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Steer clear of this one.</li>
            <li>I can appreciate anything that helps the process of making myself presentable before heading out the door go that much smoother and faster, especially when getting makeup on in the AM.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be surprised in a bathroom mirror at the office...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m often wondering if I&#x27;m wearing too much make-up or not enough.  </li>
            <li>folding stand in the back is very temperamental and prone to collapsing.</li>
            <li>The daytime setting was just too dim compared to natural sunlight.</li>
            <li>It was a gift for my 9 year old daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li>I therefore need to be  very close up and pull back, very close up and pull back and</li>
            <li>I did not feel that the extra views would benefit me much</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fun to try different make-up techniques with the different settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worse, the plastic isn&#x27;t nice plastic.</li>
            <li>It popped right back on, but I think it&#x27;s only a matter of time before it breaks permanently.</li>
            <li>and I went back to the normal mirror setting.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is big enough so that you can see your whole face, and you can zoom in, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>/&gt;-the mirrors are clear and large enough to frame my entire (big and square)&lt;br /&gt;-I like that</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace my older Clairol lighted mirror (very similar appearance), to have a larger magnifier side.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is clear and the lights supposedly should last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Jerdon JGL7W appeared to have same features as old one,</li>
            <li>Hoping it lasts the same 20 years as old one.</li>
            <li>Also, obviously, you have to use it near an outlet.  </li>
            <li>This simply doesn&#x27;t work for me, and reminds me of the old time lighted mirror my Aunt had when I was a kid.</li>
            <li>frame seems to have been cannibalized from a different product line, because on the top center of the frame it says in black print \\&quot;Rotate flat mirror up</li>
            <li>frame seems to have been cannibalized from a different product line, because on the top center of the frame it says in black print \\&quot;Rotate flat mirror up</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being a near sighted woman who wears only glasses, I put my make on without my glasses obviously.</li>
            <li>find the mirror&#x27;s stand in the back to be so flimsy, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this didn&#x27;t last even 6 months before breaking.  </li>
            <li>Many years ago I had a Clairol lighted makeup mirror that swiveled up and down (NOT side to side) and it had an electric plugin for additional small appliances.  </li>
            <li>While it does come with an extra power outlet built into the front of the unit I am not sure it would be safe to plug anything into it because of the way the unit slides around when moved slightly.</li>
            <li>This mirror has a couple of useful features: the option to go to a 5 times magnification or stay with regular, lighting assimilation in various settings (home, office, day, etc.), back lighting to allow you to use this mirror with any (or no) light, and an outlet built into the mirror on lower left (in case you want to use heat tools for styling hair while in front of mirror), and a stand setup with various angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In addition to this angle, the mirror itself swivels with one side normal and the other side giving you 5x magnification.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this mirror (in case you couldn&#x27;t tell)!</li>
            <li> I have a make-up mirror that has a 15 times mag mirror and for me, it&#x27;s perfect because I don&#x27;t have the best eyesight.</li>
            <li> This mirror is perfect for my daughter to apply her make-up and then flip the mirror if she needs to pluck her eyebrows.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> but she was not too impressed with the product.</li>
            <li> I wear glasses and find the 5x magnification just perfect for detail work.</li>
            <li> was&#x27;nt impressed with it,</li>
            <li> This part is especially amusing, since there ARE no side</li>
            <li> Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Now I have the perfect makeup mirror design again and the lighted unit is bright!  </li>
            <li> Sitting and looking into it without straining would be ideal.  </li>
            <li> So, this version is ideal since it has no side mirrors.</li>
            <li> I loved it!  </li>
            <li> Perfect size, great lighting and the plug in front is great to plug in hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great for it&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice feature on the front where you can plug in another appliance</li>
            <li> The idea is good and the product is attractive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for doing makeup or spa treatments that require a good look at your pores.</li>
            <li> The magnified side is perfect for putting on makeup, and I love the 4-light settings.</li>
            <li> It works great and it fit on her Cubie desk perfectly!</li>
            <li> One bright spot:  the 5x magnification.</li>
            <li> lights are really bright.</li>
            <li> The mirror was just as advertised, arrived when promised and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Honestly the evening, daytime, home and office settings just did not seem like any sort of lighting I have experienced.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice mirror with day, evening, office settings a nice magnifying glass</li>
            <li> First of all this would be perfect for a vanity counter top since standing and hunching over isn&#x27;t the best idea.  </li>
            <li> The best part was that later my husband commented that when he was sitting across from me he was struck by how great my face looked!</li>
            <li> in all, I am very pleased with this Jerdon mirror.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it looked good sitting on the bathroom counter, but it just doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> The lighting choices are good and now I put my make up on in good light!</li>
            <li> This lighted mirror has made my life really easy when I am trying to look great in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is good for being able to see every mark and blemish on your face, but it&#x27;s not so good for being able to look in the mirror without straining your eyes.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s nice that you can also plug something else into it even though I haven&#x27;t had to yet.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice feature so you can apply your makeup according to whether you are going out at night, during the day, party, etc.  </li>
            <li> mirror has a handy dandy switch that you can go from:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also has a nice plug on the front -</li>
            <li> Probably best used for something that doesn&#x27;t move so much, I wouldn&#x27;t yank things around with the mirror.</li>
            <li> So its nice they designed it to have this option in mind.</li>
            <li> looking for a cost effective replacement I decided that I did not  need the additional two mirror wings that  another Jerdon mirror style offered.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the 5X magnification would not be sufficient, but it&#x27;s really a good amount of magnification, and I am pleased with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Jerdon mirror is more than adequate, has good lighting and good magnification and is, I believe, a good buy at the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for getting your best face on.</li>
            <li> The adjustable settings for lighting in daytime, evening, home and office environments is hilarious because the selections couldn&#x27;t be more off!  </li>
            <li> Nice mirror until the light bulbs blew within 45 days!</li>
            <li> So for once, it&#x27;s nice to be able to have some control.  </li>
            <li> the lights on the sides don&#x27;t fold in, kind of lights the room better than my face&lt;</li>
            <li> Now days there are so many battery operated fluorescent and LED lights that it would be nice if this item were battery operated also to avoid the hassle of finding a wall</li>
            <li> I will keep looking for a more suitable lighted vanity mirror.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3VD13G7V0QI4U]]If you&#x27;re looking for an extremely powerful light and a square mirror that has a 5x flip side, then this is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is more of a useable product, rather than something that will look nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be able to see every mark and blemish on your face</li>
            <li> and like it better because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> always found the tri-fold design to be bulky and cumbersome, and I like this compact model better.  </li>
            <li> I think this mirror would be perfect for a teen.  </li>
            <li> Mine spends most of its life in the closet.</li>
            <li> I was able to apply my makeup and the eye makeup</li>
            <li> But truthfully, I&#x27;d try another Jerdon product, just not in this style.  </li>
            <li> I wish the magnify was more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just cheap-looking and not terribly sturdy.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> &quot; This is followed by instructions stating that should they need replacing, the unit must be returned to the factory or installed by \\&quot;competent electrical appliance personnel.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Jerdon Euro Tabletop Two-Sided Lighted Mirror is a favorite with my daughters.</li>
            <li> They like the more sleek design without the side</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s plastic and isn&#x27;t that appealing to look at</li>
            <li> so glad I took the chance.</li>
            <li> I set this one on the bathroom counter top and there was no way I could use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li> I recommend people to get the mirrors that have the side folding mirrors attached for better lighting.</li>
            <li> The best feature on this mirror is the different lighting.</li>
            <li> How many times have I put on make-up and then go out in florescent lighting and look like a clown?</li>
            <li> Night is more forgiving of course.</li>
            <li> The low-lighting of home is also a bit more forgiving and this mirror showcases this.</li>
            <li> I would have like it better if I could have figured out a way to hang it.</li>
            <li> I like the mirrors but tend to use it in another room that has much better lighting than using the built-in lighting.</li>
            <li> its just okay.</li>
            <li> It feels kind of cheap and plastic-y.  </li>
            <li> ent color filters depending on what kind of light you are going to be in.  </li>
            <li> many tilt adjustments levels.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li> With the Jerdon Euro Style Makeup Mirror, I have makeup that looks great and that I am able to really focus on when</li>
            <li> afterall, surely the technology has improved in 30 years?</li>
            <li> This is a really nice compact cosmetic mirror that would fit on almost any vanity table or shelf.</li>
            <li> The brightest one is my choice most of the time.  </li>
            <li> It feels kind of light to me.</li>
            <li> The side mirrors add more light to the facial area and therefore make applying your skincare and makeup more flawless.</li>
            <li> There are more stylish makeup mirrors out there, fortunately.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight and feels kind of cheap, and the light colors don&#x27;t change easily.</li>
            <li> This mirror is good for a vanity or large surface.</li>
            <li> The Conair wasn&#x27;t as bright and lacked the much needed outlet on the front to plug your blow dryer or curling iron into.</li>
            <li> It has four different color filters, which I thought was cool, so you can pick which color that you like the best.</li>
            <li> Light is bright but doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> Love to tweeze my eyebrows using the magnified side with the light and putting on makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I do not have a lot of natural light in my bathroom, the Daylight works great.  </li>
            <li> easy on/off in the front</li>
            <li> switch is easy to press on and off.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Would have been better just to make the device&#x27;s cord 14 gauge and make the outlet a full grounded 15a outlet, and then no marking would be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the mirror itself is kind of large</li>
            <li> The mirrors are bright and clear, and the magnifier is 5X which gives you a huge, HD quality look at yourself, whether you want it or not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Powerful light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+The light might be too powerful&lt;</li>
            <li> The lighting itself varies from being too dim to being too bright--</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaply made and rather</li>
            <li> The gimmick was that the mirror had four light settings:  day, office, evening and home which supposedly allowed you to put on your make-up in the light you were going to be seen in.  </li>
            <li> another reviewer mentioned, it&#x27;s a pain that the consumer can&#x27;t change the light bulbs when they go out.  </li>
            <li> On either side of the mirror are lights and there is a slider on the bottom that adjusts a filter over the lights to adjust the color of the light.  </li>
            <li> design is cheap looking and chintzy</li>
            <li> guess this mirror might be liked more than others, but most of the time my mom goes back to to tradtional bathroom mirror.&lt;br /&gt;She does use it once and a while though, when the bathroom is occupied.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> I want magnification, the 5X magnification is not as comfortable for me as 7X magnification</li>
            <li> so I cannot adjust where the light hits my face when I am closer or farther from the mirror.</li>
            <li> Then I fortunately came across this mirror.</li>
            <li> light gradually gets brighter (must be the fluorescent)</li>
            <li> That screams cheap to me.</li>
            <li> But just moves a colored film in front of the light bulbs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this if you can handle seeing yourself in such great detail.</li>
            <li> This mirror is bulky and feels cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> So it is good as far as it goes, but could be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being lighted is good, but the lights on this product are not that strong, and are easily washed out by incidental window light (unless it is a grey cloudy day).  </li>
            <li> find that the lights and mirror on this product - the obvious most important parts - are of pretty good quality from a functional standpoint.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mirror as a worthy successor to the True to Light!!</li>
            <li> The Day, Evening and Home modes were ok, but does not make much difference as she wears light make-up.</li>
            <li> The True to Light was bright and well made, lasting over 30 years, so I hoped I could find another make up mirror that would work as well,</li>
            <li> I think I was right about not needing the extra mirror wings, and I am really happy about the brighter lighting.</li>
            <li> My daughter really loves this mirror and the different light settings are great for deciding how to wear make-up.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase online, but the brand replacement I bought locally was not as bright as the one I had.</li>
            <li> light is extremely powerful.</li>
            <li> and then I decided to purchase something more modern.</li>
            <li> I was super looking forward to trying this mirror.  </li>
            <li> Euro Tabletop Two-Sided Lighted Makeup Mirror has an excellent 5x magnification mirror plus a regular mirror on the opposite side.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They offer different color filters depending on what kind of light you are going to be in.  </li>
            <li> After its warmed up, the brightness level is just right- bright enough to see your pores but not blinding.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Even as a guy, I find these types of mirrors quite useful for putting in contacts and making a quick check to see if I missed a spot shaving or if a nose hair is below where it should</li>
            <li> The Jerdon Euro Tabletop lighted mirror with 4 light settings is a very helpful in applying makeup for any occasion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for the places it could improve: \\&quot;office\\&quot; light setting is very bluish to me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about it.  </li>
            <li> I am inspired to now actually pluck my own eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too big to fit on most bathroom countertops or dressing tables</li>
            <li> extra plug-in on the front is handy, and the mirror has held up to usage thus far by three college-age girls and one harried mom, so it seems to be doing okay in the sturdiness</li>
            <li> I am doing my makeup for this setting, I rather use the \\&quot;day\\&quot; setting which looks more natural.  </li>
            <li> so that isn&#x27;t that useful for me.</li>
            <li> extra outlet in the front is nice and useful</li>
            <li> I would be nice if they designed it differently to permit the option of wall mounting</li>
            <li> I would be nice if they designed it differently to permit the option of wall mounting</li>
            <li> One nice extra is the electrical outlet on the front of the frame.</li>
            <li> sort of a &#x27;fun house&#x27; effect?)  </li>
            <li> This one of those products that looks better on the picture than it really is.&lt;br /&gt;This was used mainly by my mom and she</li>
            <li> The quality is high, and it looks just fine sitting out on my bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> I say that because the mirror itself seems to be just right.  </li>
            <li> One thing they did right:  </li>
            <li> lights don&#x27;t seem to be aimed in the right direction.  </li>
            <li> But, like most magnifying mirrors, you have to be in the exact right spot to get a clear picture.</li>
            <li> (I rarely use reading glasses, only if I need to do very fine things like unpick threads from sewing,</li>
            <li> My beloved and trusty Clairol True to Light is starting to die (one of the light bars won&#x27;t come on half of the time)</li>
            <li> My previous U. S.-made mirror worked perfectly for almost ten years</li>
            <li> I had a Jerdon mirror previously and absolutely loved it, but rarely used the side mirrors.</li>
            <li> He says it is very handy for popping his contacts in, especially since he can barely see his hands.</li>
            <li> You can plug your hair dryer or flat iron into it there very easily, without having to dig for the outlet on the wall.</li>
            <li> Im pretty picky and have searched all over the internet for the right one.</li>
            <li> plug in outlet seems useless.&lt;br /&gt;The lever to shift the light filters back and forth is cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This model is slightly smaller than the ones with swing-out doors, which might be nice to save on counter space, but is not so cool when it comes to keeping the mirror clean, especially if you use dusting powder or hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This mirror provides a more accurate light when applying makeup than mirrors that use two small bulbs.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is also kind of clunky and not very modern looking.  </li>
            <li> This is huge for a near sighted person.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a huge difference between the look when I put on my make-up in my well lit but no natural light bathroom and when I get in the car.  </li>
            <li> I had a similar style lighted mirror many years ago.  </li>
            <li> Also, the sides of this mirror do not get hot while your are using it.  </li>
            <li> I love seeing how my makeup looks in the different lighting options.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a really appealing mirror to a teen or for someone in their twenties who goes out at night and perhaps spends time under florescent lighting, they can apply make-up accordingly</li>
            <li> You just plug that mirror in, and move the white button to the setting which you prefer and the mirror turns on with the appropriate lighting.</li>
            <li> This mirror is the first one that allowed me to put on makeup with my contacts inserted.</li>
            <li> I used the magnifying side of the mirror although my first reaction was terror at all the wrinkles and lines that jumped out at me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be interested to see if their hotel style, metal framed flip mirrors have a betterfeel to them.</li>
            <li> Love the extra outlet and lighting.</li>
            <li> Overall, just an okay product.  </li>
            <li> First, it is more relaxing to sit at a table, and secondly you can flip the mirror between unmagnified and 5X magnification.  </li>
            <li> When I move my face closer to see the detail I am looking for, the lights only illuminate the sides of my face, and most of my face is unlighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like most devices made in China, this product is of unacceptably low quality in terms of endurance.</li>
            <li> First I tried Conair</li>
            <li> The magnification is 5X, which is more than enough to see what you need to see in the mirror.</li>
            <li> The Jerdon mirror uses what I consider to the more standard two upright bulbs; one on each side.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, it&#x27;s huge and more than half the size is the plastic frame part.</li>
            <li> and so I chose the one without the &#x27;wings&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;This model has light settings that simulate day light,  office lighting (what a green hued fright!), home lighting and evening light (think a restaurant or date night).</li>
            <li> There is a permanent sticker on the top that says \\&quot;Rotate flat mirror up</li>
            <li> you should make sure that the make-up is light because harsh lighting accentuates all the not-so-happy parts.</li>
            <li> The light is adjustable to four different settings, but I&#x27;ve never found those that useful in doing makeup.</li>
            <li> which means the light bulbs are right next to you, shining in your eyes and not lighting your face</li>
            <li> I am so displeased with this product that I am earnestly baffled that it has any positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brightness is much, much better than other mirrors and similar to that of the True to Light.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself is sort of flimsy looking and although not as bulky as a tri-fold, still a large footprint for valuable bathroom counter real-estate.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the size of the mirror is a bit large.  </li>
            <li> That being said - it certainly would not,should not, be a deal breaker for anyone.t to me.</li>
            <li> That being said - it certainly would not,should not, be a deal breaker for anyone.</li>
            <li> That pretty much sums up how much it is utilized and appreciated.  </li>
            <li> The girls feel the 4-light settings have been accurate when used for getting ready for nights out versus days at work and days outside at school/the park, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> There is not enough light.</li>
            <li> It takes up too much room on the vanity because of the plastic  kickstand.</li>
            <li> The colors don&#x27;t make too much of a difference, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lights could be focused / angled more toward the center, or adjustable.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a keeper, but it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I like having some extra light during the early mornings when I don&#x27;t have natural light coming into the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> The changing light option is very helpful as a regular mirror can only reflect the room light.</li>
            <li> mirror is relatively sturdy, and has a two-sided mirror which makes it nice for getting eyelashes out of your eye or plucking your eyebrows or seeing how gross that pimple really looks.  </li>
            <li> But the only light I ever use is the brightest one, which is day.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was fast, and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Getting ready in the morning can be a stressful time.  </li>
            <li> so even though you plug this one in, you aren&#x27;t losing a much need bathroom plug.</li>
            <li> In the bathroom, I think I&#x27;ve put so much on</li>
            <li> light settings are not really reminiscent of the places they are supposed to mimic, in fact, they are quite off</li>
            <li> magnification looks very distorted and weirded</li>
            <li> The mirror takes up so much space on the countertop and the added outlet on the side would never be used in our household as the mirror isn&#x27;t very sturdy and could fall off the countertop if the wind blew.  </li>
            <li> Also, it has the much needed electrical outlet on the front for your accessories.</li>
            <li> size, you can see your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;The light filters help you with makeup</li>
            <li> It has four different light settings and 2 mirrored sides.  </li>
            <li> I find that the  Jerdon mirror&#x27;s light is a big  improvement; clearer and brighter.</li>
            <li> mirror can take up a lot of counter space - which I don&#x27;t really have to spare.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s there ready to set up when I use</li>
            <li> Quite honestly, although the other lighting modes may be fun to have a look at, the only mode I use is day light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> How many of you girls know the wattages of all your other bathroom appliances?  </li>
            <li> It can be a bit of challenge to store the mirror due to its dimensions, so if the area you plan to use this mirror is constrained, be sure to measure before purchasing.</li>
            <li> But if I had a dressing table that I sat down to use, this would be okay.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, everything else I find less appealing:  </li>
            <li> This mirror is better for the younger set who doesn&#x27;t need the extra magnification to see.</li>
            <li> Ok, I admit I was intrigued with the premise for this product--a makeup mirror with different levels of lighting for different environments, including settings for daytime, office, evening, and home.</li>
            <li> My sister is 8 years older then me</li>
            <li> adequately in a well externally lit space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> Lighting could be a little better.  </li>
            <li> My daughters have a cute little antique looking</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t give off enough light, and the light selections are poor-they are not true to life and are lacking in brightness.</li>
            <li> My old mirror was another brand oval shaped and, although it had a 7X mirror, it also had very poor(for</li>
            <li> When I was younger, I had a mirror like this with different settings for the light such as night time, and I remember the mirror as being really cool.</li>
            <li> She mentioned that the only useful feature was the 5X magnification to check on the pores of her skin.</li>
            <li> You can flip the mirror from normal magnification to 5X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this as an Amazon item to review and didn&#x27;t waste money on it.</li>
            <li> The mirror is two sided and flips from normal to 5x&#x27;s magnification.  </li>
            <li> short, this might work for a young girl who&#x27;s playing with make-up, but really doesn&#x27;t seem to fit an adult&#x27;s lifestyle, at least not as a product that is prominently displayed.</li>
            <li> He had no idea that I had a new routine with the Jerdon mirror.</li>
            <li> The round pedestal lighted mirrors didn&#x27;t take up much space, but they didn&#x27;t give off much light either.  </li>
            <li> the Jerdon Euro Style rigid Lighted Makeup Mirror does not provide enough light at various distances (we are talking to a varience of inches) to apply my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not find any of the lighting settings to be very natural.  </li>
            <li> Very surprised at this Jerdon lighted makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li> We all look hot in the dark right?</li>
            <li> Interestingly, the mirror has an outlet you can use to connect small beauty</li>
            <li> Jerdon brand seems exactly the same as brand I replaced.</li>
            <li> Personally, I prefer a mirror that attaches to the wall and can be adjusted higher and lower, etc.  </li>
            <li> and when we were younger my parents bought her a mirror EXACTLY like this for her 16th birthday.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li> The knob actually flew off the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> (full pink - flesh)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is very similar to one I had a long time ago except that it has 5X magnification which is very helpful to me since I wear glasses and sometimes cannot see exactly how much coverage I am getting with my makeup.  </li>
            <li> It has the same brightness, makeup lighting function, mirror size,( 6&amp;#34;x7&amp;#34;), and mirror flip feature for magnification, as old one.</li>
            <li> The mirror in the center switched from normal to magnified and the lights switched to different shades of color that were supposed to simulate the light conditions for whatever time of day</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an old Clairol True to Light that had broken after 30+ years.</li>
            <li> The plastic housing has a general cheaper feel to it, there are no options for wall mounting, the light covers look like they could pop off at any minute, and the light adjustment slide is choppy and rough to slide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The plastic that this is made out of looks a little cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a little slider that is supposed to change the light for day, office, home, etc.</li>
            <li> The light settings are decent, but I usually find the brightest setting and use that.  </li>
            <li> The center mirror flips around from regular to magnified and is fine.  </li>
            <li> I find when I use this make-up mirror, I miss the super mag of my other mirror, I am probably just used to it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Steer clear of this one.</li>
            <li> I can appreciate anything that helps the process of making myself presentable before heading out the door go that much smoother and faster, especially when getting makeup on in the AM.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be surprised in a bathroom mirror at the office...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m often wondering if I&#x27;m wearing too much make-up or not enough.  </li>
            <li> folding stand in the back is very temperamental and prone to collapsing.</li>
            <li> The daytime setting was just too dim compared to natural sunlight.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my 9 year old daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I therefore need to be  very close up and pull back, very close up and pull back and</li>
            <li> I did not feel that the extra views would benefit me much</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fun to try different make-up techniques with the different settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worse, the plastic isn&#x27;t nice plastic.</li>
            <li> It popped right back on, but I think it&#x27;s only a matter of time before it breaks permanently.</li>
            <li> and I went back to the normal mirror setting.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is big enough so that you can see your whole face, and you can zoom in, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;-the mirrors are clear and large enough to frame my entire (big and square)&lt;br /&gt;-I like that</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace my older Clairol lighted mirror (very similar appearance), to have a larger magnifier side.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is clear and the lights supposedly should last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Jerdon JGL7W appeared to have same features as old one,</li>
            <li> Hoping it lasts the same 20 years as old one.</li>
            <li> Also, obviously, you have to use it near an outlet.  </li>
            <li> This simply doesn&#x27;t work for me, and reminds me of the old time lighted mirror my Aunt had when I was a kid.</li>
            <li> frame seems to have been cannibalized from a different product line, because on the top center of the frame it says in black print \\&quot;Rotate flat mirror up</li>
            <li> frame seems to have been cannibalized from a different product line, because on the top center of the frame it says in black print \\&quot;Rotate flat mirror up</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being a near sighted woman who wears only glasses, I put my make on without my glasses obviously.</li>
            <li> find the mirror&#x27;s stand in the back to be so flimsy, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this didn&#x27;t last even 6 months before breaking.  </li>
            <li> Many years ago I had a Clairol lighted makeup mirror that swiveled up and down (NOT side to side) and it had an electric plugin for additional small appliances.  </li>
            <li> While it does come with an extra power outlet built into the front of the unit I am not sure it would be safe to plug anything into it because of the way the unit slides around when moved slightly.</li>
            <li> This mirror has a couple of useful features: the option to go to a 5 times magnification or stay with regular, lighting assimilation in various settings (home, office, day, etc.), back lighting to allow you to use this mirror with any (or no) light, and an outlet built into the mirror on lower left (in case you want to use heat tools for styling hair while in front of mirror), and a stand setup with various angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In addition to this angle, the mirror itself swivels with one side normal and the other side giving you 5x magnification.  </li>
            <li> old mirror used a low watt, chandelier type bulb right in the middle - which explains why the lighting was so poor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply stating that one needs to turn over the flat (1x) mirror and rotate the magnifying mirror (5x) into position.</li>
            <li> design size itself is decent looking; not too big and not to small, although a bit too big for my dresser or bathroom counter</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Rotate flat mirror up to close side</li>
            <li> The back has a wire that sits in a long plastic piece with ridges in it.  </li>
            <li> I am now awaiting to see how long this one will last.</li>
            <li> Lays flat against the wall and doesn&#x27;t stick out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sadly, it&#x27;s not as bright, the Daylight setting is a Pink light, and the color of the other settings are strange.  </li>
            <li> I have been wanting a lighted magnifying makeup mirror for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Well... a few things are different but the basic setup is the same.  </li>
            <li> This allows other appliances to be plugged in if the mirror is taking up the only outlet available.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts as long as the Clairol one!</li>
            <li> I have not used a makeup mirror in a very, very long time; however, wanted to try one to see how they have changed over the years.  </li>
            <li> Daylight (the bare fluorescent bulb), Office (+green), Evening (pinkish lavender, Home</li>
            <li> The 5x magnification is a joke-it will magnify slightly from the standard mirror on the flip side.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever used the plug-in feature on old one, so</li>
            <li> Other single mirror units swiveled side to side and didn&#x27;t allow for adjustments in mirror height.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a big waste of money.</li>
            <li> (if anyone has those anymore).&lt;br /&gt; - The color choices are minimally effective.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> &quot; Since I couldn&#x27;t find any side mirrors, I couldn&#x27;t figure out what needed to be  closed.</li>
            <li> - No real cons noted by any of us.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well not much, but it does happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, not really.</li>
            <li> There are only two mirror options, so I&#x27;m not sure if they are referring to one&#x27;s distance from the magnifying mirror, which, frankly, doesn&#x27;t work because of the issue with limited focal point of the concave mirror.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, this product has no positive features.</li>
            <li> My other make-up mirror uses batteries or electricity for the lighting and has a simple, small bulb.</li>
            <li> This mirror isn&#x27;t too big nor to small</li>
            <li> This is the 21st century counterpart of the Clairol \\&quot;True-To-Light\\&quot; make-up mirrors which came out in the late 60s - early 70s and were a \\&quot;must-have\\&quot; for all teens, at least at my school.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed that in other magnifying mirrors too&lt;</li>
            <li> My neighbor&#x27;s house was gutted due to a fire started by a magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li> I have my other mirror</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use ANY other mirror in my house than this one.</li>
            <li> One to hold the unit and the other to push the bar.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a plug in for other electrical appliances, but I am not sure this makeup mirror is sturdy enough to plug something like a curling iron in and move it around without making the mirror fall over so that is not useful to me.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself is small, smaller than an average hand mirror.</li>
            <li> The different color lighting is not much of use and in fact was a little weird as the \\&quot;office\\&quot; lighting was an eerie greenish light.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s my only complaint</li>
            <li> They seem exaggeratedly blueish or pinkish to me, but I cannot really asses their accuracy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They seem exaggeratedly blueish or pinkish to me, but I cannot really asses their accuracy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> also functions as an extension cord, but I couldn&#x27;t plug in my blow dryer upside down, because of the way they set up the plug.</li>
            <li> They should have made it so that you plug all of the appliances in upside down for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;+The plug is just a 2-pronged plug, and you can&#x27;t plug your stuff in upside down</li>
            <li> PROS - less mag distortion than others</li>
            <li> So you can go a little heavier on the make-up.</li>
            <li> I acquired this product through the Amazon Vine Program, although the usual green writing saying so may not appear above.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The magnification side of the mirror itself just looks a little &#x27;off&#x27; someone, too (hard to describe --</li>
            <li> There is also a big ugly PERMANENTLY PRINTED \\&quot;Rotate flat mirror up</li>
            <li> I am not sure where to purchase the lighting for this type of mirror should one of the lights go out.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it would work well on a vanity in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> The unit itself stands by using a small metal bar set into a backstand.</li>
            <li> However, I was not impressed with this product, especially knowing it sells for about 50 bucks.  </li>
            <li> At least I know I can leave the house not looking like I put clown makeup on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;By the way, do take their FIRE WARNING seriously:  </li>
            <li> hate the plastic piece in the back with the kickstand.</li>
            <li> I do not like the plastic strip that props the mirror up, limits where you can put the mirror as you have to allow room for that behind it.  </li>
            <li> Beyond the fact that this mirror is obviously the base for another product in the Jerdon line, I&#x27;m not such an idiot that I need a permanent reminder.  </li>
            <li> table-top mirror is easier than relying on the mirror behind the bathroom sink, for a couple of reasons.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;office\\&quot; setting is very green and makes one look quite sickly, like the wicked witch of the West in the Wizard of Oz.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m obviously not impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> Well, duh.&lt;br /&gt; - \\&quot;Florescent\\&quot; is spelled wrong on the box; it should be fluorescent.</li>
            <li> The 5x magnification was actually scary</li>
            <li> I was wrong in making this choice.</li>
            <li> My blind as a bat husband.</li>
            <li> (since Clairol sadly does not make their mirror anymore).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that spot is about 1 inch away from the mirror...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what some make-up mirrors are so expensive, but one day I&#x27;ll have to have a look at one just for comparison!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It seems very exaggerated and given that weekday mornings</li>
            <li> This makes it impossible to use the magnifying side of the mirror with the existing side lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want that 7 years bad</li>
            <li> My eyes aren&#x27;t bad, got a 20/20 thing going</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;office\\&quot; one is particularly bad, because the film is blue-green.</li>
            <li> The design of this product whose intent is to beautify is ugly.  </li>
            <li> It looks ugly and it doesn&#x27;t feel sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all. There is not enough light. I wish they would have put the wattage in the add.&lt;br /&gt;I hate the plastic piece in the back with the kickstand. It takes up too much room on the vanity because of the plastic  kickstand. I will continue to look for another mirror. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this.&lt;br /&gt;Those buttons at the bottom don&#x27;t change anything . It doesn&#x27;t matter if you have it on day, night or anything else.&lt;br /&gt;It was a big waste of money.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3VD13G7V0QI4U]]If you&#x27;re looking for an extremely powerful light and a square mirror that has a 5x flip side, then this is a great product. The mirror is big enough so that you can see your whole face, and you can zoom in, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is extremely powerful. This is good for being able to see every mark and blemish on your face, but it&#x27;s not so good for being able to look in the mirror without straining your eyes. It has four different color filters, which I thought was cool, so you can pick which color that you like the best. The colors don&#x27;t make too much of a difference, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic that this is made out of looks a little cheap. This is more of a useable product, rather than something that will look nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also functions as an extension cord, but I couldn&#x27;t plug in my blow dryer upside down, because of the way they set up the plug. See my video for how if I plug the blow dryer in, and put the mirror upright, then it&#x27;s lopsided. They should have made it so that you plug all of the appliances in upside down for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Powerful light. You&#x27;ll be able to see every mark and blemish on your face&lt;br /&gt;+Great 5x magnification on the reverse side&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;+The light might be too powerful&lt;br /&gt;+The plug is just a 2-pronged plug, and you can&#x27;t plug your stuff in upside down</li>
            <li> I had a similar style lighted mirror many years ago.  This mirror provides a more accurate light when applying makeup than mirrors that use two small bulbs.  Also, the sides of this mirror do not get hot while your are using it.  The mirror was just as advertised, arrived when promised and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Mirror has a magnifying side also.  Lighting could be a little better.  I do not like the plastic strip that props the mirror up, limits where you can put the mirror as you have to allow room for that behind it.  Especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about it.  I bought it to replace my older Clairol lighted mirror (very similar appearance), to have a larger magnifier side.  Sadly, it&#x27;s not as bright, the Daylight setting is a Pink light, and the color of the other settings are strange.  I wish the magnifier side was a bit stronger as well.</li>
            <li> I Purchased the Lighted Mirror for my Mother and she loves it she is very happy with it</li>
            <li> Nice mirror until the light bulbs blew within 45 days!</li>
            <li> Many years ago I had a Clairol lighted makeup mirror that swiveled up and down (NOT side to side) and it had an electric plugin for additional small appliances.  I loved it!  Since then I hadn&#x27;t found a makeup mirror that works like that one until now!  I&#x27;ve tried the units with the side mirrors, but they get in the way.  Other single mirror units swiveled side to side and didn&#x27;t allow for adjustments in mirror height.  The round pedestal lighted mirrors didn&#x27;t take up much space, but they didn&#x27;t give off much light either.  Now I have the perfect makeup mirror design again and the lighted unit is bright!  My eyes are dimming with age and I need the extra illumination.  I&#x27;m very happy with this mirror (in case you couldn&#x27;t tell)!</li>
            <li> This mirror is great for it&#x27;s size. I love seeing how my makeup looks in the different lighting options.</li>
            <li> I have a make-up mirror that has a 15 times mag mirror and for me, it&#x27;s perfect because I don&#x27;t have the best eyesight. This mirror is better for the younger set who doesn&#x27;t need the extra magnification to see. My daughter really loves this mirror and the different light settings are great for deciding how to wear make-up. When I was younger, I had a mirror like this with different settings for the light such as night time, and I remember the mirror as being really cool. I find when I use this make-up mirror, I miss the super mag of my other mirror, I am probably just used to it and like it better because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really appealing mirror to a teen or for someone in their twenties who goes out at night and perhaps spends time under florescent lighting, they can apply make-up accordingly and it&#x27;s fun to try different make-up techniques with the different settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror does require some space on a counter or table and it has a plug in cord. My other make-up mirror uses batteries or electricity for the lighting and has a simple, small bulb. I am not sure where to purchase the lighting for this type of mirror should one of the lights go out. I do like the style of the bulbs that are verticle on each side of the mirror for thorough lighting. This mirror is perfect for my daughter to apply her make-up and then flip the mirror if she needs to pluck her eyebrows. It&#x27;s very convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The design of this product whose intent is to beautify is ugly.  The product is inelegant, like a lump of white plastic.  There are more stylish makeup mirrors out there, fortunately.  You may differ in opinion as beauty is definitely in the eye of the beholder.</li>
            <li> Ok, I admit I was intrigued with the premise for this product--a makeup mirror with different levels of lighting for different environments, including settings for daytime, office, evening, and home. You just plug that mirror in, and move the white button to the setting which you prefer and the mirror turns on with the appropriate lighting. The mirror also has a builtt-in electrical outlet on the side, so while you&#x27;re putting on makeup, you can also connect a fan or whatever and blow or style your hair at the same time. The idea is good and the product is attractive. However, the mirror itself is kind of large and I can&#x27;t imagine dragging it around in my handbag when I&#x27;m going somewhere. The lighting itself varies from being too dim to being too bright--though I guess it&#x27;s meant to be that way, based on the various setting.</li>
            <li> I got the Jerdon JGL7W to replace a damaged Conair Illumina two-sided lighted make-up mirror.  The Jerdon is a compact version of the tri-fold models like the Conair.  Like the Conair, the Jerdon has 4 color settings - evening, day, office, home.  The mirror is two-sided and one side has magnification.  Interestingly, the mirror has an outlet you can use to connect small beauty appliances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always found the tri-fold design to be bulky and cumbersome, and I like this compact model better.  The light settings are decent, but I usually find the brightest setting and use that.  The lights could be focused / angled more toward the center, or adjustable.  The mirror itself is sort of flimsy looking and although not as bulky as a tri-fold, still a large footprint for valuable bathroom counter real-estate.  I think this mirror would be perfect for a teen.  Mine spends most of its life in the closet.</li>
            <li> This mirror is the first one that allowed me to put on makeup with my contacts inserted. This is huge for a near sighted person. You cannot insert your contacts after applying eye makeup. Sometimes I wear just one for this reason. Now i don&#x27;t have to compromise . I used the magnifying side of the mirror although my first reaction was terror at all the wrinkles and lines that jumped out at me. Soon I tried the lighting selections and went with the evening lighting option for the event I was going to attend. I was able to apply my makeup and the eye makeup went well. The best part was that later my husband commented that when he was sitting across from me he was struck by how great my face looked! He had no idea that I had a new routine with the Jerdon mirror. I am inspired to now actually pluck my own eyebrows. The mirror will be a part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I acquired this product through the Amazon Vine Program, although the usual green writing saying so may not appear above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every hotel I&#x27;ve ever used a swivel mirror at, the maid puts it back so that it tilts toward the floor every day.  So for once, it&#x27;s nice to be able to have some control.  Even as a guy, I find these types of mirrors quite useful for putting in contacts and making a quick check to see if I missed a spot shaving or if a nose hair is below where it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the lights and mirror on this product - the obvious most important parts - are of pretty good quality from a functional standpoint.  The mirror is clear and the lights supposedly should last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, everything else I find less appealing:  There is a permanent sticker on the top that says \\&quot;Rotate flat mirror up to close side mirrors\\&quot;.  Beyond the fact that this mirror is obviously the base for another product in the Jerdon line, I&#x27;m not such an idiot that I need a permanent reminder.  A removable sticker would have sufficed.  The plastic housing has a general cheaper feel to it, there are no options for wall mounting, the light covers look like they could pop off at any minute, and the light adjustment slide is choppy and rough to slide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it annoys me that they put a two-prong outlet on the front of the device with another marking that says 1400w max.  How many of you girls know the wattages of all your other bathroom appliances?  To me, this is at best a nuisance and at worst a fire hazard.  Would have been better just to make the device&#x27;s cord 14 gauge and make the outlet a full grounded 15a outlet, and then no marking would be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m obviously not impressed with this product.  But truthfully, I&#x27;d try another Jerdon product, just not in this style.  I say that because the mirror itself seems to be just right.  I&#x27;d be interested to see if their hotel style, metal framed flip mirrors have a betterfeel to them.</li>
            <li> This mirror isn&#x27;t too big nor to small but I&#x27;m not sure it would work well on a vanity in the bathroom. It does take up some space so that&#x27;s something to consider. I have a lot of space so for me it&#x27;s perfect. I use it Dailey for hair and makeup. Love the extra outlet and lighting. I wish the magnify was more but that&#x27;s my only complaint, I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and sight isn&#x27;t what it used to be!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a keeper, but it really isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s cheaply made and rather bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt; - There is a convenience outlet on the mirror&#x27;s frame. This allows other appliances to be plugged in if the mirror is taking up the only outlet available.&lt;br /&gt; - The stand is adjustable, allowing for different angles that will accommodate the user&#x27;s position.&lt;br /&gt; - The mirror is two-sided - one side is 1x and one is 5x.&lt;br /&gt; - There is a slider to change the lights&#x27; hue: Daylight (the bare fluorescent bulb), Office (+green), Evening (pinkish lavender, Home (full pink - flesh)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt; - It&#x27;s just cheap-looking and not terribly sturdy.&lt;br /&gt; - It&#x27;s too big to fit on most bathroom countertops or dressing tables (if anyone has those anymore).&lt;br /&gt; - The color choices are minimally effective.&lt;br /&gt; - The box indicates that there are three options for magnification: 1x, 5x, or 10x. There are only two mirror options, so I&#x27;m not sure if they are referring to one&#x27;s distance from the magnifying mirror, which, frankly, doesn&#x27;t work because of the issue with limited focal point of the concave mirror.&lt;br /&gt; - There are instructions on the frame: \\&quot;Rotate flat mirror up to close side mirrors.\\&quot; Since I couldn&#x27;t find any side mirrors, I couldn&#x27;t figure out what needed to be  closed. Then I realized \\&quot;close\\&quot; is an adjective not a verb. It&#x27;s simply stating that one needs to turn over the flat (1x) mirror and rotate the magnifying mirror (5x) into position. Well, duh.&lt;br /&gt; - \\&quot;Florescent\\&quot; is spelled wrong on the box; it should be fluorescent. Oh yeah. I take off points for spelling.&lt;br /&gt; - There are two 6 watt fluorescent bulbs that, according to the instructions, \\&quot;should never need replacing.\\&quot; This is followed by instructions stating that should they need replacing, the unit must be returned to the factory or installed by \\&quot;competent electrical appliance personnel.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this might work for a young girl who&#x27;s playing with make-up, but really doesn&#x27;t seem to fit an adult&#x27;s lifestyle, at least not as a product that is prominently displayed. Perhaps it could be used temporarily, placed back in its box, and put in the closet.</li>
            <li> Got this mirror for my wife but she was not too impressed with the product. She mentioned that the only useful feature was the 5X magnification to check on the pores of her skin. The different color lighting is not much of use and in fact was a little weird as the \\&quot;office\\&quot; lighting was an eerie greenish light. The Day, Evening and Home modes were ok, but does not make much difference as she wears light make-up.</li>
            <li> This Jerdon Euro Tabletop Two-Sided Lighted Mirror is a favorite with my daughters. They like the more sleek design without the side mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - The two-sided mirror allows for magnification when needed for personal grooming. The girls feel the 4-light settings have been accurate when used for getting ready for nights out versus days at work and days outside at school/the park, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - No real cons noted by any of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror now resides on the desk next to the laptop and receives daily use.  That pretty much sums up how much it is utilized and appreciated.  It&#x27;s not sitting under a sink or out of sight.</li>
            <li> My daughters have a cute little antique looking two sided make up mirror in their room and thought I should give this a try for myself.  First of all this would be perfect for a vanity counter top since standing and hunching over isn&#x27;t the best idea.  Sitting and looking into it without straining would be ideal.  I like having some extra light during the early mornings when I don&#x27;t have natural light coming into the bathroom.  You have several options; home, day, office, &amp; evening with each setting having a different hue.  Since you have to plug this is, it&#x27;s nice that you can also plug something else into it even though I haven&#x27;t had to yet.  The 5x magnification was actually scary and I went back to the normal mirror setting.  Yes, it&#x27;s plastic and isn&#x27;t that appealing to look at but it has a function and does just that.  It would be nice if it looked good sitting on the bathroom counter, but it just doesn&#x27;t.  If you don&#x27;t care that it&#x27;s a bulky plastic mirror then this is for you.</li>
            <li> The Jerdon Euro Tabletop lighted mirror with 4 light settings is a very helpful in applying makeup for any occasion.The changing light option is very helpful as a regular mirror can only reflect the room light. This is especially helpful when applying eye make up. I highly recommend it for getting your best face on.</li>
            <li> This is the 21st century counterpart of the Clairol \\&quot;True-To-Light\\&quot; make-up mirrors which came out in the late 60s - early 70s and were a \\&quot;must-have\\&quot; for all teens, at least at my school.  The gimmick was that the mirror had four light settings:  day, office, evening and home which supposedly allowed you to put on your make-up in the light you were going to be seen in.  Jerdon is re-creating these mirrors for today&#x27;s woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is relatively sturdy, and has a two-sided mirror which makes it nice for getting eyelashes out of your eye or plucking your eyebrows or seeing how gross that pimple really looks.  But the only light I ever use is the brightest one, which is day.  I never switch to the others, and I have never known anyone who did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is slightly smaller than the ones with swing-out doors, which might be nice to save on counter space, but is not so cool when it comes to keeping the mirror clean, especially if you use dusting powder or hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra plug-in on the front is handy, and the mirror has held up to usage thus far by three college-age girls and one harried mom, so it seems to be doing okay in the sturdiness department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer mentioned, it&#x27;s a pain that the consumer can&#x27;t change the light bulbs when they go out.  So that&#x27;s a drawback.</li>
            <li> Jerdon brand seems exactly the same as brand I replaced. I was hesitant to purchase online, but the brand replacement I bought locally was not as bright as the one I had. Returned it, began an online search.  Jerdon JGL7W appeared to have same features as old one, so glad I took the chance. It has the same brightness, makeup lighting function, mirror size,( 6&amp;#34;x7&amp;#34;), and mirror flip feature for magnification, as old one. It does take up counter room, which is not a problem for me as mine sits on a makeup table tucked into my closet.( I don&#x27;t like looking at makeup scattered over counter, dressers, etc)  I hardly ever used the plug-in feature on old one, so doubt will with this one. Hoping it lasts the same 20 years as old one. Delivery was fast, and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Getting ready in the morning can be a stressful time.  I can appreciate anything that helps the process of making myself presentable before heading out the door go that much smoother and faster, especially when getting makeup on in the AM.  This mirror has a couple of useful features: the option to go to a 5 times magnification or stay with regular, lighting assimilation in various settings (home, office, day, etc.), back lighting to allow you to use this mirror with any (or no) light, and an outlet built into the mirror on lower left (in case you want to use heat tools for styling hair while in front of mirror), and a stand setup with various angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the places it could improve: \\&quot;office\\&quot; light setting is very bluish to me.  It seems very exaggerated and given that weekday mornings I am doing my makeup for this setting, I rather use the \\&quot;day\\&quot; setting which looks more natural.  Additionally, the size of the mirror is a bit large.  The side panels seem designed a bit in excess, even taking into account the side lights.  It can be a bit of challenge to store the mirror due to its dimensions, so if the area you plan to use this mirror is constrained, be sure to measure before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I have not used a makeup mirror in a very, very long time; however, wanted to try one to see how they have changed over the years.  This is very similar to one I had a long time ago except that it has 5X magnification which is very helpful to me since I wear glasses and sometimes cannot see exactly how much coverage I am getting with my makeup.  You can flip the mirror from normal magnification to 5X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slider bar at the bottom allows you to change color from Daylight, Office, Evening and Home.  Since I do not have a lot of natural light in my bathroom, the Daylight works great.  At least I know I can leave the house not looking like I put clown makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a plug in for other electrical appliances, but I am not sure this makeup mirror is sturdy enough to plug something like a curling iron in and move it around without making the mirror fall over so that is not useful to me.</li>
            <li> If you have plenty of space on a dressing table you might like this mirror.  It has to sit on a counter and it takes a lot of space.  The back has a wire that sits in a long plastic piece with ridges in it.  The ridges allow you to adjust the angle of the mirror.  In addition to this angle, the mirror itself swivels with one side normal and the other side giving you 5x magnification.  On either side of the mirror are lights and there is a slider on the bottom that adjusts a filter over the lights to adjust the color of the light.  This is a nice feature so you can apply your makeup according to whether you are going out at night, during the day, party, etc.  The mirror does not use batteries so you need an outlet close by.  It has a very nice feature on the front where you can plug in another appliance so you don&#x27;t lose the an outlet to this mirror.  Personally, I prefer a mirror that attaches to the wall and can be adjusted higher and lower, etc.  I set this one on the bathroom counter top and there was no way I could use it.  But if I had a dressing table that I sat down to use, this would be okay.  Again, the stand portion of it takes a lot of space.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better. I thought to save space on my makeup table to try this makeup mirror that doesn&#x27;t have the side mirrors. I was wrong in making this choice. The side mirrors add more light to the facial area and therefore make applying your skincare and makeup more flawless. This one doesn&#x27;t give off enough light, and the light selections are poor-they are not true to life and are lacking in brightness. The 5x magnification is a joke-it will magnify slightly from the standard mirror on the flip side. I&#x27;m glad I got this as an Amazon item to review and didn&#x27;t waste money on it. I recommend people to get the mirrors that have the side folding mirrors attached for better lighting.</li>
            <li> The best feature on this mirror is the different lighting. How many times have I put on make-up and then go out in florescent lighting and look like a clown? Well not much, but it does happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror has a handy dandy switch that you can go from:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Home - Office - Outside - Night - so you can tailor your make-up for your different looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Office and Outside you should make sure that the make-up is light because harsh lighting accentuates all the not-so-happy parts. Night is more forgiving of course. We all look hot in the dark right? So you can go a little heavier on the make-up. The low-lighting of home is also a bit more forgiving and this mirror showcases this. Oops -- your pores are showing. Don&#x27;t be surprised in a bathroom mirror at the office...fix it at home before you go out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a nice plug on the front - so even though you plug this one in, you aren&#x27;t losing a much need bathroom plug. Probably best used for something that doesn&#x27;t move so much, I wouldn&#x27;t yank things around with the mirror. You don&#x27;t want that 7 years bad luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnification thing. My eyes aren&#x27;t bad, got a 20/20 thing going and personally I don&#x27;t want to get that close to my pores...so that isn&#x27;t that useful for me. Guess who uses it though? My blind as a bat husband. He says it is very handy for popping his contacts in, especially since he can barely see his hands.</li>
            <li> I was super looking forward to trying this mirror.  I don&#x27;t have a lighted mirror and I&#x27;m often wondering if I&#x27;m wearing too much make-up or not enough.  There&#x27;s a huge difference between the look when I put on my make-up in my well lit but no natural light bathroom and when I get in the car.  In the bathroom, I think I&#x27;ve put so much on and then when I get out to my car, it doesn&#x27;t look nearly enough.  I thought, \\&quot;finally, I&#x27;ll get it right.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- design size itself is decent looking; not too big and not to small, although a bit too big for my dresser or bathroom counter&lt;br /&gt;-the mirrors are clear and large enough to frame my entire (big and square)&lt;br /&gt;-I like that I can plug it in&lt;br /&gt;-the extra outlet in the front is nice and useful&lt;br /&gt;- easy on/off in the front&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-the design is cheap looking and chintzy&lt;br /&gt;- the color is \\&quot;meh\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;-the light settings are not really reminiscent of the places they are supposed to mimic, in fact, they are quite off&lt;br /&gt;-the magnification looks very distorted and weirded but I&#x27;ve noticed that in other magnifying mirrors too&lt;br /&gt;- the lights on the sides don&#x27;t fold in, kind of lights the room better than my face&lt;br /&gt;-the folding stand in the back is very temperamental and prone to collapsing. I would have like it better if I could have figured out a way to hang it.</li>
            <li> This Jerdon JGL7W Euro Tabletop Two-Sided Lighted Makeup Mirror has an excellent 5x magnification mirror plus a regular mirror on the opposite side. I wear glasses and find the 5x magnification just perfect for detail work. However, I found all 4 of the lighting settings to be lacking. Honestly the evening, daytime, home and office settings just did not seem like any sort of lighting I have experienced. The daytime setting was just too dim compared to natural sunlight. The unit itself stands by using a small metal bar set into a backstand. I found this to be a bit flimsy. While it does come with an extra power outlet built into the front of the unit I am not sure it would be safe to plug anything into it because of the way the unit slides around when moved slightly. I like the mirrors but tend to use it in another room that has much better lighting than using the built-in lighting.</li>
            <li> This one of those products that looks better on the picture than it really is.&lt;br /&gt;This was used mainly by my mom and she was&#x27;nt impressed with it, as she did&#x27;nt care for the lights on the product.&lt;br /&gt;I guess this mirror might be liked more than others, but most of the time my mom goes back to to tradtional bathroom mirror.&lt;br /&gt;She does use it once and a while though, when the bathroom is occupied.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, this product was&#x27;nt a big hit in our household, its just okay.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a lighted magnifying makeup mirror for a long time.  However, I was not impressed with this product, especially knowing it sells for about 50 bucks.  It feels kind of cheap and plastic-y.  The center mirror flips around from regular to magnified and is fine.  The lighting \\&quot;scene\\&quot; is changed by sliding the bar under the mirror, which simply rotates a colored filter in front of the two fluorescent sidelights.  I did not find any of the lighting settings to be very natural.  The \\&quot;office\\&quot; setting is very green and makes one look quite sickly, like the wicked witch of the West in the Wizard of Oz.  The mirror is also kind of clunky and not very modern looking.  Overall, just an okay product.  I will keep looking for a more suitable lighted vanity mirror.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an old Clairol True to Light that had broken after 30+ years. It&#x27;s a bit wider than that one but everything else is similar- I like the 5x magnification- it&#x27;s just enough for eyebrow tweezing without distortion. Light is bright but doesn&#x27;t get hot. I usually only use the &#x27;day&#x27; setting which is the brightest. I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of months- I hope it lasts as long as the Clairol one!</li>
            <li> This mirror is good for a vanity or large surface. It has an adjust mechanism on the back that needs room. The lighting choices are good and now I put my make up on in good light!</li>
            <li> PROS - less mag distortion than others&lt;br /&gt;CONS - no wall mount, lights aimed wrong&lt;br /&gt;This table-top mirror is easier than relying on the mirror behind the bathroom sink, for a couple of reasons.  First, it is more relaxing to sit at a table, and secondly you can flip the mirror between unmagnified and 5X magnification.  One thing they did right:  there does not seem to be distortion in the magnifying mirror, which is a problem I have noticed with some magnifying mirrors at the drugstore.  So it is good as far as it goes, but could be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, do take their FIRE WARNING seriously:  My neighbor&#x27;s house was gutted due to a fire started by a magnifying mirror.  There is a removable warning sticker on the magnifying mirror itself, but I repositioned it to the frame where it will always be seen no matter the position of the magnifying mirror (I could imagine someone leaving the magnifying portion facing a window where later in the day the sun comes in).  The rule in our house is that magnifying mirrors are always stored face down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ISSUES:&lt;br /&gt;Being lighted is good, but the lights on this product are not that strong, and are easily washed out by incidental window light (unless it is a grey cloudy day).  Also, obviously, you have to use it near an outlet.  Now days there are so many battery operated fluorescent and LED lights that it would be nice if this item were battery operated also to avoid the hassle of finding a wall socket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I want magnification, the 5X magnification is not as comfortable for me as 7X magnification I have my other mirror (I rarely use reading glasses, only if I need to do very fine things like unpick threads from sewing, etc., so my eyes aren&#x27;t that weak).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lights don&#x27;t seem to be aimed in the right direction.  When I move my face closer to see the detail I am looking for, the lights only illuminate the sides of my face, and most of my face is unlighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They offer different color filters depending on what kind of light you are going to be in.  They seem exaggeratedly blueish or pinkish to me, but I cannot really asses their accuracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way the mirror flips between regular and magnified precludes mounting on a wall.  I would be nice if they designed it differently to permit the option of wall mounting so I don&#x27;t have to keep setting it up on my dining table and putting it away (I do not have a dedicated make-up table).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The frame seems to have been cannibalized from a different product line, because on the top center of the frame it says in black print \\&quot;Rotate flat mirror up to close side mirrors\\&quot;  -- but there are no side mirrors on this item !!ent color filters depending on what kind of light you are going to be in.

            <li> Very surprised at this Jerdon lighted makeup mirror.  My sister is 8 years older then me and when we were younger my parents bought her a mirror EXACTLY like this for her 16th birthday.  Well... a few things are different but the basic setup is the same.  The adjustable settings for lighting in daytime, evening, home and office environments is hilarious because the selections couldn&#x27;t be more off!  The mirror takes up so much space on the countertop and the added outlet on the side would never be used in our household as the mirror isn&#x27;t very sturdy and could fall off the countertop if the wind blew.  One bright spot:  the 5x magnification.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Granddaughter and she just loves it. Perfect size, great lighting and the plug in front is great to plug in hair dryer. She uses it every day.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my 9 year old daughter and she loves it. It works great and it fit on her Cubie desk perfectly!</li>
            <li> Like most devices made in China, this product is of unacceptably low quality in terms of endurance. One month after it was delivered and after I had used it only 2 or 3 times, the left mirror lamp died. My previous U. S.-made mirror worked perfectly for almost ten years and then I decided to purchase something more modern. As the instructions specified, a user should not try to replace the lamp, so I returned it to Amazon that, promptly and thankfully, sent me a replacement mirror.  I am now awaiting to see how long this one will last.</li>
            <li> The good,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has many tilt adjustments levels.&lt;br /&gt;Works adequately in a well externally lit space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side lights do not move or tilt so I cannot adjust where the light hits my face when I am closer or farther from the mirror. This makes it impossible to use the magnifying side of the mirror with the existing side lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a near sighted woman who wears only glasses, I put my make on without my glasses obviously. I therefore need to be  very close up and pull back, very close up and pull back and the Jerdon Euro Style rigid Lighted Makeup Mirror does not provide enough light at various distances (we are talking to a varience of inches) to apply my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would work well for someone who wears contacts, or without a vision issue.</li>
            <li> With the Jerdon Euro Style Makeup Mirror, I have makeup that looks great and that I am able to really focus on when I an putting it on.  This lighted mirror has made my life really easy when I am trying to look great in the morning.</li>
            <li> My beloved and trusty Clairol True to Light is starting to die (one of the light bars won&#x27;t come on half of the time) so I started searching for a replacement mirror. The True to Light was bright and well made, lasting over 30 years, so I hoped I could find another make up mirror that would work as well, afterall, surely the technology has improved in 30 years? Well, not really. First I tried Conair (since Clairol sadly does not make their mirror anymore). The Conair wasn&#x27;t as bright and lacked the much needed outlet on the front to plug your blow dryer or curling iron into. Then I fortunately came across this mirror. The brightness is much, much better than other mirrors and similar to that of the True to Light. Also, it has the much needed electrical outlet on the front for your accessories. The magnification is 5X, which is more than enough to see what you need to see in the mirror. I highly recommend this mirror as a worthy successor to the True to Light!!</li>
            <li> Im pretty picky and have searched all over the internet for the right one. Here are my review bullet points:&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;No distortion in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Good size, you can see your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;The light filters help you with makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;The switch is easy to press on and off.&lt;br /&gt;The light gradually gets brighter (must be the fluorescent) After its warmed up, the brightness level is just right- bright enough to see your pores but not blinding.&lt;br /&gt;It has a back stand which I decided not to use. Instead I taped up the back and mounted it to my wall. So its nice they designed it to have this option in mind. Lays flat against the wall and doesn&#x27;t stick out.&lt;br /&gt;The bulbs don&#x27;t get hot.&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;The design is quite an eyesore. It&#x27;s clunky, dated looking, doesn&#x27;t match any home decor, and looks cheap.&lt;br /&gt;You cant adjust the level of brightness.&lt;br /&gt;The plug in outlet seems useless.&lt;br /&gt;The lever to shift the light filters back and forth is cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> I am so displeased with this product that I am earnestly baffled that it has any positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it&#x27;s huge and more than half the size is the plastic frame part. The mirror itself is small, smaller than an average hand mirror. Worse, the plastic isn&#x27;t nice plastic. It looks ugly and it doesn&#x27;t feel sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine also has a message *printed* into the plastic that says \\&quot;Rotate mirror up to close side panels\\&quot; - only this model doesn&#x27;t actually have side panels. That screams cheap to me. Like the company used leftover parts to make this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a little slider that is supposed to change the light for day, office, home, etc. But just moves a colored film in front of the light bulbs. Not helpful at all. The \\&quot;office\\&quot; one is particularly bad, because the film is blue-green. No office looks like that. Perhaps if they called it \\&quot;aquarium\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;The slider and films also feel flimsy and rickety; the sliding motion isn&#x27;t smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror has a 5x side, you can rotate it so that side is facing front. But, like most magnifying mirrors, you have to be in the exact right spot to get a clear picture. Unfortunately, that spot is about 1 inch away from the mirror... which means the light bulbs are right next to you, shining in your eyes and not lighting your face evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lights are really bright. Other than that, this product has no positive features. I&#x27;d rather use ANY other mirror in my house than this one.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice compact cosmetic mirror that would fit on almost any vanity table or shelf. The mirrors are bright and clear, and the magnifier is 5X which gives you a huge, HD quality look at yourself, whether you want it or not. It&#x27;s great for doing makeup or spa treatments that require a good look at your pores. The light is adjustable to four different settings, but I&#x27;ve never found those that useful in doing makeup. The brightest one is my choice most of the time.  One nice extra is the electrical outlet on the front of the frame. You can plug your hair dryer or flat iron into it there very easily, without having to dig for the outlet on the wall. I&#x27;d recommend this if you can handle seeing yourself in such great detail.</li>
            <li> This mirror is bulky and feels cheaply made.  It has four different light settings and 2 mirrored sides.  The lights are on a slide that requires using both hands.  One to hold the unit and the other to push the bar.  If you try one handed you&#x27;ll simply push the unit off the counter.  The lights are on each side and don&#x27;t move.  The mirror is two sided and flips from normal to 5x&#x27;s magnification.  This design would be for use on a dressing table, where you could sit in front of it.  I stand in front of the bathroom mirror to apply makeup and tweeze brows.  There is no way I can stand and angle the mirror to reflect the lights needed to use.  This simply doesn&#x27;t work for me, and reminds me of the old time lighted mirror my Aunt had when I was a kid.</li>
            <li> This makeup mirror is just like the one your mom had in the 60s, but now it&#x27;s even cheaper and flimsier!  Hooray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the mirror&#x27;s stand in the back to be so flimsy, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this didn&#x27;t last even 6 months before breaking.  The magnification side of the mirror itself just looks a little &#x27;off&#x27; someone, too (hard to describe -- sort of a &#x27;fun house&#x27; effect?)  There is also a big ugly PERMANENTLY PRINTED \\&quot;Rotate flat mirror up to close side mirrors\\&quot; just above the mirror (yes, printed on the white plastic itself -- and no, it&#x27;s not a removable sticker!)  This part is especially amusing, since there ARE no side mirrors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steer clear of this one.</li>
            <li> Great purchase! Love to tweeze my eyebrows using the magnified side with the light and putting on makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!</li>
            <li> It is a very nice mirror with day, evening, office settings a nice magnifying glass, i just wish it were brighter.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this mirror in place of one that I had been using . My old mirror was another brand oval shaped and, although it had a 7X mirror, it also had very poor(for my myopic eyes) lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In looking for a cost effective replacement I decided that I did not  need the additional two mirror wings that  another Jerdon mirror style offered. I did not feel that the extra views would benefit me much and so I chose the one without the &#x27;wings&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;This model has light settings that simulate day light,  office lighting (what a green hued fright!), home lighting and evening light (think a restaurant or date night). Quite honestly, although the other lighting modes may be fun to have a look at, the only mode I use is day light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old mirror used a low watt, chandelier type bulb right in the middle - which explains why the lighting was so poor. The Jerdon mirror uses what I consider to the more standard two upright bulbs; one on each side. I find that the  Jerdon mirror&#x27;s light is a big  improvement; clearer and brighter. I was concerned that the 5X magnification would not be sufficient, but it&#x27;s really a good amount of magnification, and I am pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am very pleased with this Jerdon mirror. I think I was right about not needing the extra mirror wings, and I am really happy about the brighter lighting. I can&#x27;t imagine what some make-up mirrors are so expensive, but one day I&#x27;ll have to have a look at one just for comparison!&lt;br /&gt;This mirror can take up a lot of counter space - which I don&#x27;t really have to spare. I found that I can fold it up, lay it on it&#x27;s side and keep it on the counter easily enough - that way it&#x27;s there ready to set up when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Jerdon mirror is more than adequate, has good lighting and good magnification and is, I believe, a good buy at the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for 4 rather than 5 stars? I am not all that fond of the plastic that is used. It feels kind of light to me. That being said - it certainly would not,should not, be a deal breaker for anyone.t to me. That being said - it certainly would not,should not, be a deal breaker for anyone.</li>
            <li> I remember my Mom had a lighted make-up vanity in the 80&#x27;s. The mirror in the center switched from normal to magnified and the lights switched to different shades of color that were supposed to simulate the light conditions for whatever time of day you were applying make-up for. This mirror is exactly the same thing. It even had the same eighties look to it. It is lightweight and feels kind of cheap, and the light colors don&#x27;t change easily. It sticks when you are switching from one time of day to another. The knob actually flew off the first time I used it. It popped right back on, but I think it&#x27;s only a matter of time before it breaks permanently.</li>
            <li> I had a Jerdon mirror previously and absolutely loved it, but rarely used the side mirrors. So, this version is ideal since it has no side mirrors. The magnified side is perfect for putting on makeup, and I love the 4-light settings. The quality is high, and it looks just fine sitting out on my bathroom vanity. Guests can use it, too! I highly recommend this mirror. I will continue to use Jerdon products.</li>
