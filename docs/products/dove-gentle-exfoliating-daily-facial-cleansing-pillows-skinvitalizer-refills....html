            <li> I bought this little cleaner for my teenage son to help make it a little more fun to wash his face in the shower.  He loves this little gizmo!  The refills are very hard to find at drugstores and grocery stores where I used to buy them all the time. I&#x27;m grateful to finally find them here.  His face really clears up after he uses these and the soap is gentle for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these exfoliating pillows. They leave your complexion glowing. One side takes off any makeup residue your makeup remover leaves behind, the other buffs off dead skin cells. You can&#x27;t find these in the stores and Amazon sellers are charging a small fortune for them (more than 10 times what I used to pay at the drugstore). Dove, PLEASE bring these back!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you do realize that you used to be able to buy this product for a few dollars when it was available at the store.  Why are you TRYING to take such advantage of people?</li>
            <li> So sad this item has been discontinued.... love it for my skin. Scrubs away all the crustiness and leaves smooth face!</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find. But I&#x27;m glad I found it.  I decided to try a new way to wash my face and the revitalizer caught my eye. Ever since I have been on a hunt for the refills and I finally found them.  I love them, i love them, i love them!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but these exfoliating pillows, along with the exfoliator itself, do not bother my skin.  It also feels clean and moisturized afterwards (I have dry skin too, so I wasn&#x27;t sure about this).  Now I just love it.</li>
            <li> It was impossible to locate these refills in any area stores.  The refills were rec&#x27;d and work well in the dove facial massager that I purchases many months ago.  A great ptoduct that seems to have been discontinued unfortuately!</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that this product has been discontinued.  I found it to be so convenient and easy to use as well as a very effective daily cleanser.  I have tried numerous other products after no longer being able to get this and have not found anything that I liked as well.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely a great facial cleanser. I hate that Dove discontinued this product as I started using it two yrs ago. My problem here is that because it is not on the stores, which a 2-pack of 14 pillows used to cost $7.94, the price for this item has sky-rocketed. I find it appalling that the mark up is over 300%. I love this product, but will not support this pricing. I have written to Dove company asking to bring this product back, but will not buy it here at this price. Have a beautiful face!!!</li>
            <li> I love these little pillows, they are great just wet with warm water, one side gently exfoliates, flip it over, the other side seems to buff your face leaving it smooth. toss it rinse you face and your skin feels  and looks great.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter who swears by its performance. It kept her face looking so clean, clear and spotless. She&#x27;s just 13 yrs.</li>
            <li> i have not received this product. i ordered it on June 16th and one month later i still have not received my item. i have tried to contact seller but received very little assistance.</li>
            <li> This product is very great.</li>
            <li> I just love this product, it makes my skin feel clean and glowing. I just have a hard time finding it in retail stores.</li>
            <li> I have used Dove products for a long time.  All their products are great.  The Cleansing Pillows works great.  Once upon a time these products were sold in stores, I wonder why they stop.  Please re-start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dewanda</li>
            <li> I have used these for years. I have extremely  sensitive skin and the pillows do not irritate my skin. I get a nice glow to my skin and they exfoliate the dead cells without actually irritating my skin. I wish Dove still made the product There were very inexpensive when Dove did. These were outrageously priced, but I liked them so much, I purchased them anyway as Amazon was the only place I could find them.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find extra product for this cleansing device for my teen.age son. It is gentle enough for him to use daily. I was surprised that they were spittle pricey though.</li>
            <li> With all the health problems and limitations I now have this is the one product I found for helping my now painfully dry skin.. I understand the company stopped making it...

            <li> This is a rip off. These were a few dollars when in store. Now this merchant wants to rip people off. Ridiculous and appalling that A allows it. First rev was not allowed from A.</li>
            <li> I expected case containing several of the pictured boxes.  This was very expensive and only contained one little box which holds perhaps a dozen pads.

            <li> I love this product, and have used it for many, many years.  It&#x27;s really too bad that Dove has found it necessary to discontinue making it available.  I won&#x27;t pay this price Amazon has it listed for.</li>
