            <li> Lovely body wash, I do not need to use body lotion like I have been for years as it is not drying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not made in Hawaii. I think it&#x27;s a little misleading to label it as Hawaiian. There are plenty of local artisans in Hawaii who employ local people and who offer genuinely, made-in-Hawaii products.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> Does not smell anything like passion fruit, can barely smell anything and it dries my skin out more. i will go back to the alba very emolient body wash</li>
            <li> SMELLS AMAZING....LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Great product that replaced my selma hyak Nuance body wash that was discontinued .  Alba body wash is great and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for body that does not have all that &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; in it. I have tried some other brands and really like this one. Smells good, makes good soap and still does the job unlike some other kinds.</li>
            <li> smells freakin delicious and its cheap. what more could i ask for?</li>
            <li> Great product, even for those with sensitive skin. Wonderful and clean feeling with fresh scent. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I use this body wash alot i use to get it from the health food store, but now i seen it on amazon for a cheaper price i will buy it from there. It has a nice fruity smell which doesnt dry your skin out and it leaves smelling sweet all day. My all time favorite body wash</li>
            <li> This is the best it smell awesome and its gentle its great for kids and people with sensitive skin the price is not bad either so I&#x27;d say buy this you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> Its like taking a shower in HAWAII. The smell is out of this world delicious. You feel tropical and fresh. Get this! you wont be disappointed !</li>
            <li> Smells great but came  opened in a bag..and the body wash all in the sealed bag and on the outside....Yuck..what a mess..looking  for another seller..when I need more..</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had a roommate over the summer who had this and I loved the smell so much that I remembered it four months later and bought some for myself. I would definitely recommend because it smells so good.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible!  The consistency of cleanser is like water.  No lather and the fragrance is putrid.  Do not buy!</li>
            <li> Will not buy. The designation of natural and organics is deceiving. Their products contain phenoxyethanol, which can be harmful to kids if swallowed and parabens that have been linked to cancer and early puberty in girls.</li>
            <li> I have used this Body Wash for years. I love it. It smells really good and the size of the bottle and the strong pump are just right for dispensing shower gel efficiently.  I can&#x27;t believe anyone uses hand held bottles to dispense shower gel. How is that practical or pleasant?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many body washes but I always go back to this one.  I used to purchase in wholefoods but they keep raising the price.  The smell is amazing and will wear well with any perfume or body lotion.  This cleanses my skin well but doesn&#x27;t dry it.  It&#x27;s a must have in my bath products.</li>
            <li> My favorite body wash!  Fast shipping!</li>
