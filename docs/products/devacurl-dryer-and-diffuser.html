    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Have a great day !</li>
            <li>Best blow dryer for curly hair that I&#x27;ve found &amp; when used along with devacurl products.  </li>
            <li>It stays on perfectly!.  </li>
            <li>The dryer has the perfect heat for diffuser.  </li>
            <li>it works great!  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s awesome for me.  </li>
            <li>Best dryer on the market</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s engineered perfectly for activating curl shape and feeping it</li>
            <li>This was very intelligently designed.  </li>
            <li>But after getting my hair done by curly girl trained person and her showing me how to do it and with this awesome blow dryer</li>
            <li>(best cut I&#x27;ve had in 53 yrs!!)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li>Awesome!!</li>
            <li>This is the perfect dryer for &amp;#</li>
            <li>The Deva Curl products are all wonderful</li>
            <li>What works best for one might not work for another.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li>Works great with my curls (botticelli type)!</li>
            <li>but happy wife, happy life!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li>Great product and service.</li>
            <li>great hairdryer &amp; diffuser.  </li>
            <li>but I am happy with this product despite its steep price and not providing a miracle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a &amp;#34;after product&amp;#34;, so if you can recommend me a devacurl product that will be great.</li>
            <li>Not that great of an item.</li>
            <li>once I&#x27;m happy with my hair.</li>
            <li>a great pair of shoes?</li>
            <li>My husband thought it was a great Valentine&#x27;s gift.</li>
            <li>Your hair will come out great.</li>
            <li>I have read reviews (here and there) about people not being happy with the Deva Curl dryer and diffuser.</li>
            <li>and it was great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am just happy as a clam with this thing.</li>
            <li>I assume this would be great for a pro hairstylist with a chair in a salon</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving the results!</li>
            <li>The design of this thing makes perfect sense &amp; my curls are so much more defined.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s the point, the interesting &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; shape of the diffuser and the not too-hot temperature is perfect for curly hair.</li>
            <li>my hair looks healthy and great!!</li>
            <li>NOW my hair looks awesome and more like the model profiled.</li>
            <li>My hair looks soo good.</li>
            <li>but, this is an investment in your happiness.</li>
            <li>Nothing makes my curly hair look as good as this dryer and difuser combination.</li>
            <li>I have what you call 1980&#x27;s Hair...not in the good way.</li>
            <li>the way I look makes me fill good about myself.</li>
            <li>Probably good for a hair stylist but</li>
            <li>The hand attachment is good for curls, but you cant move it too vigorously through your hair.</li>
            <li>I bought the dryer and fuser in 2010 as a gift for my wife, who has exceptionally curly hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>The best thing about those types of diffusers is that they are springy and fit on most hairdryers.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it !</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>If you have curly hair you will love it too!</li>
            <li>Love using this diffuser on my curly, thinning hair!</li>
            <li>Thought I would give the ArcAngel gel a try along with DevaCurl Dryer &amp; DevaFuser; to see if I get more wave!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Ingenious diffuser!  </li>
            <li>Easy to handle and great diffuser</li>
            <li>if i liked it</li>
            <li>I knew this dryer sounded too good to be true :P</li>
            <li>Nice concept</li>
            <li>I think longer hair wouldn&#x27;t require so much of my own manipulations and movements for my hair to take advantage of the 360 degree air flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it again this morning and used the diffuser my own way.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m guaranteed nice curls wherever I am (hard/soft water, humidity....etc...).</li>
            <li>you buy this diffuser work with it and create your own instruction manual.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer has two settings, both temperatures perfect for curly hair , I use the high setting to get the water out after washing and then switch to the lower.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped the special diffuser would be a great tool to maximize my curl and reduce the damage blow drying can do to curly hair.  </li>
            <li>My deva stylist uses this hair dryer with more skill than I have been able to manage and I don&#x27;t get nearly as good a result.</li>
            <li>cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is very easy to use and has two heat settings, as well as hi and lo,  which helps me a lot.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!  </li>
            <li>Really good for wavy or curly hair, adds volume and height, love it, worth the price, good quality..</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair with some wave, but no volume.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a superior hair dryer and the &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; diffuser is comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I just love the DevaCurl Dryer.</li>
            <li>A French happy customer !</li>
            <li>I love this dryer and diffuser.  </li>
            <li>and I love the results.  </li>
            <li>It will be even better once I get used to the dryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I expect this curler will be my method for many years to come.</li>
            <li>Love the diffuser but not the hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m actually in love with this blow dryer...</li>
            <li>I LOVE this dryer.</li>
            <li>20 dlls dyer worked much better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>If you have curly hair, there is nothing better.</li>
            <li>Cord quality is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>made my hair more frizzy....</li>
            <li>and I had the volume that I usually love.</li>
            <li>Love the adapter on this dryer with curly hair it leaves curls ,and doesn&#x27;t blow it out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I decided to  order the DevaCurl Dryer from Amazon and am I ever glad I did.</li>
            <li>the perfect pair of earrings?&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be using this daily.  </li>
            <li>so you can see for yourself! :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love their products.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a diffusing hair dryer by Conair, and it was okay,</li>
            <li>I think the cord weighs more than the dryer itself.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>The ultimate result is beautiful hair!</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>love this dryer.</li>
            <li>otherwise, my curls love this dryer.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this dryer and diffuser combo a try after exclusively using the deva line of products for the prior six months.&lt;br /&gt;First day using the dryer and my hair looks awesome!</li>
            <li>It felt like more work to get the &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; where it needed to be.</li>
            <li>I am able to get the volume I like with this product, something a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; diffuser can not do.</li>
            <li>If you want more body and lift in your hair this dryer is for you.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know much more than that</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like many of the products available and it as a result</li>
            <li>Wish it fit more of my blow dryers.  </li>
            <li>Not so good to blow hair straight.  </li>
            <li>The curl attachment is amazing and curls my hair right up.</li>
            <li>The switches are too easy to hit while using the dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve destroyed my fine hair with perms.</li>
            <li>It makes it look like I have a lot of hair which is what I want rather than looking like I have fine, thinner hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair, but LOTS of hair</li>
            <li>The DevaFuser is my favorite diffuser for my curly hair--it does a great job getting the roots dry and keeping lift.</li>
            <li>Love my first Diffuser!  </li>
            <li>The dryer itself is surprisingly light.</li>
            <li>much would you pay for: ... a nice dinner out?</li>
            <li>Diffuser seems like more of a gimmick than a really useful attachment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually finding it is great at getting in and getting root volume.</li>
            <li>like you would use a pinky to lift a section, but this pinky blows lightly.</li>
            <li>As far as a blow dyer goes, its a good product.</li>
            <li>so maybe they&#x27;re all great, but I feel like I have the best of ALL worlds to manipulate my hair with the Hand, the concentrator and my bowl diffuser, or just plain open.</li>
            <li>The (Hand) has vents on both side and dries both directions making it a much quicker process!!!</li>
            <li>Just easy and quick.</li>
            <li>I use DevaCurl products and this dryer delivers as promised - soft, frizz-free curls when I use the DevaFuser, and beautiful looking, straight hair when I use the concentrator.</li>
            <li>I love this one it is a bit too big to travel with, but as the diffuser won&#x27;t fit my travel dryer, I now make sure I have the room to bring this on every trip!</li>
            <li>when i first used it wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>She was so excited to receive it as a gift - and I was her Christmas Hero.</li>
            <li>Spend the money--it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Success!</li>
            <li>The vid and photos show a glorious Botticelli curled girl with long hair, and it would be great.  </li>
            <li>; Now I know -- it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Defintely worth the money if you like VOLUME!</li>
            <li>Medium to long its great.  </li>
            <li>poo\\&quot; when I want a deeper clean.</li>
            <li>I actually like that effect with my bowl diffuser on it better, but The Hand is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Dryer is light and does not get hot like my cheap Kmart one</li>
            <li>Probably works better with very curly hair.</li>
            <li>This &amp; the devacurl product line has been the only good investment for my hair.</li>
            <li>a full tank of gas?  </li>
            <li>My hair has been MUCH happier with most of the Deva Curl line.  </li>
            <li>Press the cool shot button, flicker.</li>
            <li>Awesome for people with thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, light weight, super easy to hold</li>
            <li>I like this product, but the diffuser falls off easily and the blower has a funny smell when operating.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how effective the dryer was because it doesn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
            <li>Personally, I feel its a very good tool and as much time as we all spend on our hair, it&#x27;s going to be worth its price to have a good hair tool if you aren&#x27;t the type that can&#x27;t air dry, like me.</li>
            <li>Seriously, it easily creates pretty, smooth, shiny, frizz-free waves in my hair, super fast!</li>
            <li>but instead I got super frizzy undefined curls.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>This dries quickly without frizzing.</li>
            <li>After using the system, my hair was so full looking with just the right amount of wave.</li>
            <li>I had been using a regular hair dryer with the Devafuser, and the diffuser would get ridiculously hot, but I loved how the diffuser made my curls look.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair dry along with the hand hair has a lot more body and receive lots of comments on it</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and mostly straight ...</li>
            <li>great everyday results, and longevity of product.</li>
            <li>Your hair is worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Spend the rest of the money you save on something else that will be worth</li>
            <li>Is it worth it?</li>
            <li>So worth it.</li>
            <li>so it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.  </li>
            <li>so well you will save all the money you would have spent getting the next best elusive</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think as my old one, but that&#x27;s better for your hair.</li>
            <li>Even though its rather pricy its worth it</li>
            <li>This is worth $160 at Sephora</li>
            <li>All the pretty soft straight haired girls are now loving \\&quot;my\\&quot; hair and wishing they had it..</li>
            <li>It does not make your hair frizzy if you are using the right products.</li>
            <li>Diffuser keeps falling off; on/off switch for hair dryer is right where my hand goes to hold it, so I kept turning it off as I was moving it around.  </li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>(1) it does not heat to a point that will damage your hair and (2) most importantly, if you are like me, my hair takes hours to dry.</li>
            <li>My blonde weave is great, but never got the same cut twice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe if you have long hair it works better, or hair that is already super curly (like the models hair is)&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Fast delivery !</li>
            <li>It gets hot and has power.</li>
            <li>Although it makes my hair soft and frizz free, it does not enhance my wavy curls .</li>
            <li>which is exactly what I did.  </li>
            <li>Gentle glove of air!</li>
            <li>I would recommend trying the Devafuser, which can be purchased separately first</li>
            <li>It dries our hair fast!</li>
            <li>I have used many diffusers over the years and was hoping this was going to be the last one I ever had to buy!!  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>When compared with my regular dryer vs. DevaCurl dryer+diffuser and different combinations/method of product, I concluded that it is definitely the dryer that creates the awesome waves - not the gel Deva sells.</li>
            <li>First blow dryer</li>
            <li>It leaves a smooth, shiny, soft finish.</li>
            <li>My hair is almost exactly like the model profiled.</li>
            <li>Deva diffuser differs from a regular diffuser because it dries the top and bottom of your hair at one time.</li>
            <li>The body does NOT get hot.</li>
            <li>The attachment does NOT get hot.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that the screen on the back comes out to be defuzzed.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the low heat setting.</li>
            <li>This may be a result of the much higher quality cord.</li>
            <li>My regular hair dryer, used with a diffuser attachment, seems to do a better and quicker job than the deva dryer.</li>
            <li>and is supposed to create “soft, shiny frizz free curls.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, not me.</li>
            <li>I had to keep fluffing up my hair at work or it looked really flat on top of my head.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used my blow dryer to set my curls with the diffuser and to blow dry my hair so that I could flat iron it and was happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>I just dried my hair to about 60% and have great volume at the roots and soft voluminous curls all over.</li>
            <li>and then go back to The Hand and use single fingers in the top, lifting for more volume.</li>
            <li>All three of us discovered that, first of all, there is absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>think long Botticelli and corkscrew curls would benefit most from this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>I think it is an amazing hair dryer with one exception: if it is held upside down the diffuser falls off.  </li>
            <li>Seriously I know I sound self involved about this, but finally loving my hair and</li>
            <li>Cup those lovely curls to your scalp while you tenderly dry them.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; is quite large.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really need a new blow dryer, but I finally went ahead and got it and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Even on HIGH it barely moves my hair (and my hair is fine).</li>
            <li>use the deva curl products (almost the entire line--in different variations) and LOVE THEM!  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I have fine, low end of medium thickness hair</li>
            <li>I wash my hair and comb through it with a large, wide comb/pick, then scrunch with mousse and then scrunch some more with diffuser with my head bent over, then hairspray the heck out of it  .....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking if I kept at it till totally dry, the curls would get more fly-away, though probably still much better than other dryers.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s pricey, but it really does the job like nothing else.  </li>
            <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t do what it promised.</li>
            <li>I just understood curly hair, and my curly hair clients appreciated my skills.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know I paid way too much for a hairdryer</li>
            <li>I wrote to the supplier and he confirmed it only works with 110 volts.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it all!</li>
            <li>She uses it when she doesn&#x27;t have time to pin up her hair, or when she is really out to impress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the DevaFuser.</li>
            <li>My hair is really wavy, some people say curly.  </li>
            <li>I ever spent more than 25$money on.</li>
            <li>but I still had to handle my hair too much, which caused the ends to get all frizzy.  </li>
            <li>The concept of the Deva Curl Dryer and DevaFuser made much sense to me.  </li>
            <li>instead of me wishing I had straight hair.</li>
            <li>I spend this much for a hair dryer?</li>
            <li>The buttons seem to fall very conveniently no matter</li>
            <li>It was very well thought out.</li>
            <li>Thanks, DevaCurl for EVERYTHING</li>
            <li>I really like this drier.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice because each side of the green hand had vents.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, I have pretty, soft UNFRIZZY curls.</li>
            <li>The volume is what some other reviewers might refer to as &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; but personally, I love when my afro is large and in charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put the products in my hair in the same way I did when I used the Devacurl dryer and Devafuser, BUT I used a different (new) Revlon Dryer (from walmart) along with a conair large \\&quot;bowl-looking\\&quot; diffuser (with the little &#x27;fingers&#x27; inside it) and my hair turned out AWESOME!  </li>
            <li>Back to my original dryer and diffuser.</li>
            <li>I think some other reviewer already said that was a better route to take….</li>
            <li>: The attachment doesn&#x27;t stay on very well and the buttons on the handle are loose (easy to switch)</li>
            <li>The dryer is also light weight with a long cord which makes it functional.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll dry fine.</li>
            <li>Up to its full potential.</li>
            <li>I guess the important caveat is that I don&#x27;t use it to dry 100%; I use it to expedite the drying.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is shorter, and want &#x27;lift&#x27; at the crown, scrunch in some extra-hold gel at roots, section it, pick up the hair at the roots and secure sections with med-small plastic jaw clips, and use the &#x27;concentrated&#x27; airflow diffuser at root level to help dry hair--can air-dry the rest of hair or use it to speed up the drying.</li>
            <li>I can get some decent &amp;#34;waves&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My daughters and I also gave this dryer several chances and used it for weeks in hopes that it would live up to the claims but IT DOES NOT DO ANYTHING SPECIAL.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it and all deva curl products.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this item.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it if you have curls.</li>
            <li>The high heat is not as high</li>
            <li>For someone who used this as their first hair dryer it seems risky to make such a large purchase.</li>
            <li>This is a really great dryer, very strong and I like the different heat settings (especially the cold blast to set the curls).</li>
            <li>I really wanted the soft, defined curls result</li>
            <li>I had no idea how much frizz comes from a towel &amp; put my bowl diffuser from my old $20 blower on it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the real truth is this product is a pretty low quality hair dryer with a one of a kind defuser that DOES NOT work any better than a normal diffuser and a basic 1200 watts dryer!!  </li>
            <li>Now I am stuck with diffuser attachment that won&#x27;t fit any of my other hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>(I live in France).</li>
            <li>I lost 150 USD, as I live in a 220 volts area.</li>
            <li>High low force settings and High low heat settings and a cool shot</li>
            <li>which way I hold it for switching on and off, moving from high to low heat, or high to low speed and using the cool shot.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for curly haired ladies that style their hair naturally.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!  </li>
            <li>I may have not known how to properly use this specific dryer and diffuser, however it only amounted in more frizz on my hair, hence the 1 star.  </li>
            <li>The old dryer seems like a toy!</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the diffuser working on your usual dryer but also because the dryer is purposefully made for curly hair and the lower heat functions to keep your curly hair safe from heat damage.</li>
            <li>I was on the fence about ordering this hairdryer because I&#x27;ve never spent much on my dryers.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the dryer I followed the instructions on the back of the box.</li>
            <li>No frizzy curls and Its so easy to dry my hair next to my scalp.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be awkward getting used to, but it fits my hand perfectly and is much lighter than other blow dryers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>think the only thing that&#x27;s good about this is that it&#x27;s sort of flat, so it can get into the roots, but it&#x27;s awkward to hold, and it made my curly hair more wavy than curly.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was very pricey when I broke down and bought it, but I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Save your money and get the products instead...and buy a large universal \\&quot;bowl-looking\\&quot; diffuser (see link)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t go on trips with me, as it&#x27;s entirely too large and bulky for carrying in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t all of a sudden be curly but it will help your real curls stay curled and not frizz.</li>
            <li>Well constructed dryer with professional features.  </li>
            <li>Purchased for 14 yr old daughter who has curly hair.  </li>
            <li>have just transitioned from Ouidad products to DevaCurl products because I&#x27;m sensitive to the chemicals in Ouidad products</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re hesitant to pay this much for a hairdryer that will last you for years and years, consider this:&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>Being a wavy/curly haired girl, this has completely changed my regimen.  </li>
            <li>You can go online to DevaCurl.com for a specialist near you.</li>
            <li>, this fantastic looking green hand will help you shape your hair from the inside out.</li>
            <li>Also, my old dryer would make my lights flicker.</li>
            <li>so I frequently change the settings unintentionally when I hold it.</li>
            <li>but it is too much for just plugging in next to my sink at home.</li>
            <li>I just wish they gave the option of an on/off cool air button instead of making us have to hold the button down.</li>
            <li>who knew this one that cost me 3-4X more than my usual dryer would! -</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s high enough if you are using your old drying techniques</li>
            <li>but I found it to be really no better than the cheap sock diffuser I had on my old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I finally went out on a limb and got this mostly due to a video of someone with pretty straight hair using it on a shorter cut</li>
            <li>I use mine on high heat, low air flow, and it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried a high end dryer before (which all seem to be priced about the same as this)</li>
            <li>I wash my hair, but when I use it, it never ruins the curls or turns them into frizz the way my onld difuser did.  </li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s possible this diffuser might be good for fine hair, but for my thick, medium textured, loose ringlet curly hair, it didn&#x27;t enhance my curls in the least.</li>
            <li>The main problem with my hair is volume, my roots tend to be flat</li>
            <li>this blow dryer can do that a much less expensive dryer can&#x27;t do; the sight of the attachment lures buyers into looking at the product and then there&#x27;s so much hype about it---including the reviews here on Amazon---that they spend the extra money in hopes of great looks....</li>
            <li>It will dry your hair fast without blowing it all over the place.  </li>
            <li>It was very hard for me to spend so much on this, but now that I have it, I feel it was worth every cent!</li>
            <li>I have very moody short hair that some days is wavy and others flat (depending on the weather).</li>
            <li>My new stylist is young, but she has a 10 yr old with extremely curly hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product from a local professional beauty store.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen this in the professional beauty supply for several months, maybe a year now.  </li>
            <li>and if I don&#x27;t diffuse my hair to almost 100% dry with a normal dryer</li>
            <li>Normally I need a little bit of time adjusting to a new dryer</li>
            <li>I have straight thin hair most of my head, except little wave underneath.</li>
            <li>If I have to go out quickly, I just give it a little dry in the front with the DevaCurl Dryer.  </li>
            <li>She has been using DevaCurl products for a long time, and nothing makes her hair take on its natural curls like DevaCurl products.</li>
            <li>The cord is NINE FEET long and of a professional heavy-duty grade.  </li>
            <li>The price was less than I would have paid in the professional store and needed a new dryer</li>
            <li>I did not dry my hair completely (90% dry).</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m always in a rush, so i haven&#x27;t dry it completely yet with it).</li>
            <li>When I had a professional dry my hair with one of these she didn&#x27;t follow the directions on the box.</li>
            <li>dries hair fast but makes it a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li>By the time I&#x27;ve commuted to work, I am ready to shake out the curls a little and go in looking like a champ.  </li>
            <li>The 2nd time I used the dryer I notched the setting down from high and lost some (not all) of the puffy and frizz.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Have a great day !</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer for curly hair that I&#x27;ve found &amp; when used along with devacurl products.  </li>
            <li> It stays on perfectly!.  </li>
            <li> The dryer has the perfect heat for diffuser.  </li>
            <li> it works great!  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s awesome for me.  </li>
            <li> Best dryer on the market</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s engineered perfectly for activating curl shape and feeping it</li>
            <li> This was very intelligently designed.  </li>
            <li> But after getting my hair done by curly girl trained person and her showing me how to do it and with this awesome blow dryer</li>
            <li> (best cut I&#x27;ve had in 53 yrs!!)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li> Awesome!!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect dryer for &amp;#</li>
            <li> The Deva Curl products are all wonderful</li>
            <li> What works best for one might not work for another.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Works great with my curls (botticelli type)!</li>
            <li> but happy wife, happy life!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li> Great product and service.</li>
            <li> great hairdryer &amp; diffuser.  </li>
            <li> but I am happy with this product despite its steep price and not providing a miracle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a &amp;#34;after product&amp;#34;, so if you can recommend me a devacurl product that will be great.</li>
            <li> Not that great of an item.</li>
            <li> once I&#x27;m happy with my hair.</li>
            <li> a great pair of shoes?</li>
            <li> My husband thought it was a great Valentine&#x27;s gift.</li>
            <li> Your hair will come out great.</li>
            <li> I have read reviews (here and there) about people not being happy with the Deva Curl dryer and diffuser.</li>
            <li> and it was great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am just happy as a clam with this thing.</li>
            <li> I assume this would be great for a pro hairstylist with a chair in a salon</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving the results!</li>
            <li> The design of this thing makes perfect sense &amp; my curls are so much more defined.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s the point, the interesting &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; shape of the diffuser and the not too-hot temperature is perfect for curly hair.</li>
            <li> my hair looks healthy and great!!</li>
            <li> NOW my hair looks awesome and more like the model profiled.</li>
            <li> My hair looks soo good.</li>
            <li> but, this is an investment in your happiness.</li>
            <li> Nothing makes my curly hair look as good as this dryer and difuser combination.</li>
            <li> I have what you call 1980&#x27;s Hair...not in the good way.</li>
            <li> the way I look makes me fill good about myself.</li>
            <li> Probably good for a hair stylist but</li>
            <li> The hand attachment is good for curls, but you cant move it too vigorously through your hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the dryer and fuser in 2010 as a gift for my wife, who has exceptionally curly hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The best thing about those types of diffusers is that they are springy and fit on most hairdryers.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it !</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair you will love it too!</li>
            <li> Love using this diffuser on my curly, thinning hair!</li>
            <li> Thought I would give the ArcAngel gel a try along with DevaCurl Dryer &amp; DevaFuser; to see if I get more wave!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Ingenious diffuser!  </li>
            <li> Easy to handle and great diffuser</li>
            <li> if i liked it</li>
            <li> I knew this dryer sounded too good to be true :P</li>
            <li> Nice concept</li>
            <li> I think longer hair wouldn&#x27;t require so much of my own manipulations and movements for my hair to take advantage of the 360 degree air flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it again this morning and used the diffuser my own way.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m guaranteed nice curls wherever I am (hard/soft water, humidity....etc...).</li>
            <li> you buy this diffuser work with it and create your own instruction manual.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer has two settings, both temperatures perfect for curly hair , I use the high setting to get the water out after washing and then switch to the lower.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped the special diffuser would be a great tool to maximize my curl and reduce the damage blow drying can do to curly hair.  </li>
            <li> My deva stylist uses this hair dryer with more skill than I have been able to manage and I don&#x27;t get nearly as good a result.</li>
            <li> cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is very easy to use and has two heat settings, as well as hi and lo,  which helps me a lot.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!  </li>
            <li> Really good for wavy or curly hair, adds volume and height, love it, worth the price, good quality..</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair with some wave, but no volume.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a superior hair dryer and the &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; diffuser is comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I just love the DevaCurl Dryer.</li>
            <li> A French happy customer !</li>
            <li> I love this dryer and diffuser.  </li>
            <li> and I love the results.  </li>
            <li> It will be even better once I get used to the dryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expect this curler will be my method for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Love the diffuser but not the hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m actually in love with this blow dryer...</li>
            <li> I LOVE this dryer.</li>
            <li> 20 dlls dyer worked much better.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair, there is nothing better.</li>
            <li> Cord quality is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> made my hair more frizzy....</li>
            <li> and I had the volume that I usually love.</li>
            <li> Love the adapter on this dryer with curly hair it leaves curls ,and doesn&#x27;t blow it out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I decided to  order the DevaCurl Dryer from Amazon and am I ever glad I did.</li>
            <li> the perfect pair of earrings?&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be using this daily.  </li>
            <li> so you can see for yourself! :)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love their products.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a diffusing hair dryer by Conair, and it was okay,</li>
            <li> I think the cord weighs more than the dryer itself.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> The ultimate result is beautiful hair!</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> love this dryer.</li>
            <li> otherwise, my curls love this dryer.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this dryer and diffuser combo a try after exclusively using the deva line of products for the prior six months.&lt;br /&gt;First day using the dryer and my hair looks awesome!</li>
            <li> It felt like more work to get the &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; where it needed to be.</li>
            <li> I am able to get the volume I like with this product, something a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; diffuser can not do.</li>
            <li> If you want more body and lift in your hair this dryer is for you.  </li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know much more than that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like many of the products available and it as a result</li>
            <li> Wish it fit more of my blow dryers.  </li>
            <li> Not so good to blow hair straight.  </li>
            <li> The curl attachment is amazing and curls my hair right up.</li>
            <li> The switches are too easy to hit while using the dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve destroyed my fine hair with perms.</li>
            <li> It makes it look like I have a lot of hair which is what I want rather than looking like I have fine, thinner hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair, but LOTS of hair</li>
            <li> The DevaFuser is my favorite diffuser for my curly hair--it does a great job getting the roots dry and keeping lift.</li>
            <li> Love my first Diffuser!  </li>
            <li> The dryer itself is surprisingly light.</li>
            <li> much would you pay for: ... a nice dinner out?</li>
            <li> Diffuser seems like more of a gimmick than a really useful attachment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually finding it is great at getting in and getting root volume.</li>
            <li> like you would use a pinky to lift a section, but this pinky blows lightly.</li>
            <li> As far as a blow dyer goes, its a good product.</li>
            <li> so maybe they&#x27;re all great, but I feel like I have the best of ALL worlds to manipulate my hair with the Hand, the concentrator and my bowl diffuser, or just plain open.</li>
            <li> The (Hand) has vents on both side and dries both directions making it a much quicker process!!!</li>
            <li> Just easy and quick.</li>
            <li> I use DevaCurl products and this dryer delivers as promised - soft, frizz-free curls when I use the DevaFuser, and beautiful looking, straight hair when I use the concentrator.</li>
            <li> I love this one it is a bit too big to travel with, but as the diffuser won&#x27;t fit my travel dryer, I now make sure I have the room to bring this on every trip!</li>
            <li> when i first used it wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> She was so excited to receive it as a gift - and I was her Christmas Hero.</li>
            <li> Spend the money--it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Success!</li>
            <li> The vid and photos show a glorious Botticelli curled girl with long hair, and it would be great.  </li>
            <li> ; Now I know -- it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Defintely worth the money if you like VOLUME!</li>
            <li> Medium to long its great.  </li>
            <li> poo\\&quot; when I want a deeper clean.</li>
            <li> I actually like that effect with my bowl diffuser on it better, but The Hand is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Dryer is light and does not get hot like my cheap Kmart one</li>
            <li> Probably works better with very curly hair.</li>
            <li> This &amp; the devacurl product line has been the only good investment for my hair.</li>
            <li> a full tank of gas?  </li>
            <li> My hair has been MUCH happier with most of the Deva Curl line.  </li>
            <li> Press the cool shot button, flicker.</li>
            <li> Awesome for people with thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, light weight, super easy to hold</li>
            <li> I like this product, but the diffuser falls off easily and the blower has a funny smell when operating.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how effective the dryer was because it doesn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
            <li> Personally, I feel its a very good tool and as much time as we all spend on our hair, it&#x27;s going to be worth its price to have a good hair tool if you aren&#x27;t the type that can&#x27;t air dry, like me.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it easily creates pretty, smooth, shiny, frizz-free waves in my hair, super fast!</li>
            <li> but instead I got super frizzy undefined curls.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> This dries quickly without frizzing.</li>
            <li> After using the system, my hair was so full looking with just the right amount of wave.</li>
            <li> I had been using a regular hair dryer with the Devafuser, and the diffuser would get ridiculously hot, but I loved how the diffuser made my curls look.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair dry along with the hand hair has a lot more body and receive lots of comments on it</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and mostly straight ...</li>
            <li> great everyday results, and longevity of product.</li>
            <li> Your hair is worth the investment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Spend the rest of the money you save on something else that will be worth</li>
            <li> Is it worth it?</li>
            <li> So worth it.</li>
            <li> so it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.  </li>
            <li> so well you will save all the money you would have spent getting the next best elusive</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think as my old one, but that&#x27;s better for your hair.</li>
            <li> Even though its rather pricy its worth it</li>
            <li> This is worth $160 at Sephora</li>
            <li> All the pretty soft straight haired girls are now loving \\&quot;my\\&quot; hair and wishing they had it..</li>
            <li> It does not make your hair frizzy if you are using the right products.</li>
            <li> Diffuser keeps falling off; on/off switch for hair dryer is right where my hand goes to hold it, so I kept turning it off as I was moving it around.  </li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> (1) it does not heat to a point that will damage your hair and (2) most importantly, if you are like me, my hair takes hours to dry.</li>
            <li> My blonde weave is great, but never got the same cut twice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe if you have long hair it works better, or hair that is already super curly (like the models hair is)&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Fast delivery !</li>
            <li> It gets hot and has power.</li>
            <li> Although it makes my hair soft and frizz free, it does not enhance my wavy curls .</li>
            <li> which is exactly what I did.  </li>
            <li> Gentle glove of air!</li>
            <li> I would recommend trying the Devafuser, which can be purchased separately first</li>
            <li> It dries our hair fast!</li>
            <li> I have used many diffusers over the years and was hoping this was going to be the last one I ever had to buy!!  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> When compared with my regular dryer vs. DevaCurl dryer+diffuser and different combinations/method of product, I concluded that it is definitely the dryer that creates the awesome waves - not the gel Deva sells.</li>
            <li> First blow dryer</li>
            <li> It leaves a smooth, shiny, soft finish.</li>
            <li> My hair is almost exactly like the model profiled.</li>
            <li> Deva diffuser differs from a regular diffuser because it dries the top and bottom of your hair at one time.</li>
            <li> The body does NOT get hot.</li>
            <li> The attachment does NOT get hot.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that the screen on the back comes out to be defuzzed.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the low heat setting.</li>
            <li> This may be a result of the much higher quality cord.</li>
            <li> My regular hair dryer, used with a diffuser attachment, seems to do a better and quicker job than the deva dryer.</li>
            <li> and is supposed to create “soft, shiny frizz free curls.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, not me.</li>
            <li> I had to keep fluffing up my hair at work or it looked really flat on top of my head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my blow dryer to set my curls with the diffuser and to blow dry my hair so that I could flat iron it and was happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> I just dried my hair to about 60% and have great volume at the roots and soft voluminous curls all over.</li>
            <li> and then go back to The Hand and use single fingers in the top, lifting for more volume.</li>
            <li> All three of us discovered that, first of all, there is absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> think long Botticelli and corkscrew curls would benefit most from this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> I think it is an amazing hair dryer with one exception: if it is held upside down the diffuser falls off.  </li>
            <li> Seriously I know I sound self involved about this, but finally loving my hair and</li>
            <li> Cup those lovely curls to your scalp while you tenderly dry them.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; is quite large.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really need a new blow dryer, but I finally went ahead and got it and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Even on HIGH it barely moves my hair (and my hair is fine).</li>
            <li> use the deva curl products (almost the entire line--in different variations) and LOVE THEM!  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have fine, low end of medium thickness hair</li>
            <li> I wash my hair and comb through it with a large, wide comb/pick, then scrunch with mousse and then scrunch some more with diffuser with my head bent over, then hairspray the heck out of it  .....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking if I kept at it till totally dry, the curls would get more fly-away, though probably still much better than other dryers.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s pricey, but it really does the job like nothing else.  </li>
            <li> and it really doesn&#x27;t do what it promised.</li>
            <li> I just understood curly hair, and my curly hair clients appreciated my skills.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know I paid way too much for a hairdryer</li>
            <li> I wrote to the supplier and he confirmed it only works with 110 volts.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it all!</li>
            <li> She uses it when she doesn&#x27;t have time to pin up her hair, or when she is really out to impress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the DevaFuser.</li>
            <li> My hair is really wavy, some people say curly.  </li>
            <li> I ever spent more than 25$money on.</li>
            <li> but I still had to handle my hair too much, which caused the ends to get all frizzy.  </li>
            <li> The concept of the Deva Curl Dryer and DevaFuser made much sense to me.  </li>
            <li> instead of me wishing I had straight hair.</li>
            <li> I spend this much for a hair dryer?</li>
            <li> The buttons seem to fall very conveniently no matter</li>
            <li> It was very well thought out.</li>
            <li> Thanks, DevaCurl for EVERYTHING</li>
            <li> I really like this drier.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice because each side of the green hand had vents.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I have pretty, soft UNFRIZZY curls.</li>
            <li> The volume is what some other reviewers might refer to as &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; but personally, I love when my afro is large and in charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put the products in my hair in the same way I did when I used the Devacurl dryer and Devafuser, BUT I used a different (new) Revlon Dryer (from walmart) along with a conair large \\&quot;bowl-looking\\&quot; diffuser (with the little &#x27;fingers&#x27; inside it) and my hair turned out AWESOME!  </li>
            <li> Back to my original dryer and diffuser.</li>
            <li> I think some other reviewer already said that was a better route to take….</li>
            <li> : The attachment doesn&#x27;t stay on very well and the buttons on the handle are loose (easy to switch)</li>
            <li> The dryer is also light weight with a long cord which makes it functional.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll dry fine.</li>
            <li> Up to its full potential.</li>
            <li> I guess the important caveat is that I don&#x27;t use it to dry 100%; I use it to expedite the drying.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is shorter, and want &#x27;lift&#x27; at the crown, scrunch in some extra-hold gel at roots, section it, pick up the hair at the roots and secure sections with med-small plastic jaw clips, and use the &#x27;concentrated&#x27; airflow diffuser at root level to help dry hair--can air-dry the rest of hair or use it to speed up the drying.</li>
            <li> I can get some decent &amp;#34;waves&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I also gave this dryer several chances and used it for weeks in hopes that it would live up to the claims but IT DOES NOT DO ANYTHING SPECIAL.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it and all deva curl products.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this item.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend it if you have curls.</li>
            <li> The high heat is not as high</li>
            <li> For someone who used this as their first hair dryer it seems risky to make such a large purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a really great dryer, very strong and I like the different heat settings (especially the cold blast to set the curls).</li>
            <li> I really wanted the soft, defined curls result</li>
            <li> I had no idea how much frizz comes from a towel &amp; put my bowl diffuser from my old $20 blower on it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the real truth is this product is a pretty low quality hair dryer with a one of a kind defuser that DOES NOT work any better than a normal diffuser and a basic 1200 watts dryer!!  </li>
            <li> Now I am stuck with diffuser attachment that won&#x27;t fit any of my other hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> (I live in France).</li>
            <li> I lost 150 USD, as I live in a 220 volts area.</li>
            <li> High low force settings and High low heat settings and a cool shot</li>
            <li> which way I hold it for switching on and off, moving from high to low heat, or high to low speed and using the cool shot.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for curly haired ladies that style their hair naturally.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!  </li>
            <li> I may have not known how to properly use this specific dryer and diffuser, however it only amounted in more frizz on my hair, hence the 1 star.  </li>
            <li> The old dryer seems like a toy!</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the diffuser working on your usual dryer but also because the dryer is purposefully made for curly hair and the lower heat functions to keep your curly hair safe from heat damage.</li>
            <li> I was on the fence about ordering this hairdryer because I&#x27;ve never spent much on my dryers.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the dryer I followed the instructions on the back of the box.</li>
            <li> No frizzy curls and Its so easy to dry my hair next to my scalp.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be awkward getting used to, but it fits my hand perfectly and is much lighter than other blow dryers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> think the only thing that&#x27;s good about this is that it&#x27;s sort of flat, so it can get into the roots, but it&#x27;s awkward to hold, and it made my curly hair more wavy than curly.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was very pricey when I broke down and bought it, but I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Save your money and get the products instead...and buy a large universal \\&quot;bowl-looking\\&quot; diffuser (see link)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t go on trips with me, as it&#x27;s entirely too large and bulky for carrying in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t all of a sudden be curly but it will help your real curls stay curled and not frizz.</li>
            <li> Well constructed dryer with professional features.  </li>
            <li> Purchased for 14 yr old daughter who has curly hair.  </li>
            <li> have just transitioned from Ouidad products to DevaCurl products because I&#x27;m sensitive to the chemicals in Ouidad products</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re hesitant to pay this much for a hairdryer that will last you for years and years, consider this:&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> Being a wavy/curly haired girl, this has completely changed my regimen.  </li>
            <li> You can go online to DevaCurl.com for a specialist near you.</li>
            <li> , this fantastic looking green hand will help you shape your hair from the inside out.</li>
            <li> Also, my old dryer would make my lights flicker.</li>
            <li> so I frequently change the settings unintentionally when I hold it.</li>
            <li> but it is too much for just plugging in next to my sink at home.</li>
            <li> I just wish they gave the option of an on/off cool air button instead of making us have to hold the button down.</li>
            <li> who knew this one that cost me 3-4X more than my usual dryer would! -</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s high enough if you are using your old drying techniques</li>
            <li> but I found it to be really no better than the cheap sock diffuser I had on my old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I finally went out on a limb and got this mostly due to a video of someone with pretty straight hair using it on a shorter cut</li>
            <li> I use mine on high heat, low air flow, and it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a high end dryer before (which all seem to be priced about the same as this)</li>
            <li> I wash my hair, but when I use it, it never ruins the curls or turns them into frizz the way my onld difuser did.  </li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s possible this diffuser might be good for fine hair, but for my thick, medium textured, loose ringlet curly hair, it didn&#x27;t enhance my curls in the least.</li>
            <li> The main problem with my hair is volume, my roots tend to be flat</li>
            <li> this blow dryer can do that a much less expensive dryer can&#x27;t do; the sight of the attachment lures buyers into looking at the product and then there&#x27;s so much hype about it---including the reviews here on Amazon---that they spend the extra money in hopes of great looks....</li>
            <li> It will dry your hair fast without blowing it all over the place.  </li>
            <li> It was very hard for me to spend so much on this, but now that I have it, I feel it was worth every cent!</li>
            <li> I have very moody short hair that some days is wavy and others flat (depending on the weather).</li>
            <li> My new stylist is young, but she has a 10 yr old with extremely curly hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from a local professional beauty store.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this in the professional beauty supply for several months, maybe a year now.  </li>
            <li> and if I don&#x27;t diffuse my hair to almost 100% dry with a normal dryer</li>
            <li> Normally I need a little bit of time adjusting to a new dryer</li>
            <li> I have straight thin hair most of my head, except little wave underneath.</li>
            <li> If I have to go out quickly, I just give it a little dry in the front with the DevaCurl Dryer.  </li>
            <li> She has been using DevaCurl products for a long time, and nothing makes her hair take on its natural curls like DevaCurl products.</li>
            <li> The cord is NINE FEET long and of a professional heavy-duty grade.  </li>
            <li> The price was less than I would have paid in the professional store and needed a new dryer</li>
            <li> I did not dry my hair completely (90% dry).</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m always in a rush, so i haven&#x27;t dry it completely yet with it).</li>
            <li> When I had a professional dry my hair with one of these she didn&#x27;t follow the directions on the box.</li>
            <li> dries hair fast but makes it a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;ve commuted to work, I am ready to shake out the curls a little and go in looking like a champ.  </li>
            <li> The 2nd time I used the dryer I notched the setting down from high and lost some (not all) of the puffy and frizz.</li>
            <li> It also does not easily slide between your hair to get to the scalp so a poor design coupled with a no frills/low quality 1200 dryer you are basically overpaying for this product by at least $150.00!&lt;br /&gt;SERIOUSLY save your money, buy a good quality dryer with a diffuser and stick to what works!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all over pretty flat and dull looking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The heaviest part of the dryer is the extra long cord.</li>
            <li> Finally, the cord is extremely long and bulking-  </li>
            <li> When I was younger I washed my hair and let it air dry</li>
            <li> I like how the &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; holds your curls and how you can also go underneath to dry different sections.</li>
            <li> I use is mostly to dry the back and bottom of my head during winter.</li>
            <li> This dryer allows me to get some lift thru the crown while maintaining big, frizzless, loose curls all over.</li>
            <li> This has been the 1st time I have spent over $50 on a hair dryer &amp; have been using the same one with a diffuser for almost 10 yrs.</li>
            <li> so long I figured it was time for a change.</li>
            <li> had been using the DevaCurl products for a few months but found as soon as I used my old hairdryer, even with a diffuser, it negated all the benefits the hair products were doing.  </li>
            <li> The cord is LONG, like 9 ft.</li>
            <li> blow dryer not hot enough.  </li>
            <li> , it will take me a very long time to redeem my credit.  </li>
            <li> drying the underside, it will dry three times faster.  </li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry my hair compared to my &amp;#34;straight hair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Also it seemed to leave my hair fairly dry.  </li>
            <li> As my hair gets longer (shoulder-length), it takes longer to dry</li>
            <li> She cut it dry, curl by curl.</li>
            <li> Dry the roots.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> Move that all around your scalp (OFF in between and STAYING STILL while on, also put the \\&quot;finger tips\\&quot; on the scalp and angle the palm up an inch or two) for those sections that just won&#x27;t dry otherwise.</li>
            <li> and I suspect the \\&quot;killer\\&quot; of same when you get frustrated not being able to get the fuzz out.</li>
            <li> I watched several videos online to see the technique behind using the dryer and that was very helpful.</li>
            <li> has just a small amount of wave that disappear completely if you  brush it.</li>
            <li> The dryer is not very hot, it does take longer to dry, but it definitly helps with the frizz.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s official: I&#x27;m not just an air dry girl anymore!</li>
            <li> When my hair is half dry, I switch to the old dryer for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Now I just wash my hair, comb through with wide comb, scrunch some mousse in, then dry with my Deva hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to go natural, and found that my curls are flat if I don&#x27;t put my head down and dry the roots at least.  </li>
            <li> Nothing unique would suggest a less expensive hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I gave it a couple of tries...</li>
            <li> Sent this back...not as expected.  </li>
            <li> No real advantage  </li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning I style my hair wet.  </li>
            <li> for home it makes it harder to store.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to go to work with a wet head</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid round heavy duty cord and not like the lamp cords on your regular blowdryer.</li>
            <li> that when wet hits at about my bra line.</li>
            <li> If your hair style is on the shorter side the fingers are harder to get up onto your scalp.  </li>
            <li> Pass it up and spend half of the price for a Deva blow dryer on one that will do the exact same thing without the bells and whistles and the silly attachment.</li>
            <li> It took a LONG time to dry and was plain akward to use.  </li>
            <li> I take approx 15-20 minutes to get it half dry  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like any other hair dryer with a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Also, my hair is a little past midback, and if I&#x27;m not careful, the vent side of the dryer will suck my hair in and get it all tangled/stuck in the dryer!  </li>
            <li> I over $100 for the item and ended up returning it due to the frizz factor.  </li>
            <li> But, with a short asymmetrical hair style, I&#x27;m not sure this is the answer.  </li>
            <li> ; if you are looking at this dryer you have already tried lots of other things for your curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> And now my hair can have fluffy, soft, shiny waves with very little effort!</li>
            <li> No more fussing over my flat hair at work.  </li>
            <li> curls are very bouncy, and when every other product failed - this one came through for her.</li>
            <li> I do see that it adds a little volume by my roots, but not a much as i would like.</li>
            <li> I had very high expectations for this expensive hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> so I hoped I would see something that would make me able to justify spending  $135 for a stupid hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve reviewed the Deva dryer because I think it&#x27;s important for prospective buyers to weigh all of the opinions they can before they make the mistake of buying this expensive and useless dryer.  </li>
            <li> I wash with No-Poo, use a little Arc AnGel, dry the roots a few minutes, then scrunch the ends up with the dryer hand</li>
            <li> It was just an expensive hair dryer with a funny looking hand diffuser that acted like any of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with a few other Devacurl hair products &amp; for</li>
            <li> If I use this thing for 10 minutes in the morning (not that I&#x27;ve timed it- could be significantly less)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 20 dollar diffuser with a slight modification, and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  </li>
            <li> Or just get a separate dryer and a diffuser that are both less expensive?&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m much less worried about blowing a fuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got tired of walking out the door with wet hair, especially here in Colorado...</li>
            <li> Just some info: My hair just touches my shoulders, and is at that odd stage between wavy and curly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I turned it on and it just stopped working half way through drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> so when I saw it for $30 less</li>
            <li> No more flipping over to try and fluff up my hair.  </li>
            <li> NOT TRUE.  </li>
            <li> but the cord is really thick and really long.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is for people with tight curls.</li>
            <li> When I was finished my hair had tight, frizzy curls with a lot of puff.</li>
            <li> I prefer the cone type diffuser that has the little \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; in it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all the \\&quot;newest\\&quot;  hairdryers over the decades ( ceramic - ionizer - tourmaline etc ) with  little to no difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey</li>
            <li> What can I say, this little thing is the bomb.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s little green fingers penetrate to the root and provide volume like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday to get out the door faster and to not have the &amp;#34;wet dog&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used diffusers for years and never had so much trouble with one.</li>
            <li> I dried my hair about 85%.</li>
            <li> hate to sound corny</li>
            <li> you can use the palm of the green hand as a diffuser.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I usually air dry my 3b/c curly hair which I usually keep in a pixie cut or a small afro.</li>
            <li> My curls are very tight.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair with 3b curls that can go to a frizzy mess in humidity.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed due to high price .</li>
            <li> It hit the bathroom floor and the entire blade inside shattered rendering the product useless.  </li>
            <li> No more flat-irons.  </li>
            <li> No more high-sudsing shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the directions are the way they are.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small.</li>
            <li> It broke about 30 days past the returnable time.  </li>
            <li> It should have lasted a lot longer than that, especially for how expensive it is.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have tortured my hair terribly in a quest for full, voluminous, fluffy hair.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s very time consuming and often still leaves me with flyaways and frizz.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> your hard earned cash!!&lt;br /&gt;BTW-20% return fee for returns</li>
            <li> all the negative people who said the diffuser falls off or doesn&#x27;t work.....</li>
            <li> the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it is awkward to hold and if you compare the size of the blow dryer with the size of the cord, it is rediculous.  </li>
            <li> With the Deva Curl method and thick hair, it will be lunchtime before my hair dries itself-</li>
            <li> I really mean it.</li>
            <li> The difference between this dryer and the Conair unit she had is ridiculous...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I find it a little expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> numerous bad haircuts b/c they don&#x27;t know how to cut and style curly hair?</li>
            <li> Only has TWO settings to start, but the biggest disappointment is the &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; which is awkward to use and does not fit the dryer well.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the dryer broke after 2 years of using it a few times a week for 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> My hair is ringlets &amp; spirals &amp; it made it even curlier, not good.</li>
            <li> Sucks!</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to pry its cold green hand from my cold dead hand...</li>
            <li> No more &#x27; bad hair days&#x27; with this hairdryer along with  the DevaCurl haircare products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> which means my hair would look crap for half the work day.  </li>
            <li> Overall very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Is it expensive?</li>
            <li> This is one expensive dryer</li>
            <li> I just couldnt take the chance of me using the devacurl dryer wrong, along with going through a trial and error period, in addition to shoving out over $100 bucks.  </li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about this dryer/diffuser set.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say.</li>
            <li> Not at all time consuming or difficult.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering getting a bonnet dryer for those freezing cold mornings where I can&#x27;t bear a damp head, but can&#x27;t imagine having 30 min in the morning to sit in one place while it runs.  </li>
            <li> I have been unhappy with my hair for</li>
            <li> crazy blower.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really cold in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical being in the business.  </li>
            <li> It was impossible to find the voltage of the dryer, I thought it may be because as another dryer I have</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> The hand attachment tends to fall off which is annoying.</li>
            <li> Hated it.</li>
            <li> I watched to how-to video online, followed all the instructions, etc and still got awful</li>
            <li> Though very doubtful clumsiness is covered in the warranty.</li>
            <li> Deva Blow Dryer is insane!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fast delivery ! (I live in France). Great product and service. I just love the DevaCurl Dryer. I couldn&#x27;t find the same product in my country so I decided to search elsewhere, and there it was ! I just had to buy a converter in order to use it here, asthe sockets are different from US to France. I recommend it to everyone with curl, frizzy, hair type. You&#x27;ll love it ! Have a great day ! A French happy customer !</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer for curly hair that I&#x27;ve found &amp; when used along with devacurl products.  It&#x27;s nice because each side of the green hand had vents.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer and diffuser.  I&#x27;ve been using the devacurl system for a while and have been fighting lack of volume at my roots. I had to keep fluffing up my hair at work or it looked really flat on top of my head.  I have used this hair dryer and diffuser once and I love the results.  I have volume at my roots!  No more fussing over my flat hair at work.  No more flipping over to try and fluff up my hair.  It will be even better once I get used to the dryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To all the negative people who said the diffuser falls off or doesn&#x27;t work.....NOT TRUE.  It stays on perfectly!.  The dryer has the perfect heat for diffuser.  Just follow the directions...it works great!  It does not make your hair frizzy if you are using the right products.</li>
            <li> For someone who used this as their first hair dryer it seems risky to make such a large purchase. It works though. If you don&#x27;t have curls your hair won&#x27;t all of a sudden be curly but it will help your real curls stay curled and not frizz. It gets hot and has power. I use it everyday to get out the door faster and to not have the &amp;#34;wet dog&amp;#34; look. Highly recommend it and all deva curl products. Your hair is worth the investment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth the price.  When I was younger I washed my hair and let it air dry and it was bouncy and my curls sustained 24/7.  Now that I&#x27;m in my forty&#x27;s and several medications later, my hair has thinned out a has lost it&#x27;s curly bounce.  This dryer has helped me regain my curly bounce and that&#x27;s awesome for me.  You get the salon feel everytime. People have noticed the difference and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!  I recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Probably works better with very curly hair. Although it makes my hair soft and frizz free, it does not enhance my wavy curls .</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s pricey, but it really does the job like nothing else.  With the Deva Curl method and thick hair, it will be lunchtime before my hair dries itself- which means my hair would look crap for half the work day.  If I use this thing for 10 minutes in the morning (not that I&#x27;ve timed it- could be significantly less) just to *start* drying the underside, it will dry three times faster.  By the time I&#x27;ve commuted to work, I am ready to shake out the curls a little and go in looking like a champ.  And you don&#x27;t have to wave the thing around over your head.  Just tuck it into the spot(s) you want and hold for a minute or so.  It&#x27;s actually a bit relaxing compared to the rest of my morning rushing-around.&lt;br /&gt;So I guess the important caveat is that I don&#x27;t use it to dry 100%; I use it to expedite the drying.  I&#x27;m thinking if I kept at it till totally dry, the curls would get more fly-away, though probably still much better than other dryers.  I&#x27;m considering getting a bonnet dryer for those freezing cold mornings where I can&#x27;t bear a damp head, but can&#x27;t imagine having 30 min in the morning to sit in one place while it runs.  I expect this curler will be my method for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Based on the 5 star reviews I purchased this for my wavy hair to maximize my curl even though the price is 3-5 times the price of a dryer in the same 1200 watts range.  I had hoped the special diffuser would be a great tool to maximize my curl and reduce the damage blow drying can do to curly hair.  Unfortunately the real truth is this product is a pretty low quality hair dryer with a one of a kind defuser that DOES NOT work any better than a normal diffuser and a basic 1200 watts dryer!!  Only has TWO settings to start, but the biggest disappointment is the &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; which is awkward to use and does not fit the dryer well.  It also does not easily slide between your hair to get to the scalp so a poor design coupled with a no frills/low quality 1200 dryer you are basically overpaying for this product by at least $150.00!&lt;br /&gt;SERIOUSLY save your money, buy a good quality dryer with a diffuser and stick to what works!  Spend the rest of the money you save on something else that will be worth your hard earned cash!!&lt;br /&gt;BTW-20% return fee for returns so to send it back is would cost me $50.00 so I am stuck with it, but hope this will help others avoid making this costly mistake!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my blow dryer to set my curls with the diffuser and to blow dry my hair so that I could flat iron it and was happy with the results.  I just wish they gave the option of an on/off cool air button instead of making us have to hold the button down.</li>
            <li> Love it! Its diferente than a regular dryer.</li>
            <li> Love the diffuser but not the hair dryer.  It takes forever to dry my hair compared to my &amp;#34;straight hair&amp;#34; hair dryer.  Would suggest buying the diffuser alone and save your money on the hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Diffuser attachment would not stay on. I&#x27;ve used diffusers for years and never had so much trouble with one. My $20 walmart blow dryer was reinstated after a couple rounds with this one.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m actually in love with this blow dryer... If you have curly hair you will love it too! Don&#x27;t know how I lived without it. It was very hard for me to spend so much on this, but now that I have it, I feel it was worth every cent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to gush about a product, so when I do- I really mean it. I LOVE this dryer. For the first time in my life, I have pretty, soft UNFRIZZY curls. I have used DevaCurl products for some time and while they helped with the frizz, they didn&#x27;t eliminate it. Neither did oils and serums. This dryer allows me to get some lift thru the crown while maintaining big, frizzless, loose curls all over. Is it expensive? Yes, it is. Is it worth it? Oh, YES it is! I only wish I had made this purchase sooner.</li>
            <li> Read every review before you buy this over-priced product!  This is the second time I&#x27;ve reviewed the Deva dryer because I think it&#x27;s important for prospective buyers to weigh all of the opinions they can before they make the mistake of buying this expensive and useless dryer.  Both I and my daughters (two) have curly hair and so bought this dryer soon after we discovered it in a high-end beauty store.  All three of us went online and watched the video explaining how to use it in addition to poring over the instructions.  All three of us discovered that, first of all, there is absolutely nothing this blow dryer can do that a much less expensive dryer can&#x27;t do; the sight of the attachment lures buyers into looking at the product and then there&#x27;s so much hype about it---including the reviews here on Amazon---that they spend the extra money in hopes of great looks....which is exactly what I did.  Please beware!!  My daughters and I also gave this dryer several chances and used it for weeks in hopes that it would live up to the claims but IT DOES NOT DO ANYTHING SPECIAL.  Do not waste your money!  Pass it up and spend half of the price for a Deva blow dryer on one that will do the exact same thing without the bells and whistles and the silly attachment.</li>
            <li> Save your money! This is one expensive dryer and it really doesn&#x27;t do what it promised. I gave it a couple of tries... I really wanted the soft, defined curls result but instead I got super frizzy undefined curls. I watched to how-to video online, followed all the instructions, etc and still got awful results.&lt;br /&gt;My 20 dlls dyer worked much better.</li>
            <li> So, I tried this out today at the salon my friend works at.  You see, I&#x27;m a former hairstylist, and my specialty was curly hair as I have curly hair myself.  I was never deva curl certified or ouidad certified.  I just understood curly hair, and my curly hair clients appreciated my skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the only thing that&#x27;s good about this is that it&#x27;s sort of flat, so it can get into the roots, but it&#x27;s awkward to hold, and it made my curly hair more wavy than curly.  I prefer the cone type diffuser that has the little \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; in it.  I took snips and cut off the ends of the \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; so the air flow can get to my scalp.  It&#x27;s a 20 dollar diffuser with a slight modification, and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  The best thing about those types of diffusers is that they are springy and fit on most hairdryers.  I use mine on high heat, low air flow, and it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s possible this diffuser might be good for fine hair, but for my thick, medium textured, loose ringlet curly hair, it didn&#x27;t enhance my curls in the least.</li>
            <li> Love my first Diffuser!  Gentle glove of air!</li>
            <li> great hairdryer &amp; diffuser.  when i first used it wasn&#x27;t sure if i liked it but after getting used to how to hold it &amp; slide it up under my hair it just brings out the curls.</li>
            <li> I know I paid way too much for a hairdryer but I am happy with this product despite its steep price and not providing a miracle.  I had been using a regular hair dryer with the Devafuser, and the diffuser would get ridiculously hot, but I loved how the diffuser made my curls look.  If your looking for a hair dryer with a lot of heat this is not the one for you.  I would recommend trying the Devafuser, which can be purchased separately first so you know if this is for you.  My curls and hair look healthier, which was my goal.  [[ASIN:B001D14S80 DevaCurl Low-Poo Cleanser (12.0 oz)]][[ASIN:B001D14S76 DevaCurl One Condition (12.0 oz)]]</li>
            <li> It was impossible to find the voltage of the dryer, I thought it may be because as another dryer I have it works with 220 and 110 volts. I received it, the manual talks about both voltages but the equipment mention only 125 volts. I wrote to the supplier and he confirmed it only works with 110 volts. I lost 150 USD, as I live in a 220 volts area.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hairdryer from a website I was directed to through Amazon.com. It blew my hair all around and made it frizz up.  I returned the product within a week. The company did not offer me my money back but issued a credit instead.  I don&#x27;t like many of the products available and it as a result, it will take me a very long time to redeem my credit.  Be careful when purchasing things NOT from Amazon.com directly.</li>
            <li> Love it. I find that it helps by curly hair from being frizzy. Easy to handle and great diffuser</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t bought it, my boyfriend gave it to me as a birthday gift. The dryer is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I&#x27;m loving the results! I&#x27;m a 2C curl with loooong hair and lots of volume! I take approx 15-20 minutes to get it half dry  (I&#x27;m always in a rush, so i haven&#x27;t dry it completely yet with it). I&#x27;m looking for a &amp;#34;after product&amp;#34;, so if you can recommend me a devacurl product that will be great.</li>
            <li> Sent this back...not as expected.  Ordered for someone else, and they did not like. Hated it. Returning was a breeze.</li>
            <li> This made my hair frizzy not curly. It was not what I thought it would be. Not that great of an item.</li>
            <li> This has been the 1st time I have spent over $50 on a hair dryer &amp; have been using the same one with a diffuser for almost 10 yrs. I have been unhappy with my hair for so long I figured it was time for a change. Normally I need a little bit of time adjusting to a new dryer but I got the hang of this one on the 1st try. The design of this thing makes perfect sense &amp; my curls are so much more defined. I bought this along with a few other Devacurl hair products &amp; for once I&#x27;m happy with my hair. This &amp; the devacurl product line has been the only good investment for my hair. I also read Curly Girl: The Handbook &amp; all of this has been life changing for me. I&#x27;m not ashamed of my curls anymore. I highly recommend it all!</li>
            <li> Way over priced.  It&#x27;s just like any other hair dryer with a diffuser.  Don&#x27;t waist your money. Also, my hair is a little past midback, and if I&#x27;m not careful, the vent side of the dryer will suck my hair in and get it all tangled/stuck in the dryer!  Sucks!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from a local professional beauty store.  I may have not known how to properly use this specific dryer and diffuser, however it only amounted in more frizz on my hair, hence the 1 star.  I had high hopes for this item.  I over $100 for the item and ended up returning it due to the frizz factor.  Also it seemed to leave my hair fairly dry.  It took a LONG time to dry and was plain akward to use.  Save your money and get the products instead...and buy a large universal \\&quot;bowl-looking\\&quot; diffuser (see link)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the deva curl products (almost the entire line--in different variations) and LOVE THEM!  I put the products in my hair in the same way I did when I used the Devacurl dryer and Devafuser, BUT I used a different (new) Revlon Dryer (from walmart) along with a conair large \\&quot;bowl-looking\\&quot; diffuser (with the little &#x27;fingers&#x27; inside it) and my hair turned out AWESOME!  I just couldnt take the chance of me using the devacurl dryer wrong, along with going through a trial and error period, in addition to shoving out over $100 bucks.  If they still sold only the devafuser, then I would be open to try that again...but its out of stock everywhere. I knew this dryer sounded too good to be true :P</li>
            <li> This thing made my wife&#x27;s Christmas last year. She was so excited to receive it as a gift - and I was her Christmas Hero. She has been using DevaCurl products for a long time, and nothing makes her hair take on its natural curls like DevaCurl products. She uses it when she doesn&#x27;t have time to pin up her hair, or when she is really out to impress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her curls are very bouncy, and when every other product failed - this one came through for her. If you have curly hair, there is nothing better. GET IT!</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this product 10 stars. If you are a curly girl just get it, don&#x27;t hesitate! My hair looks soo good. Here&#x27;s the thing. (1) it does not heat to a point that will damage your hair and (2) most importantly, if you are like me, my hair takes hours to dry. It dries our hair fast! The (Hand) has vents on both side and dries both directions making it a much quicker process!!!</li>
            <li> I bought the dryer and fuser in 2010 as a gift for my wife, who has exceptionally curly hair. The difference between this dryer and the Conair unit she had is ridiculous... The old dryer seems like a toy! The build quality of the DevaCurl dryer is leaps and bounds above just about anything you can buy in a retail store. My wife gets a lot of use out of the fuser attachment, and it seems to work well for her.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair. It did nothing for me. Need traditional diffuser. This dryer is for people with tight curls.</li>
            <li> Love using this diffuser on my curly, thinning hair!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that&#x27;s fussy.  I have used many diffusers over the years and was hoping this was going to be the last one I ever had to buy!!  It wasn&#x27;t.  It was just an expensive hair dryer with a funny looking hand diffuser that acted like any of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I returned it.</li>
            <li> The DevaFuser is my favorite diffuser for my curly hair--it does a great job getting the roots dry and keeping lift. Unfortunately the dryer broke after 2 years of using it a few times a week for 5-10 minutes. For me, it&#x27;s way too expensive to repurchase this every 2 years; the performance isn&#x27;t that much better than a regular diffuser on a $30 hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Well constructed dryer with professional features.  Cord quality is outstanding.  The &#x27;hand&#x27; diffuser attachment is meant for longer curly hair--well below shoulder length/mid-back--to lift it at roots.  If your hair is shorter, and want &#x27;lift&#x27; at the crown, scrunch in some extra-hold gel at roots, section it, pick up the hair at the roots and secure sections with med-small plastic jaw clips, and use the &#x27;concentrated&#x27; airflow diffuser at root level to help dry hair--can air-dry the rest of hair or use it to speed up the drying.</li>
            <li> made my hair more frizzy....blow dryer not hot enough.  Back to my original dryer and diffuser. Nice concept but doesnt do what it says.  dries hair fast but makes it a frizzy mess. returned it.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dry along with the hand hair has a lot more body and receive lots of comments on it</li>
            <li> Purchased for 14 yr old daughter who has curly hair.  She used it a couple of times and all she got was frizz.  About a week later, she accidentally dropped it from about 3 ft height.  It hit the bathroom floor and the entire blade inside shattered rendering the product useless.  I had not kept the packaging or warranty registration- never had a blow dryer shatter from one drop so who knew this one that cost me 3-4X more than my usual dryer would! - so i could not return it for a replacement. Though very doubtful clumsiness is covered in the warranty. Now I am stuck with diffuser attachment that won&#x27;t fit any of my other hair dryers.  Overall very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s official: I&#x27;m not just an air dry girl anymore! I was really skeptical about this dryer/diffuser set. I usually air dry my 3b/c curly hair which I usually keep in a pixie cut or a small afro. As my hair gets longer (shoulder-length), it takes longer to dry and I find that it collapses into the dreaded triangle shape that signals that I need a haircut STAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just transitioned from Ouidad products to DevaCurl products because I&#x27;m sensitive to the chemicals in Ouidad products and I used my regular DevaCurl products with the dryer and diffuser. I dried my hair about 85%. I was surprised by how effective the dryer was because it doesn&#x27;t get very hot. But that&#x27;s the point, the interesting &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; shape of the diffuser and the not too-hot temperature is perfect for curly hair. After one use, I looked like I had just gotten a haircut at Ouidad and I had the volume that I usually love. The volume is what some other reviewers might refer to as &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; but personally, I love when my afro is large and in charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heaviest part of the dryer is the extra long cord. The dryer itself is surprisingly light. The diffuser is even lighter. If you can pay the extra cash, I recommend getting them together so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the diffuser working on your usual dryer but also because the dryer is purposefully made for curly hair and the lower heat functions to keep your curly hair safe from heat damage.</li>
            <li> Best dryer on the market</li>
            <li> Love the adapter on this dryer with curly hair it leaves curls ,and doesn&#x27;t blow it out.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it if you have curls.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for a hair dryer. Nothing unique would suggest a less expensive hair dryer. No real advantage  so why</li>
            <li> I have tried all the \\&quot;newest\\&quot;  hairdryers over the decades ( ceramic - ionizer - tourmaline etc ) with  little to no difference in my hair. Now that I have finally found Curlygirl.com and the DevaCurl curly/wavy haircare line, I AM IN HEAVEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the DevaCurl products for a few months but found as soon as I used my old hairdryer, even with a diffuser, it negated all the benefits the hair products were doing.  I decided to  order the DevaCurl Dryer from Amazon and am I ever glad I did. This had made my morning hair routine a piece of cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is very easy to use and has two heat settings, as well as hi and lo,  which helps me a lot. I have very thick wavy hair  (type 2C Curlygirl ) just off my shoulders and my morning routine is back to 10-15 minutes max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re hesitant to pay this much for a hairdryer that will last you for years and years, consider this:&lt;br /&gt;How much would you pay for: ... a nice dinner out? or theatre tickets?  a great pair of shoes? a full tank of gas?  numerous bad haircuts b/c they don&#x27;t know how to cut and style curly hair? the perfect pair of earrings?&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be using this daily.  No more &#x27; bad hair days&#x27; with this hairdryer along with  the DevaCurl haircare products.&lt;br /&gt;I hate to sound corny but, this is an investment in your happiness.</li>
            <li> I had purchased the &amp;#34;DevaFuser&amp;#34; years ago, and gave it to my daughter, only to discover that the company no longer sold this as a separate piece, and if I wanted another one, which I did, I&#x27;d have to buy the entire package. Didn&#x27;t really need a new blow dryer, but I finally went ahead and got it and am glad I did.  The hair dryer has two settings, both temperatures perfect for curly hair , I use the high setting to get the water out after washing and then switch to the lower.  Nothing makes my curly hair look as good as this dryer and difuser combination.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have straight thin hair most of my head, except little wave underneath. I like to scrunch my hair to create wave, because it saves time rather than curling and it seems to work with enough product. Thought I would give the ArcAngel gel a try along with DevaCurl Dryer &amp; DevaFuser; to see if I get more wave! When compared with my regular dryer vs. DevaCurl dryer+diffuser and different combinations/method of product, I concluded that it is definitely the dryer that creates the awesome waves - not the gel Deva sells. I will post a comparison pic. so you can see for yourself! :)</li>
            <li> I was on the fence about ordering this hairdryer because I&#x27;ve never spent much on my dryers. So worth it. I love it. No frizzy curls and Its so easy to dry my hair next to my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have been going &amp;#34;au natural&amp;#34; for awhile and decided to get a diffuser. After doing some research, Deva got rave reviews, so I decided to go with DevaCurl dryer and fuser. It is fantastic! I have very fine hair with some wave, but no volume. After using the system, my hair was so full looking with just the right amount of wave. Spend the money--it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser and bought this on a whim. I&#x27;ve seen this in the professional beauty supply for several months, maybe a year now.  I was very skeptical being in the business.  The price was less than I would have paid in the professional store and needed a new dryer so I decided to try it.  Being a wavy/curly haired girl, this has completely changed my regimen.  BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE WAVY or CURLY hair!</li>
            <li> Really good for wavy or curly hair, adds volume and height, love it, worth the price, good quality..</li>
            <li> I really like the DevaFuser. I like how the &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; holds your curls and how you can also go underneath to dry different sections. It is a little pricey but I use it a couple of time a weeks so it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Diffuser keeps falling off; on/off switch for hair dryer is right where my hand goes to hold it, so I kept turning it off as I was moving it around.  Diffuser seems like more of a gimmick than a really useful attachment.</li>
            <li> crazy blower.  You can just as well use your fingers instead of the attachment I&#x27;m sorry to say.</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning I style my hair wet.  If I have to go out quickly, I just give it a little dry in the front with the DevaCurl Dryer.  It lets me get out the door faster.  Highly recommend for curly haired ladies that style their hair naturally.</li>
            <li> This diffuser-dryer is like nothing else in curly hair styling tools.  It&#x27;s gentle, light weight, super easy to hold and it&#x27;s engineered perfectly for activating curl shape and feeping it judt where it belongs</li>
            <li> I like this product, but the diffuser falls off easily and the blower has a funny smell when operating.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, that is all that matters but as an added bonus my daughter who does hair for a living at a SPA also loves it.</li>
            <li> Was a gift and the review from the gift receiver is 5 star.</li>
            <li> I had very high expectations for this expensive hair dryer.  My hair is really wavy, some people say curly.  I was hoping to improve the finished look by using this hair dryer but I found it to be really no better than the cheap sock diffuser I had on my old hair dryer.  But it does do what it says it does, so I will definitely use it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It does not make my hair frizzy and it also helps to detangle my hair  without using a brush.</li>
            <li> I love their products.  They found my curls after years of thinking they were gone.  I don&#x27;t use the dryer everytime I wash my hair, but when I use it, it never ruins the curls or turns them into frizz the way my onld difuser did.  I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> What can I say, this little thing is the bomb. I do not spend on stuff like this because I want the value for my money....great everyday results, and longevity of product. Success! First blow dryer I ever spent more than 25$money on. Not a tinge if regret.</li>
            <li> I am a S-Wavy to Wavy girl.  Having fought my hair all my life, I have finally come to the conclusion that my hair is happiest when I allow the curls to have their way.  No more flat-irons.  No more high-sudsing shampoos.  My hair has been MUCH happier with most of the Deva Curl line.  I have been using a diffusing hair dryer by Conair, and it was okay, but I still had to handle my hair too much, which caused the ends to get all frizzy.  The concept of the Deva Curl Dryer and DevaFuser made much sense to me.  I was a bit leery of the price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a superior hair dryer and the &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; diffuser is comfortable and easy to use.  But, with a short asymmetrical hair style, I&#x27;m not sure this is the answer.  The vid and photos show a glorious Botticelli curled girl with long hair, and it would be great.  My short hair, wavy style:  the &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;into&amp;#34; the curl unless I pick up the hair sections and drape it over the &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; of the diffuser.  When I do manipulate the hair properly through the &amp;#34;fingers,&amp;#34; the dryer provides lift and volume quite well.  I think longer hair wouldn&#x27;t require so much of my own manipulations and movements for my hair to take advantage of the 360 degree air flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quiet dryer.  Lightweight.  The cord is NINE FEET long and of a professional heavy-duty grade.  I think the cord weighs more than the dryer itself.  The dryer handle doesn&#x27;t fold.  The &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; is quite large.  It takes up one drawer of my two-drawer vanity in the bathroom.  It won&#x27;t go on trips with me, as it&#x27;s entirely too large and bulky for carrying in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think long Botticelli and corkscrew curls would benefit most from this hairdryer.  The $150 price tag is steep for 3 stars and my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Worth the money.  Just get it!</li>
            <li> For curly girls, this dryer is a must.  It&#x27;s little green fingers penetrate to the root and provide volume like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  The dryer is also light weight with a long cord which makes it functional.  This was very intelligently designed.  Well done!</li>
            <li> I have what you call 1980&#x27;s Hair...not in the good way. But after getting my hair done by curly girl trained person and her showing me how to do it and with this awesome blow dryer my hair looks healthy and great!! Seriously I know I sound self involved about this, but finally loving my hair and the way I look makes me fill good about myself. All the pretty soft straight haired girls are now loving \\&quot;my\\&quot; hair and wishing they had it..instead of me wishing I had straight hair.</li>
            <li> I saw this in a highend store for $230. I had just cut my hair from a \\&quot;deva curl specialist\\&quot; (best cut I&#x27;ve had in 53 yrs!!)&amp; had read about this dryer. My husband thought it was a great Valentine&#x27;s gift. I mentioned we could get it cheaper on line, but he wanted me to have it then (yes, he&#x27;s a keeper). Hence the 3 stars. Well, the hand I do not like. My hair is ringlets &amp; spirals &amp; it made it even curlier, not good. The dryer is not very hot, it does take longer to dry, but it definitly helps with the frizz. So, what I have done is use a micro fiber cloth to help remove moisture, another recommendation from deva curl. I had no idea how much frizz comes from a towel &amp; put my bowl diffuser from my old $20 blower on it. When my hair is half dry, I switch to the old dryer for a few minutes. The ultimate result is beautiful hair! I use different hair products that are cleansing conditioners from Wen, but use the \\&quot;No poo\\&quot; when I want a deeper clean. Hope this helps someone out there. You can go online to DevaCurl.com for a specialist near you. I have used the same gal for literally 25 yrs. My blonde weave is great, but never got the same cut twice. I let it grow out for yrs &amp; then wanted a style. My new stylist is young, but she has a 10 yr old with extremely curly hair. That was all I needed to know!! She cut it dry, curl by curl. It took almost 2 hrs, but my gosh it&#x27;s great!! I stopped being \\&quot;my hair\\&quot; 8 yrs ago &amp; this is another step closer to embracing my curls.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing! My hair is fine and mostly straight ... has just a small amount of wave that disappear completely if you  brush it. In the past, I have tortured my hair terribly in a quest for full, voluminous, fluffy hair. I&#x27;ve destroyed my fine hair with perms. I&#x27;ve trashed it with back-combing and fistfuls of mousse and gel. It&#x27;s been ridiculous. And sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I wash my hair and comb through it with a large, wide comb/pick, then scrunch with mousse and then scrunch some more with diffuser with my head bent over, then hairspray the heck out of it  ..... I can get some decent &amp;#34;waves&amp;#34;. But it&#x27;s very time consuming and often still leaves me with flyaways and frizz.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Deva Blow Dryer is insane! Seriously, it easily creates pretty, smooth, shiny, frizz-free waves in my hair, super fast! The hand style diffuser is genius. Now I just wash my hair, comb through with wide comb, scrunch some mousse in, then dry with my Deva hairdryer. It dries my hair quickly. It preserves the waves. It leaves a smooth, shiny, soft finish. No frizz. No flyaways. Not at all time consuming or difficult. Just easy and quick. And now my hair can have fluffy, soft, shiny waves with very little effort! Awesome!! This. thing. rocks!  :)</li>
            <li> I think it is an amazing hair dryer with one exception: if it is held upside down the diffuser falls off.  The instructions indicate to hold it in an upward position.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and was given as a gift. My daughter was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Before buying the DevaCurl Dryer with DevaFuser, I had wondered, &amp;#34;Should I spend this much for a hair dryer? Or just get a separate dryer and a diffuser that are both less expensive?&amp;#34; Now I know -- it&#x27;s totally worth it! I use DevaCurl products and this dryer delivers as promised - soft, frizz-free curls when I use the DevaFuser, and beautiful looking, straight hair when I use the concentrator.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect dryer for &amp;#34;the job&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;You know what job I mean.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it; if you are looking at this dryer you have already tried lots of other things for your curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Well, this fantastic looking green hand will help you shape your hair from the inside out. Dry the roots.&lt;br /&gt;Then you can use the palm of the green hand as a diffuser. Cup those lovely curls to your scalp while you tenderly dry them. Your hair will come out great. Up to its full potential. I wish I could explain it better.&lt;br /&gt;In all, it works so well you will save all the money you would have spent getting the next best elusive thing.&lt;br /&gt;Do not worry, you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the closest thing you can do to actually &amp;#34;buying&amp;#34; curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this dryer. You&#x27;ll have to pry its cold green hand from my cold dead hand...</li>
            <li> the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it is awkward to hold and if you compare the size of the blow dryer with the size of the cord, it is rediculous.  The blow dryer is not that big but the cord is really thick and really long.  Probably good for a hair stylist but for home it makes it harder to store.  otherwise, my curls love this dryer.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair with 3b curls that can go to a frizzy mess in humidity. The Deva Curl products are all wonderful and I use them daily. I have read reviews (here and there) about people not being happy with the Deva Curl dryer and diffuser. I think it could be the instructions that come with the dryer. The first time I used the dryer I followed the instructions on the back of the box. My hair is almost exactly like the model profiled. When I was finished my hair had tight, frizzy curls with a lot of puff. (Granted the frizz could be the 98%+ humidity with no a/c). The 2nd time I used the dryer I notched the setting down from high and lost some (not all) of the puffy and frizz. I used it again this morning and used the diffuser my own way. NOW my hair looks awesome and more like the model profiled. I did not dry my hair completely (90% dry). I don&#x27;t have to go to work with a wet head and I&#x27;m guaranteed nice curls wherever I am (hard/soft water, humidity....etc...). I&#x27;m not sure why the directions are the way they are. When I had a professional dry my hair with one of these she didn&#x27;t follow the directions on the box. She never left the diffuser on spots for two (2) plus minutes. She was drying different parts of hair at different times and coming back around and repeating (which is how I did it).&lt;br /&gt;The Deva diffuser differs from a regular diffuser because it dries the top and bottom of your hair at one time. Basically less/no time using your hands with the diffuser.  Dryer is light and does not get hot like my cheap Kmart one did.&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this diffuser work with it and create your own instruction manual. We all have different types of curls and waves. What works best for one might not work for another. I use some of the Deva products different from the directions that are posted on the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the Deva Curl detangle spray...fantastic! It&#x27;s a must have for curly girls who get knots.</li>
            <li> Updated to add link to video demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;z0rGfmT4jQE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK I finally went out on a limb and got this mostly due to a video of someone with pretty straight hair using it on a shorter cut and it was great. I figured even if I cut my hair short again someday this would still work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with The Hand and a concentrator (I have never figure out how to use a concentrator, but its there if you need it!). The cord is LONG, like 9 ft. It&#x27;s a solid round heavy duty cord and not like the lamp cords on your regular blowdryer. High low force settings and High low heat settings and a cool shot button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First The Hand. I&#x27;m actually finding it is great at getting in and getting root volume. Use it like you do in Pixie Diffusing, don&#x27;t move it! And let it do its job. Leave it a minute or two. Move that all around your scalp (OFF in between and STAYING STILL while on, also put the \\&quot;finger tips\\&quot; on the scalp and angle the palm up an inch or two) for those sections that just won&#x27;t dry otherwise. Don&#x27;t forget the nape and back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I like that I can switch it out for my bowl diffuser (Revlon tourmaline bowl one) for the rest of my hair and then go back to The Hand and use single fingers in the top, lifting for more volume. like you would use a pinky to lift a section, but this pinky blows lightly. It works pretty slick. Also, if you hold it over your hair and slightly away, and DON\\&quot;T MOVE IT AROUND you&#x27;ll get a decent \\&quot;hood dryer\\&quot; effect. I actually like that effect with my bowl diffuser on it better, but The Hand is pretty good. You can also insert it under big sections with the \\&quot;palm\\&quot; of the hand outward (holding STILL) and get lift AND some extra length drying. I do that at the end though when it is like 70 or so percent dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the dryer itself. Love it. It&#x27;s small. I can hold it any which way. The body does NOT get hot. The attachment does NOT get hot. I can change the direction of thediffuser and not worry about singeing fingers. The buttons seem to fall very conveniently no matter which way I hold it for switching on and off, moving from high to low heat, or high to low speed and using the cool shot. It was very well thought out. I LOVE that the screen on the back comes out to be defuzzed. This is the downfall of all the drugstore models I&#x27;ve ever gotten and I suspect the \\&quot;killer\\&quot; of same when you get frustrated not being able to get the fuzz out. The high heat is not as high I don&#x27;t think as my old one, but that&#x27;s better for your hair. However it&#x27;s high enough if you are using your old drying techniques it&#x27;ll dry fine. I LOVE the low heat setting. It just seems....right. Also, my old dryer would make my lights flicker. Turn it on, flicker. Press the cool shot button, flicker. This does NOT. This may be a result of the much higher quality cord. I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m much less worried about blowing a fuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am just happy as a clam with this thing. Frankly, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone. I&#x27;ve never tried a high end dryer before (which all seem to be priced about the same as this) so maybe they&#x27;re all great, but I feel like I have the best of ALL worlds to manipulate my hair with the Hand, the concentrator and my bowl diffuser, or just plain open. Personally, I feel its a very good tool and as much time as we all spend on our hair, it&#x27;s going to be worth its price to have a good hair tool if you aren&#x27;t the type that can&#x27;t air dry, like me.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have fine, low end of medium thickness hair that when wet hits at about my bra line. The main problem with my hair is volume, my roots tend to be flat and if I don&#x27;t diffuse my hair to almost 100% dry with a normal dryer it&#x27;s all over pretty flat and dull looking. I decided to give this dryer and diffuser combo a try after exclusively using the deva line of products for the prior six months.&lt;br /&gt;First day using the dryer and my hair looks awesome! I watched several videos online to see the technique behind using the dryer and that was very helpful. I just dried my hair to about 60% and have great volume at the roots and soft voluminous curls all over. It makes it look like I have a lot of hair which is what I want rather than looking like I have fine, thinner hair.</li>
            <li> This is a really great dryer, very strong and I like the different heat settings (especially the cold blast to set the curls). I have very moody short hair that some days is wavy and others flat (depending on the weather). The curl attachment is amazing and curls my hair right up. My only complaints: The attachment doesn&#x27;t stay on very well and the buttons on the handle are loose (easy to switch) so I frequently change the settings unintentionally when I hold it. Finally, the cord is extremely long and bulking-  I assume this would be great for a pro hairstylist with a chair in a salon but it is too much for just plugging in next to my sink at home.</li>
            <li> not enough power in the hairdryer.  It felt like more work to get the &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; where it needed to be.</li>
            <li> Ingenious diffuser!  Wish it fit more of my blow dryers.  I love this one it is a bit too big to travel with, but as the diffuser won&#x27;t fit my travel dryer, I now make sure I have the room to bring this on every trip!</li>
            <li> As far as a blow dyer goes, its a good product. The hand attachment is good for curls, but you cant move it too vigorously through your hair. You&#x27;ll only end up with frizz. I use is mostly to dry the back and bottom of my head during winter. My curls are very tight. I do see that it adds a little volume by my roots, but not a much as i would like. I find it a little expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> Defintely worth the money if you like VOLUME! I am able to get the volume I like with this product, something a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; diffuser can not do.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair this dryer is for you.  If you want more body and lift in your hair this dryer is for you.  It will dry your hair fast without blowing it all over the place.  If your hair style is on the shorter side the fingers are harder to get up onto your scalp.  Medium to long its great.  Even though its rather pricy its worth it and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Awesome for people with thick, curly hair. This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> My hair tends to frizz and look like straw. I quit using blow dryers to protect it.  Then I decided to go natural, and found that my curls are flat if I don&#x27;t put my head down and dry the roots at least.  This dries quickly without frizzing. Even on HIGH it barely moves my hair (and my hair is fine). I wash with No-Poo, use a little Arc AnGel, dry the roots a few minutes, then scrunch the ends up with the dryer hand and I&#x27;m good to go! I thought it was very pricey when I broke down and bought it, but I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth. Thanks, DevaCurl for EVERYTHING</li>
            <li> My deva stylist uses this hair dryer with more skill than I have been able to manage and I don&#x27;t get nearly as good a result. My regular hair dryer, used with a diffuser attachment, seems to do a better and quicker job than the deva dryer.</li>
            <li> I really like this drier.  It works so well on my curly hair</li>
            <li> I received the deva blow without the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Got tired of walking out the door with wet hair, especially here in Colorado...it&#x27;s really cold in the mornings. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now and it&#x27;s perfect! I thought it would be awkward getting used to, but it fits my hand perfectly and is much lighter than other blow dryers I&#x27;ve used. This is a MUST for you curlies out there!</li>
            <li> she asked for this by name and she couldn&#x27;t be happier.  i don&#x27;t know much more than that but happy wife, happy life!</li>
            <li> Everything is needed in a hair dryer for curly hair</li>
            <li> I paid $135 for a hair dryer that is supposedly “specifically for curly and wavy hair!” and is supposed to create “soft, shiny frizz free curls.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it didn’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say for that price for a freakin’ hairdryer I was expecting miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judging by the reviews, it has worked for some people. Unfortunately, not me. Just some info: My hair just touches my shoulders, and is at that odd stage between wavy and curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if you have long hair it works better, or hair that is already super curly (like the models hair is)&lt;br /&gt;But it says that it is made for wavy hair as well so I hoped I would see something that would make me able to justify spending  $135 for a stupid hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next move is to just get a $10 diffuser attachment from Ulta. I think some other reviewer already said that was a better route to take…. Should have listened. :[</li>
            <li> Works great with my curls (botticelli type)!</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed due to high price . The hand attachment tends to fall off which is annoying.</li>
            <li> It broke about 30 days past the returnable time.  I turned it on and it just stopped working half way through drying my hair.  It should have lasted a lot longer than that, especially for how expensive it is.</li>
            <li> This is worth $160 at Sephora so when I saw it for $30 less I decided to go for it. I was disappointed. It didn&#x27;t do anything that my $50 difuser can&#x27;t do. As a matter of fact my difuser actually works on my hair and totally didn&#x27;t. I have fine curly hair, but LOTS of hair and it didn&#x27;t give me any &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; results like the brand ads promised so I returned it. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Works well for curyly hair.  Not so good to blow hair straight.  The switches are too easy to hit while using the dryer.</li>
