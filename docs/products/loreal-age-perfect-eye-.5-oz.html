            <li>Amazon&#x27;s return/refund policy took care of the problem, but I have three more of these on the way, and I&#x27;m worried ....</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years - purchased MANY jars from the drug store.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite drugstore brand.</li>
            <li>Do I have to say more??</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years but cannot find in stores anymore.  </li>
            <li>more often \\&quot;Age Fighting\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This eye cream is light, not greasy and makes the area around my eyes feel moisturized more than just using a day moisturizer alone.  </li>
            <li>I figured, this was cheap, let me try it.</li>
            <li>I ordered three of these, and they arrived securely packed and on time.</li>

            <li>stand by my original post....</li>

            <li>it was super cheap.</li>
            <li>any company that has to pay someone to write their reviews needs to put out a better product so real reviews can be written.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased though that my review caused this company to delete their embarrassing, obvious 100% reviews of their product written by</li>
            <li>There is no way this item is new, unopened, or a  product I could consider safe.</li>
            <li>I really need to get these refunded!!</li>
            <li>As my skin has become older it needs something towards the thicker side of eye creme for more intense hydration.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not the most recent.</li>
            <li>First off, I don&#x27;t like reviews that comment on the packaging, the delivery, etc.</li>
            <li>As for the results, my under eye area is much more hydrated than just using my oil-free facial moisturizer</li>
            <li>I am sure they were never used before, but how they were shipped caused the cream inside look all stirred up and totally upside</li>

            <li>This is a light moisturizer that takes away the fine wrinkles without dragging down the tissues around the eyes, or creating any irritation.</li>
            <li>So far no reactions, no irritation to my eyes, it&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>What Jesse needs to realize is that anyone could have a reaction to an ingredient in any product that they are allergic to, that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t a good product for someone else without the allergy.  </li>
            <li>The jar was only 1/2 full.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer it to the newer, more glamorous, more expensive output from L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>Leaves it soft and fresh not heavy.  </li>
            <li>The plastic circle that covers the top of new cream was missing.  </li>
            <li>When I opened the bottles, they all looked very old and used.</li>
            <li>Sticky, finger prints on the cream and container only half full, a HAIR inside!!</li>
            <li>The only positive feedback comes from a feedback pro.  </li>
            <li>I tend to use different products at certain times to try to keep my skin young.</li>
            <li>This is made for mature skin.</li>

            <li>With my purchase the tape that proves the jar has not been opened was missing.  </li>

            <li> The color of the cream was slightly different from each other also.&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT, one jar had obviously been opened previously; it had no tamper-proof seal.</li>
            <li> but it lessens what I have and hydrates my very dry under eye skin.</li>
            <li> but maybe it was my fault because this says its for aged skin</li>
            <li> When I opened the jar, it was half empty, and the cream was discolored.</li>

            <li> a few pro reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (Lancome) a few years after they come out in the specialty stores.</li>
            <li> I prefer it over every expensive brand I have purchased so far.</li>

            <li> I think my past purchases have also had an inside cap that lifted off.  </li>
            <li> This actually dried my eye area and gave me spots!</li>
            <li> :-/</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have excessive eye wrinkles</li>
            <li> I had to stop using this product because I started getting dark spots around my eyes!!!  </li>
            <li> This cream did not help in the least.</li>
            <li> The seal was broken and some of the product had been used.  </li>
            <li> It is either faked or expired product with poor quality</li>
            <li> I buy from inexpensive drugstore to expensive dermatologist brand eye creams.</li>
            <li> Because I was afraid to use it I tossed it out.</li>
            <li> I am extremely unhappy - I have been ripped off.</li>
            <li> The package wasnt protected so the box was in bad shape, however the product was saved.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is an used item -- totally disgusting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not enough hydration for me. I have very dry skin that is mature, in my 50&#x27;s. This cream did not help in the least.</li>
            <li> I tried this cream and now have to go to a dermatologist because of a skin  reaction.  The only positive feedback comes from a feedback pro.  Don&#x27;t believe me.......read the other \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; they have left.  Buyer beware....any company that has to pay someone to write their reviews needs to put out a better product so real reviews can be written.&lt;br /&gt;___&lt;br /&gt;To add on 5/13 I see that the professional reviewers have deleted their reviews, therefore my comment referencing their fake reviews is now obsolete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still buyer beware.  ALWAYS check the history of the person reviewing a product because believe it or not, there are paid persons writing reviews all over the internet.  I&#x27;m very pleased though that my review caused this company to delete their embarrassing, obvious 100% reviews of their product written by a few pro reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stand by my original post....I would never buy this cream again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product several times. As my skin has become older it needs something towards the thicker side of eye creme for more intense hydration. This is made for mature skin. I tend to use different products at certain times to try to keep my skin young. I may use a tightening serum and then an alpha hydroxy. (Not on my eyes) I like this product. It reminds me of a product that Lancome carried some years ago.It seems like the same formula. (I used to work for Lancome) Loreal has owned Lancome for many years. (As far as I know they still do.) Less expensive lines (Loreal) tend to get products from higher priced lines (Lancome) a few years after they come out in the specialty stores. I think we are getting the same product as Lancome costumers did 10 years ago. That to say, it does contain excellent skin technology. It&#x27;s just not the most recent.</li>
            <li> The seal was broken and some of the product had been used.  Because I was afraid to use it I tossed it out.</li>
            <li> The package wasnt protected so the box was in bad shape, however the product was saved. I bought it to give to my friend as a present...</li>
            <li> works like the highter price eye products</li>
            <li> First off, I don&#x27;t like reviews that comment on the packaging, the delivery, etc.I want  review of the product and how it performs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up at a local store because it was on sale and I had a coupon, so it was super cheap. I have had issues with expensive eye creams from major department stores, and always have to discontinue use. I figured, this was cheap, let me try it. So far no reactions, no irritation to my eyes, it&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly. I don&#x27;t like an eye cream that makes my mascara smudge. Some of the heavier ones will do that and then I&#x27;m only using it at night. No problems with this one, none at all. As for the results, my under eye area is much more hydrated than just using my oil-free facial moisturizer and I feel the lines are softer. It&#x27;s only been a week.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years.  Softens the appearance of wrinkles, lifts skin around eyes.  Skin feels wonderful and smooth, all at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and have been very happy with it.  I was disappointed with this purchase.  The cream was not the same color and very thick.  I think my past purchases have also had an inside cap that lifted off.  This one did not.  I would like to send it back but don&#x27;t want to pay the postage.  I will have to purchase another jar as this one is just not the product I am used to.</li>
            <li> It is an used item -- totally disgusting. It should not sale at all. It is unsafe for use.</li>
            <li> I ordered three of these, and they arrived securely packed and on time. BUT, one jar had obviously been opened previously; it had no tamper-proof seal. When I opened the jar, it was half empty, and the cream was discolored. For a personal care product, this is revolting. Amazon&#x27;s return/refund policy took care of the problem, but I have three more of these on the way, and I&#x27;m worried .... UPDATED April 19, 2014: The remaining three creams arrived; their original packaging was shabby, but all the tamper-proof seals were in place on the jars. I think these packages are old and have been handled a lot, but as long as the jars haven&#x27;t been opened I&#x27;ll keep them. I just hope their age hasn&#x27;t rendered them unsafe.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years - purchased MANY jars from the drug store.  It is an awesome eye cream ... If purchased from a reputable dealer!  With my purchase the tape that proves the jar has not been opened was missing.  The plastic circle that covers the top of new cream was missing.  The jar was only 1/2 full.  There is no way this item is new, unopened, or a  product I could consider safe. I am extremely unhappy - I have been ripped off.</li>
            <li> This actually dried my eye area and gave me spots! but maybe it was my fault because this says its for aged skin and I brought it thinking it will be a good idea to prevent wrinkles :-/ idk still wouldn&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> I buy from inexpensive drugstore to expensive dermatologist brand eye creams. This is my favorite drugstore brand. I&#x27;m 51 and it still works at my age. I prefer it over every expensive brand I have purchased so far. I am trying a new expensive eye cream with growth factors but bought this again just in case. It is light weight, goes on smooth and blends with my liquid makeup. I don&#x27;t have excessive eye wrinkles but it lessens what I have and hydrates my very dry under eye skin. I would recommend it to those who are on a budget and those who waste their money on spa brands that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Do not buy itã€‚it does not worth even it sold much cheaper price. It is either faked or expired product with poor quality</li>
            <li> When I opened the bottles, they all looked very old and used. I am sure they were never used before, but how they were shipped caused the cream inside look all stirred up and totally upside down.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased three bottles because I thought the price was good for eye cream. The color of the cream was slightly different from each other also.&lt;br /&gt;Discoloration made me think that these products are exposed in heat and damaged. I had to stop using this product because I started getting dark spots around my eyes!!!  I really need to get these refunded!! Very unhappy with the product!!</li>
            <li> This is a light moisturizer that takes away the fine wrinkles without dragging down the tissues around the eyes, or creating any irritation. I much prefer it to the newer, more glamorous, more expensive output from L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> Sticky, finger prints on the cream and container only half full, a HAIR inside!! Do I have to say more?? GROSS!!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect.  I have used this for many years but cannot find in stores anymore.  I use it every night before going to bed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what made reviewer Jesse think the reviews of this product were written by people paid by the company to give positive reviews.  I am a real person, have used this product for over a year and like it very much.  I am at an age where I look for \\&quot;Age Perfect\\&quot; products, or more often \\&quot;Age Fighting\\&quot;.  This eye cream is light, not greasy and makes the area around my eyes feel moisturized more than just using a day moisturizer alone.  It seems to me my crows feet are less noticiable also.  I am blonde and have fairly sensitive skin and have had no problems with any type of skin reaction.  What Jesse needs to realize is that anyone could have a reaction to an ingredient in any product that they are allergic to, that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t a good product for someone else without the allergy.  I have used LOREAL products for years and have always liked them.  Click my name on this review to see all the other reviews I have written, and NO, they aren&#x27;t all good!</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing.  I have severe allergies and this cream doesn&#x27;t bother my skin.  Leaves it soft and fresh not heavy.  I have used it on my eyes and entire face for well over 5 years.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
