            <li> My hairdresser uses this and I LOVE the smell, so I bought sample sizes to try it for several days. I decided that my hair wasn&#x27;t any better compared to my regular shampoo and conditioner, and the smell isn&#x27;t good enough to pay that much more.</li>
            <li> I began using this product early this year and I love it. The travel set was a wonderful find.  I can refill them from my full size bottles for travel and never have to figure out what is in what bottle.  This product has cured my dandruff and made my hair soft and shiny.  In spite of the price I continue to use this for the quality.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Delivery on time.</li>
            <li> came on time and was exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel...</li>
            <li> Love these products They are highly concentrated so a little goes a long way!  Will not use any other shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself makes my hair very nice. My hair is naturally a bit curly and can frizz. Certain shampoos make it worse; this one does not, if anything it makes it smoother. Only problem I can&#x27;t get past is the smell. My husband calls me &amp;#34;grandpa&amp;#34; when I use it bc he thinks it smells like an old man&#x27;s deodorant. I&#x27;m not fond of the smell either. It&#x27;s not pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> Favorite shampoo and conditioner. Used for years.</li>
            <li> Two shampoos came -  no conditioner. Very upsetting (thought he shampoo is nice)</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner and now I have it in a travel size! I&#x27;ve been using these for years and they don&#x27;t stink of fragrance and they make my hair soft!</li>
            <li> My hair is healthy after 6 months of using product  I recommend pureology products to everyone. My hair even feels lighter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and like to have the small containers when I travel. I purchase the big containers and then just refill into the small ones. I needed another small set.  It lasts me about 7 days for medium length hair which works well when I travel and rather not like to use the products provided at hotels. I go back to my set knowing that my hair will feel and look much better.</li>
            <li> Love this! Smells and feels great!</li>
            <li> My all time favorite, and the travel sizes are great.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner for my natural curly hair.  Works very well, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> I bought the travel size to see if I would like it.  It&#x27;s no better than inexpensive brands and the awful scent lingers forever.</li>
            <li> OMG Transformed My Hair it&#x27;s the only kind I can use! I have Scalp Dermatitis and after only one Use I Swear to God Got Rid of it! And has Made My Hair So Silky and Shiny! My only issue is the cost of this Shampoo and Conditione!  But one dime size drop does my whole head and I have Long wavy curly Hair almost to the middle of My Back Rich Lather! So Worth Every Penny! I Love You Pureology! And Amazon for Selling Your Products!(:💝</li>
            <li> I bought the travel side to try it and if I like it, buy larger bortles and I have travel sizes too. I reasearched and found this to be one of the best for color treated hair. This product leaves my hair smelling like I left a salon. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo all the time now!</li>
            <li> This product was introduced to me by my hair stylist. I love the tingly, clean sensation it gives my color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for anyone that travels and doesn&#x27;t want to bring their larger bottles through the airport.</li>
            <li> Love pureology it used to be my favorite...... if I could afford it.  TGI Bead Head resureection has knocked pureology off it&#x27;s pedestal.  I LOVED pureology,  now I love Bead Head even more-----for a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> me and my family really like this brand its really clean the heir and head I recommand it for every body</li>

            <li> Although the product did make my hair feel softer, the smell was terrible!  Even my husband and kids commented on it.  With so many other products on the market that actually smell good, you would think they could make it smell better.
