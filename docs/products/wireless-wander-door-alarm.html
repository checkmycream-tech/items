    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is a wonderful product and I am considering purchasing another one for the front door.</li>
            <li>It worked wonderful for 2 days and then nothing!  </li>
            <li>We bouhg tone of theses over a year ago and have used it every night as an intrusion alert, It has continued to work excellent</li>
            <li>, It was a great buy!</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>What a great concept and</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It was easy to install, and works great.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to install.</li>
            <li>it eats batteries and doesn&#x27;t seem to work through many walls.</li>
            <li>There are also many ways to install this on your door that work, you don&#x27;t have to put it on just like the picture.</li>
            <li>we are going to try it once more</li>
            <li>The batteries are easy to install.</li>
            <li>Easy to install.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this alarm system to anyone watching out for the safety of a loved one.</li>
            <li>This little device was the perfect solution!</li>
            <li>Dad is taking care of Stepmom, who has advanced Alzheimer&#x27;s and will sometimes get out at night and wander the building.</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased this alarm unit on August 6, 2012.</li>
            <li>I was so, SO excited about this product.  </li>
            <li>Original review:</li>
            <li>They love it, don&#x27;t have to worry as much about her getting out.</li>
            <li>My application was about 40 feet, so I thought I&#x27;d be safe and well within the range, but it won&#x27;t work at distances more than 30 feet, which was not enough nor what they promised.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am the primary caregiver for a person afflicted with Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease and door alarms are an absolute requirement.</li>
            <li>A true lifesaver for all with little children or in my case a loved one with Alzheimers.</li>
            <li>The receiver is loud and mobile, move and place it as needed,though the range isn&#x27;t that great, you can place it to maximize sound throw and volume ( e.g. hallway or stairwell -- resonance chamber ) pointed at hard surfaces for bounce and sound throw.</li>
            <li>ADVICE : ALWAYS be aware of the alarm&#x27;s status----ALWAYS.&lt;br /&gt;Update: 7/12/13&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product that is still working well everyday.</li>
            <li>On the positive side this works well at about 30 feet and setup is very easy (see other review for alternative mounting).</li>
            <li>This product is so easy to install and the instructions make it very simple to understand.</li>
            <li>So I thought, this thing really works and works well.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work for us, but maybe we just got a lemon?</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t find any reasonably priced alternatives, but as-is the product gets just an \\&quot;OK\\&quot; rating.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely furious.</li>
            <li>so I can be awake, but the whole house doesn&#x27;t wake up.  </li>
            <li>it was exactly what we needed to monitor our escape artist 3 year old twins</li>
            <li>Beware of the propensity to turn off the unit in situations of high frequency door openings and closings ( e.g. Visits from people, bringing in groceries, etc.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I will say that if your application is less than 30 feet, it would probably work great, but at distances less than 30 feet, you&#x27;re basically right next to the door anyway.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing we are reliably getting 30 feet distance because straightline the signal has to go through our kitchen and concrete block exterior walls (L-shaped house).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally bought a universal AC/DC adapter to use with this alarm&#x27;s receiver, so the 9V battery usage issue is over; however, I&#x27;m keeping a fresh 9v in the receiver unit in case of power outages.</li>
            <li>so we purchased a new one today.</li>
            <li>My elderly folks (age 89 and 91) live in a semi-assisted living facility in another state.</li>
            <li>Put new batteries in both pieces, worked for another day then stopped working again.</li>
            <li>Tried new batteries,to no avail.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;chime\\&quot; setting is very loud - you can&#x27;t miss it anywhere in our house - and the vibrate (which we use) is also loud</li>
            <li>My 3 year old has been getting out of the house early, early in the morning</li>
            <li>Over all I&#x27;ve been surprised by the longevity and effectiveness of this</li>
            <li>If you purchase this item stock up on 9 volt Duracell batteries it eats them like candy when the alarm goes off frequently, the door transmitter uses a kinda special little 12 volt battery</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the battery contacts are very low quality and don&#x27;t keep a good contact with the battery, then when I tried to change the battery the contacts bent and aren&#x27;t working well at all now.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for small children who are just learning to sleep in a bigger bed.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work last night when she got up, but we thought maybe our battery was old</li>
            <li>Initially I purchased this product as an interim possible immediate need item until I could research and find basically a better product, maybe hard wired--expensive,but that is the cost for proper care.</li>
            <li>The management of the facility is, naturally, very concerned as are my siblings and I. Due to fire department restrictions, they cannot allow the apartment to be locked from the inside.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t believe that BOTH products that people purchase for the safety of their loved ones failed from the get-go!</li>
            <li>It is after 11:00 p.m. and after so looking forward to being able to sleep tonight knowing that if my mother-in-law who suffers from dementia wanders during the night the new Wireless Wander door alarm we purchased would alert us.</li>

            <li> My mother in law suffers with dementia and she took a walk at my in-laws house, fortunately she was returned home by the police, and all ended well, but to prevent future &amp;#34;escapes&amp;#34; we bought this for them to install on the door.</li>
            <li> It may be that it just doesn&#x27;t work in an apartment with thick walls, or in the noisy RF spectrum of New York.</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt and product worked as expected.</li>
            <li> The remote alarm allows us to keep it with us at all times.</li>
            <li> I have fancy door trim so this installation will not work on my door, but there are other ways that do.  </li>
            <li> I know he won&#x27;t fall down the stairs in the dark.</li>
            <li> The alarm still works like a charm everyday.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s clear this is just a very poorly made item.</li>
            <li> I changed the batteries (the door trigger works on a small lithium battery) and still it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in the quality because it was exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li> On the negative side it seems to work as advertized except that walls and appliances might interfere with the signal so that we&#x27;re not getting 100&#x27; distance, and there is no \\&quot;lost signal\\&quot; alert.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very difficult to find alternatives especially at this price.</li>
            <li> This will extend life of small but expensive battery in this unit.</li>
            <li> Disappointing and a waste of my time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Update: we are growing unhappy with this product...</li>
            <li> Our son doesn&#x27;t cry anymore, so the baby monitor is now all but worthless, and I may mount it on the door so we&#x27;ll hear the device through the monitor as a workaround - look for an update.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> very satisfied. Delivery was prompt and product worked as expected.</li>
            <li> I am the primary caregiver for a person afflicted with Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease and door alarms are an absolute requirement.Initially I purchased this product as an interim possible immediate need item until I could research and find basically a better product, maybe hard wired--expensive,but that is the cost for proper care. So I thought, this thing really works and works well. The receiver is loud and mobile, move and place it as needed,though the range isn&#x27;t that great, you can place it to maximize sound throw and volume ( e.g. hallway or stairwell -- resonance chamber ) pointed at hard surfaces for bounce and sound throw. If you purchase this item stock up on 9 volt Duracell batteries it eats them like candy when the alarm goes off frequently, the door transmitter uses a kinda special little 12 volt battery 23AE  such as \\&quot; Energizer A23 (#A23BPZ-2) or Duracell 21/23 (# MN21B2)\\&quot; , the 12 volt battery lasts a lot longer. Over all I&#x27;ve been surprised by the longevity and effectiveness of this unit-- I had a low expectation when I initially ordered it here on Amazon. Good product that is still working well everyday. Beware of the propensity to turn off the unit in situations of high frequency door openings and closings ( e.g. Visits from people, bringing in groceries, etc.). ADVICE : ALWAYS be aware of the alarm&#x27;s status----ALWAYS.&lt;br /&gt;Update: 7/12/13&lt;br /&gt;Finally bought a universal AC/DC adapter to use with this alarm&#x27;s receiver, so the 9V battery usage issue is over; however, I&#x27;m keeping a fresh 9v in the receiver unit in case of power outages. The alarm still works like a charm everyday.I had originally purchased this alarm unit on August 6, 2012.</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to install and the instructions make it very simple to understand. A true lifesaver for all with little children or in my case a loved one with Alzheimers. I recommend to all. Great product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product gives us peace of mind in knowing when the door is opened. It was very easy to install. The remote alarm allows us to keep it with us at all times. I highly recommend this alarm system to anyone watching out for the safety of a loved one. It does require a 9v and AA battery. The batteries are easy to install. This is a wonderful product and I am considering purchasing another one for the front door.</li>
            <li> I was so, SO excited about this product.  My 3 year old has been getting out of the house early, early in the morning and so I needed something to alert me when he wakes up.  It worked wonderful for 2 days and then nothing!  I changed the batteries (the door trigger works on a small lithium battery) and still it didn&#x27;t work.  I really wanted it to work for us, but maybe we just got a lemon?</li>
            <li> The door alarm works nicely when I&#x27;m on the same floor as that door, but the signal does not reach upstairs - which is a big disappointment as that should be in range.</li>
            <li> Easy to install.  Works as advertised.  Suggest hooking up electric connection to monitor to avoid replacement of 9 volt battery.  Also turn off the door unit battery when alarm is not needed.  This will extend life of small but expensive battery in this unit.</li>
            <li> Update: we are growing unhappy with this product... it eats batteries and doesn&#x27;t seem to work through many walls. I&#x27;m dropping it to \\&quot;don&#x27;t like\\&quot; from \\&quot;it&#x27;s OK\\&quot; and may go lower...    Original review: What a great concept and it&#x27;s very difficult to find alternatives especially at this price. On the negative side it seems to work as advertized except that walls and appliances might interfere with the signal so that we&#x27;re not getting 100&#x27; distance, and there is no \\&quot;lost signal\\&quot; alert. On the positive side this works well at about 30 feet and setup is very easy (see other review for alternative mounting). It takes a 23A 12v battery and a 9 volt. I&#x27;m guessing we are reliably getting 30 feet distance because straightline the signal has to go through our kitchen and concrete block exterior walls (L-shaped house). The \\&quot;chime\\&quot; setting is very loud - you can&#x27;t miss it anywhere in our house - and the vibrate (which we use) is also loud so you couldn&#x27;t miss it in the same room. Our son doesn&#x27;t cry anymore, so the baby monitor is now all but worthless, and I may mount it on the door so we&#x27;ll hear the device through the monitor as a workaround - look for an update. I&#x27;m keeping it despite the distance issue because I want to make it work for us and I can&#x27;t find any reasonably priced alternatives, but as-is the product gets just an \\&quot;OK\\&quot; rating.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely furious. It is after 11:00 p.m. and after so looking forward to being able to sleep tonight knowing that if my mother-in-law who suffers from dementia wanders during the night the new Wireless Wander door alarm we purchased would alert us. It didn&#x27;t work last night when she got up, but we thought maybe our battery was old so we purchased a new one today. Not the case. Inconsistent alarms, if it alarms at all. So we tried the Wander Alarm with Motion Detector that we bought at the same time as a backup. Also DOES NOT WORK. So now I get to pull the packaging and receipts out and try to figure out how to go through the hassle of returning both --- which is something I loathe doing! I just can&#x27;t believe that BOTH products that people purchase for the safety of their loved ones failed from the get-go!</li>
            <li> Fantastic for small children who are just learning to sleep in a bigger bed.  I use this for my toddler so if he gets up at night I know he won&#x27;t fall down the stairs in the dark. This way I know when he leaves his room so I can be awake, but the whole house doesn&#x27;t wake up.  Great product.  There are also many ways to install this on your door that work, you don&#x27;t have to put it on just like the picture. I have fancy door trim so this installation will not work on my door, but there are other ways that do.  I uploaded a picture for you to see.  Note: I found out that the signal will interfere with your garage door opener. When it is turned on, the garage door wouldn&#x27;t open. So we just had to turn it off every morning.</li>
            <li> The alarm works as described, and works well.  Unfortunately the battery contacts are very low quality and don&#x27;t keep a good contact with the battery, then when I tried to change the battery the contacts bent and aren&#x27;t working well at all now.</li>
            <li> Very very very short raange. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> We bouhg tone of theses over a year ago and have used it every night as an intrusion alert, It has continued to work excellent, It was a great buy!</li>
            <li> Will not stay on the door.</li>
            <li> Literature specifically said it would work at distances up to 100 feet.  My application was about 40 feet, so I thought I&#x27;d be safe and well within the range, but it won&#x27;t work at distances more than 30 feet, which was not enough nor what they promised.&lt;br /&gt;I got it this morning and I&#x27;ve already arranged to return it.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to start again.  Disappointing and a waste of my time.&lt;br /&gt;Although I will say that if your application is less than 30 feet, it would probably work great, but at distances less than 30 feet, you&#x27;re basically right next to the door anyway.</li>
            <li> My elderly folks (age 89 and 91) live in a semi-assisted living facility in another state. Dad is taking care of Stepmom, who has advanced Alzheimer&#x27;s and will sometimes get out at night and wander the building. Dad will sleep through it all. The management of the facility is, naturally, very concerned as are my siblings and I. Due to fire department restrictions, they cannot allow the apartment to be locked from the inside. This little device was the perfect solution! Dad simply needs to set the alarm at night before they go to bed, and put the remote on his bedside table.</li>
            <li> This only works line-of-site for about fifteen feet, and if there is a wall or door in the way, not at all. Replaced all the batteries, but no go. In other words, it warns you if the door opens only if you can already see the door. It may be that it just doesn&#x27;t work in an apartment with thick walls, or in the noisy RF spectrum of New York. Or maybe it is yet another lemon. In any case, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Worked for one day then stopped working all together. Put new batteries in both pieces, worked for another day then stopped working again. For the two days total it functioned properly it was exactly what we needed to monitor our escape artist 3 year old twins but now it&#x27;s clear this is just a very poorly made item. Disappointed in the quality because it was exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li> I cannot get the thing to work. we are going to try it once more and then I will have to send it back, which is a hassle.</li>
            <li> Works great! My mother in law suffers with dementia and she took a walk at my in-laws house, fortunately she was returned home by the police, and all ended well, but to prevent future &amp;#34;escapes&amp;#34; we bought this for them to install on the door. It was easy to install, and works great. They love it, don&#x27;t have to worry as much about her getting out.</li>
            <li> The unit did not work at all!!! Tried new batteries,to no avail. Lost paperwork, so could not return or complain, and have had bronchitis for two weeks, so have not checked my E- mail until today. Can you help with a return address?  Howard Folmer</li>
