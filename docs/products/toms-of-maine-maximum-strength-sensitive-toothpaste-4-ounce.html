            <li>It really does a wonderful job of desensitizing my teeth as well.</li>
            <li>Better than non-sensitive toothpaste, not as good as Tooth Builder.</li>

            <li>This is the best toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>This is the best toothpaste for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s right, as I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over 6 months and have experienced a reversal of sensitivity progress.</li>
            <li>IS a fluoride-free alternative from Toms, but you have to look very, very closely at the picture!!!</li>
            <li>Returned it and bought Tom&#x27;s Sensitive Flouride Free toothpaste- which is awesome!</li>
            <li>This seems to be a more \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; approach.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>The taste is minty &amp; light, the scent is nice &amp; I find my teeth feel cleaner</li>
            <li>I love Tom&#x27;s of Maine products.</li>

            <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine has always been my favorite, whether it be toothpaste, mouthwash, deodorant, etc...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Shame on me for not doing more research:  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>Better than sensodyn toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Adding more words to meet guidelines.</li>
            <li>So, my family of 2 will be able to go through all of these tubes before they expire.  </li>
            <li>The product I received was expired for more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I love that Tom&#x27;s of Maine doesn&#x27;t use any harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I gave this a try, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>However, it does seem to work, is not laden with chemicals and has a pleasant flavor which leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh, not overwhelmed!  </li>
            <li>Most importantly for me, I like what Tom&#x27;s of Maine stands for.  </li>
            <li>I do like the taste, nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>Has a good taste and really minimizes the sensitivity.</li>
            <li>It has a light pleasant flavor and cleans my teeth beautifully without leaving a heavy aftertaste.</li>
            <li>Works very nice to help my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I use this toothpaste and it works just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Another fine Tom&#x27;s of Maine product.  </li>
            <li>No I am not retarded.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste is available in sizes from 1 ounce to 6 ounces.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought one 6-pack of these for $26.22 (free shipping with Prime), which works out to be $4.37 per tube.  </li>
            <li>and I liked it so much that I ordered 6 tubes from AMazon.</li>
            <li>I like the taste better, too, for what that&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>I love eating fresh oranges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>A good choice for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I certainly hope that Tom&#x27;s of Maine will continue to bring us great natural products while keeping their commitment to the environment.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve never discovered a good sensitive toothpaste.</li>
            <li>On Amazon, you can find Peppermint, Spearmint, Fennel, Orange-Mango, Cinnamint, Wintermint, Apricot, Soothing Mint, True Mint, and Gingermint, among others.</li>
            <li>Healthy product which cleaned my teeth very well without any sensitivity to my teeth or gums.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I subscribed to it.</li>
            <li>Effective in curbing my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Kinda surprising, but Amazon seems to have a new algorithm or two that plays havoc with the whole &amp;#34;best price all the time) strategy, at my expense.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s milder and it doesn&#x27;t linger, I just feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought I had an oral infection by the dentist said my gums were pretty healthy.  </li>
            <li>This is a great natural sensitive toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I searched for a fluoride free toothpaste for sensitive teeth and this popped up at the top.</li>
            <li>I remember many many years back, I gave toms of maine toothpaste a try when it used to be in their metal tube format.  </li>
            <li>Its super minty, and it helps with my sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a different popular brand of sensitive toothpaste, but it seemed to have kind of stringy parts in it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>The product works just as well as the more chemically made sensitive toothpastes, but this one is Made in USA.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh</li>
            <li>I have used all the different brands for sensitive teeth on the market and this is by far THE best.</li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth feeling minty fresh without any chemical/sweetener aftertaste or burning of my tongue.  </li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine sensitive toothpaste is one of many that I have tried.</li>
            <li>this is not the right toothpaste for you and any dentist</li>
            <li>Pretty good, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to desensitize quite as well as the other \\&quot;unnatural\\&quot; brands in the store.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, Colgate has left Tom&#x27;s alone to manage their business according to their original principles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom</li>
            <li>Seriously the best sensitive toothpaste out there.</li>
            <li>For years, I used Crest products for sensitivity and, most recently, used Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection.  </li>
            <li>Mine informed me today that many of his patients who switch to Toms end up with the same sensitivity problems they had before.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste change was his first question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the difficult-to-find combination of sensitive AND gluten free.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Price thru Amazon is much better then in local stores.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is a bit expensive in the grocery store, so I&#x27;m very happy to have found it here on Amazon in the subscribe and save program.  </li>
            <li>I prefer to use cruelty free products and was looking for toothpaste for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>This is so much nicer!</li>
            <li>just so I able to brush my teeth properly.</li>
            <li>I like Tom&#x27;s and was excited when I found they had a product for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I had been using the Tom&#x27;s of Maine whole care line for a while, but my dentist said I should switch to the sensitive product if I&#x27;m going to use a more natural toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Also by the way our mouths are not glass beakers but will readily absorb any chemical substances.</li>
            <li>Must re-think the whole approach to shopping at Amazon for everything....</li>
            <li>One thing I really appreciate about ordering this 6 pack is that the expiration date is 1 year and 9 months away.  </li>
            <li>Really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>(Tom&#x27;s products are now available in all my local grocery stores, drug stores, and supermarkets).</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re an ethical company and their products contain ingredients I trust.  </li>
            <li>...my teeth actually feel more sensitive after using this.  ???</li>
            <li>After reading so many raving reviews of this &amp;#34;chemical free&amp;#34; toothpaste, I went ahead and bought the 6-pack.&lt;br /&gt;After happily opening the package like a kid on Christmas (because I thought I had found and end to my sensitivity), I was sorely disappointed to find that is has just as much fluoride as Crest!!!&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li>Only suggestion is a more longer lasting taste/breath freshening aspect.</li>
            <li>It says smooth mint but is not very minty.  </li>
            <li>normally don&#x27;t have any sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for anyone who doesn&#x27;t like normal toothpaste but doesn&#x27;t want to use a kid&#x27;s toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I had been skeptical because I am super picky about my toothpastes but this stuff works nicely.</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine is right, try it for ten days and you will be hooked.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it can be found on Amazon and other web sites.</li>
            <li>Also with older age, I now have sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice subtle taste to it</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive teeth, so I gave this a try.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Peppermint flavor, which is refreshing, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine Sensitive toothpaste, and what a difference!  </li>
            <li>But on the other hand I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the quality and values of the original company are now going to suffer.</li>
            <li>HARD TO FIND THIS IN STORES, SO GLAD I CAN GET IT ONLINE.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I have had sensitive teeth all my life.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s makes natural products.</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine is a Natural toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Have been using Sensodyne but switched to Tom&#x27;s Natural.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth, so this product has helped since I can&#x27;t notice my teeth being that sensitive anymore.  </li>
            <li>Really like the toothpaste, leaves a zing in your mouth and stopped my tooth sensitivity totally.</li>
            <li>AND you have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Not everyone carries the sensitive in the store.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I might try a different kind, but I believe brushing with just plain water would achieve the same results as this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I bought this product in bulk (nearly a year&#x27;s worth of toothpaste on subscribe and save) because of Tom&#x27;s green reputation.  </li>
            <li>However, after decades of trying everything, my teeth simply are very sensitive and cavity prone unless I use fluoride and potassium nitrate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not just a giant fan, but completely rely on your -- not as &amp;#34;nice to have&amp;#34;, but as &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for health reasons.</li>
            <li>This my second time ordering the 6 pack of Tom&#x27;s Maximum Strength Sensitive Toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This is the only brand I have found thus far that works.</li>
            <li>This makes sense because drug interactions are always worse the more you add.</li>
            <li>One of the better - if not best - sensitive tooth pastes out there.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve long been a fan of Tom&#x27;s toothpastes but the sensitive varieties are sometimes out-of-stock on store shelves.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re $3.99 at my local Whole Paycheck - I mean Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li>Which is why I was very surprised to read that \\&quot;Toms of Maine\\&quot; is now partially owned by Colgate-Palmolive.</li>
            <li>this one is for sensitive teeth, I&#x27;ve been having sensitive teeth lately and my dentist recommended that I started using toothpaste for sensitive teeth such as Colgate</li>
    </ol>

            <li> On Amazon, you can find Peppermint, Spearmint, Fennel, Orange-Mango, Cinnamint, Wintermint, Apricot, Soothing Mint, True Mint, and Gingermint, among others.</li>
            <li> Healthy product which cleaned my teeth very well without any sensitivity to my teeth or gums.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I subscribed to it.</li>
            <li> Effective in curbing my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Kinda surprising, but Amazon seems to have a new algorithm or two that plays havoc with the whole &amp;#34;best price all the time) strategy, at my expense.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s milder and it doesn&#x27;t linger, I just feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought I had an oral infection by the dentist said my gums were pretty healthy.  </li>
            <li> This is a great natural sensitive toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I searched for a fluoride free toothpaste for sensitive teeth and this popped up at the top.</li>
            <li> I remember many many years back, I gave toms of maine toothpaste a try when it used to be in their metal tube format.  </li>
            <li> Its super minty, and it helps with my sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a different popular brand of sensitive toothpaste, but it seemed to have kind of stringy parts in it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> The product works just as well as the more chemically made sensitive toothpastes, but this one is Made in USA.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels fresh</li>
            <li> I have used all the different brands for sensitive teeth on the market and this is by far THE best.</li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling minty fresh without any chemical/sweetener aftertaste or burning of my tongue.  </li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine sensitive toothpaste is one of many that I have tried.</li>
            <li> this is not the right toothpaste for you and any dentist</li>
            <li> Pretty good, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to desensitize quite as well as the other \\&quot;unnatural\\&quot; brands in the store.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, Colgate has left Tom&#x27;s alone to manage their business according to their original principles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom</li>
            <li> Seriously the best sensitive toothpaste out there.</li>
            <li> For years, I used Crest products for sensitivity and, most recently, used Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection.  </li>
            <li> Mine informed me today that many of his patients who switch to Toms end up with the same sensitivity problems they had before.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste change was his first question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is the difficult-to-find combination of sensitive AND gluten free.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Price thru Amazon is much better then in local stores.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a bit expensive in the grocery store, so I&#x27;m very happy to have found it here on Amazon in the subscribe and save program.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to use cruelty free products and was looking for toothpaste for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is so much nicer!</li>
            <li> just so I able to brush my teeth properly.</li>
            <li> I like Tom&#x27;s and was excited when I found they had a product for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Tom&#x27;s of Maine whole care line for a while, but my dentist said I should switch to the sensitive product if I&#x27;m going to use a more natural toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Also by the way our mouths are not glass beakers but will readily absorb any chemical substances.</li>
            <li> Must re-think the whole approach to shopping at Amazon for everything....</li>
            <li> One thing I really appreciate about ordering this 6 pack is that the expiration date is 1 year and 9 months away.  </li>
            <li> Really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> (Tom&#x27;s products are now available in all my local grocery stores, drug stores, and supermarkets).</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re an ethical company and their products contain ingredients I trust.  </li>
            <li> ...my teeth actually feel more sensitive after using this.  ???</li>
            <li> After reading so many raving reviews of this &amp;#34;chemical free&amp;#34; toothpaste, I went ahead and bought the 6-pack.&lt;br /&gt;After happily opening the package like a kid on Christmas (because I thought I had found and end to my sensitivity), I was sorely disappointed to find that is has just as much fluoride as Crest!!!&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li> Only suggestion is a more longer lasting taste/breath freshening aspect.</li>
            <li> It says smooth mint but is not very minty.  </li>
            <li> normally don&#x27;t have any sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone who doesn&#x27;t like normal toothpaste but doesn&#x27;t want to use a kid&#x27;s toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I had been skeptical because I am super picky about my toothpastes but this stuff works nicely.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine is right, try it for ten days and you will be hooked.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it can be found on Amazon and other web sites.</li>
            <li> Also with older age, I now have sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice subtle taste to it</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive teeth, so I gave this a try.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Peppermint flavor, which is refreshing, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine Sensitive toothpaste, and what a difference!  </li>
            <li> But on the other hand I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the quality and values of the original company are now going to suffer.</li>
            <li> HARD TO FIND THIS IN STORES, SO GLAD I CAN GET IT ONLINE.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I have had sensitive teeth all my life.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s makes natural products.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine is a Natural toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Have been using Sensodyne but switched to Tom&#x27;s Natural.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, so this product has helped since I can&#x27;t notice my teeth being that sensitive anymore.  </li>
            <li> Really like the toothpaste, leaves a zing in your mouth and stopped my tooth sensitivity totally.</li>
            <li> AND you have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Not everyone carries the sensitive in the store.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I might try a different kind, but I believe brushing with just plain water would achieve the same results as this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in bulk (nearly a year&#x27;s worth of toothpaste on subscribe and save) because of Tom&#x27;s green reputation.  </li>
            <li> However, after decades of trying everything, my teeth simply are very sensitive and cavity prone unless I use fluoride and potassium nitrate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not just a giant fan, but completely rely on your -- not as &amp;#34;nice to have&amp;#34;, but as &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for health reasons.</li>
            <li> This my second time ordering the 6 pack of Tom&#x27;s Maximum Strength Sensitive Toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand I have found thus far that works.</li>
            <li> This makes sense because drug interactions are always worse the more you add.</li>
            <li> One of the better - if not best - sensitive tooth pastes out there.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long been a fan of Tom&#x27;s toothpastes but the sensitive varieties are sometimes out-of-stock on store shelves.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re $3.99 at my local Whole Paycheck - I mean Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li> Which is why I was very surprised to read that \\&quot;Toms of Maine\\&quot; is now partially owned by Colgate-Palmolive.</li>
            <li> this one is for sensitive teeth, I&#x27;ve been having sensitive teeth lately and my dentist recommended that I started using toothpaste for sensitive teeth such as Colgate</li>
            <li> Both the Sensodyne and Tom&#x27;s sensitive have the same 5% potassium nitrate as the active ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste because other so-called sensitive pastes still hurt my teeth.</li>
            <li> I noticed I would get these strange white strings from the inside of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> your teeth are very sensitive or (like mine) cavity-prone regardless of how often you brush or how little refined sugars you consume.</li>
            <li> and other major brands are now claiming to protect against acids--</li>
            <li> do not exactly live in a wilderness area, but my local stores no longer carry Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> If you like a more natural and less artificially sweetened toothpaste</li>
            <li> I switched to this after the inside of my mouth started sloughing off due to the use of a different toothpaste (yeah, gross, huh!)</li>
            <li> - the minty flavor isn&#x27;t as strong as other toothpastes (it doesn&#x27;t burn off my taste buds, leaving me numb to salt or sensitive to citrus).</li>
            <li> Read carefully, they gives no specific information to claim this</li>
            <li> , I would have only ordered what I expected to receive instead of what I got.</li>
            <li> It was strange.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was due to the flavor composition of the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Regular toothpaste made brushing unpleasant, since the mint was so strong that it burned my mouth.</li>
            <li> After several visits to the dentist complaining of general tooth pain, and finding nothing wrong, the dentist suggested I try a sensitive toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not completely nauseating like some other minty toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> The minty taste lasts only a few minutes after I rinse, and soon after it my mouth feels like it lacks any freshness of brushing my teeth all day.</li>
            <li> I did some research and found that this is a common effect of commercial brand toothpaste due to the surfactants such as sodium laurel sulfate (SLS).  </li>
            <li> this is anything other than the fluoride.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried a Tom&#x27;s band of toothpaste, and I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> I am so extremely upset with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Using other toothpastes irritate my tongue and gums just from their sulphates and stuff they put in their paste.</li>
            <li> It works as well as other brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently, the wife added to the cart a multi-pack of Tom&#x27;s sensitivity because we like a lot of their other products.  </li>
            <li> and I like Tom&#x27;s other toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> I find myself combining it with other toothpaste on my toothbrush</li>
            <li> I was seeking something other than the typical Crest or Colgate, because the inside of my mouth literally peels every time I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste base has way better ingredients.</li>
            <li> On the one hand, I understand the need to be able to bring the products to a wider consumer base</li>
            <li> and I have noticed sensitivity going down.</li>
            <li> It works just as well and has less ingredients which we like.</li>
            <li> Also, paste seems just a little on the thin side-a little too soft and runny.  </li>
            <li> Ice cream, hot soup, the dentist using the cold water spray don&#x27;t affect me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I still feel pain with hot or cold food or drink</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s &amp; Sensodyne both use fluoride for cavities and potassium nitrate for sensitivity--but the difference is that Tom&#x27;s does not burden your immune system with numerous other unnecessary unnatural chemical substances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t touch the pain from having very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> He told me this after I had mentioned I was experiencing a reoccurrence of extreme sensitivity the past few months.</li>
            <li> Not everyone gets queesy but everyone probably can feel the difference if you use Sensodyne for few month&#x27;s and then switch to Tom&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not suggest using potassium nitrate unless (like mine)</li>
            <li> but I opted for Tom&#x27;s of Maine and over several months the sensitivity has decreased dramatically.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste and company are so much better than Crest or Colgate, which are absolutely horrible loaded with chemicals and toxins and couldn&#x27;t care less about the environment.</li>
            <li> badly handled by customer service which was very unapologetic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For years I have been purchasing Crest Sensitivity for about $3.20 for a small tube.</li>
            <li> It seems like any ordinary toothpaste except it leaves my mouth craving refreshment.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s is a small company, employing fewer than two hundred people.</li>
            <li> TO AVOID QUESTIONABLE INGREDIENTS ESPECIALLY AROUND MUCOUS MEMBRANES.</li>
            <li> So not sure what caused the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth are still sensitive to cold, but not as bad as before I started using this product and overall I haven&#x27;t had anymore gum/nerve pain.</li>
            <li> Do not use fluoride; it effects the petutary gland negatively.</li>
            <li> Well, I noticed the price of Crest&#x27;s brand inexplicably jumped to over $4.00 for the same sized tube &amp;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really liked any toothpaste because I don&#x27;t care for the taste of mint.  </li>
            <li> (If your skin sloughs off inside your mouth, you know what I mean.)  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste has just the right amount of mint to freshen breathe, without all of the nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used toothpaste for as long as I can remember and have never had a bad experience</li>
            <li> Eventually however I discovered no side effects with using products like Tom&#x27;s with a minimum  of unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li> It just works, and doesn&#x27;t have the sickly sweetness of other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> &amp; although was wary (the price for a 6-pack just made me think something was wrong)</li>
            <li> Made me feel uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> But this stuff is so thin!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I bought six tubes of this, it&#x27;s completely useless.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste contains no sugar, sweeteners, or artificial flavoring.</li>
            <li> This is a bit disappointing and troubling.</li>
            <li> Artificial sugars give me migraines.</li>
            <li> Now that I have been using it, I can&#x27;t stand the others with the artificial sweetener in them.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I do, however, wish that we could buy this without fluoride.  That&#x27;s a chemical we&#x27;re trying to avoid in our family.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on accident. Do not use fluoride; it effects the petutary gland negatively. Returned it and bought Tom&#x27;s Sensitive Flouride Free toothpaste- which is awesome! Works like it should!!</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s &amp; Sensodyne both use fluoride for cavities and potassium nitrate for sensitivity--but the difference is that Tom&#x27;s does not burden your immune system with numerous other unnecessary unnatural chemical substances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Sensodyne Pronamel&amp;#34; and other major brands are now claiming to protect against acids--but this is madison avenue double-speak. Read carefully, they gives no specific information to claim this this is anything other than the fluoride. I have tried Sensodyne several times and always get queesy after awhile. Yes I spit it out. No I am not retarded. Not everyone gets queesy but everyone probably can feel the difference if you use Sensodyne for few month&#x27;s and then switch to Tom&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not suggest using potassium nitrate unless (like mine) your teeth are very sensitive or (like mine) cavity-prone regardless of how often you brush or how little refined sugars you consume. I believe that Theraneem herbal toothpaste is the best for all around health of the gums as well as excellent and non-abrasive cleansing. However, after decades of trying everything, my teeth simply are very sensitive and cavity prone unless I use fluoride and potassium nitrate. In spite of the advice of dentists, I avoided the chemical products for decades because they always ended up making me queesy. Eventually however I discovered no side effects with using products like Tom&#x27;s with a minimum  of unnecessary chemicals. This makes sense because drug interactions are always worse the more you add. Also by the way our mouths are not glass beakers but will readily absorb any chemical substances.</li>
            <li> For years, I used Crest products for sensitivity and, most recently, used Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection.  I noticed I would get these strange white strings from the inside of my mouth.  At first, I thought I had an oral infection by the dentist said my gums were pretty healthy.  I did some research and found that this is a common effect of commercial brand toothpaste due to the surfactants such as sodium laurel sulfate (SLS).  It was embarrassing, especially when I was at work and kept pulling these strings out.  I recently switched to Tom&#x27;s and the strings are no longer there.  I can brush my teeth without the inside of my mouth sloughing off and take care of the sensitivity at the same time.  The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was due to the flavor composition of the toothpaste.  It says smooth mint but is not very minty.  My breath doesn&#x27;t taste minty after an hour.  I wish the flavor was stronger.  Other than that, I like it.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to desensitize quite as well as the other \\&quot;unnatural\\&quot; brands in the store.  This seems to be a more \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; approach.  Also, paste seems just a little on the thin side-a little too soft and runny.  However, it does seem to work, is not laden with chemicals and has a pleasant flavor which leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh, not overwhelmed!  We wish the price were lower and will look for a sale price, but we will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used toothpaste for as long as I can remember and have never had a bad experience so I didn&#x27;t expect to have one with this product either.  You go toothpaste...keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> Product arrives as promised. The product works just as well as the more chemically made sensitive toothpastes, but this one is Made in USA. Thank you!</li>
            <li> For years I have been purchasing Crest Sensitivity for about $3.20 for a small tube. This is because I cannot brush my teeth with \\&quot;regular\\&quot; toothpastes as I believe I am allergic to something in them. Sensitivity is the only way I can go. Well, I noticed the price of Crest&#x27;s brand inexplicably jumped to over $4.00 for the same sized tube &amp; I figured that was enough. I read the reviews on Tom&#x27;s &amp; although was wary (the price for a 6-pack just made me think something was wrong), I made the order. I am glad I did. The taste is minty &amp; light, the scent is nice &amp; I find my teeth feel cleaner then Crest ever made them feel.    Thank you, Tom&#x27;s for a great product!</li>
            <li> I love Tom&#x27;s of Maine products. I cannot find this toothpaste locally, so I must order online. I have had great dental checkups since using this toothpaste. Before I always had irritated gums.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go back to anything else! I had been skeptical because I am super picky about my toothpastes but this stuff works nicely. My mouth feels fresh and I have noticed sensitivity going down. I used Arm&amp;Hammer before, but never again. :)</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth this is not the right toothpaste for you and any dentist will tell you that. Mine informed me today that many of his patients who switch to Toms end up with the same sensitivity problems they had before. He told me this after I had mentioned I was experiencing a reoccurrence of extreme sensitivity the past few months. The toothpaste change was his first question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He told me to do myself a favor and switch back to something with fluoride and non holistic. I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s right, as I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over 6 months and have experienced a reversal of sensitivity progress.</li>
            <li> I switched to this after the inside of my mouth started sloughing off due to the use of a different toothpaste (yeah, gross, huh!) I have VERY sensitive teeth, so I gave this a try. My mouth has healed and this seems to take care of the sensitivity. I won&#x27;t use anything else at this point.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference in sensitivity....</li>
            <li> Good natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have used all the different brands for sensitive teeth on the market and this is by far THE best. I have had sensitive teeth all my life. Even the dentist noticed a difference at my last cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great toothpasteâ€¦great taste, too.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried a Tom&#x27;s band of toothpaste, and I am not impressed. I was seeking something other than the typical Crest or Colgate, because the inside of my mouth literally peels every time I brush my teeth. Hearing and reading rave reviews about Tom&#x27;s I gave it ago. It seems like any ordinary toothpaste except it leaves my mouth craving refreshment. The minty taste lasts only a few minutes after I rinse, and soon after it my mouth feels like it lacks any freshness of brushing my teeth all day. I did not notice any help with the sensitivity part, but I did not buy the toothpaste for that. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve never discovered a good sensitive toothpaste. Will I buy Tom&#x27;s again? I might try a different kind, but I believe brushing with just plain water would achieve the same results as this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s is a small company, employing fewer than two hundred people. It was founded in 1970 and then purchased by Colgate in 2006. Fortunately, Colgate has left Tom&#x27;s alone to manage their business according to their original principles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s makes natural products. The toothpaste contains no sugar, sweeteners, or artificial flavoring. By contrast, I looked at a tube of Colgate toothpaste that I have on the shelf. It contains \\&quot;flavor,\\&quot; whatever that is, \\&quot;saccharine,\\&quot; and \\&quot;propylene glycol.\\&quot; The last ingredient is a less-toxic form of anti-freeze. One advantage of Tom&#x27;s toothpaste is that we do not have to worry about ingesting poisons when we use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Tom&#x27;s for years. The toothpaste comes in many flavors. On Amazon, you can find Peppermint, Spearmint, Fennel, Orange-Mango, Cinnamint, Wintermint, Apricot, Soothing Mint, True Mint, and Gingermint, among others. I prefer the Peppermint flavor, which is refreshing, but not overwhelming. The toothpaste is available in sizes from 1 ounce to 6 ounces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not exactly live in a wilderness area, but my local stores no longer carry Tom&#x27;s. Fortunately, it can be found on Amazon and other web sites. The prices do vary from vendor to vendor, so check for the best price.</li>
            <li> Healthy product which cleaned my teeth very well without any sensitivity to my teeth or gums. The mint flavor is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural sensitive toothpaste.  I have been using it for a couple of years now.  It works just as well as the brand names.  It has a nice flavor too.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine has always been my favorite, whether it be toothpaste, mouthwash, deodorant, etc... this one is for sensitive teeth, I&#x27;ve been having sensitive teeth lately and my dentist recommended that I started using toothpaste for sensitive teeth such as Colgate but I opted for Tom&#x27;s of Maine and over several months the sensitivity has decreased dramatically. I&#x27;m happy with this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I am so extremely upset with this purchase. I searched for a fluoride free toothpaste for sensitive teeth and this popped up at the top. After reading so many raving reviews of this &amp;#34;chemical free&amp;#34; toothpaste, I went ahead and bought the 6-pack.&lt;br /&gt;After happily opening the package like a kid on Christmas (because I thought I had found and end to my sensitivity), I was sorely disappointed to find that is has just as much fluoride as Crest!!!&lt;br /&gt;There IS a fluoride-free alternative from Toms, but you have to look very, very closely at the picture!!!</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine is a Natural toothpaste for sensitive teeth. Previously, these would come in a metal containers but after being bought out by Colgate they are in plastic container - which is fine as well but do not use this past the expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4Oz toothpaste seems to last for several weeks. would like them to bring back the 6Oz ones!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Taste great, works well and doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals others do.  A good choice for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Bought one 6-pack of these for $26.22 (free shipping with Prime), which works out to be $4.37 per tube.  They&#x27;re $3.99 at my local Whole Paycheck - I mean Whole Foods.  Kinda surprising, but Amazon seems to have a new algorithm or two that plays havoc with the whole &amp;#34;best price all the time) strategy, at my expense.  Must re-think the whole approach to shopping at Amazon for everything....</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has just the right amount of mint to freshen breathe, without all of the nasty chemicals. I love it so much I subscribed to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in bulk (nearly a year&#x27;s worth of toothpaste on subscribe and save) because of Tom&#x27;s green reputation.  Shame on me for not doing more research:  Tom&#x27;s is owned by a company that tests in animals.</li>
            <li> Sensitivity wise - it doesn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product. It is the difficult-to-find combination of sensitive AND gluten free. Please, Tom&#x27;s of Maine, keep it up.  I&#x27;m not just a giant fan, but completely rely on your -- not as &amp;#34;nice to have&amp;#34;, but as &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for health reasons. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Seriously the best sensitive toothpaste out there. Better than sensodyn toothpaste. The toothpaste base has way better ingredients. Using other toothpastes irritate my tongue and gums just from their sulphates and stuff they put in their paste. This one I have been using for years and love it!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  Leaves my mouth feeling minty fresh without any chemical/sweetener aftertaste or burning of my tongue.  Adding more words to meet guidelines.</li>
            <li> Been using this toothpaste for years.</li>
            <li> Have been using Sensodyne but switched to Tom&#x27;s Natural. It does the job, decreasing sensitivity so well, I forget it is an issue. Only suggestion is a more longer lasting taste/breath freshening aspect. Price thru Amazon is much better then in local stores.</li>
            <li> HARD TO FIND THIS IN STORES, SO GLAD I CAN GET IT ONLINE. PRICE A BIT STEEP THOUGH.GOOD TO AVOID QUESTIONABLE INGREDIENTS ESPECIALLY AROUND MUCOUS MEMBRANES.</li>
            <li> Effective in curbing my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Tom&#x27;s of Maine whole care line for a while, but my dentist said I should switch to the sensitive product if I&#x27;m going to use a more natural toothpaste.  I think he and the hygienist were worried it was too abrasive for my teeth.  I have sensitive teeth, so this product has helped since I can&#x27;t notice my teeth being that sensitive anymore.  One thing I really appreciate about ordering this 6 pack is that the expiration date is 1 year and 9 months away.  So, my family of 2 will be able to go through all of these tubes before they expire.  Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> This my second time ordering the 6 pack of Tom&#x27;s Maximum Strength Sensitive Toothpaste. I am very happy with this product. I like the way it tastes - the minty flavor isn&#x27;t as strong as other toothpastes (it doesn&#x27;t burn off my taste buds, leaving me numb to salt or sensitive to citrus). The toothpaste helps with the gum/nerve sensitivity I have. My teeth are still sensitive to cold, but not as bad as before I started using this product and overall I haven&#x27;t had anymore gum/nerve pain. The tubes are recyclable, which is awesome, and Tom&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t test on animals or use animal derived materials.</li>
            <li> The product I received was expired for more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;Very badly handled by customer service which was very unapologetic.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this provider.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste because other so-called sensitive pastes still hurt my teeth. This is the only brand I have found thus far that works.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine sensitive toothpaste is one of many that I have tried. I do like the taste, nice and fresh. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t touch the pain from having very sensitive teeth. I need to brush my teeth 5x/day for it to keep working. I can&#x27;t recommend that it would work but give it a try if you want.</li>
            <li> I have been using a different popular brand of sensitive toothpaste, but it seemed to have kind of stringy parts in it.  Made me feel uncomfortable.  My husband bought a tube of Tom&#x27;s toothpaste for me and I liked it so much that I ordered 6 tubes from AMazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I found this toothpaste!  After several visits to the dentist complaining of general tooth pain, and finding nothing wrong, the dentist suggested I try a sensitive toothpaste.  I tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine Sensitive toothpaste, and what a difference!  The pain disappeared within a couple of days, and has not returned.  That was almost 2 years ago.  I love that Tom&#x27;s of Maine doesn&#x27;t use any harmful chemicals.  I&#x27;ve never really liked any toothpaste because I don&#x27;t care for the taste of mint.  I actually like this toothpaste though.  The mint flavor is not overpowering.  This toothpaste is a bit expensive in the grocery store, so I&#x27;m very happy to have found it here on Amazon in the subscribe and save program.  I&#x27;d buy it regardless, but it&#x27;s always nice to save money.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine is right, try it for ten days and you will be hooked. I have used Tom&#x27;s maybe ten years now, and the price just goes up and up. I decided to buy in bulk from Amazon, to save money now and save later, using it as the price in stores goes up. Really like the toothpaste, leaves a zing in your mouth and stopped my tooth sensitivity totally.</li>
            <li> We like Tom&#x27;s and use this instead of Sensodyne. It works just as well and has less ingredients which we like. We couldn&#x27;t find this at our local supermarkets, so ordered it online in this six pack.</li>
            <li> I remember many many years back, I gave toms of maine toothpaste a try when it used to be in their metal tube format.  I didn&#x27;t like it because I didn&#x27;t think it was minty enough compared to the colgates and crests of the world.  But now, I don&#x27;t want to support any animal testing, so was looking around to switch.  Also with older age, I now have sensitive teeth.  I gave this a try, and I love it.  Its super minty, and it helps with my sensitivity.  Plus no animal testing.  Win win -- love this product!</li>
            <li> Really like this toothpaste. Dentist asked me what I&#x27;ve been using since my teeth looked so white. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use cruelty free products and was looking for toothpaste for sensitive teeth.  Tried this and it works great.  Has a good taste and really minimizes the sensitivity.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste and company are so much better than Crest or Colgate, which are absolutely horrible loaded with chemicals and toxins and couldn&#x27;t care less about the environment. Which is why I was very surprised to read that \\&quot;Toms of Maine\\&quot; is now partially owned by Colgate-Palmolive. This is a bit disappointing and troubling. On the one hand, I understand the need to be able to bring the products to a wider consumer base (Tom&#x27;s products are now available in all my local grocery stores, drug stores, and supermarkets). But on the other hand I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the quality and values of the original company are now going to suffer. I certainly hope that Tom&#x27;s of Maine will continue to bring us great natural products while keeping their commitment to the environment.</li>
            <li> Artificial sugars give me migraines. This has none. The taste is pleasant. It works as well as other brands.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  One of the better - if not best - sensitive tooth pastes out there.  Also, delivery is prompt and well packaged.</li>
            <li> It just works, and doesn&#x27;t have the sickly sweetness of other toothpastes. I&#x27;ve long been a fan of Tom&#x27;s toothpastes but the sensitive varieties are sometimes out-of-stock on store shelves. Buying it from Amazon.com was the way to go...</li>
            <li> I use this toothpaste and it works just fine for me.  I used to use Sensodyne, and Tom&#x27;s is as effective, in my experience.  I like the taste better, too, for what that&#x27;s worth.  Most importantly for me, I like what Tom&#x27;s of Maine stands for.  They&#x27;re an ethical company and their products contain ingredients I trust.  This is the kind of business I want to support.  With Tom&#x27;s great products, it&#x27;s easy for me to do so.</li>
            <li> I did not know Tom&#x27;s made toothpaste with fluoride. I have gotten this type of toothpaste, Tom&#x27;s, before and there was no fluoride in it. Had I know they make with and without, I would have only ordered what I expected to receive instead of what I got.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with the Tom&#x27;s products for years and now I&#x27;m thrilled to be on Amazon&#x27;s subscription plan.  Good value and just-in-time shipments.  A must-buy product!</li>
            <li> I like Tom&#x27;s and was excited when I found they had a product for sensitive teeth. It works. If you like a more natural and less artificially sweetened toothpaste AND you have sensitive teeth, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is good.  Now that I have been using it, I can&#x27;t stand the others with the artificial sweetener in them.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t leave a minty taste in your mouth. It does great for my sensitivity, though.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> ...my teeth actually feel more sensitive after using this.  ???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally don&#x27;t have any sensitivity. Ice cream, hot soup, the dentist using the cold water spray don&#x27;t affect me.&lt;br /&gt;I use Sensodyne at night when oranges are in season because the acids can cause sensitivity and I love eating fresh oranges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, the wife added to the cart a multi-pack of Tom&#x27;s sensitivity because we like a lot of their other products.  However, the wife and I both noticed sensitivity after using Tom&#x27;s for two weeks morning and night when we ran out of Tom&#x27;s regular toothpaste. It was strange. I switched to Sensodyne for a week and the sensitivity went away.  Both the Sensodyne and Tom&#x27;s sensitive have the same 5% potassium nitrate as the active ingredient.  So not sure what caused the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the taste of Tom&#x27;s over Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> I became allergic to regular toothpaste. Lips swelled and peeled. Dentist recommended this brand and I have been using ever since.  I like buying in bulk (online). Not everyone carries the sensitive in the store. This is an excellent toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste for sensitive teeth I&#x27;ve ever used! It has a light pleasant flavor and cleans my teeth beautifully without leaving a heavy aftertaste. It really does a wonderful job of desensitizing my teeth as well.</li>
            <li> Better than non-sensitive toothpaste, not as good as Tooth Builder. I still feel pain with hot or cold food or drink and I didn&#x27;t with Tooth Builder.</li>
            <li> Works very nice to help my sensitive teeth.  It has a nice subtle taste to it that&#x27;s not completely nauseating like some other minty toothpastes.  Buying in bulk definitely helps save some $$ too.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t foam well. I have to use a lot of it to get those results. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Regular toothpaste made brushing unpleasant, since the mint was so strong that it burned my mouth. This is so much nicer! It&#x27;s milder and it doesn&#x27;t linger, I just feel clean and fresh. I would recommend it for anyone who doesn&#x27;t like normal toothpaste but doesn&#x27;t want to use a kid&#x27;s toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Another fine Tom&#x27;s of Maine product.  It provides the sensitivity protection I need without the whitening products that I am allergic to.  (If your skin sloughs off inside your mouth, you know what I mean.)  A great product at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I have sensitive teeth and I like Tom&#x27;s other toothpastes.  I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s deodorant for years and have never had a problem, nor have I had a problem with their non-sensitivity toothpastes.  But this stuff is so thin!  It doesn&#x27;t lather in your mouth at all.  I find myself combining it with other toothpaste on my toothbrush just so I able to brush my teeth properly. Terrible.  I can&#x27;t believe that I bought six tubes of this, it&#x27;s completely useless.</li>
