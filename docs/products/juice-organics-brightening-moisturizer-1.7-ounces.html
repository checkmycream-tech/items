            <li>Organic and feels great on my skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy so far--I hope it continues to work!</li>
            <li>Smells great, wonderful creaminess, but I seem to be allergic to it and had to stop using it.</li>
            <li>and I do see my face getting bright!  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S JUST SO GREAT TO FIND IT ON AMAZON AT THIS GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li>BUT they still all work great</li>
            <li>and they are highly effective too!</li>
            <li>Great product, great smell, nice weight</li>
            <li>Orange scent is pleasant and dissipates.</li>

            <li>Organically, I love this product!</li>
            <li>and if you can get a good price on it get more than one</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think good skin products are easy to find, and I haven&#x27;t found anything that works better for me more than this stuff.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Juice Organics products.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>She keeps asking me to buy it over and over again, so she must love the stuff.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>

            <li>Love this product also.</li>
            <li>and I love them!&lt;br</li>
            <li>coast.&lt;br /&gt;I will surely see about that this winter.</li>
            <li>Okay product.  </li>
            <li>Wow, this moisturizer is so good in brightening my skin!</li>
            <li>--it spreads very easily and it has a light smell.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, but I can see how some might find it strong.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the fragrance, but it isn&#x27;t too strong</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works great, you can see and feel the difference of the glowing of the face, I highly recommended, have a exact good odor, and it&#x27;s organic no bad or harm chemicals will leave on the face.</li>
            <li>Probably very nice if you don&#x27;t have extremely sensitive skin like I do.</li>
            <li>I mentioned being a mother of 2 because they have wreaked havoc on my skin as well, and these 4 steps make  my skin feel and look younger, every time I put it on I feel a fresh tingly AWESOME feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li>My face feels kind of stuffy &amp; hot</li>
            <li>I previously used the Juice Beauty products, but was very happy when they came out with the Juice Organics line because it is easier to find.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use and skin feels smooth and brighter, fresher looking.</li>
            <li>I loved the feel on my skin and how it made my skin so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>So now i&#x27;m very happy that i can finally find these natural healthy brightening products from Juice Organic</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves this product, I bought it for him because I felt it fit the bill in the weight catagory that he likes for a moisturizer</li>
            <li>I also feel good that I&#x27;m using something natural on my face.</li>
            <li>OLD AN HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THE SUN.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive fair skin.</li>
            <li>The tube is sealed,I like that, haven&#x27;t started using but excited to try</li>
            <li>I originally bought this in the sample package with the cleanser.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell you exactly what it is that Juice does for me, but I can tell that I look better withit than without.</li>
            <li>Both have a pleasant smell that wears off quickly (the brightening one smells a bit like orange candy), and the texture is very similar in both</li>
            <li>I have since bought the full size.</li>
            <li>Obsorb quickly</li>
            <li>The product is super creamy, so you do not need a lot</li>
            <li>Average product!The smell is not that great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer along with the brightening moisturizer since they were first available in drug stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using for like a week and my skin is already brighter and more even!</li>
            <li>I wish they had an SPF, but I love the fact that the ingredients are much more natural than many of the other moisturizers that are widely available.  </li>
            <li>apple/orange juice on your face, pretty sweet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the shipping cost.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin moisturized with a fresh, matte finish.</li>
            <li>: So maybe it will help you decide if this is the right product for you</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like strongly scented products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 33  with 2 kids and have sensitive skin over the years I would try many things and always broke out with pimples from either to much oil in products</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do anything exceptional for my skin either, which I would classify as normal (not oily nor dry).  </li>
            <li>I noticed my skin was brighter and clearer within the first week.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THAT!</li>
            <li>when exactly when I first found it at Target, but its been a while</li>
            <li>I use it along with aloe gel and they blend pretty well tgt.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Saw a difference in my skin after the first application.</li>
            <li>Contains organic ingredients but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s an organic product...but great ingredient list and made in the USA.</li>
            <li>Like many of the other reviewers, I noticed that this product was working the first week--</li>
            <li>I am very cautious of products that do not have a seal.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much use for this.</li>
            <li>There is no inflammation either, very soothing.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>, i&#x27;m a fair skin Asian, i have normal to slightly dry skin, this product doesn&#x27;t break me out or cause any allergy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not greasy, perfect for the average weather, but for me,&lt;br /&gt;it might not be enough if for the dry wintry weather in the east</li>
            <li>I tried a sample size of this from Target and was surprised to see visible results after the first use.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this product!</li>
            <li>little details about my type of skin and why I love this product</li>
            <li>I ordered this while trying to find my new go-to day moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin is so clear and feels very soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding face cleaners and moisturizers that I like, but I love this brand.</li>
            <li>MY 35 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER INTRODUCED ME TO IT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried both this moisturizer and the pomegranate one of this same line, and I really like them both.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive or acne prone skin</li>
            <li>Purchased this at TJ Maxx in the clearance bin not expecting much...was surprised.</li>
            <li>The tube was half full.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if my dark spots have lightened much, but I still don&#x27;t see myself switching, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, and my dry patches are gone.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t noticed any major differences in my skin, but I think the pomegranate moisturizer does have a bit of a skin-plumping effect which I really like, and both moisturizers keep my skin from feeling dry throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>IT DOESN&#x27;T REQUIRE A LOT TO GET TOTAL COVERAGE AND LEAVES MY SKIN VERY SOFT.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hard to find organic brightening products since most of the brightening products out there are quite harmful to the skin.</li>
            <li>and the serum is now gel or clear instead of white and cream like.</li>
            <li>Irritating at first with the acids but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too heavy, hasn&#x27;t irritated or broken out my sensitive skin, and I feel that it really has improved my skin and given me more of a glow.</li>
            <li>I had been skipping washing my face on tired nights or late mornings, but this stuff is so great</li>
            <li>It smells like orange and has a slightly thick texture but absorb quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>Very thick, this isn&#x27;t a light cream.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very thick, this isn&#x27;t a light cream.</li>
            <li> They have recently changed something, because this goes on a little thicker ( but it helps if u put it on right after a shower with slightly damp skin.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Juice Organics brand for a long time now.  </li>
            <li> My skin is combo but a bit dry at times.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin with dry patches, redness.</li>
            <li> I also have slight rossica along my jaw and sometimes up my cheeks, These 4 steps clears up my red blotchy-ness and evens my skin tone out.</li>
            <li> and I tell everyone I meet, and I would sell it if that would mean this company stays alive and I can use It forever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna try other products of juice organics.</li>
            <li> Not exactly.</li>
            <li> I just turned 48 and have the usual sunspots as well as red acne spots.</li>
            <li> I used it at night before bed and when I awake in the AM, I notice the spots are lighter and my skin is brighter, less reddish.</li>
            <li> (the pompeptide one is slightly thicker and less</li>
            <li> A little goes over.</li>
            <li> I wish these lasted a little longer (I can probably get 3 weeks use out of one tube), but I will keep repurchasing this.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t notice it after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Goes on a bit too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Actually it makes me hungry when I smell it, and then I get mad that I don&#x27;t have any actual orange juice to drink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> This product is to thick for my skin and it also broke my face out.</li>
            <li> Plus, it is less expensive than the Juice Beauty line.  </li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> Friends ask me what my secret is because they say I look so &amp;#34;young&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very skeptical about skin care</li>
            <li> it is NOT a non-comedogenic product and broke me out in the worst way.  </li>

            <li> The tube is sealed,I like that, haven&#x27;t started using but excited to try</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Juice Organics products.  I will continue to buy the brightening moisturizer.  It really works!</li>
            <li> A little goes over. Obsorb quickly and I do see my face getting bright!  I&#x27;m gonna try other products of juice organics.</li>
            <li> Average product!The smell is not that great.My face feels kind of stuffy &amp; hot and I sweat on my face whenever I put this cream on.</li>
            <li> Juice.... it is made from JUICE. So it basically smells like you are rubbing apple/orange juice on your face, pretty sweet eh? Not exactly. Actually it makes me hungry when I smell it, and then I get mad that I don&#x27;t have any actual orange juice to drink. It doesn&#x27;t do anything exceptional for my skin either, which I would classify as normal (not oily nor dry).  Will I use it until its gone, Yes. Wold I buy it again, nope.</li>
            <li> This is a great, light, pleasant smelling and feeling product, will purchase again and again</li>
            <li> Smells great, wonderful creaminess, but I seem to be allergic to it and had to stop using it. Probably very nice if you don&#x27;t have extremely sensitive skin like I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer along with the brightening moisturizer since they were first available in drug stores. I noticed my skin was brighter and clearer within the first week. I stopped using it once it disappeared from drug stores, but recently started buying it online. I don&#x27;t think good skin products are easy to find, and I haven&#x27;t found anything that works better for me more than this stuff. It&#x27;s worth the shipping cost. (If it helps, I have normal/combination skin)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Juice Organics brand for a long time now.  I previously used the Juice Beauty products, but was very happy when they came out with the Juice Organics line because it is easier to find.  Plus, it is less expensive than the Juice Beauty line.  My skin is so clear and feels very soft.  I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding face cleaners and moisturizers that I like, but I love this brand.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample size of this from Target and was surprised to see visible results after the first use. I just turned 48 and have the usual sunspots as well as red acne spots. I used it at night before bed and when I awake in the AM, I notice the spots are lighter and my skin is brighter, less reddish. I also feel good that I&#x27;m using something natural on my face.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS WONDERFUL. I AM 60 YEARS OLD AN HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THE SUN. THIS PRODUCT HELPS ME NOT GET THE AGE SPOTS AND GOT RID OF THE ONES I HAD. IT DOESN&#x27;T REQUIRE A LOT TO GET TOTAL COVERAGE AND LEAVES MY SKIN VERY SOFT. HOWEVER YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE A SENIOR TO BENEFIT. MY 35 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER INTRODUCED ME TO IT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. IT&#x27;S JUST SO GREAT TO FIND IT ON AMAZON AT THIS GREAT PRICE. THANK YOU DAUGHTER AND AMAZON. NOBODY BELEIVES I AM 60, AND I REALLY LIKE THAT!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this in the sample package with the cleanser. I had been skipping washing my face on tired nights or late mornings, but this stuff is so great, now I don&#x27;t skip washes just so I can use it! I have since bought the full size. I love the scent, but I can see how some might find it strong. I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like strongly scented products. It doesn&#x27;t take much, and my dry patches are gone. I&#x27;m not sure if my dark spots have lightened much, but I still don&#x27;t see myself switching, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works great, you can see and feel the difference of the glowing of the face, I highly recommended, have a exact good odor, and it&#x27;s organic no bad or harm chemicals will leave on the face.</li>
            <li> I received this product in the mail on time however, the box did not have a seal on it. I am very cautious of products that do not have a seal. I thought perhaps the tube may have a seal but it did not either. When I squeezed the tube I realized I midway into squeezing when I finally got product. What a rip off I thought. The tube was half full.     I can&#x27;t comment on the product since I did not use it and returned it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive fair skin. It evens and brightens my face, and didn&#x27;t cause my break outs.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could find this product with a bigger size.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this while trying to find my new go-to day moisturizer. I love it. It isn&#x27;t too heavy, hasn&#x27;t irritated or broken out my sensitive skin, and I feel that it really has improved my skin and given me more of a glow. I don&#x27;t love the fragrance, but it isn&#x27;t too strong and I don&#x27;t notice it after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much use for this. My ex wife asked me to purchase it, so I did. She keeps asking me to buy it over and over again, so she must love the stuff.</li>
            <li> Organic and feels great on my skin! I have been using the 4 steps for Juice Organics ( cleanser, under eye, brightening serum, and Moisturizer.) for years now and I love it. They have recently changed something, because this goes on a little thicker ( but it helps if u put it on right after a shower with slightly damp skin.) and the serum is now gel or clear instead of white and cream like. BUT they still all work great and I love them. I don&#x27;t work for them, but I would like to scream from the roof tops how much I love them and I tell everyone I meet, and I would sell it if that would mean this company stays alive and I can use It forever! I use to buy it at my local TARGET here in San Diego but one day it wasn&#x27;t on the shelf! I&#x27;m soooooooo GLAD Amazon sells it! I have it on subscription and I have Amazon Prime.&lt;br /&gt;A little details about my type of skin and why I love this product: So maybe it will help you decide if this is the right product for you too.&lt;br /&gt; My skin is combo but a bit dry at times. I also have slight rossica along my jaw and sometimes up my cheeks, These 4 steps clears up my red blotchy-ness and evens my skin tone out. The more I use it the more even my skin gets, it seems to be improving my skin. I&#x27;m 33  with 2 kids and have sensitive skin over the years I would try many things and always broke out with pimples from either to much oil in products or I would have a reaction and my skin would burn and I&#x27;d get a rash.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this stuff probably since 2005 maybe 2000 I&#x27;m not sure when exactly when I first found it at Target, but its been a while and I love it. I mentioned being a mother of 2 because they have wreaked havoc on my skin as well, and these 4 steps make  my skin feel and look younger, every time I put it on I feel a fresh tingly AWESOME feeling on my skin. I love it!</li>
            <li> Wow, this moisturizer is so good in brightening my skin! I&#x27;ve only been using for like a week and my skin is already brighter and more even! I&#x27;m very skeptical about skin care and i only wanna use natural/organic skin care. It&#x27;s very hard to find organic brightening products since most of the brightening products out there are quite harmful to the skin. So now i&#x27;m very happy that i can finally find these natural healthy brightening products from Juice Organic and they are highly effective too! It smells like orange and has a slightly thick texture but absorb quickly into the skin. I use it along with aloe gel and they blend pretty well tgt.&lt;br /&gt;FYI, i&#x27;m a fair skin Asian, i have normal to slightly dry skin, this product doesn&#x27;t break me out or cause any allergy.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers, I noticed that this product was working the first week--my skin tone is more even. The product is super creamy, so you do not need a lot--it spreads very easily and it has a light smell. It leaves my skin moisturized with a fresh, matte finish. There is no inflammation either, very soothing. I&#x27;m happy so far--I hope it continues to work!</li>
            <li> This product is to thick for my skin and it also broke my face out. I felt like i was wearing a mask. No good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both this moisturizer and the pomegranate one of this same line, and I really like them both.  Both have a pleasant smell that wears off quickly (the brightening one smells a bit like orange candy), and the texture is very similar in both (the pompeptide one is slightly thicker and less liquidy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any major differences in my skin, but I think the pomegranate moisturizer does have a bit of a skin-plumping effect which I really like, and both moisturizers keep my skin from feeling dry throughout the day.  I wish they had an SPF, but I love the fact that the ingredients are much more natural than many of the other moisturizers that are widely available.  I wish these lasted a little longer (I can probably get 3 weeks use out of one tube), but I will keep repurchasing this.</li>
            <li> I loved the feel on my skin and how it made my skin so smooth and soft.  I also loved the scent.  HOWEVER...it is NOT a non-comedogenic product and broke me out in the worst way.  If you don&#x27;t have sensitive or acne prone skin this might be for you.  I had to stop using it after two or three times.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Love this product also. So easy to use and skin feels smooth and brighter, fresher looking. Friends ask me what my secret is because they say I look so &amp;#34;young&amp;#34;. Bought the cleanser also. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Goes on a bit too heavy.  I can&#x27;t wear it under makeup as it makes the foundation look caked on.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this product, I bought it for him because I felt it fit the bill in the weight catagory that he likes for a moisturizer and I can&#x27;t stand the smell of artifical perfumes that come with some of petro-products.  Great product, great smell, nice weight and if you can get a good price on it get more than one</li>
            <li> I am using both cleanser and this moisturizer and I love them!&lt;br /&gt;It is not greasy, perfect for the average weather, but for me,&lt;br /&gt;it might not be enough if for the dry wintry weather in the east coast.&lt;br /&gt;I will surely see about that this winter. Organically, I love this product!</li>
            <li> Purchased this at TJ Maxx in the clearance bin not expecting much...was surprised. Saw a difference in my skin after the first application. Definitely clearer and brighter. I have acne prone skin with dry patches, redness. Cleared my skin up with twice a day application. Irritating at first with the acids but definitely worth it. Very thick, this isn&#x27;t a light cream. Orange scent is pleasant and dissipates. Contains organic ingredients but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s an organic product...but great ingredient list and made in the USA. Will definitely be using this regularly</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this product! Can&#x27;t tell you exactly what it is that Juice does for me, but I can tell that I look better withit than without.</li>
            <li> Okay product.  Not a lot in the bottle for the cost.</li>
