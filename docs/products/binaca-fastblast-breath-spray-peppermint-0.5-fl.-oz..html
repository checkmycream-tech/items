            <li>Binaca spray is top of the line.</li>
            <li>Not until I went on Amazon where you&#x27;re able to find any and everything</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This has a refreshing taste and is long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite breath spray.  </li>
            <li>Freshens breath quickly and effectively with just a couple of sprays.</li>
            <li>Plus the price is much better than those breath products that are available.</li>
            <li>I tryed other product&#x27;s but binaca work&#x27;s the best for me.</li>
            <li>Almost sure would not buy again under the same price + shipping conditions, even if the product&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I do recommend it, however, if you don&#x27;t like strong taste, don&#x27;t buy it.  </li>
            <li>Love the minty flavor- leaves my mouth fresh.</li>
            <li>I am enslaved to this product for keeping my breath fresh on a minutes notice!  </li>
            <li>More effective and taste better than any other breath spray on the market.</li>
            <li>I liked being able to remove the label and actually see the contents of it.</li>
            <li>Cool breath freshener.</li>
            <li>I love having a whole box of replacements, since I use this often.  </li>
            <li>this is a good price for it if you you it on a regular basis</li>
            <li>Easy to pack and appreciated by all!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I meet with a lot of people and have to have something that is fast and easy and</li>
            <li>Great for a quick breath freshen up or for opening up sinuses when spraying at back of mouth near throat.  </li>
            <li>Tastes good and &#x27;freshness&#x27; lasts longer than expected.</li>
            <li>This keeps his breath fresh and not stinky from smoking.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to everyone that want&#x27;s fresh taste.</li>
            <li>It last a lot and its not ozono depleting mini pump has a nice &amp;#34;flick lid&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it at local retailers, but of course it was available here.</li>
            <li>Good alternative to a pricier &#x27;other brand.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>I have a bridge right now</li>
            <li>I know this may sound a bit strange, but besides using Binaca Breath Spray Peppermint as a refreshing breath spray, I use it as a room deodorizer.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I am not fond of the new taste, as it is stronger, not as sweet, and doesn&#x27;t seem to freshen the breath like the original formula.</li>
            <li>This certainly does the trick!</li>
            <li>The shipment came very fast</li>
            <li>I found this purchase to be a very reasonable value.</li>
            <li>Always reliable and consistent.</li>
            <li>Useful, really, when meeting people after a revealing meal.</li>
            <li>First time I am using that product, but I am not at an age when it will make a lot of difference.</li>
            <li>This leaves a pleasant taste after use and is not readily available at retail in stores I normally shop.</li>
            <li>so I looked her and found exactly what I wanted at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>this is just pure mint taste no chemical taste to it at all.</li>
            <li>The large size containers make them very long-lasting.</li>
            <li>It has a better minty flavour than other breath sprays that I have used.</li>
            <li>No other breath spray keeps your mouth as fresh with no medicinal, perfume-like after taste.</li>
            <li>; like a Zippo lighter (I don&#x27;t smoke, but Zippos are cool to flick open!).</li>
            <li>purchased this item at Wal-mart and liked it, however I was not able to find it again....</li>
            <li>Need a quick breath freshener look no further</li>
            <li>the price is too high.</li>
            <li>Normally I use 7-8 sprays because that is the most that I can tolerate, but the minty taste doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li>Small convenient container, fresh and clean mint aroma.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this product.  </li>
            <li>none of those available last nearly as long.</li>
            <li>I have a problem with dry mouth and have to carry something with me at all times to keep my mouth feeling and smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li>I really feel ripped off and short changed.</li>
            <li>My groomsmen appreciated this product especially since our wedding was the day after we went to a cigar-rolling show.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably price allows you to have several around the house, for those up-close moments.</li>
            <li>I especially use it in public restrooms where the air is none too fresh.  </li>
            <li>The dispenser is a little big, more that twice the size of the regular spray.</li>
            <li>The contents seem to taste the same, but there is no way of knowing how much spray you have left.  </li>
            <li>I was very let down when the smaller size binaca spray was delivered.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I especially use it in public restrooms where the air is none too fresh.  </li>
            <li> The dispenser is a little big, more that twice the size of the regular spray.</li>
            <li> The contents seem to taste the same, but there is no way of knowing how much spray you have left.  </li>
            <li> I was very let down when the smaller size binaca spray was delivered.</li>
            <li> Same product as the overpriced breath sprays in the stores, which are also becoming difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> My teens are very conscious of their breath so this gives them a little extra boost of confidence.  </li>
            <li> It is getting hard to find at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time and the store I bought it at discontinued it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed less issues at the dentist since using this product on a regular basis including when waking up in the middle of the night -- kills all the bacteria that feast on your teeth.</li>
            <li> Have used up several myself as have other household members.  </li>
            <li> I have allergies and suffer from dry mouth, also sing</li>
            <li> I like it for relief of a dry mouth and it helps freshen my breath.</li>
            <li> At one time Binaca was sold by many of the brick and mortar stores in this area, but now it is almost impossible to find here.    </li>
            <li> but I still feel not clean enough.  </li>
            <li> When I called in I was told the the bigger pump spray was not available.</li>
            <li> everything  was  expected</li>
            <li> Small enough to carry in pocket.</li>
            <li> I wish I could hand them out like candy to other people</li>
            <li> not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li> The specific reason I ordered what was pictured was because I was having a hard time locating this type of container which is \\&quot;see-through\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes hard to find in the drug stores, as they tend to have the smaller tube type.  </li>
            <li> I have chronic sinusitis and use this at least daily.  </li>
            <li> Just a little bit sharp flavor.</li>
            <li> The taste is goos, with a slight bite.</li>
            <li> gives a tingling sensation to the mouth, but keeps the mouth fresh and void of bad breath.</li>
            <li> this order I placed a few days ago was for .5 fl. ounces of binaca spray.</li>
            <li> This is one we repeat buy every few months.</li>
            <li> I kept one star because of the added cost of shipping made this 6-pack go past the &amp;#34;affordable&amp;#34; line.</li>
            <li> We find the recommended 3 squirts a little too tough to stomach, and it makes us wince, so 1 or 2 is all we do....</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time finding these in the store.</li>
            <li> It has become hard to find, but I can now get it on Amazon.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the stamps yet but an happy with the looks of them.</li>
            <li> There are lots of breath mints out there.  I happen to prefer Binaca, and use it enough to spring for a big package.  Good deal on the price and you just can&#x27;t beat Binaca for breath spray.</li>
            <li> this order I placed a few days ago was for .5 fl. ounces of binaca spray.I was very let down when the smaller size binaca spray was delivered.I really feel ripped off and short changed.I don&#x27;t plan on buying this spray from this company ever again.ripoff that&#x27;s all</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this product.  I promise you will fall in love with this item.  It&#x27;s amazing and my friends beg for a blast of Binaca!</li>
            <li> At one time Binaca was sold by many of the brick and mortar stores in this area, but now it is almost impossible to find here.    This is a good product and a good value.</li>
            <li> Since I can&#x27;t find it in stores around here anymore I was very happy to find it on Amazon.  it&#x27;s not like the ones in the metal canisters, I don&#x27;t like the taste of those.  this is just pure mint taste no chemical taste to it at all.</li>
            <li> Good alternative to a pricier &#x27;other brand.&#x27;  They are effective and convenient to ensure a pleasant breath or moisten the throat to avoid light coughing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many years.  When I received it, the packaging was different, a darker blue label. I had planned to return (and the seller was understanding about wanting to return it) thinking that I received the wrong item.  After doing some checking on the Binaca website, I discovered it is the same product, peppermint, however, the flavor has been reformulated.  The picture on Amazon has not been updated.  Unfortunately, I am not fond of the new taste, as it is stronger, not as sweet, and doesn&#x27;t seem to freshen the breath like the original formula.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great packaging</li>
            <li> This is one we repeat buy every few months.</li>
            <li> It came on time, and wasn&#x27;t damaged in any way.</li>
            <li> freshens breath. great item.</li>
            <li> I carry one of these Fastblast Sprays in my pocket at all times,&lt;br /&gt;for when my mouth tastes stale.  It holds a months supply,&lt;br /&gt;has a great fresh minty taste,&lt;br /&gt;and saves the lives of those around me from passing out.&lt;br /&gt;MUCH better flavor than Listerine!</li>
            <li> My teens are very conscious of their breath so this gives them a little extra boost of confidence.  We keep them in our backpacks, in the car, in the kitchen so we can always grab a squirt.  We find the recommended 3 squirts a little too tough to stomach, and it makes us wince, so 1 or 2 is all we do....</li>
            <li> I have a problem with dry mouth and have to carry something with me at all times to keep my mouth feeling and smelling fresh.  This certainly does the trick!</li>
            <li> The item pictured is .5 oz 300 sprays pump spray.  What I received was .214 oz 150 sprays aerosol spray.  When I called in I was told the the bigger pump spray was not available.</li>
            <li> Good flavor and breath freshener. Spray nozzle turns 360 degrees which takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper to buy these in bulk from Amazon than individually in local store. No issues with the spray function on any of them. Small enough to carry in pocket. Tastes good and &#x27;freshness&#x27; lasts longer than expected. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this product in stores anymore...none of those available last nearly as long. The product showed up fast and I am very happy with.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Freshens breath so well.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason Binaca decided it would discontinue the breath spray that you see pictured here. IE, I did not receive what I ordered. The specific reason I ordered what was pictured was because I was having a hard time locating this type of container which is \\&quot;see-through\\&quot;.  I liked being able to remove the label and actually see the contents of it. What I was shipped was the \\&quot;new\\&quot; style which you cannot see through. I feel I was duped by the seller as they used a stock photograph and nowhere mentioned \\&quot;you may not receive what is in the photo\\&quot;. The contents seem to taste the same, but there is no way of knowing how much spray you have left.  Another perfect example of a company pulling a great product and making the \\&quot;new\\&quot; one a \\&quot;so-so\\&quot; product. The shipment came very fast but I was sorely dissapointed when I opened it.  If you are looking for this product I would suggest contacting the seller ahead of time to specify the type you want.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the product and the service on purchase was great.</li>
            <li> No other breath spray keeps your mouth as fresh with no medicinal, perfume-like after taste. Best value when purchasing multiple packs of 6 or 12.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Bianca it&#x27;s good&lt;br /&gt;I always have one with me&lt;br /&gt;sometimes I wish I could hand them out like candy to other people</li>
            <li> i smoke but don&#x27;t really like for others to smell it, so this is a great deterence, i&#x27;ll be having these always</li>
            <li> I like this spray. Small convenient container, fresh and clean mint aroma. I also use it as air freshener. Only one spray... and your room or bathroom smell heavenly.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time and the store I bought it at discontinued it so I looked her and found exactly what I wanted at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It contains at least 300 sprays and keeps my breath fresh.  It is simple to use and portable. Fits discreetly into pocket or purse.</li>
            <li> Cool breath freshener. Always reliable and consistent.</li>
            <li> I kiss everybody now!</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband who&#x27;s a smoker. This keeps his breath fresh and not stinky from smoking.</li>
            <li> As always, I love this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Binaca since the 80&#x27;s and hate that I can&#x27;t find it in stores.&lt;br /&gt;I was stoked to be able to get it here.</li>
            <li> In the same territory as Listerine Breath Strips, I decided to try Binaca Fastblast Breath Spray Peppermint. Almost at the same level, but I must admit that in this case I still prefer Listerine, but this one is a close second. They give you plenty of this spray that goes in the mouth with a blast of peppermint. Useful, really, when meeting people after a revealing meal. Price was acceptable. 4 Stars.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the size of the container, but the product is still excellent.  I use it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Have been using Binaca for years--it&#x27;s the best. Please add two more 6 packs to my Wish List.  Thank you. Cramer Partridge</li>
            <li> good container. good sprayer. nice size. not too big and not too small. the price is too high. quality of spray has been a mainstay. i have used this spray for more than 2 years.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find in the store anymore and I like this.</li>
            <li> Great product and very fast shipping. Will continue to purchase this product from this seller.  vcola</li>
            <li> My groomsmen appreciated this product especially since our wedding was the day after we went to a cigar-rolling show.  Easy to pack and appreciated by all!</li>
            <li> gives a tingling sensation to the mouth, but keeps the mouth fresh and void of bad breath. would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it works well for me.  It is getting hard to find at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> great blast for smokers</li>
            <li> Love the minty flavor- leaves my mouth fresh. I have allergies and suffer from dry mouth, also sing so I keep a bottle on the risers!</li>
            <li> First time I am using that product, but I am not at an age when it will make a lot of difference.</li>
            <li> Great for a quick breath freshen up or for opening up sinuses when spraying at back of mouth near throat.  I have chronic sinusitis and use this at least daily.  Have ordered this pack twice as these tend to disappear over time.  Have used up several myself as have other household members.  No substitute for good oral hygiene but do in a pinch.  Cheaper than Altoids.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I couldn&#x27;t it in my drugstore or grocery store.  Bought it thru Amazon ( always great service).  I carry this product in my purse, gave one to my DIL&#x27;s in their &amp;#34;girlie&amp;#34; bag for Christmas.  They also love it.  It is a very strong but effective product.  I do recommend it, however, if you don&#x27;t like strong taste, don&#x27;t buy it.  Like I said, I love it!</li>
            <li> lISTEN-UP EVERYONE-I&#x27;ve tried them all and do yourself a &amp;#34;BIG-BIG&amp;#34; favor&amp;#34;,guarantied to do the job!Great for any occasion--Hey guys-She could love ya forever!!!</li>
            <li> It has a better minty flavour than other breath sprays that I have used. Like how the cap is attached to the bottle so it won&#x27;t go astray. Normally I use 7-8 sprays because that is the most that I can tolerate, but the minty taste doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> These were very good but they positioned the &#x27;squirt&#x27; in a position that makes you have to twist your wrist to get it into your mouth and not on your face</li>
            <li> I found this purchase to be a very reasonable value. I was having a hard time finding these in the store.</li>
            <li> Great, I recommende spray 2-3 time.</li>
            <li> I find the Binanca Fast Blast spray to be the best out there for quality and cost.</li>
            <li> Found this a Walgreen&#x27;s for the same price.  The dispenser is a little big, more that twice the size of the regular spray.</li>
            <li> I have been using Binaca Fastblast Breath Spray in Peppermint for years. It has become hard to find, but I can now get it on Amazon.Com. I meet with a lot of people and have to have something that is fast and easy and Binaca Fastblast Breath Spray works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Price and Delivery from Amazon.Com</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Formula may have changed, but it&#x27;s still darn good!</li>
            <li> Same product as the overpriced breath sprays in the stores, which are also becoming difficult to find.  I love having a whole box of replacements, since I use this often.  And the price is terrific.  The large size containers make them very long-lasting.</li>
            <li> They come in a box with 5 of them and they are peppermint</li>
            <li> Have used this product since quitting smoking in 1999. I like it for relief of a dry mouth and it helps freshen my breath.</li>
            <li> Great price, good delivery time ,will deal again</li>
            <li> Good product, no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have a bridge right now and I brush teeth and gum for longer than 10 min., but I still feel not clean enough.  Binaca spray makes my mouth feel good.  Just a little bit sharp flavor.</li>
            <li> I tryed other product&#x27;s but binaca work&#x27;s the best for me. I would recommend this product to everyone that want&#x27;s fresh taste.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!  Glad I bought it.  I worked great.</li>
            <li> More effective and taste better than any other breath spray on the market. I&#x27;ve also noticed less issues at the dentist since using this product on a regular basis including when waking up in the middle of the night -- kills all the bacteria that feast on your teeth.</li>
            <li> This leaves a pleasant taste after use and is not readily available at retail in stores I normally shop. Plus the price is much better than those breath products that are available.</li>
            <li> Good quality and value</li>
            <li> Reunited with this after many years of not finding in stores.  Not everyone finds the sort of chemical smell likeable but it does refresh.</li>
            <li> This product gives a very refreshing and confident blast of mint wherever you are. It last a lot and its not ozono depleting mini pump has a nice &amp;#34;flick lid&amp;#34; like a Zippo lighter (I don&#x27;t smoke, but Zippos are cool to flick open!). I kept one star because of the added cost of shipping made this 6-pack go past the &amp;#34;affordable&amp;#34; line. Almost sure would not buy again under the same price + shipping conditions, even if the product&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Everyone says my breath is much better since using this. I hate to offend with my dragon breath and this stuff relly works.</li>
            <li> Works great and has lots of sprays per unit. Works for smokers,</li>
            <li> Great quality; great price; great flavor; great effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Freshens breath quickly and effectively with just a couple of sprays. I haven&#x27;t been able to find it at local retailers, but of course it was available here. Please keep it in stock, I promise I will buy more when I use these 6 up!</li>
            <li> Binaca spray is top of the line. This container lasts forever (300 sprays). The taste is goos, with a slight bite.</li>
            <li> I have considered Binaca the best for many years, and the 6 pack is handy and cost effective,  I have tried others and the dispenser did not work properly, but this does.</li>
            <li> Some people don&#x27;t like chewing gum or mints but this is a really good and &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34; alternative if youre concerned about Aspartame in many chewing gums. One bottle has ~300 squirts and its has a great flavor.</li>
            <li> purchased this item at Wal-mart and liked it, however I was not able to find it again....Not until I went on Amazon where you&#x27;re able to find any and everything......I Luv the product.....</li>
            <li> Excellent price for the 6-pack.  I&#x27;m a smoker, so I use this after every cigarette I smoke.</li>
            <li> I am enslaved to this product for keeping my breath fresh on a minutes notice!  The stores have stopped selling it and this is the only place I can find them....TG!!!</li>
            <li> everything  was  expected</li>
            <li> I know this may sound a bit strange, but besides using Binaca Breath Spray Peppermint as a refreshing breath spray, I use it as a room deodorizer.  I especially use it in public restrooms where the air is none too fresh.  It works wonderfully as a breath refreshing spray as we all know, but this extended use comes in handy,too.</li>
            <li> Nothing but alcohol taste ~ not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I love it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes hard to find in the drug stores, as they tend to have the smaller tube type.  This has a refreshing taste and is long-lasting.  Reasonably price allows you to have several around the house, for those up-close moments.</li>
            <li> Need a quick breath freshener look no further</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite breath spray.  it would never be without it and uses every day.  this is a good price for it if you you it on a regular basis</li>
