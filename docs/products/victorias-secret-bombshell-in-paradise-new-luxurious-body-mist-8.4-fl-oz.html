            <li> I got this VS Bombshell Summer perfume,  I wad hoping it would smell better but it&#x27;s not bad,  not long lasting.  I think I&#x27;m gonna stick with regular Bombshell.  The seller had it to me in no time,  wad impressed with the shipment.</li>
            <li> This was discontinued and sold out in the stores and on the website so I love that I found it online!</li>
            <li> This is one of my top 5 favorites on my list of body sprays! This spray is sooooo beautiful i cant even explain! The perfume equivalent is just as good! I love this scent! It is very girly and everyone i know loves it! Now if you dont want the alcohol smella t all from body sprays i would suggest getting the perfume. This doesnt last too too long so i usually re-apply every hour or so. If you have a travel perfume container that would work best for on the go rather than taking the whole bottle everywhere with you.</li>

            <li> I love all the Victoria Secrets perfumes &amp; this one is fabulous! I have gotten lots of compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li> This scent is nice and light, easy to wear to work. It smells like vacation in a bottle. I love to wear it on rainy days as a pick me up. I also get headaches if a scent is too strong and this has never given me a headache.</li>
            <li> Quick, smells beautiful. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Smells so sexy</li>
