            <li>Worth it.</li>

            <li>I really don&#x27;t keep up with whether it is Eau De Toilet or cologne.</li>
            <li>I sprayed this new bottle and it had next to no scent whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>It is not Bvlgari extreme what you sent me, its the one on the picture which is a different one also by Bvlgari, much lighter</li>

            <li> recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.</li>

            <li> I test scents at Sax Fifth Avenue and purchase online. This is a nice, clean scent. Women love it. Worth it.</li>
            <li> I love to smell it on my partner thank you, and I got it just in time for her birthday.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a cologne for my husband that is different, in a good way.  Some of the colognes are so overpowering and they all smell the same.  This cologne is just perfect.  He receives many compliments on how great he smells!!  Luckily, I am not the jealous type.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift that I will give next month. No comment yet</li>
            <li> Okay people. I really don&#x27;t keep up with whether it is Eau De Toilet or cologne. All I know is how it smells.  This makes me smell important and Western European.   I&#x27;m not European but I am important.   Purchase it. I assure you it is one of the best smelling colognes out there.</li>
            <li> This product is still in USA, it can&#x27;t fly outside for safety reasons, i need the return pack code please, for star the process in my package office.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Smells so gooood!</li>
            <li> Discovered this in a gift shop on a cruise. Had to purchase another one for my husband. It smells wonderful on him!</li>
            <li> my belove girl suggest me to use this perfume, I like her smell when she use it. LOVE HER and HER EVERYTHING:)</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne! I can&#x27;t ever find this in stores in this size. I was able to purchase the 3.4 oz for what is being charged for 1.7 oz in the factory stores. Product was delivered WAY ahead of est. delivery date and exactly as described. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> It is not Bvlgari extreme what you sent me, its the one on the picture which is a different one also by Bvlgari, much lighter</li>
            <li> I am very grateful for this product because it had already time looking, thank you very much, keep it up</li>
            <li> Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.</li>
            <li> really good product and just what i expected, is get on time and is just beautiful and original botton line i love it</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son at Christmas and he just loves this scent.  He usually gets this cologne every year.</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with purchase. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne--this purchase was my fourth bottle, so I know what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like.  I sprayed this new bottle and it had next to no scent whatsoever.  I compared it with my last bottle and the difference is night and day.  The bottles are exactly the same--both are eau-de-toilette.  The new one I purchased from Amazon is clearly either defective or not the real thing.  To make matters worse, it can&#x27;t be returned because it is a &amp;#34;hazardous or flammable substance.&amp;#34;  Interestingly enough, it was ok for Amazon to send this product in the mail, but it would be much too dangerous for me to return it in the mail...  I&#x27;ll be disputing this purchase with my credit card company.  Yes, folks, the price is indeed too good to be true.  Stay away!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance for my husband.  When his last bottle ran out, I found this on Amazon at a good price and the shipping was really quick.</li>
            <li> not the real formula..counterfeit</li>
            <li> Got it for Christmas for my Dad, its my favorite cologne and his as well.&lt;br /&gt;If you want an amazing smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering but subtle and clean, this is the one!</li>
            <li> Well...the sense of smell is a subjective thing and I am not going to try and word the sensation, so here is a simple one line review:&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of it!</li>
