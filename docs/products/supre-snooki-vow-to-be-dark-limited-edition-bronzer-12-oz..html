            <li>more regularly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recieved my lotion in a very timely fashion; very pleased with the shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if floral flowers are your thing then you&#x27;ll love the scent I prefer a fruity or sweet scent when it comes to lotions.</li>
            <li>The product Snooki Ultra Dark Leg Bronzer worked much better!!!</li>
            <li>Great and tan last a week...</li>
            <li>Great instant results!</li>
            <li>Love this product love how it feel on the skin, and the result you get for using it thanks buy it again</li>
            <li>Excited to see it progress.</li>
            <li>It has a great smell and gave a a nice dark tan after the first time.  </li>
            <li>(Haven&#x27;t had much time to go in due to working that awesome 3-11 LPN schedule of mine &amp; having my wisdom teeth cut out on 8/8/14.)&lt;br /&gt;Anywho</li>
            <li>have a pretty good tan; not too dark but definitely a nice, sun-kissed</li>
            <li>Bottle is very pretty.</li>
            <li>But it was hot for a while!</li>
            <li>After day 2 of use and in a low grade bed I have a nice glow on my skin.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I am an avid tanner not a newbie.</li>
            <li>but I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Giving it 4 stars right now just because I didn&#x27;t see much color difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I already had a great base tan which isn&#x27;t as good anymore.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give this lotion a try because it seemed promising by reading the description</li>
            <li>instead it smells better and works getting you incredibly dark.</li>
            <li>It works but the description made it sound like it was a dark and fast product.</li>
            <li>plus the fact I got amazing dark results with her other lotion.</li>
            <li>will definitely be updating my review once I start going steady again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using the snooki ultra dark bronzer 70x in the past and getting amazing results</li>
            <li>and it smells amazing stinks</li>

            <li> After using the snooki ultra dark bronzer 70x in the past and getting amazing results</li>
            <li> and it smells amazing stinks</li>
            <li> I have had absolutely no change in my tan in the last month since I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s limited addition</li>
            <li> snooki vow makes you so dark just after the 2nd time I was so dark</li>
            <li> not what i expected..</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not as dark as I expected to be after a month of using it.</li>
            <li> If I were you I would pass on this lotion not worth the money</li>
            <li> Id get her ultra dark bronzer 70x lotion</li>
            <li> It went on thick which I don&#x27;t care for in a lotion because a little doesn&#x27;t go a long way plus it leaves your skin feeling funky after.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice &amp; I haven&#x27;t had real bad staining on the hands.</li>
            <li> can get a little watery between uses, but overall it doesn&#x27;t smell too bad.</li>
            <li> The texture reminded me of that you find in a thick hand cream or lotion.</li>
            <li> but worse.</li>
            <li> BUT when I sweat in the bed it stinks for a while then goes to smelling</li>
            <li> I guess all of them smell bad after you tan :(</li>
            <li> it so annoying.</li>
            <li> I meannit wasn&#x27;t a horrible scent</li>
    </ol>

            <li> can get a little watery between uses, but overall it doesn&#x27;t smell too bad. does help darken tan</li>
            <li> Great lotion! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Came in super fast!!!!!! Like 2 or 3 days. But it was hot for a while! Bc the weather. Idk if that did anything to it. Bottle is very pretty. it smell so GREAT!! Smells like hair shampoo lol. BUT when I sweat in the bed it stinks for a while then goes to smelling okay. But my last tanning lotion was like that but worse. I guess all of them smell bad after you tan :( it so annoying. I think I&#x27;ve gotten darker from this lotion. It goes on great! Not greasy (but just a Lil greasy when you get out bed) so not perf but its good ! Didn&#x27;t to give it was for engagement until I got it lolssss im not engaged (yet) oh well!</li>
            <li> This product did not bronze or give me a darker tan. The product Snooki Ultra Dark Leg Bronzer worked much better!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product love how it feel on the skin, and the result you get for using it thanks buy it again</li>
            <li> Love it works great people started noticing how tan I was within 2 visits using this!</li>
            <li> Great product . Thank you</li>
            <li> Great bronzer and it won&#x27;t turn you orange</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff for awesome price</li>
            <li> I loved it, need to order some more, my granddaughter got that one!</li>
            <li> Love love love snooki vow makes you so dark just after the 2nd time I was so dark and it smells amazing stinks it&#x27;s limited addition</li>
            <li> After day 2 of use and in a low grade bed I have a nice glow on my skin. Excited to see it progress. The smell is nice &amp; I haven&#x27;t had real bad staining on the hands. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Goes on smoothly and evenly has a great scent to it. My local tanning salon would&#x27;ve charged 3 times the price as this seller did!</li>
            <li> Awesome tanner!!! Works Great and tan last a week... Would recommend buying this lotion..</li>
            <li> not what i expected..</li>
            <li> Great Product ... fast shipping.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m only giving this product a 1 b/c I have to check off something.  I have had absolutely no change in my tan in the last month since I&#x27;ve been using it.  in fact I almost feel as though my tan has faded, and i&#x27;m not the only one to notice.  I know it&#x27;s trial and error but I tan very easily and I already had a great base tan which isn&#x27;t as good anymore.  it also leaves streak marks if you don&#x27;t rub it in evenly which it says it doesn&#x27;t do.  I would just like to try something that actually works like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Great instant results!</li>
            <li> Smells good before and after tanning!</li>
            <li> After using the snooki ultra dark bronzer 70x in the past and getting amazing results I thought I&#x27;d give this lotion a try because it seemed promising by reading the description plus the fact I got amazing dark results with her other lotion. Well this lotion didn&#x27;t do anything for me at all to my surprise maybe it could of been tampered with or the lotion just isn&#x27;t that good of a product. The texture reminded me of that you find in a thick hand cream or lotion. It went on thick which I don&#x27;t care for in a lotion because a little doesn&#x27;t go a long way plus it leaves your skin feeling funky after. I&#x27;m not big on the scent I meannit wasn&#x27;t a horrible scent but if floral flowers are your thing then you&#x27;ll love the scent I prefer a fruity or sweet scent when it comes to lotions. If I were you I would pass on this lotion not worth the money and I saw no color. Id get her ultra dark bronzer 70x lotion instead it smells better and works getting you incredibly dark. I am an avid tanner not a newbie.</li>
            <li> Smells great keeps me tan for days !</li>
            <li> I just got it and I have used it 2 time and I love it. It has a great smell and gave a a nice dark tan after the first time.  I have never used any of her tanning lotion before but I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I recieved my lotion in a very timely fashion; very pleased with the shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging- awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is like roses; a stronger scent of roses but a good scent. I haven&#x27;t noticed any ATO since I&#x27;ve used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW- as for the color.....&lt;br /&gt;I have a pretty good tan; not too dark but definitely a nice, sun-kissed brown.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this lotion maybe 3 times since I&#x27;ve gotten it. (Haven&#x27;t had much time to go in due to working that awesome 3-11 LPN schedule of mine &amp; having my wisdom teeth cut out on 8/8/14.)&lt;br /&gt;Anywho, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be more impressed with the color once I start going more regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving it 4 stars right now just because I didn&#x27;t see much color difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be updating my review once I start going steady again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks everyone!!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your Snooki lotion!!!</li>
            <li> Great lotion got me darker after first use.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the way my skin feels but I&#x27;m not as dark as I expected to be after a month of using it. It works but the description made it sound like it was a dark and fast product.</li>
