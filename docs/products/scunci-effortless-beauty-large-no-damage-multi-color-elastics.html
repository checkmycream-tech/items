            <li>Scunci elastics offer a very good variety of colors on one card.</li>
            <li>these work great and have a variety of colors</li>
            <li>It’s great for kids’ hair.</li>
            <li>I wish they would have sent the pastel colors shown, but it&#x27;s still a good product that I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li>a good product for a good price.  </li>
            <li>good price for product.  </li>
            <li>Good price and nice assortment.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They don&#x27;t pull or snag your hair, so that&#x27;s a nice feature, too.</li>
            <li>the colors are nice, they seem to hold up well, everything you need from a hair band.</li>
            <li>Nice assortment of colors.</li>
            <li>The hair ties are extremely easy to use and have good stretch.</li>
            <li>I LOVE ALL OF THE COLORS.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my daughter, and while she tried to keep up with them, she lost most of them at school.  </li>
            <li>These used to be our favorite hair elastics.  </li>
            <li>I do love that these are no damage bands with no metal clasp to pull out hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall very happy!</li>
            <li>Never can have too many hair ties around.  </li>
            <li>all girls will love it.</li>
            <li>Wonderful, don&#x27;t tear my long hair.  </li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t super amazing or anything like that, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li>Anyways, for the price I don&#x27;t really care, I can still get a good amount of use out of each band before I see any discoloration.</li>
            <li>i love it&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very useful for iny hair style</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just easy to take one out at lunch or your desk and lose it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to tie and does not pull hair.</li>
            <li>Most hair ties break within a day, and to last 2 months is amazing!</li>
            <li>Mostly in the first use.  </li>
            <li>Kinda stretch out too quickly</li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON FOR GETTING THEM TO ME SO QUICKLY!</li>
            <li>Many other products are too flimsy and break easily.</li>
            <li>As far as your basic hair elastics go, this is about as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>The first one that I used broke.</li>
            <li>They last about a month or more each?</li>
            <li>These are quality and don&#x27;t snap and break the first time you wear them.  </li>
            <li>Pretty colors.  </li>
            <li>I bought these a while ago and had high expectations from Scunci, and they didn&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
            <li>She loves them and they really hold her hair in place.</li>
            <li>How much can one say about elastic bands for the hair?</li>
            <li>They seem dried out and kind of crunchy.</li>
            <li>With other brands, I often find myself having to take out my ponytail and redo it many times a day.</li>
            <li>With those odds, perhaps it is better to go to the competition and get the bands from Con Air or some other brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i also love how it&lt;br /&gt;dosen&#x27;t pull out your hair like other hair ties.</li>
            <li>However, this last batch has had far too many bands snap open on the first use.  </li>
            <li>is a little more relaxed</li>
            <li>These work really well for keeping my hair tied back, but my husband finds that they often snap within the first day of him using them.  </li>
            <li>JUST GOT MY NEW SCUNCI PASTEL ELASTICS.</li>
            <li>I not only recommend this product to anyone, I plan to purchase more in the next week because I cannot find them at any local stores.  </li>
            <li>These work great in her very thick and long hair.  </li>
            <li>I love these colors and the fact they don&#x27;t have any sharp parts to break off long hair</li>
            <li>These were old and brittle, lost their elasticity immediately, and broke.</li>
            <li>I suspect this related to the fact that the elastic wasn&#x27;t particularly stretchy and they don&#x27;t have the metal fastener for reinforcement.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and straight, medium thickness, and these do not break for me.  </li>
            <li>These bands of black magic are endless entertainment for the house</li>
            <li>They hold my thick heavy hair up good.</li>
            <li>And I use the odd colors for other things like chips, or just to band something together easily.</li>
            <li>I know it sounds ridiculous, but I have fine hair</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t for people with thick hair such as myself, but I do have one daughter with thin hair, so these work great for her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/1 update:  </li>
            <li>Buyers should be fine with these as long as their hair is not too thick.</li>
            <li>These work well but at least 1/4 of the broke quickly.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little thicker than I prefer, but work well and don&#x27;t stretch out too fast.</li>

            <li> I typically just throw my hair back in a tie</li>

            <li> I just got a bad batch and everyone else will have more luck.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had these fall out completely several ties when I just had a messy ponytail or bun.  </li>
            <li> Save yourself the headache and go buy them at the store, so you know that they haven&#x27;t been sitting in a box in a warehouse for an unknown amount of time.</li>
            <li> They colors in the one I got were pink, dark pink, teal, grey, and black.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair, so it&#x27;s hard to find an elastic that works for me.</li>
            <li> and I find that these don&#x27;t hold my hair as well as my other scunci hair ties</li>
            <li> The last hair tie broke this week :/.  </li>
            <li> Now I have to be very careful every time I touch one.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and about 1/4 of these break while I tried to put then in my hair the first time.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the previous reviews before buying.</li>
            <li> i use these hair ties everyday.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my granddaughter who has very thick long hair.  </li>
            <li> At least half the bands ended up in the trash.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re still totally workable, just not awesome.</li>
            <li> Warning: You cannot stretch to hard on these elastics!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> IT IS HARD TO DECIDE WHICH COLOR TO WEAR?</li>
            <li> Gave these to my Granddaughter who has very thick, heavy hair.</li>
            <li> and I end up having to redo or tighten my hair at least once an hour as it slides out.  </li>
            <li> This last batch has been rather disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t buy them again because they&#x27;re no use for him (he has thick, curly hair)</li>
            <li> This is very disappointing from an Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li> I find your minimum number of words requirement annoying.</li>

            <li> Warning: You cannot stretch to hard on these elastics!&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed with my purchase. The first one that I used broke. Now I have to be very careful every time I touch one. It feels like they&#x27;ve been sitting there for a long time waiting for somebody to buy them. I wish I had read the previous reviews before buying. I will not spend money on those again.</li>
            <li> JUST GOT MY NEW SCUNCI PASTEL ELASTICS. THEY ARE PERFECT FOR PUTTING MY HAIR IN PIG TAILS AND BRAIDS AND DON&#x27;T TANGLE MY HAIR. I LOVE ALL OF THE COLORS. IT IS HARD TO DECIDE WHICH COLOR TO WEAR? THANKS AMAZON FOR GETTING THEM TO ME SO QUICKLY!</li>
            <li> I know it sounds ridiculous, but I have fine hair and I find that these don&#x27;t hold my hair as well as my other scunci hair ties do- it seems like the tension or elastic in it is a little more relaxed and I end up having to redo or tighten my hair at least once an hour as it slides out.  I typically just throw my hair back in a tie and I&#x27;ve had these fall out completely several ties when I just had a messy ponytail or bun.  They&#x27;re still totally workable, just not awesome.</li>
            <li> I bought these a while ago and had high expectations from Scunci, and they didn&#x27;t disappoint! The hair ties are extremely easy to use and have good stretch. They last about a month or more each? and I&#x27;m only on about my second or third one even though I use one almost every day. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for everyone who ordered this product, but what I received was not the pastel colored hair ties, so I discounted a star. They colors in the one I got were pink, dark pink, teal, grey, and black. I wish they would have sent the pastel colors shown, but it&#x27;s still a good product that I&#x27;ll use. I&#x27;ve been using these hair ties for years and I&#x27;ve never had any break, but I have had them become discolored, almost like they&#x27;ve got bleach spots on them but I don&#x27;t bleach my hair so I have no idea where it comes from. Anyways, for the price I don&#x27;t really care, I can still get a good amount of use out of each band before I see any discoloration.</li>
            <li> There is lots of colors to choose from in this set of hair bands. They hold my thick heavy hair up good. Haven&#x27;t stretched out yet like others have.</li>
            <li> As far as your basic hair elastics go, this is about as good as it gets. I have pretty thick hair, so it&#x27;s hard to find an elastic that works for me. These aren&#x27;t super amazing or anything like that, but they get the job done. With other brands, I often find myself having to take out my ponytail and redo it many times a day. I still have to do that with these, but only a couple times, rather than many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t pull or snag your hair, so that&#x27;s a nice feature, too.</li>
            <li> These were old and brittle, lost their elasticity immediately, and broke. Save yourself the headache and go buy them at the store, so you know that they haven&#x27;t been sitting in a box in a warehouse for an unknown amount of time.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my granddaughter who has very thick long hair.  They stay in place even when she is swimming.</li>
            <li> These are quality and don&#x27;t snap and break the first time you wear them.  Also, they don&#x27;t tangle up in your hair like some do, so they don&#x27;t cause pain removing from head.  They aren&#x27;t for people with thick hair such as myself, but I do have one daughter with thin hair, so these work great for her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/1 update:  The last hair tie broke this week :/.  I bought these for my daughter, and while she tried to keep up with them, she lost most of them at school.  It&#x27;s just easy to take one out at lunch or your desk and lose it.  However, this last one is the only one that broke.  She wore this one for over two months because it is the only hair tie she owns that is big enough to hold all her hair up.  I not only recommend this product to anyone, I plan to purchase more in the next week because I cannot find them at any local stores.  Most hair ties break within a day, and to last 2 months is amazing!</li>
            <li> Was bought as a stocking stuffer for my daughter.  These work great in her very thick and long hair.  Many other products are too flimsy and break easily.</li>
            <li> a good product for a good price.  the colors are nice, they seem to hold up well, everything you need from a hair band.</li>
            <li> Would order them again.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t break at joined spot. They do tend to stretch out some.</li>
            <li> Kinda stretch out too quickly</li>
            <li> These work really well for keeping my hair tied back, but my husband finds that they often snap within the first day of him using them.  I probably won&#x27;t buy them again because they&#x27;re no use for him (he has thick, curly hair) but if I were using them just for me, I would continue to buy them.  My hair is long and straight, medium thickness, and these do not break for me.  Buyers should be fine with these as long as their hair is not too thick.</li>
            <li> Gave these to my Granddaughter who has very thick, heavy hair. She loves them and they really hold her hair in place.</li>
            <li> Although the package does not appear tampered with, the 30-count Pastel scunci package only contained 24 in the package.  This is very disappointing from an Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li> They all broke.  Mostly in the first use.  Very disappointed with the quality.  Will not be purchasing ever, ever again!</li>
            <li> These used to be our favorite hair elastics.  This last batch has been rather disappointing.  I do love that these are no damage bands with no metal clasp to pull out hair.  However, this last batch has had far too many bands snap open on the first use.  At least half the bands ended up in the trash.  With those odds, perhaps it is better to go to the competition and get the bands from Con Air or some other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully I just got a bad batch and everyone else will have more luck.</li>
            <li> i love it&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very useful for iny hair style</li>
            <li> They still pull out hair.  The dab of adhesive used to connect the ends snags and pulls the hair.</li>
            <li> I recently bought these and I am very disappointed. I have very thin hair and about 1/4 of these break while I tried to put then in my hair the first time. I do not have a lot of hair so I didn&#x27;t need to stretch these far or use them roughly but even with that being the case a lot of them snapped before I ever got the chance to use them. They seem dried out and kind of crunchy. I will not be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> Six bands of Five colors ea. Easy to tie and does not pull hair.</li>
            <li> Nice assortment of colors. No metal for hair to snag on. They&#x27;re a little thicker than I prefer, but work well and don&#x27;t stretch out too fast. I prefer [[ASIN:B001KYRVSO Vidal Sassoon Medium No Crimper Elastics, Neutral, 30 Count]] because they are thinner, but they stretch out faster.</li>
            <li> These bands of black magic are endless entertainment for the house Eberle feline.  . yet no match for the jaws of the dire cat eberle</li>
            <li> Wonderful, don&#x27;t tear my long hair.  Hold well.  Pretty colors.  Well made.</li>
            <li> Scunci elastics offer a very good variety of colors on one card. They seem to be well made and will hold up for quite a while- all though I have already popped one, But of all the the elastics that I have, I don&#x27;t think that is such an odd occurrence. Overall very happy! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good price and nice assortment.  Very happy with purchase.  Really..why the 15 words required???  How much can one say about elastic bands for the hair? I find your minimum number of words requirement annoying.</li>
            <li> Never can have too many hair ties around.  And I use the odd colors for other things like chips, or just to band something together easily.</li>
            <li> these work great and have a variety of colors so it works for me!</li>
            <li> I love these colors and the fact they don&#x27;t have any sharp parts to break off long hair</li>
            <li> This is the best  product. It’s great for kids’ hair. It doesn’t’ tangle in comparation to the others in the stores.</li>
            <li> i use these hair ties everyday. i also love how it&lt;br /&gt;dosen&#x27;t pull out your hair like other hair ties.</li>
            <li> These work well but at least 1/4 of the broke quickly.  I suspect this related to the fact that the elastic wasn&#x27;t particularly stretchy and they don&#x27;t have the metal fastener for reinforcement.</li>
            <li> good price for product.  all girls will love it. neon  colors will give a perfect touch for all people and ages</li>
