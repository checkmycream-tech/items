            <li>Looks perfect in the dark, and eveyone is asking me about this polish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased several Harmony Gelish polishes and have been happy with all of them.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews on Gelish colors not matching the colors shown in the images, I found this color to be EXACTLY what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I top it off with two coats of &amp;#34;Silver Sand.&amp;#34; This color, along with two coats of Silver Sand always elicit comments from people about how pretty my nails look.</li>
            <li>I love gelish and have many many colors, however this appears far more purple than blue and is not as pictured.</li>
            <li>They are good quality polishes that last the full two weeks.</li>
            <li>I bought  this polish from lucky star gifts and it arrived promply and well wrapped.</li>
            <li>My favorite Gelish color so far!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty</li>
            <li>I like it best with three thin coats.  </li>
            <li>I find that three thin coats of color work best on my nails.</li>
            <li>It is very glossy and rich looking.</li>
            <li>if I take the time to do it right.</li>
            <li>Perfect color a deep purple almost black</li>
            <li>], I was reminded of the great coverage I usually get with Gelish.  </li>
            <li>Not as dark as it shows in the swatch, in bright sunlight</li>
            <li>You can get a couple of different looks depending on how many coats you apply.  </li>
            <li>I just finished my first DIY manicure with Harmony Gelish</li>
            <li>For anyone looking to do this for their first time, here are my lessons learned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not so forgiving if you&#x27;re doing this for the first time</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>But, I love it just the same.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really like the purple.</li>
            <li>Night Reflection itself, in low light, looks like a deep purple (as in the swatch), but under a light its a very iridescent medium purple.</li>
            <li>This is REALLY</li>
            <li>Really like the color</li>
            <li>but it peels off with 2 coats in several days and is light around the edge of the nail.</li>
            <li>Only needed two coats to achieve a perfectly smooth opaque color.  </li>
            <li>This is a very shiny, very &amp;#34;look at my purple nails&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It is most definitely purple and not very dark.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice change from the traditional dark colors if you love the dark nail polishes like I do.</li>
            <li>A little more &amp;#34;rockstar&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Nice deep dark purple.</li>
            <li>More on the blue side of purple than the pink side.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if my botle was a dud or if this color is a dud -- either wasy as much as I love Gelish, I cannot recommend this color.</li>
            <li>I get so many comments everyday on this one!</li>
            <li>First -- the color is pretty, though a very, very dark bluish purple.  </li>
            <li>I added a coat of Vegas Nights on top, which is a very small multi-color glitter.</li>
            <li>This color in particular is a medium-deep royal purple with a red \\&quot;candy\\&quot; shimmer in it.</li>
            <li>I love it, deep purple, not almost black, which is what it looked like on line, and at first I was disappointed, but I really love this one!</li>
            <li>Bella&#x27;s Vampire is the deep dark rich purple you professionals are looking for.</li>
            <li>It is a very dark purplish blue in the light.  </li>
            <li>You need to use 3-4 coats to get solid and dark coverage, but it is a very pretty color.</li>
            <li>It is okay, but the dark colors can be a little unforgiving with messups in application.  </li>
            <li>This polish is an exception to that general rule.  </li>
            <li>its fun...but certainly not for a a classy business professional.</li>
            <li>When I tried to add additional polish to the tips for full coverage, it just looked thick and gloppy and still pulled away from the edges.  </li>

            <li> Definitely a dark grape color!  </li>

            <li> In the sunlight it has an almost metallic depth--like expensive metallic car paint.</li>

            <li> I have been buying gelish for a couple of months. Decided to go with this for a fall color. Didn&#x27;t really like the purple. I thought it would be darker. It is okay, but the dark colors can be a little unforgiving with messups in application.  I will wear it again, but maybe mix it with something else.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have read the review posted on here.  This polish color is not the almost black it looks like.  It is most definitely purple and not very dark.</li>
            <li> This is a dark purple color. Grape would have to be the best color description I can give. It&#x27;s too bad its hard to tell what the true color of the polish will be until you actually put it on.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely color.  It is a very dark purplish blue in the light.  When it is darker, it looks close to black, but not so severe.  It is a rich beautiful color.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> As always, I love the Gelish polishes.  They wear so well I don&#x27;t use regular polish anymore.  I love this color and get so many compliments on it.  You can get a couple of different looks depending on how many coats you apply.  One thin coat will give a vibrant medium purple color.  I like it best with three thin coats.  It&#x27;s a very deep violet.  More on the blue side of purple than the pink side.  It is very glossy and rich looking.</li>
            <li> In the picture this polish appears to be a very dark blue, almost black. But out of the bottle it is a very deep dark purple. You need to use 3-4 coats to get solid and dark coverage, but it is a very pretty color. It&#x27;s a nice change from the traditional dark colors if you love the dark nail polishes like I do. I recommend it, but don&#x27;t expect it to be blue.</li>
            <li> I just finished my first DIY manicure with Harmony Gelish and I used Night Reflection with Vegas Nights. Night Reflection itself, in low light, looks like a deep purple (as in the swatch), but under a light its a very iridescent medium purple. (See posted picture.) This is a beautiful color and I don&#x27;t regret purchasing it at all. I added a coat of Vegas Nights on top, which is a very small multi-color glitter. For anyone looking to do this for their first time, here are my lessons learned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Take your time applying the foundation and the color will be WAY easier. Be sure to have good lighting for this step. This is REALLY important!&lt;br /&gt;2. Remember to cap the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The painting portion of the manicure, starting with the pH bond, took me about 45 minutes. I expect it to go quicker in the future. If you are going to try this, just be patient, and the results can be great! Also, I used the NOVA LED dryer and it works great!</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews on Gelish colors not matching the colors shown in the images, I found this color to be EXACTLY what I was looking for.  Definitely a dark grape color!  Perfect for fall!</li>
            <li> This purple is so dark that it almost looks black. It is a great undercoat for a glitter topper to brighten it up. I top it off with two coats of &amp;#34;Silver Sand.&amp;#34; This color, along with two coats of Silver Sand always elicit comments from people about how pretty my nails look.</li>
            <li> I have over 20 colors of Gelish, so it goes without saying that I think Gelish polish, in general, is great.  This polish is an exception to that general rule.  First -- the color is pretty, though a very, very dark bluish purple.  No complaints about the color.  What I didn&#x27;t like was the coverage.  When I put on this polish, it immediate pulled away from the tips of my nail and the cuticle area, making it appear that I didn&#x27;t paint all the way to the edges.  This is particularly troubling on the tips of the nail, where you want to have good coverage and you want to cap the tip with polish.  When I tried to add additional polish to the tips for full coverage, it just looked thick and gloppy and still pulled away from the edges.  I had to use three coats for coverage, and the polish kept pulling away from the tips and edges of my nail.  The finished effect was not very attractive.  I removed this color in less than a day and when I redid my manicure wit Tiger Blossom, [[ASIN:B005NI86XM Harmony Gelish U V Gel \\&quot;Tiger Blossom #01334\\&quot;]], I was reminded of the great coverage I usually get with Gelish.  Not sure if my botle was a dud or if this color is a dud -- either wasy as much as I love Gelish, I cannot recommend this color.</li>
            <li> My favorite Gelish color so far!!  Behaves well during application and wears brilliantly.</li>
            <li> I love all the Gelish products. They are good quality and are affordable. will continue to add to my color collection.</li>
            <li> Great winter color. Deep purple and the product stays on for 2 weeks(ish) if I take the time to do it right.</li>
            <li> I bought  this polish from lucky star gifts and it arrived promply and well wrapped.I put on 2 coats and it came out a beautiful deep purple, not too bright, which I liked.In the sunlight it has an almost metallic depth--like expensive metallic car paint.Love it!</li>
            <li> Nice deep dark purple. Looks dark, almost black, under standard indoor lighting and would contrast well with white or silver nail stamps or details. In the sunlight, it&#x27;s definitely a medium purple with a tiny bit of sparkle in it, but it is definitely not &amp;#34;glitter.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Really like the color but it peels off with 2 coats in several days and is light around the edge of the nail. I think Cnd is a better product.</li>
            <li> This is a deep violet, with a hint of shimmer. Not so forgiving if you&#x27;re doing this for the first time (like I did) but it&#x27;s a great color. Only needed two coats to achieve a perfectly smooth opaque color.  Not as dark as it shows in the swatch, in bright sunlight it&#x27;s a dark juicy purple.</li>
            <li> This color is a perfect deep purple.  In the light you can see the purple color, but in poor lighting it probably looks black.  Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several Harmony Gelish polishes and have been happy with all of them. They are good quality polishes that last the full two weeks. I find that three thin coats of color work best on my nails. This color in particular is a medium-deep royal purple with a red \\&quot;candy\\&quot; shimmer in it. It&#x27;s very pretty and I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I get so many comments everyday on this one! I love it, deep purple, not almost black, which is what it looked like on line, and at first I was disappointed, but I really love this one!</li>
            <li> This color is gorgeous!!  It&#x27;s a beautiful deep purple with just two coats.  This polish wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;streaky&amp;#34; as some of the other darker colors I&#x27;ve used.  And it could also be that I&#x27;ve learned to hold my hand down when applying the darker colors to prevent the polish from pooling at my cuticles. I added pics with the two coat application.  The next time I&#x27;ll try three coats to see how that changes the color.  But, I love it just the same.</li>
            <li> this shade is like nothing else!!! like it very much!!!! Looks perfect in the dark, and eveyone is asking me about this polish. Seems like it hooks the eye</li>
            <li> I L-O-V-E Gelish polish and this one is no different! Perfect color a deep purple almost black ( my daughters school colors are dark purple and gold sooo had to have!) I will post pics later, just awesome!</li>
            <li> the sample color online looks black, but this is a very deep dark purple. Takes about 3 coats to get proper coverage.</li>
            <li> I love gelish and have many many colors, however this appears far more purple than blue and is not as pictured.</li>
            <li> Love it. It stays great and won&#x27;t chip. Truly happy with this product. There&#x27;s not much else to say so thank you</li>
            <li> Darker than I thought.</li>
            <li> This is a great color. You need to put on at least two coats for it not to be transparent but it&#x27;s a great color purple!</li>
            <li> A little more &amp;#34;rockstar&amp;#34; purple than the pics lead you to believe. This is a very shiny, very &amp;#34;look at my purple nails&amp;#34; purple. I love it...its fun...but certainly not for a a classy business professional. Bella&#x27;s Vampire is the deep dark rich purple you professionals are looking for.</li>
            <li> I love this color nail polish. I was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be what I expected but it is perfect! Very deep purple color. I got tons of compliments on this.</li>
