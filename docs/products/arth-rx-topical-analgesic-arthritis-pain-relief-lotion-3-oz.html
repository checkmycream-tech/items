            <li>It does not work very well.</li>
            <li>After showering, I applied it again, and was feeling so much</li>
            <li>had an event in which much walking was required that afternoon.</li>
            <li>Rolled a couple of layers which was WAY TOO MUCH.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>

            <li> Exactly what was expected, service for this product was 5 star</li>
            <li> However, there are a few heat sensitive individuals who simply cannot tolerate it.  </li>
            <li> As long as people read and follow the directions they will recieve long lasting pain relief.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take long to take affect either - 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li> If you are new to the product, have some rubbing alcohol on hand,(it will remove it if you are intolerant) and just test a small area before application.</li>
            <li> works extremely well for back and knee pain</li>
            <li> Only down side is when you get the area wet it does burn, but the burn also helps to reduce pain.</li>
            <li> it takes only a few minutes to penetrate and bring relief.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I fell a few days after I got the medicine and hurt my left leg and foot.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using it for years after trying other analgesics and</li>
            <li> I have tried other pain relievers and they don&#x27;t compare.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the experience that other people had with the Arth-rx.</li>
            <li> The only problem is it burns if put on to thick.  </li>
            <li> you are not able to go into the sun, very long with it on, and I like to garden.</li>
            <li> A few applications of Arth-rx helped relieve my hand pain due to arthritis.    </li>
            <li> After a few days we switched to Mineral Ice and it did help.</li>
            <li> I ran out of arth-RX a few years ago and could not find it at any retailer so my son found it for me on your web site and ordered some for me.</li>
            <li> As the other reviewer, I find it difficult to find in local stores.  </li>
            <li> : 6/15/14&lt;br /&gt;I twisted my ankle on the 14th, and by that night, could barely walk on that foot.</li>
            <li> will never be without at least one bottle of this in my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ( at least that is what I hear ) with arthritis inflammation crisis.</li>
            <li> It works fast and doesn&#x27;t have a nasty scent.</li>
            <li> It appears like a chemical burn or a very bad sunburn on his back within minutes after applying.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> this was a replacement for my almost empty,one great stuff,been using it for yrs,</li>
            <li> husband like this very much, easy to use, no smell, doesn&#x27;t get onto clothing and helps a lot with arthritic pain in knees ands hands!  It does feel burny at first but not terribly and doesn&#x27;t stop him using it with the knowledge, it will help him.&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s 96.</li>
            <li> My husband  finds this  to be  the only relief  for  his  neuropthy pain  in his  feet .</li>
            <li> I have used this product since having discovered it in 1998. As the other reviewer, I find it difficult to find in local stores.  I have both fibromyalgia and degenerative arthritis. This product, by far, is the most successful in giving me some relief when my pain is intolerable.  Most individuals with whom I have shared it have been thrilled.  However, there are a few heat sensitive individuals who simply cannot tolerate it.  If you are new to the product, have some rubbing alcohol on hand,(it will remove it if you are intolerant) and just test a small area before application. Also, don&#x27;t be surprised when it \\&quot;heats up\\&quot; again when you shower.  It&#x27;s one of its&#x27; nice properties. The other nice attribute is the roll-on administration is much easier if you have to apply it to yourself.</li>
            <li> I was sent expired product. It does not work very well. I will not order this again.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works on knee pain! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A few applications of Arth-rx helped relieve my hand pain due to arthritis.    It was great to apply lotion with the built in applicator and not have to touch the lotion.</li>
            <li> Works well. Wish the smell wasn&#x27;t baby powder.</li>
            <li> I first used this product for tendonitis in my elbows years ago. It helped greatly.&lt;br /&gt; I am now using it to prevent leg cramps at night, and it is a fail-safe preventative for me. If I forget to use it before going to bed, and get a cramp...it takes only a few minutes to penetrate and bring relief.&lt;br /&gt;One caution...when you first use it, it does get really warm, so be skimpy in the amount you roll on. You will &#x27;grow into&#x27; the heat the more you use it, and it doesn&#x27;t feel so warm after a while.&lt;br /&gt;I believe using it regularly, as for arthritis pain, it has a cumulative effect and the pain lessens over time.&lt;br /&gt;I will never be without at least one bottle of this in my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: 6/15/14&lt;br /&gt;I twisted my ankle on the 14th, and by that night, could barely walk on that foot. I applied the magic, but the pain was still intense during the night, and and also in the morning. After showering, I applied it again, and was feeling so much better!&lt;br /&gt;We had an event in which much walking was required that afternoon. I felt fine, and am doing great today!!&lt;br /&gt;This is a new use for me, and I am literally jumping with joy!&lt;br /&gt;This really is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> All I can say that my mom loves this lotion. It helps her ( at least that is what I hear ) with arthritis inflammation crisis. I had to buy more and also bought one for my sister&#x27;s-in-law mother.</li>
            <li> We have been using this for years, it is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Arth Rx is the best product for muscle aches.  I&#x27;m always surprised they don&#x27;t have commercials to let people how how fabulous the product is.  My husband has been using it for years after trying other analgesics and Arth Rx works the best.  I was happy to find it on Amazon since it&#x27;s hard to find in drugstores and when you do find the one or two on the shelf they&#x27;re beyond their expiration date.  We used them anyway, we love this product so much.  I recommend it to anyone with joint, neck or back pain.  It works fast and doesn&#x27;t have a nasty scent.</li>
            <li> Arth-rx really helps the pain in my right hand.  I have tried other pain relievers and they don&#x27;t compare.  I like the fact that it is a roll-on also.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for back pain.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the experience that other people had with the Arth-rx. I fell a few days after I got the medicine and hurt my left leg and foot. After a trip to the ER we tried Arth-rx. I had sprained my ankle and foot. My husband rubbed Arth-rx all over my leg and foot and it didn&#x27;t seem to help with the pain and soreness. After a few days we switched to Mineral Ice and it did help. I ordered the Arth-rx from Amazon and got it in 2 days. Very good service from them. I get books from Amazon a lot for my Kindle and love the service.</li>
            <li> Think answer to years of trial @ error to releave shoulder arthritis &amp; tendinitis pains.</li>
            <li> this is the only thing that stops the pain in my back. I carry one with me at all times.</li>
            <li> I have been using arth-RX ever sence it was released about 15 years ago. I always tell any one that is in pain to try it and if they don&#x27;t get relief from it that I will buy it from them. As of today no one has taken me up on this offer.   I ran out of arth-RX a few years ago and could not find it at any retailer so my son found it for me on your web site and ordered some for me. As long as people read and follow the directions they will recieve long lasting pain relief.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. However, it does burn, especially when the sun shines on the area it was applied.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was expected, service for this product was 5 star</li>
            <li> wasnt not what i wanted</li>
            <li> It helps to reduce arthritis pain but one has to reapply.</li>
            <li> Just do not care for it. It seems to heat the skin, but not go into the muscles.&lt;br /&gt;  Pl use you are not able to go into the sun, very long with it on, and I like to garden.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from nerve damage, which no topical product has been able to relieve the severe pain. If only........</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and takes away the pain right away.  The only problem is it burns if put on to thick.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It is great for aches and pains,and keeps me off the pain pills. Recommended by me.</li>
            <li> works extremely well for back and knee pain</li>
            <li> Does reduce the pain on contact. Not via heat. Have no idea how, but it does work. Doesn&#x27;t take long to take affect either - 1-2 minutes. Only down side is when you get the area wet it does burn, but the burn also helps to reduce pain. Absolutely no medicine smell, actually smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> Did a good job of giving temporary relief.</li>
            <li> Arth-RX is the best topical pain reliever on the market; but, a caveat:  be careful where you use it.  You will suffer if you put it on sensitive areas, whatever your sensitive areas are.</li>
            <li> Lot the heating properties to this lotion!  Rub it on sore muscles and the area heats up and the pain goes right away.  It can be quite hot, so don&#x27;t apply too much until you see how it works for you.  Don&#x27;t get any on your hands and touch elsewhere!</li>
            <li> Not getting the warm comfort described in the other reviews.  I got one for my 89 year old mom, too.  She likes it and finds it easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Just got it this afternoon and applied it on my husband&#x27;s back.  Rolled a couple of layers which was WAY TOO MUCH.  Suggest to just apply first to a small area before applying all over the body.  It appears like a chemical burn or a very bad sunburn on his back within minutes after applying.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my wife.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used for pain in my neck. I highly recommend this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Marcilionis</li>
