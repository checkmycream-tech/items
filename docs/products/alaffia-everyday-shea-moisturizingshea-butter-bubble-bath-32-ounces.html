            <li>It smells nice and makes a lot of bubbles!</li>
            <li>the best of the bunch is Aura Cacia which produced bubbles to the top of tub.</li>
            <li>This smells good, with a somewhat medicinal soothing, relaxing odor.  </li>
            <li>I chose the produce that included free shipping, so it was a very good deal.</li>
            <li>outstanding and great price.</li>

            <li>This is a nice smelling bubble bath.</li>
            <li>It makes large amounts of bubbles and seems to be a very good value for the price.</li>
            <li>I love to fill a warm tub and soak in both the smell and the bubbles.</li>
            <li>Very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I really love any scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering and floral/fake like most kids washes and bubble baths.  </li>
            <li>, she loves it too:)</li>
            <li>As a man who takes a daily bubble bath, this product is totally awesome.</li>
            <li>My daughters love this bubble bath.</li>
            <li>Most all natural bubbles do not give you a good amount of bubbles.  </li>
            <li>Lightly scented, and doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li>This smelled great and produced lots of bubbles that lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>The intoxicating smell makes the bathing process that much better and after my bath, I&#x27;m ready to conquer the world!</li>
            <li>All for a great price for such a large quantity.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s natural and is a fair-trade product.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast!</li>
            <li>which is why I buy bubble bath in the first place.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other natural bath bubbles, and this is really my favorite because two cap fulls does the trick.</li>
            <li>Odd scent, but very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I will say it smells very much like eucalyptus and mint, and not as much like the vanilla or citrus.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and will definitely make this a regular product beside my tub.</li>
            <li>The scent is soft and not at all heavy, pleasant.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to make lots of bubbles.</li>
            <li>Really bubbly - it doesn&#x27;t take much at all to get the bubbles going</li>
            <li>Very relaxing bath.</li>
            <li>but I still really like it....</li>
            <li>When I ran the hot water again (after it cooled down), even more bubbles popped up.</li>
            <li>This is the only bubble bath my child uses no bad ingredients</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and would buy again.</li>
            <li>You get a large amount of frothy bubbles that will last throughout your bath.</li>
            <li>No complaints from my 3 year old daughter</li>
            <li>The bubbles are thick and last through a nice long period for relaxation.  </li>

            <li> This is the only bubble bath my child uses no bad ingredients</li>
            <li> Love this bubble bath! It smells nice and makes a lot of bubbles!</li>
            <li> Great product. Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> The best and creamiest bubbles and it smells great too. All for a great price for such a large quantity.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. A small amount produces a lot of bubbles! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice smelling bubble bath. It doesn&#x27;t take much to make lots of bubbles. The scent works well for men, women and children. I recommend this bubble bath. It arrived quickly and was well packaged. I&#x27;ll buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Really bubbly - it doesn&#x27;t take much at all to get the bubbles going and they last a long time. Terrific smell too!!!</li>
            <li> Lots of bubbles here.  Very relaxing bath.</li>
            <li> We have previously used the Alaffia Lavender/Lemon scent and I thought I would give this one a try.  Its defintely different from the Lavender but I still really like it....I really love any scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering and floral/fake like most kids washes and bubble baths.  I will say it smells very much like eucalyptus and mint, and not as much like the vanilla or citrus.  This big bottle lasts us forever; a little goes a long way!  No complaints from my 3 year old daughter, she loves it too:)</li>

            <li> Most all natural bubbles do not give you a good amount of bubbles.  This smelled great and produced lots of bubbles that lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Alaffia does nor have not much bubble action. I ordered 3 or 4 brands to try with epsom salt, the best of the bunch is Aura Cacia which produced bubbles to the top of tub. When I ran the hot water again (after it cooled down), even more bubbles popped up.</li>
            <li> This smells good, with a somewhat medicinal soothing, relaxing odor.  But it is not very viscous and takes a lot to create any bubbles at all - which is why I buy bubble bath in the first place.  I love to fill a warm tub and soak in both the smell and the bubbles. I will continue to search for the one bubble bath that simply thrills me.  This isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Odd scent, but very refreshing. A little goes a long way, and the bubbles stay firm for a long soak.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other natural bath bubbles, and this is really my favorite because two cap fulls does the trick. You get a large amount of frothy bubbles that will last throughout your bath. It does not leave a residue. I am not 100% about the smell.</li>
            <li> Very good for sensitive skin. Lightly scented, and doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li> outstanding and great price.</li>

            <li> This bubble bath makes great bubbles and I love that it&#x27;s natural and is a fair-trade product. All in all, it&#x27;s a great value for a really great product and I will continue buying it for my kids. I like the scent, as well.</li>
            <li> My daughters love this bubble bath. It makes large amounts of bubbles and seems to be a very good value for the price. I chose the produce that included free shipping, so it was a very good deal. Highly recommend and would buy again.</li>
