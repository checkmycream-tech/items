            <li>I think its great because it makes her happy</li>
            <li>Ok but not the best out there-</li>
            <li>Sometimes you have to give a good shake before application because of separation, but otherwise great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a very happy consumer and try to pass along my good experience to others in case they are on the fence about buying something. :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!! :-)</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and because I am middle-aged and I have lost a fair amount of weight</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Loved this.</li>
            <li>As I would expect from Smashbox, the primer itself is smooth and makes your skin feel awesome, almost like a serum.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the reviews led me to believe.</li>
            <li>I LOVED IT</li>
            <li>I can put over my moisturizers and my face looks good.</li>
            <li>Does a fantastic job of covering up redness, as well as being an excellent primer.</li>
            <li>Oftentimes I will just set this with a translucent powder and am good to go.</li>
            <li>Who says money can&#x27;t buy happiness?</li>
            <li>but I received so many compliments on how good I looked!</li>
            <li>This primer goes on very smoothly and allows make up and foundation to go on beautifully and stay on longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is wonderful to help even out skin tones and give a fresh underlay for foundation.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>My favorite primer!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Give your face a couple minutes after you apply this (without touching it!), and you will see a reduction in redness.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>There are better primers out there without the price tag!</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, but effective.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think this covered any of the redness on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I feel I have a nice complexion</li>
            <li>Really nice product.</li>
            <li>It does however make my face have a nice silky feel to it after I have applied it.</li>
            <li>The texture and feel of the cream is nice-</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t it will slide all over your face and then the redness will not be as effectively covered.</li>
            <li>Nice primer.  </li>
            <li>This is the best primer I have tried so far!</li>
            <li>So far I am really happy about this buy!</li>
            <li>The product has a very smooth, lightweight feel.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference even before applying foundation and after was even more amazing.</li>
            <li>I WAS SO PLEASED.  </li>
            <li>I really love the way it works for me.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>It gets rid of most of the red on my face, and once I apply foundation, my skin looks flawless.</li>
            <li>I love love love this primer.</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>My makeup looks better and stays on longer when I use this primer.</li>
            <li>I wish I could find some redeeming quality about this lotion, but I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Love the smoothness.</li>
            <li>so when looking for more, I came across this product.  </li>
            <li>It sounded perfect for the red in my complexion.  </li>
            <li>and I have since ordered the yellow cream and, as before, I am very happy with that.</li>
            <li>...makes your face look nice and smooth...</li>
            <li>make up savy...which makes it all that much better...</li>
            <li>nicely provides a smooth color improved matte finish.  </li>
            <li>Love the way this makes your skin velvety smooth!</li>
            <li>I just love this smashbox product.  </li>
            <li>Love this primer.  </li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.will order again</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love Smashbox products and hoped it would do the trick.  </li>
            <li>I bought a &amp;#34;green stick&amp;#34; at the local beauty supply shop for $6.99 that works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it takes the redness out of my cheeks better than any make up or Rosacea product I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>So impressed I am back to splurge again.</li>
            <li>I love this primer.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not used primer before so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. . .  </li>
            <li>And for the price, I expect more, much more from this product.</li>
            <li>It hides the redness on my face and the price was better on line than in the store.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s certainly better than nothing.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Anyone with with redness in their skin will LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I find a &amp;#34;patting&amp;#34; approach works better than a &amp;#34;rubbing&amp;#34; approach.</li>
            <li>Used to buy this thru Sephora but got better pricing thru Amazon.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I have been using this smash box product for 2 years and love it.</li>
            <li>First product i have found that successfully hides redness before applying my foundation.</li>
            <li>love the feel as it&#x27;s applied to my face</li>
            <li>and since I have tried pretty much everything else on the market that has never worked, but this stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li>I really notice a difference in my skin&#x27;s redness, and the product makes my skin feel amazing!  </li>
            <li>literally worth every dime!!</li>
            <li>This product really makes your makeup look great and smooth all day.</li>
            <li>It has a very smooth texture and feels light on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product, it did just as expected.</li>
            <li>I think it will be very easy to use it up quickly from a squeeze tube.</li>
            <li>I love how it goes on so easy and smooth</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li>and you will see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>but I still had fantastic redness removal all over my face.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin perfectly smooth for you to apply foundation, but I would not recommend applying it under your eyes.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I bought a travel size for $17.  </li>
            <li>Helps with my ruddy complexion and keeps the makeup smooth.</li>
            <li>The primer does well at correcting red spots and feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li>Feels like product is not even on- lightweight and smooth.</li>
            <li>It helps with the redness in my face and leaves my face feeling silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice primer but doesn&#x27;t cover much.</li>
            <li>Just a fabulous, fabulous product.</li>
            <li>It provides a smooth even finish to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Foundation goes  on smoothly after the primer, and helps to eliminate streaks of foundation.</li>
            <li>; it goes on smooth but does not help hide any redness.  </li>
            <li>It also lets the foundation glide on smoothly.</li>
            <li>smooth primer to reduce redness.</li>
            <li>Yes, it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>and it looks better, more even, and the overall look is more</li>
            <li>I sometimes don&#x27;t even bother with my normal foundation as it evens out the complexion nicely.  </li>
            <li>and I was so excited when I read this temporarily got rid of the redness before you put your makeup on.</li>
            <li>In fact, I have noticed that when I used this my face is less oily throughout the day (which is something I did not anticipate but was a pleasant surprise!).</li>
            <li>Love this product use this prior to ordering from amazon it was cost effective on amazon</li>
            <li>Very light and effortless to put on, and then foundation goes on really well over it.</li>
            <li>I have used smashbox&#x27;s regular photo finish primer for years, and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Loreal BB cream and loved it for covering red in my face.</li>
            <li>SOOOOO MUCH :)</li>
            <li>If it really helps reduce redness and doesn&#x27;t break me out (it&#x27;s SPF free, thankfully - SPF &#x3D; breakout city for me!)</li>
            <li>At 47, I can wear just the Photo Finish alone on days I don&#x27;t want to do full make-up.</li>
            <li>Yes, it has a nice soft finish.</li>
            <li>While it was always fine, it didn&#x27;t have that seamless, airbrushed quality that I saw on so many and always wanted.</li>
            <li>I am giving it 4 stars because I thought it would offer better coverage for red areas, but I still love the stuff.  </li>
            <li>It helps tremendously.</li>
            <li>but it lessens it, and makes the foundation more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone out frequently just using it and a light powder.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other primers that work more effectively.</li>
            <li>after a long day and well into the evening, it still feels good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for years, it does a great job of toning down my ruddy face and smoothing out the lines and pores.</li>
            <li>My sister came over later in the day and she immediately noticed how nice my mothers skin looked not knowing we had done anything special to make it that way.</li>
            <li>However, this primer evens out my skin tone really nicely, making any blotchy areas less noticeable, and it does not make me look any more sallow.  </li>
            <li>All it does is make my skin smooth, but as for getting me that photo ready finish, it doesn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s highway robbery what they charge for it, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I then tried to think of it just as a primer, but didn&#x27;t find it useful as that either.  </li>
            <li>it really is worth every dime</li>
            <li>I love how soft &amp; smooth my skin feels after applying &amp; it really helps to neutralize the redness.</li>
            <li>one thing I&#x27;d suggest doing (if you can) is go to a local Sephora and buy something where you may be able to get a free sample of it and try it before you buy it.  </li>
            <li>It just absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li>So far, it mostly evens out my skin tones.</li>
            <li>I ordered the product early and did many &amp;#34;mock&amp;#34; trials of make up and photos.</li>
            <li>, then it&#x27;s worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best product I know of to get rid of redness of all kinds - from acne to broken blood vessels.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s something I can do for her that brings a smile on her face -</li>
            <li>I have mild redness, mostly from use of retin-a.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictures are taken in the same location, 3 minutes apart.</li>
            <li>This primer has made a huge difference in the appearance of my skin and it helps my makeup to go on smoothly and last longer.</li>
            <li>It makes a great base, made my skin feel so so smooth, didn&#x27;t make me break out, makes foundation go on flawlessly over dry patchy skin.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need to use very much to get the benefits.</li>
            <li>AT FIRST</li>
            <li>Tried it on  my eye lids before a powder shadow and even though the shadow doesn&#x27;t last quite all day, it is better than before.  </li>
            <li>One word of caution about applying makeup over this primer: be gentle!</li>
            <li>knew exactly what i was getting.  </li>
            <li>If you use too much, you will start to get the greenish look to your skin!</li>
            <li>Be aware -</li>
            <li>Cuts down on redness (I have rosacea) and makes foundation go on much more smoothly.</li>
            <li>If I put a powder foundation over the primer the marks pretty much disappear.</li>
            <li>Within a week of using this product, the pump top separated from the long tube that stands in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Even without putting anything ontop of it it certainly improves the appearance of fine lines and overall imperfections.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much for makeup , and I certainly don&#x27;t spend a lot when I do.</li>
            <li>AND I REALLY LIKE</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>If it did, it was very minute.  </li>
            <li>Have reasonable</li>
            <li>I have a lot of redness in my skin, and this did absolutely nothing to even it out.  </li>
            <li>I still had to use just as much makeup as I did before to even out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Really evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It really minimizes the redness of my face.  </li>
            <li>Very slippery and felt like it helped to move my powder around instead of keeping it in place.</li>
            <li>very talc-y</li>
            <li>This is not something to &amp;#34;rub in,&amp;#34; but to smooth onto the face and blend out as necessary.</li>
            <li>Pat don&#x27;t drag it across your face and you&#x27;ll have better results.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t used this primer-it really works.</li>
            <li>This has worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>It really made a difference in reducing the amount of redness and evening out her skintone.</li>
            <li>The green tint counteracts the redness in my skin and leaves a nice even tone.</li>
            <li>It is green, and blends in nicely-</li>
            <li>Wow! !!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin on my face to the point that some products make me break out or in some cases even cause blistering from allergic reactions and this product is very gentle and does not cause me to breakout.  </li>
            <li>Considering how much this product costs, and the endorsement it got from the sales assistant at Sephora, I had really high hopes.</li>
            <li>The BB cream hands down works better than this.</li>
            <li>I was previously using a liquid foundation, but was able to switch to a lightweight powder when using this primer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Plus I&#x27;ve used other green-tinted concealers before and this product has a more natural look to it.</li>
            <li>just add a little at a time , so it will absorb and then add more if needed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>my skin is getting old and saggy and I&#x27;m not likin&#x27; it much).  </li>
            <li>ALSO I HAVEN&#x27;T HAD AN OUTBREAK WHICH I NORMALLY DO</li>
            <li>That way, if something happens, I can confront a sales associate and at least get some kind of response.  </li>
            <li>but there are several places on my face where I sometimes get a strong, high red coloration.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live with out it</li>
            <li>so I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I wrote to the seller to ask for a new pump.  </li>
            <li>This is true for makeup generally speaking, especially with setting products (e.g., primers and/or foundations) with powder.</li>
            <li>It takes away those red spots I get and then makes it much easier to put on foundation which will stay on a lot longer!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and I love it.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the price on amazon seems to be pretty consistent with prices at other retailers (e.g., Ulta).</li>
            <li>I have a ruddy complexion and this covers the red nicely as well as making a good all day base for my makeup.  </li>
            <li>After that when I apply my foundation, the foundation goes on so smoothly that I end up using much less of it</li>
            <li>like the way it feels and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I have developed quite the case of rosacea and have tried lots of things that didn&#x27;t work well for me like make-ups and creams that were supposed to &#x27;calm&#x27; your skin (Clinique) but this Smashbox product really helped hide my red cheeks and nose, especially combined with my regular make-up.</li>
            <li>It is light to apply too, not greasy or heavy which I like.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s at least a week or more.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that I ended up with some itchiness on my face that I didn&#x27;t have before, and the itchiness still lasted a couple of days after I had run out of the primer, so sensitive skin people, beware.  </li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT LEAVES SKIN SOFT EVENS</li>
            <li>Works really well at getting the red out of my skin.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW.</li>
            <li>Like many women mistakenly do early on in their makeup using years, I applied foundation straight out of it&#x27;s bottle, or worse, compact.</li>
            <li>The powder alone would not have been sufficient,  but with this primer,  I feel completely made up, but not at all caked over...</li>
            <li>green tinge definitely deals with the redness in my face better -</li>
            <li>I have now moved on to MAC and instead of a green primer I am trying yellow which seems to be working better.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use this every day as I don&#x27;t wear full makeup every day, so that travel size lasted me a year and a half.  </li>
            <li>Sure, a little goes a long way if you know how to apply it correctly.</li>
            <li>Because my skin is somewhat olive/sallow to begin with, I was not sure a green primer would be a good idea.  </li>
            <li>First realize that my mother is about as cheap as they come, refusing to even replace drug store mascara long after it has mostly dried out because \\&quot;it still has some left in it\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra effort to squeeze it out and eventually cut the tube open to get the last of it.</li>
            <li>It can feel a little oily on the skin, but I have super oily skin</li>
            <li>When I bought my BareMinerals at my local Sephora a couple of weeks ago, I got a small free sample of something, and this is what I chose.  </li>
            <li>I naturally have a red nose &amp; cheeks</li>
            <li>so the fact she spent $40 on one ounce of anything is a testament to how much she loves it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for dry to normal skin.</li>
            <li>For the price I also had high expectations which makes me think the brand name of &amp;#34;Smashbox&amp;#34; is charging for it&#x27;s name and not consistently high quality products.</li>
            <li>Had hopes that this would help out my slight redness on my cheeks and maybe help out with my large pores.</li>
            <li>I am only wearing the primer in the second picture, no other makeup.</li>
            <li>In my case, one full pump of liquid foundation on  a paper plate (easier and than a stainless stell makeup palette) is mixed with a small amount of Smashbox&#x27;s green Photo Finish primer.</li>
            <li>It took away the red to give me a clean even slate, there was a little pink still on my nose and around my nostrils</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewer in that it does not cover any very red areas, even when I have tried to cover that area more thickly.  </li>
            <li>with my previous primer I didn&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would help cover up the redness from the breakouts until my skin was clear again - and I was hoping it would make it possible that all I really needed to wear was this and very little foundation.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the original smashbox primer for years; recently, having developed rosesea, I decided to try out the green tinted one as green counteracts red tones.</li>

            <li> I think its great because it makes her happy</li>
            <li> Ok but not the best out there-</li>
            <li> Sometimes you have to give a good shake before application because of separation, but otherwise great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a very happy consumer and try to pass along my good experience to others in case they are on the fence about buying something. :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!! :-)</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and because I am middle-aged and I have lost a fair amount of weight</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> Loved this.</li>
            <li> As I would expect from Smashbox, the primer itself is smooth and makes your skin feel awesome, almost like a serum.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the reviews led me to believe.</li>
            <li> I LOVED IT</li>
            <li> I can put over my moisturizers and my face looks good.</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job of covering up redness, as well as being an excellent primer.</li>
            <li> Oftentimes I will just set this with a translucent powder and am good to go.</li>
            <li> Who says money can&#x27;t buy happiness?</li>
            <li> but I received so many compliments on how good I looked!</li>
            <li> This primer goes on very smoothly and allows make up and foundation to go on beautifully and stay on longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is wonderful to help even out skin tones and give a fresh underlay for foundation.</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> My favorite primer!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Give your face a couple minutes after you apply this (without touching it!), and you will see a reduction in redness.</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this!  </li>
            <li> There are better primers out there without the price tag!</li>
            <li> It is lightweight, but effective.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think this covered any of the redness on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I feel I have a nice complexion</li>
            <li> Really nice product.</li>
            <li> It does however make my face have a nice silky feel to it after I have applied it.</li>
            <li> The texture and feel of the cream is nice-</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t it will slide all over your face and then the redness will not be as effectively covered.</li>
            <li> Nice primer.  </li>
            <li> This is the best primer I have tried so far!</li>
            <li> So far I am really happy about this buy!</li>
            <li> The product has a very smooth, lightweight feel.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference even before applying foundation and after was even more amazing.</li>
            <li> I WAS SO PLEASED.  </li>
            <li> I really love the way it works for me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> It gets rid of most of the red on my face, and once I apply foundation, my skin looks flawless.</li>
            <li> I love love love this primer.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> My makeup looks better and stays on longer when I use this primer.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find some redeeming quality about this lotion, but I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love the smoothness.</li>
            <li> so when looking for more, I came across this product.  </li>
            <li> It sounded perfect for the red in my complexion.  </li>
            <li> and I have since ordered the yellow cream and, as before, I am very happy with that.</li>
            <li> ...makes your face look nice and smooth...</li>
            <li> make up savy...which makes it all that much better...</li>
            <li> nicely provides a smooth color improved matte finish.  </li>
            <li> Love the way this makes your skin velvety smooth!</li>
            <li> I just love this smashbox product.  </li>
            <li> Love this primer.  </li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.will order again</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love Smashbox products and hoped it would do the trick.  </li>
            <li> I bought a &amp;#34;green stick&amp;#34; at the local beauty supply shop for $6.99 that works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I love this product because it takes the redness out of my cheeks better than any make up or Rosacea product I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> So impressed I am back to splurge again.</li>
            <li> I love this primer.</li>
            <li> &amp; I love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used primer before so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. . .  </li>
            <li> And for the price, I expect more, much more from this product.</li>
            <li> It hides the redness on my face and the price was better on line than in the store.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s certainly better than nothing.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Anyone with with redness in their skin will LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> I find a &amp;#34;patting&amp;#34; approach works better than a &amp;#34;rubbing&amp;#34; approach.</li>
            <li> Used to buy this thru Sephora but got better pricing thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I have been using this smash box product for 2 years and love it.</li>
            <li> First product i have found that successfully hides redness before applying my foundation.</li>
            <li> love the feel as it&#x27;s applied to my face</li>
            <li> and since I have tried pretty much everything else on the market that has never worked, but this stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> I really notice a difference in my skin&#x27;s redness, and the product makes my skin feel amazing!  </li>
            <li> literally worth every dime!!</li>
            <li> This product really makes your makeup look great and smooth all day.</li>
            <li> It has a very smooth texture and feels light on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product, it did just as expected.</li>
            <li> I think it will be very easy to use it up quickly from a squeeze tube.</li>
            <li> I love how it goes on so easy and smooth</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li> and you will see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> but I still had fantastic redness removal all over my face.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin perfectly smooth for you to apply foundation, but I would not recommend applying it under your eyes.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I bought a travel size for $17.  </li>
            <li> Helps with my ruddy complexion and keeps the makeup smooth.</li>
            <li> The primer does well at correcting red spots and feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li> Feels like product is not even on- lightweight and smooth.</li>
            <li> It helps with the redness in my face and leaves my face feeling silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice primer but doesn&#x27;t cover much.</li>
            <li> Just a fabulous, fabulous product.</li>
            <li> It provides a smooth even finish to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Foundation goes  on smoothly after the primer, and helps to eliminate streaks of foundation.</li>
            <li> ; it goes on smooth but does not help hide any redness.  </li>
            <li> It also lets the foundation glide on smoothly.</li>
            <li> smooth primer to reduce redness.</li>
            <li> Yes, it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li> and it looks better, more even, and the overall look is more</li>
            <li> I sometimes don&#x27;t even bother with my normal foundation as it evens out the complexion nicely.  </li>
            <li> and I was so excited when I read this temporarily got rid of the redness before you put your makeup on.</li>
            <li> In fact, I have noticed that when I used this my face is less oily throughout the day (which is something I did not anticipate but was a pleasant surprise!).</li>
            <li> Love this product use this prior to ordering from amazon it was cost effective on amazon</li>
            <li> Very light and effortless to put on, and then foundation goes on really well over it.</li>
            <li> I have used smashbox&#x27;s regular photo finish primer for years, and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Loreal BB cream and loved it for covering red in my face.</li>
            <li> SOOOOO MUCH :)</li>
            <li> If it really helps reduce redness and doesn&#x27;t break me out (it&#x27;s SPF free, thankfully - SPF &#x3D; breakout city for me!)</li>
            <li> At 47, I can wear just the Photo Finish alone on days I don&#x27;t want to do full make-up.</li>
            <li> Yes, it has a nice soft finish.</li>
            <li> While it was always fine, it didn&#x27;t have that seamless, airbrushed quality that I saw on so many and always wanted.</li>
            <li> I am giving it 4 stars because I thought it would offer better coverage for red areas, but I still love the stuff.  </li>
            <li> It helps tremendously.</li>
            <li> but it lessens it, and makes the foundation more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone out frequently just using it and a light powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other primers that work more effectively.</li>
            <li> after a long day and well into the evening, it still feels good on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for years, it does a great job of toning down my ruddy face and smoothing out the lines and pores.</li>
            <li> My sister came over later in the day and she immediately noticed how nice my mothers skin looked not knowing we had done anything special to make it that way.</li>
            <li> However, this primer evens out my skin tone really nicely, making any blotchy areas less noticeable, and it does not make me look any more sallow.  </li>
            <li> All it does is make my skin smooth, but as for getting me that photo ready finish, it doesn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s highway robbery what they charge for it, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I then tried to think of it just as a primer, but didn&#x27;t find it useful as that either.  </li>
            <li> it really is worth every dime</li>
            <li> I love how soft &amp; smooth my skin feels after applying &amp; it really helps to neutralize the redness.</li>
            <li> one thing I&#x27;d suggest doing (if you can) is go to a local Sephora and buy something where you may be able to get a free sample of it and try it before you buy it.  </li>
            <li> It just absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li> So far, it mostly evens out my skin tones.</li>
            <li> I ordered the product early and did many &amp;#34;mock&amp;#34; trials of make up and photos.</li>
            <li> , then it&#x27;s worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best product I know of to get rid of redness of all kinds - from acne to broken blood vessels.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s something I can do for her that brings a smile on her face -</li>
            <li> I have mild redness, mostly from use of retin-a.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictures are taken in the same location, 3 minutes apart.</li>
            <li> This primer has made a huge difference in the appearance of my skin and it helps my makeup to go on smoothly and last longer.</li>
            <li> It makes a great base, made my skin feel so so smooth, didn&#x27;t make me break out, makes foundation go on flawlessly over dry patchy skin.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need to use very much to get the benefits.</li>
            <li> AT FIRST</li>
            <li> Tried it on  my eye lids before a powder shadow and even though the shadow doesn&#x27;t last quite all day, it is better than before.  </li>
            <li> One word of caution about applying makeup over this primer: be gentle!</li>
            <li> knew exactly what i was getting.  </li>
            <li> If you use too much, you will start to get the greenish look to your skin!</li>
            <li> Be aware -</li>
            <li> Cuts down on redness (I have rosacea) and makes foundation go on much more smoothly.</li>
            <li> If I put a powder foundation over the primer the marks pretty much disappear.</li>
            <li> Within a week of using this product, the pump top separated from the long tube that stands in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Even without putting anything ontop of it it certainly improves the appearance of fine lines and overall imperfections.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much for makeup , and I certainly don&#x27;t spend a lot when I do.</li>
            <li> AND I REALLY LIKE</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> If it did, it was very minute.  </li>
            <li> Have reasonable</li>
            <li> I have a lot of redness in my skin, and this did absolutely nothing to even it out.  </li>
            <li> I still had to use just as much makeup as I did before to even out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Really evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It really minimizes the redness of my face.  </li>
            <li> Very slippery and felt like it helped to move my powder around instead of keeping it in place.</li>
            <li> very talc-y</li>
            <li> This is not something to &amp;#34;rub in,&amp;#34; but to smooth onto the face and blend out as necessary.</li>
            <li> Pat don&#x27;t drag it across your face and you&#x27;ll have better results.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t used this primer-it really works.</li>
            <li> This has worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> It really made a difference in reducing the amount of redness and evening out her skintone.</li>
            <li> The green tint counteracts the redness in my skin and leaves a nice even tone.</li>
            <li> It is green, and blends in nicely-</li>
            <li> Wow! !!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my face to the point that some products make me break out or in some cases even cause blistering from allergic reactions and this product is very gentle and does not cause me to breakout.  </li>
            <li> Considering how much this product costs, and the endorsement it got from the sales assistant at Sephora, I had really high hopes.</li>
            <li> The BB cream hands down works better than this.</li>
            <li> I was previously using a liquid foundation, but was able to switch to a lightweight powder when using this primer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Plus I&#x27;ve used other green-tinted concealers before and this product has a more natural look to it.</li>
            <li> just add a little at a time , so it will absorb and then add more if needed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> my skin is getting old and saggy and I&#x27;m not likin&#x27; it much).  </li>
            <li> ALSO I HAVEN&#x27;T HAD AN OUTBREAK WHICH I NORMALLY DO</li>
            <li> That way, if something happens, I can confront a sales associate and at least get some kind of response.  </li>
            <li> but there are several places on my face where I sometimes get a strong, high red coloration.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live with out it</li>
            <li> so I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> In the meantime, I wrote to the seller to ask for a new pump.  </li>
            <li> This is true for makeup generally speaking, especially with setting products (e.g., primers and/or foundations) with powder.</li>
            <li> It takes away those red spots I get and then makes it much easier to put on foundation which will stay on a lot longer!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and I love it.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the price on amazon seems to be pretty consistent with prices at other retailers (e.g., Ulta).</li>
            <li> I have a ruddy complexion and this covers the red nicely as well as making a good all day base for my makeup.  </li>
            <li> After that when I apply my foundation, the foundation goes on so smoothly that I end up using much less of it</li>
            <li> like the way it feels and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I have developed quite the case of rosacea and have tried lots of things that didn&#x27;t work well for me like make-ups and creams that were supposed to &#x27;calm&#x27; your skin (Clinique) but this Smashbox product really helped hide my red cheeks and nose, especially combined with my regular make-up.</li>
            <li> It is light to apply too, not greasy or heavy which I like.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s at least a week or more.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that I ended up with some itchiness on my face that I didn&#x27;t have before, and the itchiness still lasted a couple of days after I had run out of the primer, so sensitive skin people, beware.  </li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT LEAVES SKIN SOFT EVENS</li>
            <li> Works really well at getting the red out of my skin.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW.</li>
            <li> Like many women mistakenly do early on in their makeup using years, I applied foundation straight out of it&#x27;s bottle, or worse, compact.</li>
            <li> The powder alone would not have been sufficient,  but with this primer,  I feel completely made up, but not at all caked over...</li>
            <li> green tinge definitely deals with the redness in my face better -</li>
            <li> I have now moved on to MAC and instead of a green primer I am trying yellow which seems to be working better.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use this every day as I don&#x27;t wear full makeup every day, so that travel size lasted me a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> Sure, a little goes a long way if you know how to apply it correctly.</li>
            <li> Because my skin is somewhat olive/sallow to begin with, I was not sure a green primer would be a good idea.  </li>
            <li> First realize that my mother is about as cheap as they come, refusing to even replace drug store mascara long after it has mostly dried out because \\&quot;it still has some left in it\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra effort to squeeze it out and eventually cut the tube open to get the last of it.</li>
            <li> It can feel a little oily on the skin, but I have super oily skin</li>
            <li> When I bought my BareMinerals at my local Sephora a couple of weeks ago, I got a small free sample of something, and this is what I chose.  </li>
            <li> I naturally have a red nose &amp; cheeks</li>
            <li> so the fact she spent $40 on one ounce of anything is a testament to how much she loves it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for dry to normal skin.</li>
            <li> For the price I also had high expectations which makes me think the brand name of &amp;#34;Smashbox&amp;#34; is charging for it&#x27;s name and not consistently high quality products.</li>
            <li> Had hopes that this would help out my slight redness on my cheeks and maybe help out with my large pores.</li>
            <li> I am only wearing the primer in the second picture, no other makeup.</li>
            <li> In my case, one full pump of liquid foundation on  a paper plate (easier and than a stainless stell makeup palette) is mixed with a small amount of Smashbox&#x27;s green Photo Finish primer.</li>
            <li> It took away the red to give me a clean even slate, there was a little pink still on my nose and around my nostrils</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer in that it does not cover any very red areas, even when I have tried to cover that area more thickly.  </li>
            <li> with my previous primer I didn&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would help cover up the redness from the breakouts until my skin was clear again - and I was hoping it would make it possible that all I really needed to wear was this and very little foundation.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the original smashbox primer for years; recently, having developed rosesea, I decided to try out the green tinted one as green counteracts red tones.</li>
            <li> I would say this formula will help tone down the redness a little bit if you have mild redness.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my (55 yr old) mother who has redness especially on her cheeks and nose due to rosacea.</li>
            <li> My fave primer of any other brand by far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who would benefit from this product is certainly wasn&#x27;t me.</li>
            <li> So she begged me not spend so much money on a small bottle of makeup even though she has been complaining about redness on her face for years.</li>
            <li> I went into an Ulta store a couple of years ago to try some other makeup, and the makeup artist there put some of this Smashbox green primer on me first.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really tone down my redness, Other than that</li>
            <li> product helps to tamp down redness, but does not eliminate it completely.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical about this product, and really reluctant to spend so much money on something that might not work.</li>
            <li> The green tone isn&#x27;t enough to completely erase my redness but again, there is a noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> This primer is so silky and goes a long way for each application; long lasting, try it to see for yourself!</li>
            <li> I usually use the regular, clear Smashbox primer, so thought this would be the same, but with color corrector.</li>
            <li> I have tried similar products with not much success - they sit unused my my drawer which is why I am going back to this product.</li>
            <li> It helps control some oily skin, but not for too long.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I would say that if your skin is very red or pink from acne or rosacea</li>
            <li> This product suits my skin (no breakouts yet, and it has been 5 days since I have been using it), and reduces (does  not completely hide) redness and acne scars.</li>
            <li> And as far as the primer itself, my foundation still wears off in a few hours</li>
            <li> I mean really what&#x27;s $40 when it is all that in a hand basket.</li>
            <li> It seems to keep my skin from getting too dry or too oily, and it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.  </li>
            <li> But have developed some redness in the past year, so this product seemed to be just what I need.  </li>
            <li> It takes away any dark circles, red spots or anything else that shows up from under my makeup.</li>
            <li> It does tone down the red in your face.  </li>
            <li> 34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34; is only half-true.</li>
            <li> I only gave 4 stars because when I used this product previously it came in a bottle with a pump that dispensed a pre-measured amount which is what would prefer.</li>
            <li> For me, it only slightly got rid of redness...</li>
            <li> This foundation primer, definitely works,a little bit goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I have very acne prone skin, and I am always afraid to try new products on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessive about using as much of it as possible so as not to waste it, but I bet a lot of folks would toss the tube when it gets down to the last week or two of product.</li>
            <li> Redness, broken capillaries, flaking, large pores and just about everything else you can have, I do.</li>
            <li> That last little painstaking bit I get out of the tube isn&#x27;t just a day or two...</li>
            <li> I was really hoping the photo finish would cover them at least a little.</li>
            <li> One cheek I put her stuff on, the other check I put on Smackbox primer and the cheek with Smashbox primer was visibly less red and smoothed out my pores.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, very little goes a long long way.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m just saying be careful, because there are people that it won&#x27;t work for.</li>
            <li> However a few years ago I totally splurged on this</li>
            <li> I see absolutely no covering at all.  </li>
            <li> but it sure helps a lot as a base under your regular make-up.</li>
            <li> I generally have a “pink” shade to my face although I’m very pale.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a sunblock in this formula - like there is in the other formula (the one that is pink..?)</li>
            <li> Although it looks quite green in the tube, it goes on barely tinted green, which might explain why it is ineffective at hiding any redness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use anything other than this product again.  </li>
            <li> The lotion feels slimy to me and doesn&#x27;t hold the makeup - actually all my makeup was in my t-zone by the end of the day and that doesn&#x27;t usually happen when I don&#x27;t use anything at all under my makeup.</li>
            <li> In the past I have used a yellow cream corrector on those areas and it&#x27;s worked well.  </li>
            <li> I BOUGH THE SMALL ONE AND HAD TO GET BIGGER BOTTLE</li>
            <li> I love the product, but was disappointed in the seller.  </li>
            <li> It may seem expensive, but a small amount goes a long way and it is worth every cent.</li>
            <li> The hint I was given by a friend was to pat in on (not too thickly or too thinly) and then wait 1-2 minutes before putting on your foundation for the Smashbox to &#x27;set&#x27; or be absorbed a bit.</li>
            <li> This did not help eliminate my redness(which isn&#x27;t even that bad) or any of my fine lines.</li>
            <li> To say my skin is bad is to put it mildly!</li>
            <li> This year winter and tanning has been particularly hard on my skin making it very red looking.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> But that silky feel is not worth what I paid for and not what I paid it to do.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but can really reduce the need for a concealer.</li>
            <li> When I used it, however, it was so thin in consistency that in the process of applying it, it wiped completely off the areas where I was placing it.  </li>
            <li> It times down the redness and primes for all day makeup.</li>
            <li> The green disappears (I have redness from sundamage) and helps the redness tone down.</li>
            <li> No special techniques...just rub it on with your fingers ....</li>
            <li> I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS</li>
            <li> /&gt;After you wash and moisturize your face just rub a little Smashbox photo</li>
            <li> Also, I think it made my skin break out a little.  </li>
            <li> BECAUSE THE PRODUCT IS GREEN.  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> The primer is green which helps to cover imperfections on your skin and even skin tone.</li>
            <li> My review is for the GREEN primer only.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , wait a few minutes</li>
            <li> In doing so, I would waste a lot of primer, and at this price, I&#x27;d rather not.  </li>
            <li> It arrived a few days after I ordered, and it just so happened my mom was at my house</li>
            <li> Product feel&#x27;s a little greasy when applying, and is a little pricey!</li>
            <li> other than that I’d really recommend it to anyone that’s sick of redness on their face.</li>
            <li> Usually I like to use a green corrector powder, but I like the matte primer that this gives you, so there it is.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t look green!  </li>
            <li> I wish that there were a larger size, this is rather expensive for the size.  </li>
            <li> After going through the small sample, I wish I&#x27;d gotten something else.  </li>
            <li> I tend to have oily skin so usually after a couple hours</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m supposed to use a big quarter size to get my redness out, but it&#x27;s too small &amp; too expensive to use that</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t even need to wear foundation when I use this product.</li>
            <li> The green tint is genius!  </li>
            <li> I am very pale, have combination skin and have periodic breakouts.  </li>
            <li> skeptical due to the few negative reviews</li>
            <li> It may look expensive, but a very small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always very difficult to get the last bit out of the tube.</li>
            <li> This product is a must if you are serious about your makeup.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this even for everyday use, everyone is taking pictures randomly</li>
            <li> I really doubt you will be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Not a great solution.  </li>
            <li> I was still skeptical thinking maybe I just wanted this to work</li>
            <li> will not buy this product again, because it&#x27;s too expensive to just be an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This stuff is just expensive</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a sample of an expensive redness corrector primer she got from her dermatologist</li>
            <li> But the product has worked well for me, and has definitely decreased the redness of my skin!</li>
            <li> But she wouldn&#x27;t buy it for herself because she said it was too expensive -</li>
            <li> so bad I was seeing things,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> However the service from this vendor has been lacking.  :(</li>
            <li> Boy was I disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed; I&#x27;ll be returning it to Sephora, esp since it cost $40.</li>
            <li> My forehead and chin being the worst.  </li>
            <li> It has worked wonders for me, and will continue purchasing it despite the outrageous price tag.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS AT FIRST BECAUSE THE PRODUCT IS GREEN.  ONCE I TRIED IT I WAS SO PLEASED.  IT DOES COVER AND MAKES MY PORES LOOK SMALLER.  I PUT IT ON BEFORE MY FOUNDATION AND I REALLY LIKE HOW IT MAKES MY SKIN FEEL. ALSO I HAVEN&#x27;T HAD AN OUTBREAK WHICH I NORMALLY DO SINCE I STARTED USING THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical about this product, and really reluctant to spend so much money on something that might not work. For me, I had great results. I generally have a “pink” shade to my face although I’m very pale. It took away the red to give me a clean even slate, there was a little pink still on my nose and around my nostrils but I still had fantastic redness removal all over my face. It leaves your skin perfectly smooth for you to apply foundation, but I would not recommend applying it under your eyes. I’ve never had an issue with makeup clumping in the wrinkles under my eyes before but with this product I had to wipe constantly and basically ended up with no concealer under my eyes anymore :/ other than that I’d really recommend it to anyone that’s sick of redness on their face.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live with out it</li>
            <li> I have developed quite the case of rosacea and have tried lots of things that didn&#x27;t work well for me like make-ups and creams that were supposed to &#x27;calm&#x27; your skin (Clinique) but this Smashbox product really helped hide my red cheeks and nose, especially combined with my regular make-up. The hint I was given by a friend was to pat in on (not too thickly or too thinly) and then wait 1-2 minutes before putting on your foundation for the Smashbox to &#x27;set&#x27; or be absorbed a bit. I really love the way it works for me.</li>
            <li> I went into an Ulta store a couple of years ago to try some other makeup, and the makeup artist there put some of this Smashbox green primer on me first.  I liked it so much I bought a travel size for $17.  I love this stuff.  I have combination skin and because I am middle-aged and I have lost a fair amount of weight, a lot of products don&#x27;t work for me (read: my skin is getting old and saggy and I&#x27;m not likin&#x27; it much).  Because my skin is somewhat olive/sallow to begin with, I was not sure a green primer would be a good idea.  However, this primer evens out my skin tone really nicely, making any blotchy areas less noticeable, and it does not make me look any more sallow.  I agree with the other reviewer in that it does not cover any very red areas, even when I have tried to cover that area more thickly.  For that, I have ended up using concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this every day as I don&#x27;t wear full makeup every day, so that travel size lasted me a year and a half.  After moisturizing, I apply the primer all over my face, especially focusing on any red or darkened areas.  After that when I apply my foundation, the foundation goes on so smoothly that I end up using much less of it and it looks better, more even, and the overall look is more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after a long day and well into the evening, it still feels good on my skin.  It does not settle into the creases of my skin or get shiny.  It seems to keep my skin from getting too dry or too oily, and it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.  I am giving it 4 stars because I thought it would offer better coverage for red areas, but I still love the stuff.  It&#x27;s highway robbery what they charge for it, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really tone down my redness, Other than that, it is great as a primer.</li>
            <li> Helps with my ruddy complexion and keeps the makeup smooth.</li>
            <li> I have a ruddy complexion and this covers the red nicely as well as making a good all day base for my makeup.  It is lightweight, but effective. I sometimes don&#x27;t even bother with my normal foundation as it evens out the complexion nicely.  Even in the hottest and muggiest of our Florida summer days, I find my make up lasts all day.  Tried it on  my eye lids before a powder shadow and even though the shadow doesn&#x27;t last quite all day, it is better than before.  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Gives a perfect finish.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Works for my skin type which is oily.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic! I read all the reviews prior to purchasing, and I tried it on in the store too. It gets rid of most of the red on my face, and once I apply foundation, my skin looks flawless. It helps tremendously. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Loved this. The green tint counteracts the redness in my skin and leaves a nice even tone.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BEST! It times down the redness and primes for all day makeup.</li>
            <li> Ok but not the best out there-</li>
            <li> This has been the best primer ever for me. It takes away those red spots I get and then makes it much easier to put on foundation which will stay on a lot longer! Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love love love this primer. I have been using the original smashbox primer for years; recently, having developed rosesea, I decided to try out the green tinted one as green counteracts red tones. As I would expect from Smashbox, the primer itself is smooth and makes your skin feel awesome, almost like a serum. Even without putting anything ontop of it it certainly improves the appearance of fine lines and overall imperfections. It also improves the wearing-life of any foundation/concealer that is layered ontop of it. The green tone isn&#x27;t enough to completely erase my redness but again, there is a noticeable improvement. I am extremely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite primer! Helps my make up stay on, smooths out my skin and evens out my tone while covering up the darker spots.</li>
            <li> Love this product! My makeup looks better and stays on longer when I use this primer. The primer does well at correcting red spots and feels great on your skin. Will definitely buy again. Great price, compared to buying in store!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use anything other than this product again.  I have used smashbox&#x27;s regular photo finish primer for years, and loved it.  But have developed some redness in the past year, so this product seemed to be just what I need.  Has the same smoothing effect as photo finish, yet neutralizes the redness without looking chalky - you won&#x27;t look green!  Very happy with it.  Will no doubt reorder again  and again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, this is the second time I purchased it. It isn&#x27;t a miracle cure for redness but it sure helps a lot as a base under your regular make-up. It is light to apply too, not greasy or heavy which I like.</li>
            <li> This primer is so silky and goes a long way for each application; long lasting, try it to see for yourself!</li>
            <li> I am very pale, have combination skin and have periodic breakouts.  I was hoping this would help cover up the redness from the breakouts until my skin was clear again - and I was hoping it would make it possible that all I really needed to wear was this and very little foundation.  I honestly don&#x27;t think this covered any of the redness on my skin.  If it did, it was very minute.  I still put on the same amount of makeup to ensure the breakout redness was covered.  I then tried to think of it just as a primer, but didn&#x27;t find it useful as that either.  The lotion feels slimy to me and doesn&#x27;t hold the makeup - actually all my makeup was in my t-zone by the end of the day and that doesn&#x27;t usually happen when I don&#x27;t use anything at all under my makeup. I wish I could find some redeeming quality about this lotion, but I can&#x27;t. This was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and never been disappointed. The only &amp;#34;flaw&amp;#34; I have in the product is the tube it&#x27;s packaged in. It&#x27;s always very difficult to get the last bit out of the tube. I&#x27;m obsessive about using as much of it as possible so as not to waste it, but I bet a lot of folks would toss the tube when it gets down to the last week or two of product. That last little painstaking bit I get out of the tube isn&#x27;t just a day or two... it&#x27;s at least a week or more. Worth the extra effort to squeeze it out and eventually cut the tube open to get the last of it.</li>
            <li> Love the smoothness. Feels like product is not even on- lightweight and smooth. The green disappears (I have redness from sundamage) and helps the redness tone down.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you have to give a good shake before application because of separation, but otherwise great.  I would buy again at this great price.</li>
            <li> This primer has made a huge difference in the appearance of my skin and it helps my makeup to go on smoothly and last longer. The primer is green which helps to cover imperfections on your skin and even skin tone. Prior to using this product, I used Estee Lauder primer but it started drying my skin out so I decided to try something new. I&#x27;m sold on this product and will order it again when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> I feel I have a nice complexion but there are several places on my face where I sometimes get a strong, high red coloration.  My forehead and chin being the worst.  In the past I have used a yellow cream corrector on those areas and it&#x27;s worked well.  I ran out of the cream so when looking for more, I came across this product.  It sounded perfect for the red in my complexion.  When I used it, however, it was so thin in consistency that in the process of applying it, it wiped completely off the areas where I was placing it.  It looked like I hadn&#x27;t applied anything after several attempts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this was a faulty batch from the factory. I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would want to use it considering how ineffective it was.  For the price I also had high expectations which makes me think the brand name of &amp;#34;Smashbox&amp;#34; is charging for it&#x27;s name and not consistently high quality products. This is getting mailed back to the seller this week and I have since ordered the yellow cream and, as before, I am very happy with that.</li>
            <li> Omg...if you don&#x27;t have this....GET IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;It works so well...evens out your color...makes your face look nice and smooth...it really is worth every dime and I am by no means make up savy...which makes it all that much better...just put it on...and apply your regular make up after that...No special techniques...just rub it on with your fingers ....literally worth every dime!!</li>
            <li> nicely provides a smooth color improved matte finish.  I wish that there were a larger size, this is rather expensive for the size.  Usually I like to use a green corrector powder, but I like the matte primer that this gives you, so there it is.</li>
            <li> *UPDATE: Looks like Amazon did a switch-a-roo with the product image on this page. My review is for the GREEN primer only.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product helps to tamp down redness, but does not eliminate it completely. If you have redness, don&#x27;t expect this to make you look like a porcelain doll. Have reasonable expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look at the pictures and judge for yourself. I have mild redness, mostly from use of retin-a.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictures are taken in the same location, 3 minutes apart. I am only wearing the primer in the second picture, no other makeup.</li>
            <li> I usually use the regular, clear Smashbox primer, so thought this would be the same, but with color corrector. It is much thinner in consistency, and the green tint (to balance any redness) is virtually non-existent once you put it on. I like the primer because my makeup doesn&#x27;t run around my eyes during the day, but when I use this, it still does. Might as well not use anything.</li>
            <li> This is the sheet. My fave primer of any other brand by far.</li>
            <li> I really notice a difference in my skin&#x27;s redness, and the product makes my skin feel amazing!  Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I only gave 4 stars because when I used this product previously it came in a bottle with a pump that dispensed a pre-measured amount which is what would prefer. I think it will be very easy to use it up quickly from a squeeze tube. I love how soft &amp; smooth my skin feels after applying &amp; it really helps to neutralize the redness. I have tried similar products with not much success - they sit unused my my drawer which is why I am going back to this product.</li>
            <li> This product goes on like silk ,but it is a bit too is sheer.</li>
            <li> Love the way this makes your skin velvety smooth! However, I do not think it works well for red spots. I&#x27;ve used Loreal BB cream and loved it for covering red in my face. The BB cream hands down works better than this. I will be sticking with my BB cream.</li>
            <li> When I bought my BareMinerals at my local Sephora a couple of weeks ago, I got a small free sample of something, and this is what I chose.  After going through the small sample, I wish I&#x27;d gotten something else.  I have a lot of redness in my skin, and this did absolutely nothing to even it out.  I still had to use just as much makeup as I did before to even out my skin tone.  I also noticed that I ended up with some itchiness on my face that I didn&#x27;t have before, and the itchiness still lasted a couple of days after I had run out of the primer, so sensitive skin people, beware.  If you already use this and you like it, I&#x27;d say keep using it.  If you don&#x27;t use it and you&#x27;re thinking about it, one thing I&#x27;d suggest doing (if you can) is go to a local Sephora and buy something where you may be able to get a free sample of it and try it before you buy it.  I&#x27;m not saying it won&#x27;t work for everyone, I&#x27;m just saying be careful, because there are people that it won&#x27;t work for.</li>
            <li> I just love this smashbox product.  It helps with the redness in my face and leaves my face feeling silky and smooth.  Works great under my make up.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the reviews led me to believe. It&#x27;s a nice primer but doesn&#x27;t cover much. I&#x27;ve used other primers that work more effectively.</li>
            <li> Love this primer.  It may look expensive, but a very small amount goes a long way.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.will order again</li>
            <li> Cuts down on redness (I have rosacea) and makes foundation go on much more smoothly.</li>
            <li> This product really makes your makeup look great and smooth all day.</li>
            <li> Just a fabulous, fabulous product. Really evens out my skin tone. Thank you!</li>
            <li> GREAT....LOVE THIS PRODUCT LEAVES SKIN SOFT EVENS IT OUT. I BOUGH THE SMALL ONE AND HAD TO GET BIGGER BOTTLE I LOVED IT SOOOOO MUCH :)</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, it does a great job of toning down my ruddy face and smoothing out the lines and pores. Very light and effortless to put on, and then foundation goes on really well over it. Really great product!</li>
            <li> Came 2 days early!&lt;br /&gt;Was skeptical due to the few negative reviews and since I have tried pretty much everything else on the market that has never worked, but this stuff is awesome! I&#x27;ve had acne since I was 11, been on 2 therapies of Accutane and now at 56 I have Rosacea. To say my skin is bad is to put it mildly! Redness, broken capillaries, flaking, large pores and just about everything else you can have, I do. I used this last night and Wow! I noticed a huge difference even before applying foundation and after was even more amazing. I was still skeptical thinking maybe I just wanted this to work so bad I was seeing things, but I received so many compliments on how good I looked! I tend to have oily skin so usually after a couple hours my foundation has disappeared but not with using Smashbox! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as impressed with this item as I thought I would be. I naturally have a red nose &amp; cheeks and I was so excited when I read this temporarily got rid of the redness before you put your makeup on. For me, it only slightly got rid of redness...I still have to use a caked-on layer of concealer on my nose &amp; cheeks to get my face uniform. I feel like I&#x27;m squirting a lot of it on my finger...with my previous primer I didn&#x27;t have to use as much. Maybe I&#x27;m supposed to use a big quarter size to get my redness out, but it&#x27;s too small &amp; too expensive to use that much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this product again, because it&#x27;s too expensive to just be an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; primer.</li>
            <li> Yup, I&#x27;ve reached the age of need...this is wonderful to help even out skin tones and give a fresh underlay for foundation. Really nice product. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Excellent service.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It does tone down the red in your face.  If you concentrate it on blemish spots, then cover with concealer, you wouldn&#x27;t know you had a blemish.  It helps control some oily skin, but not for too long.  (in humid areas)  It&#x27;s a great primer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading reviews that said how well it worked to neutralize freckles and red spots under foundation.  I love Smashbox products and hoped it would do the trick.  It didn&#x27;t work at all.  I even tried using twice the recommended amount.  It just absorbed into my skin.  I bought a &amp;#34;green stick&amp;#34; at the local beauty supply shop for $6.99 that works perfectly.  Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It does take away the redness however it is a bit oily for my skin.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for dry to normal skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it takes the redness out of my cheeks better than any make up or Rosacea product I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;After you wash and moisturize your face just rub a little Smashbox photo finish color correcting primer to any red areas on your face, wait a few minutes and you will see a huge difference. I usually don&#x27;t even need to wear foundation when I use this product. It&#x27;s amazing!! :-)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much for makeup , and I certainly don&#x27;t spend a lot when I do. However a few years ago I totally splurged on this and I am so glad I did. It makes a great base, made my skin feel so so smooth, didn&#x27;t make me break out, makes foundation go on flawlessly over dry patchy skin. I never took note of the color correcting part until this week when I re found it. I bought it 4 years ago. This year winter and tanning has been particularly hard on my skin making it very red looking. So I decided to try it out for the color correction. Wow! !! It worked instantly! I was so impressed. So impressed I am back to splurge again. I mean really what&#x27;s $40 when it is all that in a hand basket. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it! Try it I really doubt you will be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love this primer. I ordered it to help with the red tones of my skin. I think it does a great job &amp; I love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> Did not do as promised.......not even close. I have oily skin and this did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.  It really minimizes the redness of my face.  It is green, and blends in nicely-sometimes I use it with no foundation.  It provides a smooth even finish to my skin.  Foundation goes  on smoothly after the primer, and helps to eliminate streaks of foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used primer before so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. . .  So far, it mostly evens out my skin tones. I think results will improve as I learn to work  with it.  I especially like the texture of this product.</li>
            <li> I saw this item used in a tutorial online and wanted it to help with my wedding photos. I ordered the product early and did many &amp;#34;mock&amp;#34; trials of make up and photos. I am very happy with this product, it did just as expected. My skin looked great with no glare or glossyness in my photos. Of course I also used my Mary Kay foundation but this primer helped last all night and to eliminate a wet/oily look in my photos.  I would recommend this even for everyday use, everyone is taking pictures randomly and this product is a great addition to the look of perfect skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any change with color correction.  My redness is the same.</li>
            <li> Had hopes that this would help out my slight redness on my cheeks and maybe help out with my large pores. It did neither. Very slippery and felt like it helped to move my powder around instead of keeping it in place. And for the price, I expect more, much more from this product.</li>
            <li> I have alot of redness in my face plus age spots.  I was really hoping the photo finish would cover them at least a little. I see absolutely no covering at all.  It does however make my face have a nice silky feel to it after I have applied it. It then makes my foundation glide on easier.  But that silky feel is not worth what I paid for and not what I paid it to do.  I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and I love it. I can put over my moisturizers and my face looks good. It hides the redness on my face and the price was better on line than in the store. My face glows now.</li>
            <li> This is the best primer I have tried so far! I love how it goes on so easy and smooth and you don&#x27;t need to use very much to get the benefits. I have very sensitive skin on my face to the point that some products make me break out or in some cases even cause blistering from allergic reactions and this product is very gentle and does not cause me to breakout.  I would say that if your skin is very red or pink from acne or rosacea this product will not take all your redness away. However, it&#x27;s certainly better than nothing.  Plus I&#x27;ve used other green-tinted concealers before and this product has a more natural look to it. I would say this formula will help tone down the redness a little bit if you have mild redness.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would help with the rosacea-induced redness but it didn&#x27;t.  Although it looks quite green in the tube, it goes on barely tinted green, which might explain why it is ineffective at hiding any redness.  The texture and feel of the cream is nice- very talc-y; it goes on smooth but does not help hide any redness.  Also, I think it made my skin break out a little.  Very disappointed; I&#x27;ll be returning it to Sephora, esp since it cost $40.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it under my foundation makeup. It takes away any dark circles, red spots or anything else that shows up from under my makeup. Don&#x27;t leave the house without this!</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job of covering up redness, as well as being an excellent primer. The only problem is that I have to squeeze and shake the bottle before I use it because the product separates.</li>
            <li> My fav primer out there!</li>
            <li> This foundation primer, definitely works,a little bit goes a long way!  My daughter recommended it.  Product feel&#x27;s a little greasy when applying, and is a little pricey!</li>
            <li> Works well as a primer. I can&#x27;t really see any difference with the green tint making covering up discolorations any easier. But it works well as a primer.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have been using for years.</li>
            <li> Anyone with with redness in their skin will LOVE this product.  Does a great job minimizing redness and makes a great palette before applying foundation or even tinted moisturizers.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It can feel a little oily on the skin, but I have super oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t increase the look of oiliness on my face. In fact, I have noticed that when I used this my face is less oily throughout the day (which is something I did not anticipate but was a pleasant surprise!). I am finding that with correctors, the adage &amp;#34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34; is only half-true. Sure, a little goes a long way if you know how to apply it correctly. This is not something to &amp;#34;rub in,&amp;#34; but to smooth onto the face and blend out as necessary. Give your face a couple minutes after you apply this (without touching it!), and you will see a reduction in redness. It has worked wonders for me, and will continue purchasing it despite the outrageous price tag. Oh, and the price on amazon seems to be pretty consistent with prices at other retailers (e.g., Ulta). This stuff is just expensive, there is no getting around it. If it really helps reduce redness and doesn&#x27;t break me out (it&#x27;s SPF free, thankfully - SPF &#x3D; breakout city for me!), then it&#x27;s worth the price tag. You can make it last a while if you go the &amp;#34;problem area only&amp;#34; route and blend well. Oftentimes I will just set this with a translucent powder and am good to go. Oh, and a final note, it does help cover redness and scarring from blemishes. It&#x27;s not perfect, but can really reduce the need for a concealer. If I put a powder foundation over the primer the marks pretty much disappear. One word of caution about applying makeup over this primer: be gentle! If you aren&#x27;t it will slide all over your face and then the redness will not be as effectively covered. I find a &amp;#34;patting&amp;#34; approach works better than a &amp;#34;rubbing&amp;#34; approach. This is true for makeup generally speaking, especially with setting products (e.g., primers and/or foundations) with powder. Pat don&#x27;t drag it across your face and you&#x27;ll have better results.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but was disappointed in the seller.  Within a week of using this product, the pump top separated from the long tube that stands in the bottle.  In order to take it out to reattach them, I would have to get the tube out of the bottle.  In doing so, I would waste a lot of primer, and at this price, I&#x27;d rather not.  So I&#x27;ve been using a Q-tip to get the stuff out.  Not a great solution.  In the meantime, I wrote to the seller to ask for a new pump.  I did not even receive a response.  I have seen this product being sold in ULTA, so from  now on, I will purchase it there.  That way, if something happens, I can confront a sales associate and at least get some kind of response.  The product is great!  However the service from this vendor has been lacking.  :(</li>
            <li> I have used this item for several years.  It reduces the redness on my face.  It also lets the foundation glide on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Works really well at getting the red out of my skin.  The green tint is genius!  At 47, I can wear just the Photo Finish alone on days I don&#x27;t want to do full make-up.</li>
            <li> Love this product use this prior to ordering from amazon it was cost effective on amazon knew exactly what i was getting.  smooth primer to reduce redness.</li>
            <li> Considering how much this product costs, and the endorsement it got from the sales assistant at Sephora, I had really high hopes. Boy was I disappointed. Yes, it goes on smoothly. Yes, it has a nice soft finish. But does it neutralize redness? Cover scars? Diminish the appearance of rosacea or even out skin tone at all? No. If you&#x27;re looking for redness reducing solution do not buy this, it will do nothing for your skin. I&#x27;m not sure who would benefit from this product is certainly wasn&#x27;t me.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been buying it for 5 years and it&#x27;s part of my routine every morning. It&#x27;s the best product I know of to get rid of redness of all kinds - from acne to broken blood vessels. It also provides a matte finish and evens the skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have very acne prone skin, and I am always afraid to try new products on my face. This product suits my skin (no breakouts yet, and it has been 5 days since I have been using it), and reduces (does  not completely hide) redness and acne scars. It has a very smooth texture and feels light on my skin. So far I am really happy about this buy!</li>
            <li> Used to buy this thru Sephora but got better pricing thru Amazon. If you haven&#x27;t used this primer-it really works.</li>
            <li> I have a medium-fair complexion, and often get redness around my nose and cheeks. This has worked really well for me. The product has a very smooth, lightweight feel. Only a tiny bit of product is needed to get the desired effect. If you use too much, you will start to get the greenish look to your skin! I was previously using a liquid foundation, but was able to switch to a lightweight powder when using this primer.</li>
            <li> This product is a must if you are serious about your makeup. It primes your skin and evens out the tone.  It feels great on the face.  One of my must haves.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my (55 yr old) mother who has redness especially on her cheeks and nose due to rosacea. First realize that my mother is about as cheap as they come, refusing to even replace drug store mascara long after it has mostly dried out because \\&quot;it still has some left in it\\&quot;. So she begged me not spend so much money on a small bottle of makeup even though she has been complaining about redness on her face for years. It arrived a few days after I ordered, and it just so happened my mom was at my house so we put it on her all of 5 minutes after it was delivered to my doorstep. All I can say is WOW. It really made a difference in reducing the amount of redness and evening out her skintone. My sister came over later in the day and she immediately noticed how nice my mothers skin looked not knowing we had done anything special to make it that way. My mom was glowing all day and checking her face out in the mirror. Who says money can&#x27;t buy happiness? She made me order another bottle for her immediately \\&quot;incase they run out\\&quot; (which I tried to explain likely wouldn&#x27;t happen) and that is saying something. This woman refuses to throw out socks with holes in them so the fact she spent $40 on one ounce of anything is a testament to how much she loves it. Be aware - It did not eliminate all the redness from her face, but it noticeably diminished it and in addition to her powder foundation the redness on her face was drastically reduced.</li>
            <li> I have been using smashbox for about a year.  I wrote a review on it before, stating this is the best primer I have ever used.  I is perfect for drier skin, does on, stays on, helps the face go with liquid make up or even moisturizer.  It lasts a long time, very little goes a long long way. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I have been using this smash box product for 2 years and love it. First product i have found that successfully hides redness before applying my foundation. Just bought some for my sister as a gift.</li>
            <li> For years, I didn&#x27;t fully comprehend the importance of using a primer with foundation. Like many women mistakenly do early on in their makeup using years, I applied foundation straight out of it&#x27;s bottle, or worse, compact. While it was always fine, it didn&#x27;t have that seamless, airbrushed quality that I saw on so many and always wanted. I have very fair skin and it was always such a challenge to blend at the chin &amp; neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those of you looking to get the finish you see in the media? Buy this primer, and mix it with your liquid foundation. It may seem expensive, but a small amount goes a long way and it is worth every cent. In my case, one full pump of liquid foundation on  a paper plate (easier and than a stainless stell makeup palette) is mixed with a small amount of Smashbox&#x27;s green Photo Finish primer. I apply it with a Sigma F80 brush to finally get the airbrushed finish I&#x27;ve always wanted. It evens out my tone and gets rid of the redness. I don&#x27;t know how I existed without this primer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And no, I don&#x27;t work for any company that makes any of the products I mentioned. I&#x27;m just a very happy consumer and try to pass along my good experience to others in case they are on the fence about buying something. :-) Good luck!</li>
            <li> Love this!  It&#x27;s silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Great coverage for roseacia.</li>
            <li> This primer this the best if you have rosesa. It goes on very smooth. A friend gave me a sample of an expensive redness corrector primer she got from her dermatologist and I tested it with my Smashbox primer. One cheek I put her stuff on, the other check I put on Smackbox primer and the cheek with Smashbox primer was visibly less red and smoothed out my pores. I will always buy this product because it works for me!</li>
            <li> I wish there was a sunblock in this formula - like there is in the other formula (the one that is pink..?) But the product has worked well for me, and has definitely decreased the redness of my skin! I will definitely buy again and will look forward to a sunblock version!</li>
            <li> love the feel as it&#x27;s applied to my face</li>
            <li> This primer goes on very smoothly and allows make up and foundation to go on beautifully and stay on longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green tinge definitely deals with the redness in my face better - it doesn&#x27;t eradicate it,  but it lessens it, and makes the foundation more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone out frequently just using it and a light powder. The powder alone would not have been sufficient,  but with this primer,  I feel completely made up, but not at all caked over...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it feels and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff.  She was given a sample by a friend and said it was wonderful - I don&#x27;t know why.  But she wouldn&#x27;t buy it for herself because she said it was too expensive - so I have been ordering it for her.  I think its great because it makes her happy and it&#x27;s something I can do for her that brings a smile on her face - and I don&#x27;t have to go to a woman&#x27;s make-up counter at a department store to get it for her!</li>
            <li> This did not help eliminate my redness(which isn&#x27;t even that bad) or any of my fine lines. I&#x27;m so disappointed. All it does is make my skin smooth, but as for getting me that photo ready finish, it doesn&#x27;t at all. And as far as the primer itself, my foundation still wears off in a few hours</li>
            <li> I like the feeling of the product. However it did not cancel out the redness in my skin. I have now moved on to MAC and instead of a green primer I am trying yellow which seems to be working better.</li>
            <li> Nice primer.  It glides on smoothly. I will purchase again when needed.</li>
            <li> just add a little at a time , so it will absorb and then add more if needed.&lt;br /&gt;I like it a lot and use it daily to get rid of my redness in my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all the hype is about. I do not have a naturally red skin tone, but it does nothing for pimple redness reduction. I&#x27;m also unimpressed with the results when combined with foundation. There are better primers out there without the price tag!</li>
