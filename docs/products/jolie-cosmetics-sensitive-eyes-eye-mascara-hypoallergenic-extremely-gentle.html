            <li>Excellent product, haven&#x27;t worn any eye make up for years because of the burning and watery eyes.</li>

            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s really, really good.</li>
            <li>so I never use mascara, so I took a gamble on this mascara and it was awesome no problems and made my lashes full and beautiful, was easy to remove as well....</li>
            <li>What a tremendous WINNER!!!  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I really liked this mascara; the color, the texture, the durability.</li>
            <li>This is what I would call a nice &amp;#34;every day&amp;#34; mascara.  </li>
            <li>This one could be a good choice for most people, but it&#x27;s just OK for me.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to wear any kind of makeup for years now and</li>
            <li>My eyes have no reaction to it which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, was using Isa Dora Hypoallergenic but can&#x27;t find it any more.  </li>
            <li>and I like it better Than the Isa Dora.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to find a mascara that did not irritate my eyes or eyelids.  </li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>Just OK.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I also love the consistency.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found it.</li>
            <li>I had hopes I had found a solution to not being able to wear mascara for years.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything out there including many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; touting mascaras.  </li>
            <li>Thank you, Amazon, for selling such a great find!</li>
            <li>Most mascaras make my eyes water.</li>
            <li>I am glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>This mascara feels like I have nothing on, love it.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find ANY mascara I could tolerate for more than an hour or so.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it if you don&#x27;t want all the lengthening-thickening-curling stuff that&#x27;s in most mascaras these days.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product and I will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li>but it is easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>I can easily remove it with a tissue and water at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Good for older women who don&#x27;t want a lot of goo on their lashes.</li>
            <li>This mascara is light weigh, goes on smoothly, washes off easily.  </li>
            <li>and I can wear it all day comfortably.  </li>
            <li>And more glad that you offer a product like this to sensitive eye people, and I for sure will order again</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge so far, which is good.  </li>
            <li>like I said, it is a very nice daily wear cosmetic.</li>
            <li>Full of parabens, returned product.</li>
            <li>It may come off a bit on hot days but is easily blotted away.</li>
            <li>This one was better than many others, but if I have it on for several hours, I still start to get some burning sensation in my eyes.</li>
            <li>Not the fault of the makeup: I am highly allergic to many things.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t normally tolerate mascara, but this stuff is OK.  </li>
            <li>By end of evening I might have a tad of irritation more from something being in my eyelashes, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me for a normal workday of 8 hours or so.  </li>
            <li>It is unbelievable and the price is so reasonable; please never stop making this product as I am telling everyone how wonderful the mascara is!!  </li>
            <li>The first beauty product I have ever purchased that has no markings on the container!</li>
            <li>I really love this sensitive eyes eye mascara!  </li>
            <li>Whatever they don&#x27;t put in this mascara is the secret; what a joy to have clear, bright eyes and not to worry about watering or itching eyes.  </li>
            <li>So far, it looks like I can wear this one longer than most.</li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive eyes this is much better than nothing</li>
            <li>Give it a try; worth the money; it may work for you.</li>
            <li>, I put two to three coats on and it stays all day without my eyes turning red or becoming itchy!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t make my old brand anymore, am glad to find a new one that doesn&#x27;t bother me!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used it but would recommend it.</li>
            <li>(Yes, hot compresses help, hopefully this will resolve soon.)</li>
            <li>and therefore it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes as pretty as I want them to</li>
            <li>I put this on first</li>
            <li>thank you so much!</li>
            <li>so no, unfortunately I didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li>thanks again</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth a try for anyone with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>After using the product, my eyes are still irritated, do not think it is really helpful for irritated eyes</li>
            <li>This mascara is a real find.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for truly hypoallergenic and gentle eye make-up and had hoped that this would be it.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensative skin and eyes</li>
            <li>Mascara really irritates my eyes.</li>
            <li>and I really like the way it goes on - no clumps or stuck-together lashes, just color.  </li>
            <li>(I have a theory that since it is hypoallergenic I should put it closest to my eyes) and then put my other non-hyopallergenic mascara on top of it.  </li>
            <li>Like the name brand mascara, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, and it seems to stay on better than other one did, yet</li>
            <li>I only wear mascara for special occasions.</li>
            <li>Am still testing how long I can be comfortable wearing it.</li>
            <li>Runs a little easier than water proof, but hey, for the sake of my eye health, that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to wash off -</li>
            <li>I have been through more mascaras than I can count trying to find one that won&#x27;t irritate my eyes after a few hours.</li>
            <li>and hopefully it will be ok after a few months.</li>
            <li>Thank you for being my new go-to mascara.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes and can&#x27;t wear over the counter products.</li>
            <li>It does not clump up and looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>I have always had very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear mascara often, and my eyes have become VERY sensitive to it.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>The first day I tried it my eyes became very red and watery and my eyelids got puffy.  </li>
            <li>For the past several years my eyes have become much more sensitive to mascara to the point that I stopped wearing it, which was a let down to me because I love using my shadows and eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>After searching on Google for mascara especially for sensitive eyes I found this product and ordered it based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>and I have very oily skin and havent&#x27; noticed this product migrating down my cheeks like many of the more expensive mascaras.</li>
            <li>The bottom says &amp;#34;Sensitive Mascara&amp;#34; with the color name.&lt;br /&gt;Because my eyes are sensitive to just about everything product-wise, I seldom wear mascara.</li>
            <li>It felt like the mascara was washed out of an old tube.</li>
            <li>No flaking, and it looks beautifully natural.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone who has sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I have keratoconus and my eyes are so sensitive to mascara that I had given up trying to wear it.  </li>
            <li>But my eyes are so sensitive that I have not found any makeup I can wear on or around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I am a presenter who sells it and it is made with natural products.</li>
            <li>First mascara in a long time that does not make me &amp;#34;tear up&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I decided to keep it, and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>But the biggest surprise was how nicely it thickens my thin lashes with no clumping.  </li>
            <li>Next day, whole ridge along eyelid was swollen and red and hurting.  </li>
            <li>I am 76 years old and believe me, in this long life I have tried all kinds of mascara saying they were hypoallergenic, but this mascara is the first and only that actually is.  </li>
            <li>I even use it as a &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; with other product on top, only on the outer half of my lashes to build them up.  </li>
            <li>So far, the only mascara I could wear was a masque made out of walnut shells which is off the market.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and my prior mascara was no longer being manufactured.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 days, but so far no itching.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a shade lighter than black and probably looks a little more natural with my blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>It goes on much like other mascaras</li>
            <li>It still makes my eyes water, but not as much as the other hypoallergenic mascaras I have tried.  </li>
            <li>The mascara is okay, just not as thick as I would like and does not last long.  </li>
            <li>When I want a more dramatic look</li>
            <li>I really wanted this product to work and gave it several tries.</li>
            <li>-- it is in fact light and yet - thick enough to enhance without &amp;#34;overdoing&amp;#34; it.  </li>
            <li>least it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Due to multiple eye surgeries I have very sensitive eyes that water a lot.</li>

            <li> I even use it as a &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; with other product on top, only on the outer half of my lashes to build them up.  </li>
            <li> So far, the only mascara I could wear was a masque made out of walnut shells which is off the market.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and my prior mascara was no longer being manufactured.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 days, but so far no itching.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a shade lighter than black and probably looks a little more natural with my blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> It goes on much like other mascaras</li>
            <li> It still makes my eyes water, but not as much as the other hypoallergenic mascaras I have tried.  </li>
            <li> The mascara is okay, just not as thick as I would like and does not last long.  </li>
            <li> When I want a more dramatic look</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work and gave it several tries.</li>
            <li> -- it is in fact light and yet - thick enough to enhance without &amp;#34;overdoing&amp;#34; it.  </li>
            <li> least it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Due to multiple eye surgeries I have very sensitive eyes that water a lot.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who has had trouble wearing mascara.</li>
            <li> However as it says it&#x27;s dark chocolate not black</li>
            <li> I have long curly eyelashes that i wanted to play up but just gave up as nothing seemed to agree with my eye sensitivities.  </li>
            <li> I tried this mascara and had the same reaction I&#x27;ve had with other mascaras.</li>
            <li> It does take some time to dry.</li>
            <li> Works well gave it a 4 as its a bit thin/takes a while to dry.</li>
            <li> w/ chronic dry eye syndrome to boot;</li>
            <li> The packaging and tube were very understated compared to the name brand, and I realized that I had inadvertently ordered Black/Brown instead of Black which I&#x27;ve always used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Contents were dry, not much in the tube.</li>
            <li> This was no better than Almay and more expensive.  </li>
            <li> But 24-48 hours after using this product my eyelid was red and hurt a little.  </li>
            <li> Usually mascara should be discarded after using it for 3 months, but if it doesn&#x27;t last that long and even if it does, I will be ordering this product again before that just to insure that I have it on hand.  </li>
            <li> I do not have an allergy to mascara but an extreme sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> Does not cause any eye irritation that I had with other mascaras.</li>
            <li> Had problems with other mascaras</li>
            <li> I have long lashes and it ends up as polkadots on my eye lids if I don&#x27;t keep them closed for a few minutes!</li>
            <li> I have found that Bare Escentuels mascara isn&#x27;t too bad if I put it just on the upper lashes and not very thick.</li>
            <li> I searched Amazon for a name brand mascara that I had used previously, and it displayed other mascaras that people had looked at along with the one I had searched for.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t try wearing it again as the discomfort is not worth the results.  </li>
            <li> The product was dried out and seemed empty.  </li>
            <li> It still causes my eyes some irritation, sadly, but then I&#x27;m VERY sensitive to eye makeup.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no point in highlighting my eyes if I look like I was just on an all night crying jag.  </li>
            <li> after applying 6 coats, you still couldnt tell I had mascara on.disgusted with the waste of money.</li>
            <li> But made up eyes without some mascara looks very odd.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it was a little easier to wash off!</li>
            <li> No more mascara for me, I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> and unfortunately I could only wear mascara for about an hour(including Clinique) before my eyes started to get irritated.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what is in it, or rather, what is NOT.  </li>
            <li> Was never able to wear mascara before without my eyes stinging.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I would recomment this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Seemed to be dried up when it arrived!  </li>
            <li> Not very good.  </li>
            <li> My eyes started reacting to mascara and had to get a very expensive ointment to clear them up.</li>
            <li> If you blink hard after you have applied it, it rubs off on the skin below the eyes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t  bother my eyes, but it hardly looked like I had any mascara on.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding mascara that didn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  </li>
            <li> While it is the least irritating mascara I have ever used, I did experience some irritation after wearing for a few hours.</li>
            <li> This one which was about $10 less expensive</li>
            <li> My lashes looked thin.</li>
            <li> Sadly it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I started having to wear glasses, I have been unable to find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every brand of mascara from drugstore brands to the very expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Too bad!</li>
            <li> Every mascara I have tried causes my eyes to itch terribly.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this mascara, was using Isa Dora Hypoallergenic but can&#x27;t find it any more.  I have used yours and I like it better Than the Isa Dora.  I haven&#x27;t been able to wear any kind of makeup for years now and it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itch or swell.  I used to wear makeup all the time and became allergic to it.  Wish there was shadow I could wear.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find a mascara that did not irritate my eyes or eyelids.  My eyelashes are quite sparse as well.  Fortunately I found this product and lo and behold I have eyelashes again and have not experienced eye irritation.  This mascara is great</li>
            <li> Love it..finally a product I can use</li>
            <li> I fight eye problems constantly, and this mascara does not aggrevate my eye problems.</li>
            <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  It goes on much like other mascaras but it is easy to remove.  It may come off a bit on hot days but is easily blotted away.</li>
            <li> It still causes my eyes some irritation, sadly, but then I&#x27;m VERY sensitive to eye makeup.</li>
            <li> The first beauty product I have ever purchased that has no markings on the container! The bottom says &amp;#34;Sensitive Mascara&amp;#34; with the color name.&lt;br /&gt;Because my eyes are sensitive to just about everything product-wise, I seldom wear mascara. It does take some time to dry. If you blink hard after you have applied it, it rubs off on the skin below the eyes. It doesn&#x27;t do anything to your lashes but give them color, so if you are used to using lengthening or thickening mascaras, don&#x27;t expect any of that with this product. Am still testing how long I can be comfortable wearing it. So far, it looks like I can wear this one longer than most.</li>
            <li> It felt like the mascara was washed out of an old tube.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve had this, my eye allergies and itchy eyes that I was so used to that I almost didn&#x27;t notice are gone! It&#x27;s wonderful. and I have very oily skin and havent&#x27; noticed this product migrating down my cheeks like many of the more expensive mascaras. No flaking, and it looks beautifully natural.</li>
            <li> Contents were dry, not much in the tube.</li>
            <li> Just OK. Didn&#x27;t  bother my eyes, but it hardly looked like I had any mascara on. My lashes looked thin.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every brand of mascara from drugstore brands to the very expensive ones. This mascara does not make my eyes burn like all the others I have tried. It doesn&#x27;t flake. Would recommend to anyone who has sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> This mascara works well, but I prefer the rubber applicator brushes with the rubber bristles to prevent clumping.</li>
            <li> Awesome no eye sensitivity comes off easily, I will always use this product as my go to mascara, thanks again</li>
            <li> I will order this again.  Great product!  Lashes definitely feel thicker, fuller and longer. This is the first time I used it but would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I do not have an allergy to mascara but an extreme sensitivity.  I am 76 years old and believe me, in this long life I have tried all kinds of mascara saying they were hypoallergenic, but this mascara is the first and only that actually is.  I my eyes don&#x27;t burn or turn red and I can wear it all day comfortably.  Be assured I will be ordering this mascara  and only this mascara again as soon as I need it.  Usually mascara should be discarded after using it for 3 months, but if it doesn&#x27;t last that long and even if it does, I will be ordering this product again before that just to insure that I have it on hand.  Kudos to whoever formulated this brand and to the vender.  I would and will recommend this to any of my friends who need it.</li>
            <li> It still makes my eyes water, but not as much as the other hypoallergenic mascaras I have tried.  I don&#x27;t think I could wear it all day, but it does well for a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I really love this sensitive eyes eye mascara!  I have very sensitive eyes and can&#x27;t wear over the counter products.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  I have keratoconus and my eyes are so sensitive to mascara that I had given up trying to wear it.  This does not bother my eyes.  I also love the consistency.  It does not clump up and looks very natural.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who has had trouble wearing mascara.</li>
            <li> My eyes burn while wearing most mascaras and this one was no different, unfortunately.  I have found that Bare Escentuels mascara isn&#x27;t too bad if I put it just on the upper lashes and not very thick.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my eyes like regular mascara, however I seem to need several coats to cover my lashes.</li>
            <li> After searching on Google for mascara especially for sensitive eyes I found this product and ordered it based on the positive reviews.  The first day I tried it my eyes became very red and watery and my eyelids got puffy.  I won&#x27;t try wearing it again as the discomfort is not worth the results.  There&#x27;s no point in highlighting my eyes if I look like I was just on an all night crying jag.  Amazon was very good about issuing a refund.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t normally tolerate mascara, but this stuff is OK.  By end of evening I might have a tad of irritation more from something being in my eyelashes, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me for a normal workday of 8 hours or so.  I will buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> Due to multiple eye surgeries I have very sensitive eyes that water a lot. This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve found that does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> My eyes still burned and watered with this mascara.  I was disappointed. I had read the reviews and was hopeful that this one would work for me.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth tube.  It does not smudge or flake.  Just wish it was a little easier to wash off!</li>
            <li> The product was dried out and seemed empty.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Does not cause any eye irritation that I had with other mascaras. I only wear mascara for special occasions. Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> For the past several years my eyes have become much more sensitive to mascara to the point that I stopped wearing it, which was a let down to me because I love using my shadows and eyeliner.  But made up eyes without some mascara looks very odd.  This mascara is light weigh, goes on smoothly, washes off easily.  If you&#x27;re looking for mascara the double and triple the look of your lashes this IS NOT the mascara for you..........but if you have sensitive eyes this is much better than nothing, I put two to three coats on and it stays all day without my eyes turning red or becoming itchy!</li>
            <li> I had hopes I had found a solution to not being able to wear mascara for years.  But 24-48 hours after using this product my eyelid was red and hurt a little.  Next day, whole ridge along eyelid was swollen and red and hurting.  Still does.  No more mascara for me, I&#x27;m done.  (Yes, hot compresses help, hopefully this will resolve soon.)</li>
            <li> I just wanted to rave about this mascara!  I have always had very sensitive eyes and unfortunately I could only wear mascara for about an hour(including Clinique) before my eyes started to get irritated.  I have tried everything out there including many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; touting mascaras.  I have long curly eyelashes that i wanted to play up but just gave up as nothing seemed to agree with my eye sensitivities.  When I saw the ad for this product on Amazon, i thought \\&quot;This is probably just another loser\\&quot;.  Loser??!!  What a tremendous WINNER!!!  I have worn this mascara for hours without the slightest bit of irritation!  It is unbelievable and the price is so reasonable; please never stop making this product as I am telling everyone how wonderful the mascara is!!  I would rate it a \\&quot;6\\&quot; if there were a \\&quot;6\\&quot;!!  Whatever they don&#x27;t put in this mascara is the secret; what a joy to have clear, bright eyes and not to worry about watering or itching eyes.  Thank you, Amazon, for selling such a great find!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I really liked this mascara; the color, the texture, the durability. No flaking or rubbing off. For the price, it&#x27;s really, really good. But my eyes itched wearing it, so I threw it out.  Not the fault of the makeup: I am highly allergic to many things. Give it a try; worth the money; it may work for you. Good for older women who don&#x27;t want a lot of goo on their lashes. So I gave it four stars even though I cannot wear it. So far, the only mascara I could wear was a masque made out of walnut shells which is off the market.  Too bad!</li>
            <li> Most mascaras make my eyes water. I thought this product was my answer, but they still watered and they sting. Thanks</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work and gave it several tries. While it is the least irritating mascara I have ever used, I did experience some irritation after wearing for a few hours. But my eyes are so sensitive that I have not found any makeup I can wear on or around my eyes. I think it&#x27;s worth a try for anyone with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding mascara that didn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  This mascara is wonderful and it has been great to be able to wear it without any problems.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Every mascara I have tried causes my eyes to itch terribly.  This mascara is wonderful--no itching whatsoever and no flakes.</li>
            <li> I am glad I tried it.  And more glad that you offer a product like this to sensitive eye people, and I for sure will order again</li>
            <li> After using the product, my eyes are still irritated, do not think it is really helpful for irritated eyes</li>
            <li> My eyes have no reaction to it which is very important to me. However as it says it&#x27;s dark chocolate not black and therefore it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes as pretty as I want them to</li>
            <li> Full of parabens, returned product.</li>
            <li> I believe this is a knockoff of the 3D fiber lashes made by Younique. I am a presenter who sells it and it is made with natural products. Same look and case....</li>
            <li> First mascara in a long time that does not make me &amp;#34;tear up&amp;#34;.  Not sure what is in it, or rather, what is NOT.  I love it.  I even use it as a &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; with other product on top, only on the outer half of my lashes to build them up.  That works without the allergic reaction as well.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and my prior mascara was no longer being manufactured.  This mascara is a real find.  It does not flake and best of all does not make my eyes sting or water.  Thank you for being my new go-to mascara.</li>
            <li> I have lots of allergies and this is the only Mascara I can wear on a daily bases.</li>
            <li> This is what I would call a nice &amp;#34;every day&amp;#34; mascara.  That is, it isn&#x27;t so think that you look like you&#x27;re going out to a formal event when you put it on -- it is in fact light and yet - thick enough to enhance without &amp;#34;overdoing&amp;#34; it.  When I want a more dramatic look I put this on first (I have a theory that since it is hypoallergenic I should put it closest to my eyes) and then put my other non-hyopallergenic mascara on top of it.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to do entirely without this mascara as, like I said, it is a very nice daily wear cosmetic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for truly hypoallergenic and gentle eye make-up and had hoped that this would be it.  Sadly it wasn&#x27;t.  This was no better than Almay and more expensive.  I tried it twice and couldn&#x27;t wear it because of the irritation it caused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been through more mascaras than I can count trying to find one that won&#x27;t irritate my eyes after a few hours. This one was better than many others, but if I have it on for several hours, I still start to get some burning sensation in my eyes. Ever since I started having to wear glasses, I have been unable to find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes. This one could be a good choice for most people, but it&#x27;s just OK for me.</li>
            <li> Was never able to wear mascara before without my eyes stinging.  I have no problem with this whatsoever.</li>
            <li> The mascara is okay, just not as thick as I would like and does not last long.  Not sure if I would recomment this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, haven&#x27;t worn any eye make up for years because of the burning and watery eyes. This mascara feels like I have nothing on, love it. I&#x27;ve tried every brand, all of them made my eyes burn. This one works!</li>
            <li> This will be my go to mascara. It does not itch or burn my eyes. Runs a little easier than water proof, but hey, for the sake of my eye health, that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and I will definitely order it again. Had problems with other mascaras my eyes would start to weep in the morning. Do not have this problem with this hypoallergenic mascara.</li>
            <li> this item is junk. after applying 6 coats, you still couldnt tell I had mascara on.disgusted with the waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have very sensative skin and eyes so I never use mascara, so I took a gamble on this mascara and it was awesome no problems and made my lashes full and beautiful, was easy to remove as well.... thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I have only tried this once, but I literally forgot I had it on.  I don&#x27;t wear mascara often, and my eyes have become VERY sensitive to it.  I have not been able to find ANY mascara I could tolerate for more than an hour or so.  I put this on in the morning, and forgot about it.  When I rubbed my eye later in the eve, I remembered I had it on.</li>
            <li> Not very good.  Seemed to be dried up when it arrived!  Do not recommend</li>
            <li> Mascara really irritates my eyes. This brand is the only one I have I found that doesn&#x27;t bother them.</li>
            <li> Works well gave it a 4 as its a bit thin/takes a while to dry. I have long lashes and it ends up as polkadots on my eye lids if I don&#x27;t keep them closed for a few minutes! They don&#x27;t make my old brand anymore, am glad to find a new one that doesn&#x27;t bother me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a week or two and I really like the way it goes on - no clumps or stuck-together lashes, just color.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge so far, which is good.  It&#x27;s kind of hard to wash off - I seem to have to wash twice to get it all off.  Definitely not a deal-breaker at all.  I&#x27;d recommend it if you don&#x27;t want all the lengthening-thickening-curling stuff that&#x27;s in most mascaras these days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a mascara I can use. My eyes started reacting to mascara and had to get a very expensive ointment to clear them up. I tried this mascara and had the same reaction I&#x27;ve had with other mascaras. I&#x27;m giving my eyelases a rest and hopefully it will be ok after a few months.</li>
            <li> I searched Amazon for a name brand mascara that I had used previously, and it displayed other mascaras that people had looked at along with the one I had searched for.  This one which was about $10 less expensive, so I thought I would give it a try.  The packaging and tube were very understated compared to the name brand, and I realized that I had inadvertently ordered Black/Brown instead of Black which I&#x27;ve always used in the past.  I decided to keep it, and I was pleasantly surprised.  It&#x27;s just a shade lighter than black and probably looks a little more natural with my blonde hair.  But the biggest surprise was how nicely it thickens my thin lashes with no clumping.  Like the name brand mascara, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, and it seems to stay on better than other one did, yet I can easily remove it with a tissue and water at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 days, but so far no itching.  Keeping my fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive eyes w/ chronic dry eye syndrome to boot; so no, unfortunately I didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
