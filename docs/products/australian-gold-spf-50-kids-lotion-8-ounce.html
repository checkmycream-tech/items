            <li>I have no complaints,  smells good, not greasy</li>

            <li>Exceptional sun protection.</li>
            <li>I found this on vacation in Cancun and was glad to pick some up on Amazon!</li>

            <li>smells nice</li>
            <li>This product is nice and it coats well and also protects well</li>
            <li>Another good product, but Australian gold smells best</li>
            <li>This brand has become our favorite because there is no sticky or slimy feel and the scent is pleasant but light.</li>
            <li>I love this also , great for summer , very moisturising &amp; staying on after swimming also , maybe I apply two times after a day at the beach.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am about to order another supply through Amazon as they seem to have the best prices on Australian Gold products.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>If you are going to be at the beach all day, then the scent is okay.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Gonna stick with it till I find something better.</li>
            <li>I just love it -</li>
            <li>so glad I found it here</li>
            <li>I was furious, I thought lotions were OK to take on carry-on....</li>
            <li>This is now one of my &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; items, along with the Face version, which I love, too.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for anything more than that in a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I burn easily and have tried many 50+ sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Of course the smell is amazing, but I have never had a sunburn with Aussie Gold and we go to some really hot places!  </li>
            <li>High SPF, smells great, goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Australian Gold offers a great variety of SPFs to accommodate everyone&#x27;s needs and even have those that include bronzers to get your beautiful tan started.  </li>
            <li>Easy application.</li>
            <li>but the scent is a bit strong.  </li>
            <li>not greasy, not oily, no white cast, moisturizes like a lotion/cream, great protection (</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>so we use a special formula for faces for the kiddos.</li>
            <li>Scent is refreshing and very &amp;#34;vacation.&amp;#34; This is now our go-to sun protection.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It rubs in quickly with no oily residue.</li>
            <li>We have had some warm days here in the Las Vegas desert, but not extreme yet.</li>
            <li>I first came across this product on a European Cruise, and loved the scent and feel of this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Bought our first bottle in NYC after sunburning on the hop-on hop-off tour!  </li>
            <li>and she was burned to a crisp!</li>
            <li>We even used it on our faces and sensitive areas and were fine.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>My first time using this product.</li>
            <li>love Australian gold products</li>
            <li>A really gold skin tone!</li>
            <li>I have used australian gold product for more than 20 years.  </li>
            <li>Australian Gold is my favorite sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*Update- Feels like a lotion, makes your skin smooth, soft and moisturized throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I always love Australian Gold brand.  </li>
            <li>Has a good smell and lasts under heavy water exposure.</li>
            <li>tried.&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof for long time.&lt;br /&gt;In Italy it costs more than from USA with shipping and taxes.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m certainly paler than than I would be without anything.</li>
            <li>+ is also available as the babies version, which seems to be the same without the tropical aroma.</li>
            <li>We used 50 SPF and my two children, my husband and myself came back lightly tanned but not burnt.  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen REALLY works well.  </li>
            <li>It really protects.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m going to purchase more for sure before we go back down again!!  </li>
            <li>high spf</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I have used Australian Gold for at least 5 years and am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>IF THEY HAVE DROPPED THIS FROM THEIR NEW FORMULA, THE ABOVE REVIEW MAY NO LONGER BE VALID!!!</li>
            <li>I used to only use a sensitive skin sunscreen with a high spf (also found at your local drugstore), but I&#x27;d still burn, as I have pretty pale white skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly greasy, but it soaks in and goes on really quickly - so that greasy feeling doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad scent but not really what I want to smell like everyday.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> kind of like coconut gone bad tossed and turned with a chemical in a wild, passionate, regrettable night.</li>
            <li> Long lasting protection.</li>
            <li> I was so anxious to try this highly rated sunscreen on our vacation</li>
            <li> Nothing to harsh but could be fixed</li>
            <li> This is really thick and goopy but blends really well.</li>
            <li> The 50 is just for the extreme case when I&#x27;ll be baking in the sun for long.</li>
            <li> I usually burn like a lobster after being in the sun for 20 minutes but this actually protects me.</li>
            <li> I usually use SPF 30 from same brand.</li>
            <li> However, whenever I use it on my face it burns a little.</li>

            <li> Since I have skin cancer, I have to wear sunscreen everyday.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday -</li>
            <li> I use it every day all year round.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> bad part is that I had half a bottle left and accidentally left it in the kayak down in Florida :(  --</li>
            <li> thick cream... rubs in well...</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m disappointed because I have the Australian Gold Bronzer SPF 30</li>
            <li> weird smell,</li>
            <li> but sadly it was removed at airport going thru security.</li>
            <li> wrong!</li>
            <li> I used it for my holidays and got very bad sunburned.</li>
            <li> A very bad protector.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this also , great for summer , very moisturising &amp; staying on after swimming also , maybe I apply two times after a day at the beach.</li>
            <li> It took my eyes 4 days to heal with tons of alow-vera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful, it should NOT touch the skin near your eyes. Never happened to me before. I didn&#x27;t assume they use such harmful chemicals but they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like their Face Guard but not this product.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. I used to only use a sensitive skin sunscreen with a high spf (also found at your local drugstore), but I&#x27;d still burn, as I have pretty pale white skin.  I usually burn like a lobster after being in the sun for 20 minutes but this actually protects me. It&#x27;s slightly greasy, but it soaks in and goes on really quickly - so that greasy feeling doesn&#x27;t last long. My go to sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I used it for my holidays and got very bad sunburned. A very bad protector.</li>
            <li> I burn easily and have tried many 50+ sunscreens. I came across Australian gold by accident and was stunned at the improved protection. Nothing else comes close. This 50+ is also available as the babies version, which seems to be the same without the tropical aroma. I&#x27;d just as soon get the one without the smell, but this formula protects like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried!!!  HOWEVER, THE ABOVE WAS WITH THE SUNSCREEN INCLUDING TITANIUM DIOXIDE. IF THEY HAVE DROPPED THIS FROM THEIR NEW FORMULA, THE ABOVE REVIEW MAY NO LONGER BE VALID!!!</li>
            <li> Has a good smell and lasts under heavy water exposure. I found this on vacation in Cancun and was glad to pick some up on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Australian Gold before so I knew what to expect.  This is exactly what I wanted.  High SPF, smells great, goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Great smell and feel. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have used Australian Gold for at least 5 years and am very pleased with it.  Does a great job of protecting my skin, never feels greasy and has a pleasant smell. Australian Gold offers a great variety of SPFs to accommodate everyone&#x27;s needs and even have those that include bronzers to get your beautiful tan started.  I am about to order another supply through Amazon as they seem to have the best prices on Australian Gold products.  Order yours today!</li>
            <li> I like this products but container burst because the way it was packaged so I put what was left in another container.</li>
            <li> smells nice... good coverage... thick cream... rubs in well... high spf</li>
            <li> Exceptional sun protection. I bought it again because it is the best that I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof for long time.&lt;br /&gt;In Italy it costs more than from USA with shipping and taxes.</li>
            <li> Australians are supposed to be an expert at sunscreens and after trying this I agree with this statement! This is really thick and goopy but blends really well. Provided excellent protection against the strong Caribbean sun.</li>
            <li> Bought our first bottle in NYC after sunburning on the hop-on hop-off tour!  Soothing :o)  Long lasting protection. Easy application. Scent is refreshing and very &amp;#34;vacation.&amp;#34; This is now our go-to sun protection.</li>
            <li> Most sunscreens do what they&#x27;re supposed to when you follow the instructions and don&#x27;t miss a spot! This brand has become our favorite because there is no sticky or slimy feel and the scent is pleasant but light. Sunscreen is a hit if you can sit inside for lunch without feeling like you shouldn&#x27;t touch the furniture.</li>
            <li> I usually use SPF 30 from same brand. The 50 is just for the extreme case when I&#x27;ll be baking in the sun for long.</li>
            <li> My first time using this product. We have had some warm days here in the Las Vegas desert, but not extreme yet. So far so good</li>
            <li> I have no complaints,  smells good, not greasy and it does the job. I also purchased &#x27;sun bum&amp;#34; . Another good product, but Australian gold smells best</li>
            <li> love Australian gold products</li>
            <li> It works. However, whenever I use it on my face it burns a little. Nothing to harsh but could be fixed I believe</li>
            <li> Makes my face tingle as if getting a sun burn. I have sensitive skin so it may be an ingredient.</li>
            <li> Queda perecto el bronceado! A really gold skin tone! Love it</li>
            <li> Smells just like it used to when I was slave to the tanning bed. Now, the smell is connected to the idea that the skin is protected. Good buy!! Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sunscreen with \\&quot;safe\\&quot; ingredients, my research said this was a good one. I would prefer a different scent it&#x27;s a little \\&quot;air freshener orange\\&quot; to me (my husband says he like it but what does he know?!) A friend and I were at an event all day, at the end I looked at her and she was burned to a crisp! She hadn&#x27;t worn sunscreen at all but I was so thankful I had. I spend a lot of time outside and have browned up over the summer but never burned and I&#x27;m certainly paler than than I would be without anything. I put sunscreen on everyday after I get out of the shower. This stuff works great!</li>
            <li> Since I have skin cancer, I have to wear sunscreen everyday.  This product is nice and it coats well and also protects well but the scent is a bit strong.  It&#x27;s not a bad scent but not really what I want to smell like everyday.  If you are going to be at the beach all day, then the scent is okay.</li>
            <li> This 50+ sun lotion is the only one that we have found that doesn&#x27;t cause a reaction on my wife&#x27;s skin. It provides the protection as stated and when we used it on a Mediteranian cruise last year, neither of us got sunburnt. It rubs in quickly with no oily residue.</li>
            <li> I have used australian gold product for more than 20 years.  It is the only sunscreen I trust.  If you use it, you won&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Of course the smell is amazing, but I have never had a sunburn with Aussie Gold and we go to some really hot places!  Being a sun lover I always try different products, but I&#x27;m sticking with this one!</li>
            <li> Australian Gold is my favorite sunscreen.  We just got back from Florida where we went kayaking and played in the pool, ocean etc.  We used 50 SPF and my two children, my husband and myself came back lightly tanned but not burnt.  The sunscreen REALLY works well.  We even used it on our faces and sensitive areas and were fine.  I reapplied it every couple of hours (especially when we were out in the bay kayaking all day) and it did wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad part is that I had half a bottle left and accidentally left it in the kayak down in Florida :(  -- but I&#x27;m going to purchase more for sure before we go back down again!!  Highly recommend this sunscreen.  It really protects.</li>
            <li> I received this today. Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;Pros- not greasy, not oily, no white cast, moisturizes like a lotion/cream, great protection (SPF 50)&lt;br /&gt;Cons- weird smell, kind of like coconut gone bad tossed and turned with a chemical in a wild, passionate, regrettable night. :/ I have to say I&#x27;m disappointed because I have the Australian Gold Bronzer SPF 30 and it has an orange creamsicle smell. I thought this product would have it too, but it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update- Feels like a lotion, makes your skin smooth, soft and moisturized throughout the day. Product is perfect except for the smell. Gonna stick with it till I find something better.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday - I just love it - so glad I found it here</li>
            <li> I was so anxious to try this highly rated sunscreen on our vacation but sadly it was removed at airport going thru security. I was furious, I thought lotions were OK to take on carry-on....wrong! I guess I will have to reorder again to try.  eeerrrr</li>
            <li> I first came across this product on a European Cruise, and loved the scent and feel of this sunscreen. I looked everywhere I went when I got home to find it locally without any luck, until I checked Amazon. This is now one of my &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; items, along with the Face version, which I love, too. I use it every day all year round. Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. It works, feels nice and has a great scent!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as SPF 30, but it is the best sun lotion.</li>
            <li> Works great. We NEVER burn. It does sting my kids face so we use a special formula for faces for the kiddos.</li>
            <li> I always love Australian Gold brand.  Works well and has a great scent.  Can&#x27;t ask for anything more than that in a sunscreen.</li>
