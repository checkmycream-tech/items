            <li>They are  the best I have found.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s good for the price</li>
            <li>At a good price, too.  </li>
            <li>I have had a devil of a time finding good hair rollers.  </li>
            <li>They take a good 15-20 minutes to heat up but do curl my hair.</li>
            <li>These are like the good ones I used to have 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get good heat like that.  </li>
            <li>The set seems to heat to a good temperature but the rollers ruin the set.  </li>
            <li>Tried and True - used this product for years!!!</li>
            <li>Works great and easy to use!</li>
            <li>Yesssssssss I love my hair rollars and they do a great job  and make my hair look like ive been to the hair dressers</li>
            <li>These rollers heat up nicely and provide a good curl.  </li>
            <li>When I received it, the curler sizes were right, and I thought it would be a perfect replacement.  </li>
            <li>And I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>These grip nicely, and the set holds.  </li>
            <li>Heat nicely.</li>
            <li>Curls my hair nicely.</li>
            <li>I knew I want this kind because of the &amp;#34;bobby pin&amp;#34; type clips.</li>
            <li>I think this should be removed from Amazon website before it taints its reputation for carrying qualities items from reliable, honest manufacturers.</li>
            <li>Heats up quick and my hair curls great, I love it!</li>
            <li>It is surprising to learn Amazon.com would associate with a seller who does not have a more appropriate policy in handling defective products.  </li>
            <li>Great for a quick fix for a night out.</li>
            <li>It heats up quick and  works great.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and take off.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Even if I squeeze them to make them narrower, they stretch out as soon as they are placed over the roller, making the rollers fall out very easily.</li>
            <li>am keeping the set as it is the best I have found so far, but  I would not buy this set again.</li>
            <li>but I would go with something better.</li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I am glad they have ridges in them because without the ridges, my hair wont curl.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found them.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in a hurry or a rush, make sure you turn them on before you get in the shower</li>
            <li>I love the on/off switch....</li>
            <li>Make sure you pay attenion to where each size curler goes</li>
            <li>This is the second best hair setter I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>It has an on/off switch with a light, too -- something I prefer to having to plug and unplug!</li>
            <li>I use this product ever week and love it.  </li>
            <li>The rollers stay where u put them and secure nicely.  </li>
            <li>I am glad Amazon had it listed, I could not find this item in any store in town.</li>
            <li>I am pleased I bought them.</li>
            <li>The top of the roller shows which direction to put on the post.  </li>
            <li>I prefer rollers with ribs because they tend to hold my hair better.</li>
            <li>I compared it to the Clairol Kindness it has more grip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>but I need a lot more heat to keep my curls.  </li>
            <li>(really good and hot</li>
            <li>These rollers remind me of my mothers original set!</li>
            <li>If you want only warm rollers, these are great.  </li>
            <li>It has an on/off switch, slots to hold the curler pins, and does a really good job curling my stubborn, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>The instructions say it takes 15 min to warm up, and that&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>I have a Hot Tools curling iron and LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>(I had bought a set of hot rollers from Bed Bath and Beyond for a lot more $$$ with plastic clips that made \\&quot;dents\\&quot; in my hair!  </li>
            <li>and I received them very quickly.</li>
            <li>They fall out easily.  </li>
            <li>They were perfect - getting real hot, and each curler stayed in my hair without slipping.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love my new rollers!</li>
            <li>That said, in my opinion, they are the best of the hot rollers currently on the market.  </li>
            <li>Hot tools makes the best products around, these Hot Rollers even curl my super straight hair.</li>
            <li>I love my hot rollers and use them every day!</li>
            <li>Also sets the hair adequately in about 20 minutes - perfect for doing other things while they are working.  </li>
            <li>It has a compact shape that would easily fit into a bag.</li>
            <li>they won&#x27;t fit otherwise.</li>
            <li>I had not bought new hot rollers in over twenty years and they have made great improvements in the design.</li>
            <li>The right curlers, the right sizes (and the right amounts), and good clips.  </li>
            <li>I had an old set of Clairol hot rollers for over 15 years and they were great.  </li>
            <li>Pleased with the hot rollers</li>
            <li>This is my first set of hot rollers and I love them!</li>
            <li>I chose these rollers because someone had said that they were the most like the hot rollers our mothers had in the 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I have used hot rollers for years and I like a set that gets nice and hot.  </li>
            <li>Even with the medal pins, they slip right out!  </li>
            <li>need that amount to set my full head.</li>
            <li>However, I like everything else about these rollers, so I am changing my routine to make sure these are ready when I need them.</li>
            <li>My hair seems to take the curl very well, so I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
            <li>(if I am clumsy or what have you), but basically they are just really great!  </li>
            <li>I wish that had been a true statement.  </li>
            <li>They heat up well and hold the curl like the old Clairol hot rollers I used as a kid (and LOVED).</li>
            <li>I LOVE the on/off button (other one I had to unplug for off), doesn&#x27;t hold ends of hair to begin rolling as much as I wish it did, but works great when started rolling.</li>
            <li>The cool touch ends are fine, but I find when using them, I have to also touch the hot part.  </li>
            <li>It may get better with more use or if I had left them in longer.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this set, it heats quickly, curls well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick</li>
            <li>I have had a Hot Tools hot rollers set like this for many years but it was time for a replacement.</li>
            <li>The rollers get very hot and do it quickly.</li>
            <li>Think you&#x27;re better off spending a little more for something that is better made.</li>
            <li>They heat up very hot</li>
            <li>You must put the roller on exactly correct for it to fit on the post.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a long time since I used this type of product and found it just as good as ever.</li>
            <li>I like the Clairol ones, these don&#x27;t warm up very quickly or make it hold curl very long.  </li>
            <li>They work really well and don&#x27;t get too hot to handle :)</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold much of a curl.  </li>
            <li>The Hot Tools Hot Setter works fine if you have A LOT of patience.  </li>
            <li>secure the hair very well.</li>
            <li>I have found that this type of roller works far better to form a curl in my hair than the type with the fuzzy coating.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Would have liked extra clips included.</li>
            <li>I love my hair now that I have the Hot Tools Professional.</li>
            <li>The initial curls were bouncy and beautiful, but mine fell out after I brushed my hair into style.  </li>
            <li>I love these hot rollers, they are just like my old set from the 80&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It works as well...or better than my old hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>kind of roller gives more of a long lasting curl on my hair....</li>
            <li>I finally had to replace my old Clairol hot rollers, and wanted something really good to replace them.  </li>
            <li>I have very straight, shoulder-length, hard-to-curl hair.</li>
            <li>She likes them very much.</li>
            <li>This set is very much like the one it is replacing.  </li>
            <li>on the original has a rack type surface the new one the surface has nothing to hold hair in pla ce on roller</li>
            <li>Overall,  I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found the rollers get too hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li>so they have time to get hot.  </li>
            <li>Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 rating is that the plastic top came cracked.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Does not get as hot as I would like it to have it.  </li>
            <li>They either do not get hot or die within a month.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these hot rollers for myself and now just purchased another set for my mom.  </li>
            <li>I love these plastic rollers and they get hot enough to hold a curl.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product![[ASIN:B0010VGB6K Hot Tools</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks use,  the roller machine quit getting hot,  and Amazon wouldn&#x27;t  replace it.  </li>
            <li>While I have no problem with the manufacturer (Hot Tools), I would never buy hot rollers with ribs again.  </li>
            <li>i had a set of hot rollers for over 20 years and had no problems with them.</li>
            <li>They do get hot ...</li>
            <li>Well, they need to be hot to do the job</li>
            <li>and sometimes they are a bit hot</li>
            <li>Much faster than using just a curling iron!</li>
            <li>If you want HOT rollers, keep looking.  </li>
            <li>But some sections of hair turned out better than others, resulting in drastically different levels of curl around my head.  </li>
            <li>The reason for this is so I don&#x27;t have to open and shut the case too many times.</li>
            <li>I thought I saw the heating spindle went all the way up through the hot roller</li>
            <li>I have used hot rollers</li>
            <li>I got these for my wife for Christmas, because her original set, 25 years old, bit the dust.  </li>
            <li>Professional 1321 Hot Rollers with Ribs and Cool Touch Ends,</li>
            <li>I love this product cuz it has all the sizes I want (small for certain areas and larger and LARGE as needed and a good balance of each size).  </li>
            <li>The other longer heating rods seemed far superior.</li>
            <li>and it is my opinion that this causes the rollers to take forever to heat up and they just don&#x27;t get as warm as the previous sets that I owned.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s &amp;#34;hinges&amp;#34; quite easily so you&#x27;re always trying to put it back together.</li>
            <li>I cannot even use the large rollers on my hair as they would form almost no curl.</li>
            <li>but i can&#x27;t travel with it without keeping it in a large plastic bag and having to reassemble it to use it.</li>
            <li>The Hot Tools 1321 Hot Rollers came early and was exactly as advertise.  </li>
            <li>they give you a nice tight curl so that it lasts for the day/evening.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are fine but some of the clips to hold the rollers in my hair are too big and will not stay around the roller.  </li>
            <li>Back in ancient history, I owned the original Clairol hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>I cannot return the set because due to some health issues with my pup, I was very busy with her and her vet stay with acute pancreatitis and</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The smallest rollers in this set curl my hair very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks for prompt sending.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I used to have a Clairol 90 second heat up roller set - those things would curl and smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair came ouit very fly-away.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I returned it as it was very time consuming waiting for the product to be ready</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn you or anything, but no one should assume you don&#x27;t need to work with the whole roller.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This product is very unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li>The unit takes way too much time to heat and the clips don&#x27;t really hold the hair.</li>
            <li>H.eats up fast - like that.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; hair very well when rolled.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very flimsy and comes off of</li>
            <li>and it never seemed warm enough to actually have any affect on my hair.</li>
            <li>they cool down much more quickly than my old set did and therefore don&#x27;t hold the curl for as long.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to today - the Hot Tools 1321 rollers get hot enough, but they have no &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; to stay in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I would have requested new set, but I had to leave town to take care of my Mother postoperative &amp; out of state!  </li>
            <li>Last two sets of hot rollers were the velvet rollers and after them constantly falling apart, decided to go back to this kind.  </li>
            <li>Previous products were more durable.  </li>
            <li>Get hot enough, but not too hot</li>
            <li>I looked at several different sets and read many reviews.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t really get hot enough.</li>
            <li>That surprised me since my old set was hot in about 5 to 8 min.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I still can but time has slipped by using my old set of Remington flocked rollers 10+ years old and sadly not made anymore.</li>
            <li>without the outside shell (which i attempted to tape back together) the hot rollers still work but don&#x27;t seem to heat up as quickly or retain the heat as well.</li>
            <li>so I could put them back in the right order.</li>
            <li>I am matching the right clips with the different sized rollers.  </li>
            <li>However, they are not like the Hot Tools with the original round extended post.  </li>
            <li>tossed it and got new ones</li>
            <li>This item is similar to my old 25 year old Vidal Sassoon hot rollers, which still work and get much hotter.  </li>
            <li>These hot rollers were one set of very few available without the flocked coating on the rollers.  </li>
            <li>After researching hot rollers for months (because I have been in need for a new set for two yrs now), I finally opted for this set.  </li>
            <li>I am having to use the curling iron prior to using the hot rollers each and every morning.  </li>
            <li>This is the 5th set of hot rollers that I currently possess.</li>
            <li>My last set, purchased in a brick and mortar store, created funny lines across my hair.  </li>
            <li>In the case, there were 6 (not 4) small rollers and 8 (not 10) medium (2 BONUS mediums were included but without clips).  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li>Rollers do not instantly start falling out as with so many other brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second set of these hot rollers.</li>
            <li>THESE ROLLERS DO NOT GET HOT ENOUGH.  </li>
            <li>of them get hot enough to curl my hair</li>
            <li>Wish they had more small rollers in it.  </li>
            <li>You will want to get extra pins because this set comes with exact amount of pins.</li>
            <li>I have waited a long time to find new hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I gave these a four star instead of five is because it&#x27;s somewhat easy to mix the pins up and put a smaller pin on a bigger roller</li>
            <li>Fortunately I saved the clips from several previous roller sets so have something much stronger and tighter to use.</li>
            <li>It was advertised that rollers stay hot but cool to the touch,  but not hot enough,  I expected better product compared to other brand what I purchased before.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair short so all of the large rollers I never use.</li>
            <li>I recommend staying clear of this seller.</li>
            <li>I bought this product in hopes that it would replace my old set of curlers.  </li>
            <li>I read other reviews with the mention that the rollers did not get very hot.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t heat up like my old ones.  </li>
            <li>I only had about 1 hour to get ready to go.  </li>
            <li>But these heat up in 10-15 minutes, do not leave unsightly lines, and put in enough curl that I have reasonable waves again.  </li>
            <li>Because I have naturally curly hair, they seem to hold all day even if I have straightened my hair the day before.</li>
            <li>I looked everywhere for this set when my old ones went out.  </li>
            <li>Replaced identical 8 year old item.  </li>
            <li>I AM SO COMPLETELY UNSATISFIED, DID NOIT EVEN LOOKI</li>
            <li>and I have naturally curly hair anyway.  </li>
            <li>This replaced an old one that still worked but was slowly taking longer to heat, and was falling apart the more I packed it to travel.</li>
            <li>They heat up super fast and don&#x27;t  leave funky ends, as long as your careful when rolling .</li>
            <li>Since hot rollers are meant to utilize with dry hair...</li>
            <li>Gives my hair a lot of bounce and they curl my otherwise straight, flat hair and gives it body!  </li>
            <li>so I was very happy that this one survived the shipping only to be disappointed by the lack of performance.</li>
            <li>i bought these to replace the other ones thinking they were all pretty much the same...</li>
            <li>The set before that was so old, it took an hour to heat up adequately - what a waste of electricity.  </li>
            <li>I had used this kind of hard ribbed roller in the past and forgot how much I missed them.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how people who use a single roller wand ever get ready for work.  </li>
            <li>I tried all over to find these hot  rollars  with the ribs to grab the hair  as the other type , rollars just fell out .</li>
            <li>Other than that design flaw, I think they&#x27;re exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, course, curly hair though, so for normal hair, they are probably fine.</li>
            <li>But again, they are fine if you have plain white girl hair, unlike my Jewish afro.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;do not heat well enough to completely curl, and the pins do&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li>I wish a company would produce something like the old Clairol set to hold the hair in place on the rollers properly.  </li>
            <li>So few of the new hot rollers get hot enough to curl my thick, straight hair.</li>
            <li>The top was hard to re-open after I clicked it closed for storage.  </li>
            <li>The red dots on my old set turn black when they are ready.    </li>
            <li>product as I expected but haven&#x27;t used much as my hair is still a bit short.  </li>
            <li>I have bought several sets and was not happy I am glad that I found these</li>
            <li>was not happy with the hot rollers,i expected the rollers to get very hot,since the product was from hot tools,i have long hair,very fine,the product didn&#x27;t keep the curl in my hair.</li>
            <li>As long as you know how to use them, you will get soft wavy curls.</li>
            <li>I wish I had done that with the Hot Tools set I bought in 2006 when the posts were round and extended the length of the roller.</li>
            <li>The stem that you put the curler on is very short, not a long prong like stem</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair and the electric rollers with clamps kept falling out.  </li>
            <li>For people with thin or fine hair, I would recommend these.</li>
            <li>I have thin, baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The curlers heat up fine, however, the container is really poorly designed and I think will crack in no time.  </li>
            <li>I wish the entire set were made up of these small rollers, as the medium sized rollers form a loose curl which falls out quickly.  </li>

            <li> Sometimes fancy isn&#x27;t always best.</li>

            <li> Theses curlers are awesome!</li>
            <li> The best one, they no longer make, but this is as close to that hair setter as one can get.  </li>
            <li> They are  the best I have found.</li>
            <li> It must be just what is needed to do a good job of getting that hair perfect as my wife had me order another set.</li>
            <li> Yes, I read ALL reviews and even read where some consumers experienced a heating problem with this set, I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> and they work great.  </li>

            <li> Great set.</li>
            <li> Great set</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this product, and it is probably the best of its type.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price</li>
            <li> At a good price, too.  </li>
            <li> I have had a devil of a time finding good hair rollers.  </li>
            <li> They take a good 15-20 minutes to heat up but do curl my hair.</li>
            <li> These are like the good ones I used to have 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get good heat like that.  </li>
            <li> The set seems to heat to a good temperature but the rollers ruin the set.  </li>
            <li> Tried and True - used this product for years!!!</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Yesssssssss I love my hair rollars and they do a great job  and make my hair look like ive been to the hair dressers</li>
            <li> These rollers heat up nicely and provide a good curl.  </li>
            <li> When I received it, the curler sizes were right, and I thought it would be a perfect replacement.  </li>
            <li> And I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> These grip nicely, and the set holds.  </li>
            <li> Heat nicely.</li>
            <li> Curls my hair nicely.</li>
            <li> I knew I want this kind because of the &amp;#34;bobby pin&amp;#34; type clips.</li>
            <li> I think this should be removed from Amazon website before it taints its reputation for carrying qualities items from reliable, honest manufacturers.</li>
            <li> Heats up quick and my hair curls great, I love it!</li>
            <li> It is surprising to learn Amazon.com would associate with a seller who does not have a more appropriate policy in handling defective products.  </li>
            <li> Great for a quick fix for a night out.</li>
            <li> It heats up quick and  works great.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and take off.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Even if I squeeze them to make them narrower, they stretch out as soon as they are placed over the roller, making the rollers fall out very easily.</li>
            <li> am keeping the set as it is the best I have found so far, but  I would not buy this set again.</li>
            <li> but I would go with something better.</li>
            <li> Glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I am glad they have ridges in them because without the ridges, my hair wont curl.  </li>
            <li> Glad I found them.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in a hurry or a rush, make sure you turn them on before you get in the shower</li>
            <li> I love the on/off switch....</li>
            <li> Make sure you pay attenion to where each size curler goes</li>
            <li> This is the second best hair setter I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> It has an on/off switch with a light, too -- something I prefer to having to plug and unplug!</li>
            <li> I use this product ever week and love it.  </li>
            <li> The rollers stay where u put them and secure nicely.  </li>
            <li> I am glad Amazon had it listed, I could not find this item in any store in town.</li>
            <li> I am pleased I bought them.</li>
            <li> The top of the roller shows which direction to put on the post.  </li>
            <li> I prefer rollers with ribs because they tend to hold my hair better.</li>
            <li> I compared it to the Clairol Kindness it has more grip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> but I need a lot more heat to keep my curls.  </li>
            <li> (really good and hot</li>
            <li> These rollers remind me of my mothers original set!</li>
            <li> If you want only warm rollers, these are great.  </li>
            <li> It has an on/off switch, slots to hold the curler pins, and does a really good job curling my stubborn, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say it takes 15 min to warm up, and that&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li> I have a Hot Tools curling iron and LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> (I had bought a set of hot rollers from Bed Bath and Beyond for a lot more $$$ with plastic clips that made \\&quot;dents\\&quot; in my hair!  </li>
            <li> and I received them very quickly.</li>
            <li> They fall out easily.  </li>
            <li> They were perfect - getting real hot, and each curler stayed in my hair without slipping.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love my new rollers!</li>
            <li> That said, in my opinion, they are the best of the hot rollers currently on the market.  </li>
            <li> Hot tools makes the best products around, these Hot Rollers even curl my super straight hair.</li>
            <li> I love my hot rollers and use them every day!</li>
            <li> Also sets the hair adequately in about 20 minutes - perfect for doing other things while they are working.  </li>
            <li> It has a compact shape that would easily fit into a bag.</li>
            <li> they won&#x27;t fit otherwise.</li>
            <li> I had not bought new hot rollers in over twenty years and they have made great improvements in the design.</li>
            <li> The right curlers, the right sizes (and the right amounts), and good clips.  </li>
            <li> I had an old set of Clairol hot rollers for over 15 years and they were great.  </li>
            <li> Pleased with the hot rollers</li>
            <li> This is my first set of hot rollers and I love them!</li>
            <li> I chose these rollers because someone had said that they were the most like the hot rollers our mothers had in the 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I have used hot rollers for years and I like a set that gets nice and hot.  </li>
            <li> Even with the medal pins, they slip right out!  </li>
            <li> need that amount to set my full head.</li>
            <li> However, I like everything else about these rollers, so I am changing my routine to make sure these are ready when I need them.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to take the curl very well, so I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
            <li> (if I am clumsy or what have you), but basically they are just really great!  </li>
            <li> I wish that had been a true statement.  </li>
            <li> They heat up well and hold the curl like the old Clairol hot rollers I used as a kid (and LOVED).</li>
            <li> I LOVE the on/off button (other one I had to unplug for off), doesn&#x27;t hold ends of hair to begin rolling as much as I wish it did, but works great when started rolling.</li>
            <li> The cool touch ends are fine, but I find when using them, I have to also touch the hot part.  </li>
            <li> It may get better with more use or if I had left them in longer.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this set, it heats quickly, curls well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick</li>
            <li> I have had a Hot Tools hot rollers set like this for many years but it was time for a replacement.</li>
            <li> The rollers get very hot and do it quickly.</li>
            <li> Think you&#x27;re better off spending a little more for something that is better made.</li>
            <li> They heat up very hot</li>
            <li> You must put the roller on exactly correct for it to fit on the post.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I used this type of product and found it just as good as ever.</li>
            <li> I like the Clairol ones, these don&#x27;t warm up very quickly or make it hold curl very long.  </li>
            <li> They work really well and don&#x27;t get too hot to handle :)</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold much of a curl.  </li>
            <li> The Hot Tools Hot Setter works fine if you have A LOT of patience.  </li>
            <li> secure the hair very well.</li>
            <li> I have found that this type of roller works far better to form a curl in my hair than the type with the fuzzy coating.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Would have liked extra clips included.</li>
            <li> I love my hair now that I have the Hot Tools Professional.</li>
            <li> The initial curls were bouncy and beautiful, but mine fell out after I brushed my hair into style.  </li>
            <li> I love these hot rollers, they are just like my old set from the 80&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It works as well...or better than my old hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> kind of roller gives more of a long lasting curl on my hair....</li>
            <li> I finally had to replace my old Clairol hot rollers, and wanted something really good to replace them.  </li>
            <li> I have very straight, shoulder-length, hard-to-curl hair.</li>
            <li> She likes them very much.</li>
            <li> This set is very much like the one it is replacing.  </li>
            <li> on the original has a rack type surface the new one the surface has nothing to hold hair in pla ce on roller</li>
            <li> Overall,  I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found the rollers get too hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li> so they have time to get hot.  </li>
            <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 rating is that the plastic top came cracked.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Does not get as hot as I would like it to have it.  </li>
            <li> They either do not get hot or die within a month.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these hot rollers for myself and now just purchased another set for my mom.  </li>
            <li> I love these plastic rollers and they get hot enough to hold a curl.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product![[ASIN:B0010VGB6K Hot Tools</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks use,  the roller machine quit getting hot,  and Amazon wouldn&#x27;t  replace it.  </li>
            <li> While I have no problem with the manufacturer (Hot Tools), I would never buy hot rollers with ribs again.  </li>
            <li> i had a set of hot rollers for over 20 years and had no problems with them.</li>
            <li> They do get hot ...</li>
            <li> Well, they need to be hot to do the job</li>
            <li> and sometimes they are a bit hot</li>
            <li> Much faster than using just a curling iron!</li>
            <li> If you want HOT rollers, keep looking.  </li>
            <li> But some sections of hair turned out better than others, resulting in drastically different levels of curl around my head.  </li>
            <li> The reason for this is so I don&#x27;t have to open and shut the case too many times.</li>
            <li> I thought I saw the heating spindle went all the way up through the hot roller</li>
            <li> I have used hot rollers</li>
            <li> I got these for my wife for Christmas, because her original set, 25 years old, bit the dust.  </li>
            <li> Professional 1321 Hot Rollers with Ribs and Cool Touch Ends,</li>
            <li> I love this product cuz it has all the sizes I want (small for certain areas and larger and LARGE as needed and a good balance of each size).  </li>
            <li> The other longer heating rods seemed far superior.</li>
            <li> and it is my opinion that this causes the rollers to take forever to heat up and they just don&#x27;t get as warm as the previous sets that I owned.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s &amp;#34;hinges&amp;#34; quite easily so you&#x27;re always trying to put it back together.</li>
            <li> I cannot even use the large rollers on my hair as they would form almost no curl.</li>
            <li> but i can&#x27;t travel with it without keeping it in a large plastic bag and having to reassemble it to use it.</li>
            <li> The Hot Tools 1321 Hot Rollers came early and was exactly as advertise.  </li>
            <li> they give you a nice tight curl so that it lasts for the day/evening.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are fine but some of the clips to hold the rollers in my hair are too big and will not stay around the roller.  </li>
            <li> Back in ancient history, I owned the original Clairol hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> I cannot return the set because due to some health issues with my pup, I was very busy with her and her vet stay with acute pancreatitis and</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The smallest rollers in this set curl my hair very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks for prompt sending.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I used to have a Clairol 90 second heat up roller set - those things would curl and smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair came ouit very fly-away.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I returned it as it was very time consuming waiting for the product to be ready</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn you or anything, but no one should assume you don&#x27;t need to work with the whole roller.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> This product is very unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li> The unit takes way too much time to heat and the clips don&#x27;t really hold the hair.</li>
            <li> H.eats up fast - like that.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; hair very well when rolled.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very flimsy and comes off of</li>
            <li> and it never seemed warm enough to actually have any affect on my hair.</li>
            <li> they cool down much more quickly than my old set did and therefore don&#x27;t hold the curl for as long.</li>
            <li> Fast forward to today - the Hot Tools 1321 rollers get hot enough, but they have no &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; to stay in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I would have requested new set, but I had to leave town to take care of my Mother postoperative &amp; out of state!  </li>
            <li> Last two sets of hot rollers were the velvet rollers and after them constantly falling apart, decided to go back to this kind.  </li>
            <li> Previous products were more durable.  </li>
            <li> Get hot enough, but not too hot</li>
            <li> I looked at several different sets and read many reviews.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t really get hot enough.</li>
            <li> That surprised me since my old set was hot in about 5 to 8 min.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I still can but time has slipped by using my old set of Remington flocked rollers 10+ years old and sadly not made anymore.</li>
            <li> without the outside shell (which i attempted to tape back together) the hot rollers still work but don&#x27;t seem to heat up as quickly or retain the heat as well.</li>
            <li> so I could put them back in the right order.</li>
            <li> I am matching the right clips with the different sized rollers.  </li>
            <li> However, they are not like the Hot Tools with the original round extended post.  </li>
            <li> tossed it and got new ones</li>
            <li> This item is similar to my old 25 year old Vidal Sassoon hot rollers, which still work and get much hotter.  </li>
            <li> These hot rollers were one set of very few available without the flocked coating on the rollers.  </li>
            <li> After researching hot rollers for months (because I have been in need for a new set for two yrs now), I finally opted for this set.  </li>
            <li> I am having to use the curling iron prior to using the hot rollers each and every morning.  </li>
            <li> This is the 5th set of hot rollers that I currently possess.</li>
            <li> My last set, purchased in a brick and mortar store, created funny lines across my hair.  </li>
            <li> In the case, there were 6 (not 4) small rollers and 8 (not 10) medium (2 BONUS mediums were included but without clips).  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li> Rollers do not instantly start falling out as with so many other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second set of these hot rollers.</li>
            <li> THESE ROLLERS DO NOT GET HOT ENOUGH.  </li>
            <li> of them get hot enough to curl my hair</li>
            <li> Wish they had more small rollers in it.  </li>
            <li> You will want to get extra pins because this set comes with exact amount of pins.</li>
            <li> I have waited a long time to find new hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave these a four star instead of five is because it&#x27;s somewhat easy to mix the pins up and put a smaller pin on a bigger roller</li>
            <li> Fortunately I saved the clips from several previous roller sets so have something much stronger and tighter to use.</li>
            <li> It was advertised that rollers stay hot but cool to the touch,  but not hot enough,  I expected better product compared to other brand what I purchased before.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair short so all of the large rollers I never use.</li>
            <li> I recommend staying clear of this seller.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes that it would replace my old set of curlers.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews with the mention that the rollers did not get very hot.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t heat up like my old ones.  </li>
            <li> I only had about 1 hour to get ready to go.  </li>
            <li> But these heat up in 10-15 minutes, do not leave unsightly lines, and put in enough curl that I have reasonable waves again.  </li>
            <li> Because I have naturally curly hair, they seem to hold all day even if I have straightened my hair the day before.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for this set when my old ones went out.  </li>
            <li> Replaced identical 8 year old item.  </li>
            <li> I AM SO COMPLETELY UNSATISFIED, DID NOIT EVEN LOOKI</li>
            <li> and I have naturally curly hair anyway.  </li>
            <li> This replaced an old one that still worked but was slowly taking longer to heat, and was falling apart the more I packed it to travel.</li>
            <li> They heat up super fast and don&#x27;t  leave funky ends, as long as your careful when rolling .</li>
            <li> Since hot rollers are meant to utilize with dry hair...</li>
            <li> Gives my hair a lot of bounce and they curl my otherwise straight, flat hair and gives it body!  </li>
            <li> so I was very happy that this one survived the shipping only to be disappointed by the lack of performance.</li>
            <li> i bought these to replace the other ones thinking they were all pretty much the same...</li>
            <li> The set before that was so old, it took an hour to heat up adequately - what a waste of electricity.  </li>
            <li> I had used this kind of hard ribbed roller in the past and forgot how much I missed them.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how people who use a single roller wand ever get ready for work.  </li>
            <li> I tried all over to find these hot  rollars  with the ribs to grab the hair  as the other type , rollars just fell out .</li>
            <li> Other than that design flaw, I think they&#x27;re exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, course, curly hair though, so for normal hair, they are probably fine.</li>
            <li> But again, they are fine if you have plain white girl hair, unlike my Jewish afro.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;do not heat well enough to completely curl, and the pins do&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li> I wish a company would produce something like the old Clairol set to hold the hair in place on the rollers properly.  </li>
            <li> So few of the new hot rollers get hot enough to curl my thick, straight hair.</li>
            <li> The top was hard to re-open after I clicked it closed for storage.  </li>
            <li> The red dots on my old set turn black when they are ready.    </li>
            <li> product as I expected but haven&#x27;t used much as my hair is still a bit short.  </li>
            <li> I have bought several sets and was not happy I am glad that I found these</li>
            <li> was not happy with the hot rollers,i expected the rollers to get very hot,since the product was from hot tools,i have long hair,very fine,the product didn&#x27;t keep the curl in my hair.</li>
            <li> As long as you know how to use them, you will get soft wavy curls.</li>
            <li> I wish I had done that with the Hot Tools set I bought in 2006 when the posts were round and extended the length of the roller.</li>
            <li> The stem that you put the curler on is very short, not a long prong like stem</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and the electric rollers with clamps kept falling out.  </li>
            <li> For people with thin or fine hair, I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> I have thin, baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> The curlers heat up fine, however, the container is really poorly designed and I think will crack in no time.  </li>
            <li> I wish the entire set were made up of these small rollers, as the medium sized rollers form a loose curl which falls out quickly.  </li>
            <li> I read reviews and have tried several things to get the rollers to heat like making sure they are all pushed in firmly, giving them a slight twist  but only a few of the rollers heat.</li>
            <li> The cover is very difficult to close and the ends of the rollers are somewhat cool, however the middle of the rollers are too hot to handle.</li>
            <li> long coarse hair.so decided to try 1 last time&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> The instructions said there might be a little smoke or odor for the first few times it was used.  </li>
            <li> They take too long to heat up and the pins don&#x27;t hold the curler in the hair.  </li>
            <li> So long that I wondered if the dots on the rollers had malfunctioned.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy them again, but I hope I don&#x27;t need to for a long time.  </li>
            <li> When heated the unit emits a strange odor.  </li>
            <li> I found these seem to take a long time to heat up probably because the heating element does&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not bad enough to return, but not perfect either.</li>
            <li> They are not particularly hot enough, again, because the element is not long enough and, as a result, the hair curl is not as tight as I am used to.  </li>
            <li> The little red dot on two of the big rollers never change color.  </li>
            <li> I decided at that point, and from other reviewers on this product, that I would just box up the product unused and send it back.  </li>
            <li> which is what it takes for my very long hair to maintain a curl all day long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very long time electric roller user.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t dry your hair out.</li>
            <li> I ordered a second set a few months ago, and the lid already has a crack in it from me just pushing on the hook to open it.</li>
            <li> The metal on the pins is very thin and pliable, making their fit over the rollers very loose.</li>
            <li> The rollers from BBB were soft and did not stay in my hair with the either clip and wasted my $$$ on the other set.</li>
            <li> and I was sent&lt;br /&gt;Mainly large clips and a few small.  </li>
            <li> I think Amazon  did me wrong and won&#x27;t  be too quick to shop here again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for rollers that weren&#x27;t ceramic with those clamps that leave marks in your hair and actually stayed tight.</li>
            <li> I finally received 2 replacements that did not fit the product.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t heat up as well as expected.</li>
            <li> When I opened the product, I saw how narrow and short the heating posts were --</li>
            <li> I returned them to the company because they weren&#x27;t what I expected.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it takes so long to heat up!  </li>
            <li> Given that I can no longer find a set of this type with only small rollers, I have to say this product fills the void for me.</li>
            <li> However, the small as it heats up is unbelievably gross.  </li>
            <li> My first set of rollers was knocked of the counter, shattering the lid and rendering the set useless.</li>
            <li> Rollers are never hot to touch.  </li>
            <li> I hair is too short, it probably would be hard to keep them in.  </li>
            <li> I saw a review that complained that they got too hot and the poor lady was burning her fingers.  </li>
            <li> Especially in this excessively humid air in the South!</li>
            <li> and that would have cost  half of the value of the curlers.  </li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t curl the hair that tightly</li>
            <li> The hold my hair tight and don&#x27;t slip out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just really disappointed in Hot Tools!!  </li>
            <li> Takes a little time to heat</li>
            <li> There are no &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; to hold the rollers in, just little &amp;#34;nubs&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The plastic on these rollers does not grab my hair as well as others I have had -- they tend to be a little slippery.</li>
            <li> her old one was going bad after ten tears</li>
            <li> and you have to leave the rollers in for a few minutes</li>
            <li> Also, the sizes of the rollers are distributed in an uneven manner.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have much trouble with them staying in my hair because they have the &amp;#34;spikes&amp;#34; and I like the pins instead of clips.  </li>
            <li> though obviously there are much worse things in life.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also impossible to keep from losing the pins as the outside case was the only thing holding them in the unit.</li>
            <li> but I usually apply my makeup while it is heating.  </li>
            <li> This version can not compare to the past sets that I have had.</li>
            <li> You would have to buy additional medium clips as the small clips won&#x27;t work with the medium rollers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to open and close as well.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll keep them or not.  </li>
            <li> The post is thin, vertical and not very extended.  </li>
            <li> The case was broken and could not be closed.</li>
            <li> (I hate the Ionic rollers, which don&#x27;t generate enough heat to hold curls in my hair AT ALL; same with the velvet covered rollers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are a sorry excuse for &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; rollers!</li>
            <li> I can understand if some people have a hard time keeping these rollers in.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick, so the rollers stay in with the clips, but I do not get a lot of curl.  </li>
            <li> These are slow to heat up, about 20 min.  </li>
            <li> I wanted one that had lots of rollers because I have thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to give it at least 20 minutes, which is ridiculous to me.  </li>
            <li> The lid,however,is very difficult to open and shut.</li>
            <li> I used a curling product, but I have very hard to curl hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and the ribs on the curlers</li>
            <li> The case was cracked and the latch was broken when it arrived</li>
            <li> Have short,fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> This is frustrating, causing me to have to re-roll often.</li>
            <li> my whole life and these are the worst.</li>
            <li> It arrived with the plastic cover cracked--rendering it useless.  </li>
            <li> An expensive lesson.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> These rollers are disappointing, but work in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews were not encouraging, but I was getting desperate.  </li>
            <li> And so disappointing.</li>
            <li> wrong!</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed!  </li>
            <li> and it is still awful.  </li>
            <li> I have used electric rollers for 30 yrs, these are almost the worst.</li>
            <li> (They did not tangle my hair or drop out, which the worst did...)</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After researching hot rollers for months (because I have been in need for a new set for two yrs now), I finally opted for this set.  BIG MISTAKE!  Yes, I read ALL reviews and even read where some consumers experienced a heating problem with this set, I purchased it.  I have a Hot Tools curling iron and LOVE IT!  Howe  v  e  r....this set does not maintain the heat (just as consumers stated in the reviews) AT ALL!  I am having to use the curling iron prior to using the hot rollers each and every morning.  I am so disappointed!  I cannot return the set because due to some health issues with my pup, I was very busy with her and her vet stay with acute pancreatitis and the return deadline date expired.  I&#x27;m just really disappointed in Hot Tools!!  Feel like I got &amp;#34;ripped off&amp;#34;.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Sometimes fancy isn&#x27;t always best. This roller set is basic but has everything you need. It must be just what is needed to do a good job of getting that hair perfect as my wife had me order another set. She loves it. I guess we now have a set to take traveling with us.</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I have very straight, shoulder-length, hard-to-curl hair. This is the 5th set of hot rollers that I currently possess. The smallest rollers in this set curl my hair very well. I wish the entire set were made up of these small rollers, as the medium sized rollers form a loose curl which falls out quickly.  I cannot even use the large rollers on my hair as they would form almost no curl. I have found that this type of roller works far better to form a curl in my hair than the type with the fuzzy coating. Given that I can no longer find a set of this type with only small rollers, I have to say this product fills the void for me. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and the electric rollers with clamps kept falling out.  These stay in.  For people with thin or fine hair, I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> I have thin, baby fine hair.  These grip nicely, and the set holds.  My only concern is with the lid.  It doesn&#x27;t seem built to last, but time will tell. Overall,  I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes that it would replace my old set of curlers.  When I received it, the curler sizes were right, and I thought it would be a perfect replacement.  However, the small as it heats up is unbelievably gross.  It wends its way from the bathroom through the bedroom and then the hallway - even the cat leaves the room when it&#x27;s on.  The instructions said there might be a little smoke or odor for the first few times it was used.  It has been three weeks and it is still awful.  I will have to throw it away.</li>
            <li> I love my hair now that I have the Hot Tools Professional. Thanks for prompt sending. Its a godsend. Thanks</li>
            <li> They sent a defective product and charged me $4 to send back  the roller that did not heat up requesting one replacement roller.  I finally received 2 replacements that did not fit the product.  I sent them back one month ago asking for the correct size but have received nothing.  I am stuck with a 4-roller unit</li>
            <li> The Hot Tools 1321 Hot Rollers came early and was exactly as advertise.  I read other reviews with the mention that the rollers did not get very hot.  I agree.  The little red dot on two of the big rollers never change color.  This item is similar to my old 25 year old Vidal Sassoon hot rollers, which still work and get much hotter.  The red dots on my old set turn black when they are ready.    My hair is thick, so the rollers stay in with the clips, but I do not get a lot of curl.  I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t heat up like my old ones.  These rollers are disappointing, but work in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Takes a little time to heat but I usually apply my makeup while it is heating.  I like the 20 rollers--need that amount to set my full head. However, it doesn&#x27;t curl the hair that tightly and you have to leave the rollers in for a few minutes so the curl doesn&#x27;t fall out.    Also, the sizes of the rollers are distributed in an uneven manner.  I had to make a diagram so I could put them back in the right order. It&#x27;s good for the price but I would go with something better.</li>
            <li> I got these for my wife for Christmas, because her original set, 25 years old, bit the dust.  She likes them very much.</li>
            <li> They take too long to heat up and the pins don&#x27;t hold the curler in the hair.  They keep falling out.</li>
            <li> These rollers do only what you expect. It&#x27;s like what you see is what you get. As long as you know how to use them, you will get soft wavy curls. Very easy to use and take off.</li>
            <li> The rollers are all I had hoped, BUT one side of the lid was cracked &amp; I have to tie it with a ribbon to hold cover on.  I would have requested new set, but I had to leave town to take care of my Mother postoperative &amp; out of state!  Otherwise I am 100% happy!</li>
            <li> The rollers are fine but some of the clips to hold the rollers in my hair are too big and will not stay around the roller.  I am matching the right clips with the different sized rollers.  I am not going to send it back, maybe I can bend the clips with a pair of players.</li>
            <li> The seller didn&#x27;t include medium clips with the setter.&lt;br /&gt;Most of the rollers are medium and I was sent&lt;br /&gt;Mainly large clips and a few small.  Without medium&lt;br /&gt;clips the rollers just fall out of your hair.  Unusable&lt;br /&gt;product!</li>
            <li> Pleased with the hot rollers</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t really get hot enough. I have very thick, course, curly hair though, so for normal hair, they are probably fine. I used to have a Clairol 90 second heat up roller set - those things would curl and smooth. These just curl. No smoothing.  But again, they are fine if you have plain white girl hair, unlike my Jewish afro.  Oy, what&#x27;s a JAP to do?</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife. It arrived with the plastic cover cracked--rendering it useless.  When I went to the seller&#x27;s site to see how to return I learned I would have to pay to send it back and further would pay a restocking fee.  It is surprising to learn Amazon.com would associate with a seller who does not have a more appropriate policy in handling defective products.  I recommend staying clear of this seller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I used this type of product and found it just as good as ever.</li>
            <li> I had used this kind of hard ribbed roller in the past and forgot how much I missed them.  Last two sets of hot rollers were the velvet rollers and after them constantly falling apart, decided to go back to this kind.  Glad I did.  I can understand if some people have a hard time keeping these rollers in.  I have shoulder length hair cut into layers and they work great.  I hair is too short, it probably would be hard to keep them in.  I would definitely recommend these rollers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very long time electric roller user.  The Hot Tools Hot Setter works fine if you have A LOT of patience.  They take forever to heat.  So long that I wondered if the dots on the rollers had malfunctioned.  They don&#x27;t seem to change colors gradually, but turn completely--eventually.  I haven&#x27;t found the rollers get too hot to the touch.  I am a fan of the rollers with the flanges.</li>
            <li> The instructions say it takes 15 min to warm up, and that&#x27;s right. Then theuy recommend 15 minutes to set. My hair came ouit very fly-away. I have used electric rollers for 30 yrs, these are almost the worst. (They did not tangle my hair or drop out, which the worst did...)</li>
            <li> when you roll the hair slip out not. on the original has a rack type surface the new one the surface has nothing to hold hair in pla ce on roller</li>
            <li> Just wonderful. They don&#x27;t dry your hair out. They don&#x27;t burn your hair. Heat nicely. Great for a quick fix for a night out. Love the product.</li>
            <li> The case was cracked and the latch was broken when it arrived</li>
            <li> I was looking for the set with the larger rollers, but I do like this set.  Very happy with the style and the price.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  I am glad they have ridges in them because without the ridges, my hair wont curl.  Glad I found them.</li>
            <li> These are slow to heat up, about 20 min.  That surprised me since my old set was hot in about 5 to 8 min.  If you&#x27;re in a hurry or a rush, make sure you turn them on before you get in the shower so they have time to get hot.  The initial curls were bouncy and beautiful, but mine fell out after I brushed my hair into style.  I used a curling product, but I have very hard to curl hair.  It may get better with more use or if I had left them in longer.  I only had about 1 hour to get ready to go.  The top was hard to re-open after I clicked it closed for storage.  I imagine this set would travel well.  It has a compact shape that would easily fit into a bag.</li>
            <li> Seem to work great. Especially like the on/off switch so I can keep it plugged in. Get hot enough, but not too hot so I can still pick them up and work with them. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 rating is that the plastic top came cracked. Not bad enough to return, but not perfect either.</li>
            <li> They were a gift for my mother and she loves them.</li>
            <li> Theses curlers are awesome! They heat up very hot which is what it takes for my very long hair to maintain a curl all day long! Especially in this excessively humid air in the South!</li>
            <li> I finally had to replace my old Clairol hot rollers, and wanted something really good to replace them.  I&#x27;ve never tried the flocked rollers, so I can&#x27;t say how this compares with those.  This set is very much like the one it is replacing.  It has an on/off switch, slots to hold the curler pins, and does a really good job curling my stubborn, straight hair.  My only complaint is that it takes so long to heat up!  I&#x27;ve got to give it at least 20 minutes, which is ridiculous to me.  However, I like everything else about these rollers, so I am changing my routine to make sure these are ready when I need them.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife she was so happy to get this her old one was going bad after ten tears</li>
            <li> This is my first set of hot rollers and I love them! They work really well and don&#x27;t get too hot to handle :)</li>
            <li> I like this set of rollers, I like that they aren&#x27;t flocked----this kind of roller gives more of a long lasting curl on my hair....I love the on/off switch....</li>
            <li> I have used hot rollers for years and I like a set that gets nice and hot.  These do the trick.  I have to leave them plugged in 20+ minutes to get them to the temp I like.  Make sure you pay attenion to where each size curler goes bc they won&#x27;t fit otherwise.</li>
            <li> This is the second best hair setter I have ever owned. The best one, they no longer make, but this is as close to that hair setter as one can get.  I would recommend this set, it heats quickly, curls well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy. Great set. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love these hot rollers, they are just like my old set from the 80&#x27;s they give you a nice tight curl so that it lasts for the day/evening.  I have bought several sets and was not happy I am glad that I found these they were just what I was looking for. Delivery was quick will order from this seller again</li>
            <li> I have had a Hot Tools hot rollers set like this for many years but it was time for a replacement. This version can not compare to the past sets that I have had. The design has been changed and the heating rod no longer extends the entire length of the roller and it is my opinion that this causes the rollers to take forever to heat up and they just don&#x27;t get as warm as the previous sets that I owned. Therefore, I returned it as it was very time consuming waiting for the product to be ready and it never seemed warm enough to actually have any affect on my hair. Now perhaps I got a defective one but I don&#x27;t quite understand why they changed the design of this. The other longer heating rods seemed far superior. I have been trying to replace my set for some time now and they always arrived damaged so I was very happy that this one survived the shipping only to be disappointed by the lack of performance.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold much of a curl.  My last set, purchased in a brick and mortar store, created funny lines across my hair.  Used it twice.  The set before that was so old, it took an hour to heat up adequately - what a waste of electricity.  But these heat up in 10-15 minutes, do not leave unsightly lines, and put in enough curl that I have reasonable waves again.  The cool touch ends are fine, but I find when using them, I have to also touch the hot part.  It doesn&#x27;t burn you or anything, but no one should assume you don&#x27;t need to work with the whole roller.  Also sets the hair adequately in about 20 minutes - perfect for doing other things while they are working.  Don&#x27;t know how people who use a single roller wand ever get ready for work.  I&#x27;d buy them again, but I hope I don&#x27;t need to for a long time.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Just the type of set I was looking for.  The right curlers, the right sizes (and the right amounts), and good clips.  At a good price, too.  Heats up well (really good and hot if I turn it on and then go walk the dog while it heats).  My hair seems to take the curl very well, so I&#x27;m pleased.  It has an on/off switch with a light, too -- something I prefer to having to plug and unplug!</li>
            <li> This product is very unsatisfactory. The cover is very difficult to close and the ends of the rollers are somewhat cool, however the middle of the rollers are too hot to handle.</li>
            <li> When heated the unit emits a strange odor.  The unit takes way too much time to heat and the clips don&#x27;t really hold the hair.</li>
            <li> I have waited a long time to find new hot rollers.  I looked at several different sets and read many reviews.  I wanted one that had lots of rollers because I have thick curly hair.  Some of the reviews were not encouraging, but I was getting desperate.  This is exactly what I wanted.  They heat up within about 20 minutes and I don&#x27;t have much trouble with them staying in my hair because they have the &amp;#34;spikes&amp;#34; and I like the pins instead of clips.  Because I have naturally curly hair, they seem to hold all day even if I have straightened my hair the day before.</li>
            <li> product as I expected but haven&#x27;t used much as my hair is still a bit short.  What else can I say</li>
            <li> Does not get as hot as I would like it to have it.  Prefer the Remington Ceramic.  Used for years.</li>
            <li> Back in ancient history, I owned the original Clairol hot rollers.  They were perfect - getting real hot, and each curler stayed in my hair without slipping.  Fast forward to today - the Hot Tools 1321 rollers get hot enough, but they have no &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; to stay in my hair.  Even with the medal pins, they slip right out!  There are no &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; to hold the rollers in, just little &amp;#34;nubs&amp;#34;. Aggravating. And so disappointing.</li>
            <li> Have short,fine thin hair. These curlers,when used with styling mousse, give body to hair. The lid,however,is very difficult to open and shut.</li>
            <li> product broke after using it for the 1st time it also had a crack in the lid... tossed it and got new ones</li>
            <li> I have had a devil of a time finding good hair rollers.  They either do not get hot or die within a month.  I wish these had flocking, but you can&#x27;t have everything.  They take a good 15-20 minutes to heat up but do curl my hair.</li>
            <li> It was advertised that rollers stay hot but cool to the touch,  but not hot enough,  I expected better product compared to other brand what I purchased before. Seller shipped timely.</li>
            <li> Product was not as advertised. In the case, there were 6 (not 4) small rollers and 8 (not 10) medium (2 BONUS mediums were included but without clips).  You would have to buy additional medium clips as the small clips won&#x27;t work with the medium rollers.</li>
            <li> The curlers heat up fine, however, the container is really poorly designed and I think will crack in no time.  It&#x27;s difficult to open and close as well.  I like the combination of the size of the rollers but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll keep them or not.  Think you&#x27;re better off spending a little more for something that is better made.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li> Curls my hair nicely. Rollers do not instantly start falling out as with so many other brands. Just what I was looking for,</li>
            <li> I use this product ever week and love it.  I had not bought new hot rollers in over twenty years and they have made great improvements in the design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second set of these hot rollers. They heat up well and hold the curl like the old Clairol hot rollers I used as a kid (and LOVED). So few of the new hot rollers get hot enough to curl my thick, straight hair. (I hate the Ionic rollers, which don&#x27;t generate enough heat to hold curls in my hair AT ALL; same with the velvet covered rollers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with them is that the lid is too fragile. My first set of rollers was knocked of the counter, shattering the lid and rendering the set useless. I ordered a second set a few months ago, and the lid already has a crack in it from me just pushing on the hook to open it.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric rollers for over 40 years.  I found these seem to take a long time to heat up probably because the heating element does&lt;br /&gt;not go all the way through the roller but are short stubs that the roller sits on.  They are not particularly hot enough, again, because the element is not long enough and, as a result, the hair curl is not as tight as I am used to.  I have very thick hair and the ribs on the curlers is what made me buy these as I do not like the velcro one.</li>
            <li> I tried all over to find these hot  rollars  with the ribs to grab the hair  as the other type , rollars just fell out . Yesssssssss I love my hair rollars and they do a great job  and make my hair look like ive been to the hair dressers</li>
            <li> I purchased these hot rollers for myself and now just purchased another set for my mom.  These are like the good ones I used to have 10 years ago.  Gives my hair a lot of bounce and they curl my otherwise straight, flat hair and gives it body!  (I had bought a set of hot rollers from Bed Bath and Beyond for a lot more $$$ with plastic clips that made \\&quot;dents\\&quot; in my hair!  The rollers from BBB were soft and did not stay in my hair with the either clip and wasted my $$$ on the other set. I love these plastic rollers and they get hot enough to hold a curl. I would recommend this product![[ASIN:B0010VGB6K Hot Tools Professional 1321 Hot Rollers with Ribs and Cool Touch Ends, Set of 20]]</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for this set when my old ones went out.  Great set and I received them very quickly.</li>
            <li> This replaced an old one that still worked but was slowly taking longer to heat, and was falling apart the more I packed it to travel. I LOVE the on/off button (other one I had to unplug for off), doesn&#x27;t hold ends of hair to begin rolling as much as I wish it did, but works great when started rolling. H.eats up fast - like that. I would recommend</li>
            <li> I am changing my review of this product.  After a couple of weeks use,  the roller machine quit getting hot,  and Amazon wouldn&#x27;t  replace it.  They would if I paid to mail it back and that would have cost  half of the value of the curlers.  I think Amazon  did me wrong and won&#x27;t  be too quick to shop here again.</li>
            <li> Replaced identical 8 year old item.  Use daily, I give it 15 minutes to heat up while I shower.  Rollers are never hot to touch.  Leave in for 15-30 minutes while I breakfast and curls last all day.  Great product.</li>
            <li> While I have no problem with the manufacturer (Hot Tools), I would never buy hot rollers with ribs again.  Since hot rollers are meant to utilize with dry hair...having ribbed rollers tends to make your hair frizzy.  At least...that was the case with me.  I knew I should have bought the ceramic ones!</li>
            <li> i had a set of hot rollers for over 20 years and had no problems with them. i bought these to replace the other ones thinking they were all pretty much the same...wrong! within 6 weeks and only about 3 uses...the outside plastic cover cracked. then within another couple weeks it came off in my hand as i was trying to open the case to turn on the rollers. without the outside shell (which i attempted to tape back together) the hot rollers still work but don&#x27;t seem to heat up as quickly or retain the heat as well. they cool down much more quickly than my old set did and therefore don&#x27;t hold the curl for as long. it&#x27;s also impossible to keep from losing the pins as the outside case was the only thing holding them in the unit. does it still heat up? yes...but i can&#x27;t travel with it without keeping it in a large plastic bag and having to reassemble it to use it. all in all just a big pain... though obviously there are much worse things in life. i&#x27;m looking for another set now but will never buy anything from this manufacturer again.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for.  It heats up quick and  works great.  The rollers stay where u put them and secure nicely.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t heat up as well as expected.</li>
            <li> I love this product cuz it has all the sizes I want (small for certain areas and larger and LARGE as needed and a good balance of each size).  They do get hot ... I won&#x27;t deny that.  I saw a review that complained that they got too hot and the poor lady was burning her fingers.  Well, they need to be hot to do the job and sometimes they are a bit hot (if I am clumsy or what have you), but basically they are just really great!  They get the job done and if I move quckly enough I will not burn my fingers and if I do not move quickly enough ... well, I just have to deal with it.  But they do the job!  And I love this product!</li>
            <li> Yes, I am looking for those old-school heat rollers from the &#x27;80&#x27;s, and thought by the description that this was it.  When I opened the product, I saw how narrow and short the heating posts were -- perhaps 1-1/2\\&quot; in height.  I decided at that point, and from other reviewers on this product, that I would just box up the product unused and send it back.  With that, I still got dinged a restocking fee -- I understand.  An expensive lesson.  But will keep looking for something else.</li>
            <li> I should have heeded the reviews when I bought it.  Just put it in the closet thinking maybe I&#x27;ll try it again later.</li>
            <li> I love my hot rollers and use them every day! Much faster than using just a curling iron! The hold my hair tight and don&#x27;t slip out. Love them!</li>
            <li> Heats up quick and my hair curls great, I love it! I would recommend it. I am glad Amazon had it listed, I could not find this item in any store in town.</li>
            <li> It works as well...or better than my old hot rollers.  Hold the hair and the curls stay!  I am pleased I bought them.</li>
            <li> was not happy with the hot rollers,i expected the rollers to get very hot,since the product was from hot tools,i have long hair,very fine,the product didn&#x27;t keep the curl in my hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; hair very well when rolled.</li>
            <li> IT NEVER HEATED  ENOUGH TO CURL HAIR  I AM SO COMPLETELY UNSATISFIED, DID NOIT EVEN LOOKI LIKE WHAT  I ORDERED.</li>
            <li> These rollers heat up nicely and provide a good curl.  However, they are not like the Hot Tools with the original round extended post.  The post is thin, vertical and not very extended.  You must put the roller on exactly correct for it to fit on the post.  The top of the roller shows which direction to put on the post.  That said, in my opinion, they are the best of the hot rollers currently on the market.  I bought an extra set \\&quot;just in case.\\&quot;  I wish I had done that with the Hot Tools set I bought in 2006 when the posts were round and extended the length of the roller.</li>
            <li> I chose these rollers because someone had said that they were the most like the hot rollers our mothers had in the 70&#x27;s.  I wish that had been a true statement.  THESE ROLLERS DO NOT GET HOT ENOUGH.  If you want only warm rollers, these are great.  If you want HOT rollers, keep looking.  Fortunately, my hair still curled but that&#x27;s because my hair is thin and I have naturally curly hair anyway.  But some sections of hair turned out better than others, resulting in drastically different levels of curl around my head.  I had to FIX with a curling iron.  Overall, these rollers suck in my opinion.  They just don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to.</li>
            <li> I read reviews and have tried several things to get the rollers to heat like making sure they are all pushed in firmly, giving them a slight twist  but only a few of the rollers heat. Wish I had returned this item. Maybe I still can but time has slipped by using my old set of Remington flocked rollers 10+ years old and sadly not made anymore. Beware of purchase!</li>
            <li> I like the Clairol ones, these don&#x27;t warm up very quickly or make it hold curl very long.  The stem that you put the curler on is very short, not a long prong like stem</li>
            <li> i had sent to my job and never got them and still got charged so i had to pay for them.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would get them for myself as a birthday gift I have bought 5 sets of hot rollers in the past year&lt;br /&gt;none of them get hot enough to curl my hair i have long coarse hair.so decided to try 1 last time&lt;br /&gt;and order another set which i never got and had to pay for so dont know if they would have worked.</li>
            <li> Tried and True - used this product for years!!!</li>
            <li> flimsy and  rollers will not stay in hair</li>
            <li> Although there are plenty of rollers in convenient sizes, they&lt;br /&gt;do not heat well enough to completely curl, and the pins do&lt;br /&gt;not secure the hair very well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for rollers that weren&#x27;t ceramic with those clamps that leave marks in your hair and actually stayed tight. I knew I want this kind because of the &amp;#34;bobby pin&amp;#34; type clips. The rollers get very hot and do it quickly. There&#x27;s two things that I dislike--the on/off switch is inside the case. I don&#x27;t even use it as a result. I just plug them in and unplug them when I&#x27;m done rather than turn them off and on. The reason for this is so I don&#x27;t have to open and shut the case too many times. It&#x27;s very flimsy and comes off of it&#x27;s &amp;#34;hinges&amp;#34; quite easily so you&#x27;re always trying to put it back together. I don&#x27;t think that they would travel well because of the case either. Other than that design flaw, I think they&#x27;re exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Wish they had more small rollers in it.  I wear my hair short so all of the large rollers I never use.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love my new rollers! These rollers remind me of my mothers original set! She was a beautician and swore by these type. The only reason I gave these a four star instead of five is because it&#x27;s somewhat easy to mix the pins up and put a smaller pin on a bigger roller and then then the pin is ruined. You will want to get extra pins because this set comes with exact amount of pins.</li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers becuase I prefer rollers with ribs because they tend to hold my hair better. The plastic on these rollers does not grab my hair as well as others I have had -- they tend to be a little slippery. The metal on the pins is very thin and pliable, making their fit over the rollers very loose. Even if I squeeze them to make them narrower, they stretch out as soon as they are placed over the roller, making the rollers fall out very easily. This is frustrating, causing me to have to re-roll often. Fortunately I saved the clips from several previous roller sets so have something much stronger and tighter to use.</li>
            <li> Have used these rollers for years.  They are  the best I have found.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week. My hair is medium length. The rollers did not have enough grip. I compared it to the Clairol Kindness it has more grip.&lt;br /&gt;  It works Okay. It&#x27;s a Keeper.</li>
            <li> I returned them to the company because they weren&#x27;t what I expected.  I thought I saw the heating spindle went all the way up through the hot roller but it only went about 1/4 of the way.  You can&#x27;t get good heat like that.  I&#x27;m sorry but I need a lot more heat to keep my curls.  I like the idea of the rollers with the ribs so I don&#x27;t have to deal with the felt coming off later but they don&#x27;t make them like they use to.</li>
            <li> These hot rollers were one set of very few available without the flocked coating on the rollers.  I had an old set of Clairol hot rollers for over 15 years and they were great.  The rollers on these have ridges that are not deep enough to grab and hold the hair.  They fall out easily.  The set seems to heat to a good temperature but the rollers ruin the set.  I wish a company would produce something like the old Clairol set to hold the hair in place on the rollers properly.  It makes me wonder if those who design these roller sets ever try to use them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am keeping the set as it is the best I have found so far, but  I would not buy this set again.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY! The description was a total lie. It did not have the longer heating rods. The case was broken and could not be closed. I think this should be removed from Amazon website before it taints its reputation for carrying qualities items from reliable, honest manufacturers.</li>
            <li> Hot tools makes the best products around, these Hot Rollers even curl my super straight hair. They heat up super fast and don&#x27;t  leave funky ends, as long as your careful when rolling .</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this product, and it is probably the best of its type.  Previous products were more durable.  Would have liked extra clips included.</li>
            <li> These are a sorry excuse for &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; rollers! THey are barely lukewarm no matter how long I wait (up to 30 minutes) I have used hot rollers my whole life and these are the worst. Absolutely horrible.</li>
