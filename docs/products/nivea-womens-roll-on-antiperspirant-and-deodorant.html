            <li>Not as good as others</li>

            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Has the lightest fragrance ever which is nice but doesn&#x27;t compete with cologne.</li>
            <li>It is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used - no marks, nice smell, but not too strong, and works really well.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my underarms looking better.</li>
            <li>I will try to update after a month or so. :)</li>
            <li>And I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I can find it on amazon.</li>
            <li>Disappears completely, nice smell, creamy, and keeps armpits fresh for 24 hours!</li>
            <li>I like how easily this applies.</li>
            <li>It works fine and all, but it was not the type I wanted.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel secure while using.</li>
            <li>I have tried all the roll on deodorants available in the grocery store and pharmacies..</li>
            <li>It is very fresh and light.</li>
            <li>I specifically ordered multiples of this in one order as it was advertised as deodorant, however what I received was a box full of anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li>I feel fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I have right now.</li>
            <li>great long lasting wear and the smell is very soft and lovely.</li>
            <li>The price of the product was great but the shipping was excessive, probably b/c</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, doesn&#x27;t show up on my clothes, and lasts long</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and feels soft, not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>I feel confident on the second day that I still will be presentable around others.</li>
            <li>;-)&lt;br /&gt;Also, it does not stain your clothes.</li>
            <li>Stays long and has a refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>First off, I am an Asian girl, mid-20&#x27;s with somewhat light olive skin.</li>
            <li>Delivery came in fast and well.</li>
            <li>The bottle/container is very fancy feeling, I didn&#x27;t realize it was glass before I received it.</li>
            <li>really, who would?</li>
            <li>but I really wanted a &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Unlike the other deodorants I have used, this one does not have an overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li>But you have to wait for it to dry before wearing clothes as it does leave white stains on your top if you are in a hurry!</li>
            <li>It keeps me dry and comfortable even on the warmest of days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, I thought I previously purchased the tightening pore and whitening deodorant, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>If you are trying to find a new deodorant don&#x27;t bother with this one.</li>
            <li>I would certainly purchase it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>Dries clear.</li>
            <li>Fast ship despite international.</li>
            <li>I especially like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have much scent to it.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t really work through out regular days either.</li>
            <li>I started using this when I traveled abroad for work frequently.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>but I guess it is still too early to tell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably try the whitening deodorant before I completely give up on the Nivea brand.</li>
            <li>I have had to blow dry my underarms trying to get this stuff to dry faster, but ultimately it&#x27;s worth it.</li>

            <li> By powerful, I mean that your deodorant is overpowering , and it clashes with the perfume or eau de toilette</li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like is that it takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> although I haven&#x27;t tried to wear it for that long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad expensive to keep ordering and shipping and bulks are rare.</li>
            <li> I also noticed my underarm skin getting smoother and softer (due to shaving, it has a lot of bumps before).</li>
            <li> In addition, the packaging was in a weak box and one of the bottles leaked out, causing the entire box to be wet and had to be sealed into a plastic bag by the USPS for delivery.</li>
            <li> Because my skin is very dry, I usually don&#x27;t shower every day.</li>
            <li> Now after a few months.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I have uneven skin tone in my underarm from the side effects of shaving.</li>
            <li> Skin tone is still uneven</li>
            <li> Not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> I am from Europe, and in the USA, it is hard to find a deodorant that is not too &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was shipped the wrong product.</li>
            <li> Just too expensive!</li>
            <li> Too bad is not sold in stores in the US.</li>
            <li> I did not smell bad during the day, but you have to like the powder smell.</li>
            <li> Within fifteen minutes of having it on and working out, I smelt horrible.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!!</li>

            <li> Best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Dries clear. I love it. Fast ship despite international. Will recommend.</li>
            <li> I specifically ordered multiples of this in one order as it was advertised as deodorant, however what I received was a box full of anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! I found this through a blogger and I don&#x27;t think I can ever switch back to regular deodorant ...</li>
            <li> I started using this several years ago when I was visiting Morocco and decided to try it. It works great in my opinion. Because my skin is very dry, I usually don&#x27;t shower every day. I feel confident on the second day that I still will be presentable around others. This is the only deodorant I use anymore.</li>
            <li> i love it! it smells good.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I especially like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have much scent to it. lh</li>
            <li> The  scent was so strong,it gave me a migrane. I had too throw it away.Not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my skin and smells great. Just too expensive!</li>
            <li> where have roll-on&#x27;s been all my life? never going back to stick deodorant! great long lasting wear and the smell is very soft and lovely. would recommend this to anyone! although the shipping time will take a couple weeks to get to you.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It is a shame that they do not sell it at stores in the states.  A bottle will last me a year but I buy two a year in case they quit making it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best deodorant and anti-perspirants that I have used. It keeps me dry and comfortable even on the warmest of days. It also leaves my underarms looking better. The only thing I do not like is that it takes forever to dry. I have had to blow dry my underarms trying to get this stuff to dry faster, but ultimately it&#x27;s worth it. I do wish they sold this item in the States. I would certainly purchase it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to find a new deodorant don&#x27;t bother with this one. Within fifteen minutes of having it on and working out, I smelt horrible. It also didn&#x27;t really work through out regular days either.</li>
            <li> Delivery came in fast and well. But, I don&#x27;t like the smell and I don&#x27;t feel secure while using. Not as good as others Nivea deodorants I have right now.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Discovered it this summer in France. Works so well. Has the lightest fragrance ever which is nice but doesn&#x27;t compete with cologne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, I thought I previously purchased the tightening pore and whitening deodorant, but I didn&#x27;t. I was shipped the wrong product. It works fine and all, but it was not the type I wanted.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I have ever owned! Disappears completely, nice smell, creamy, and keeps armpits fresh for 24 hours!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Roll-On deodorant and that is what was listed on my invoice, but just received my order and it is the spray.  Now I have to go without deodorant.</li>
            <li> Stays long and has a refreshing scent. But you have to wait for it to dry before wearing clothes as it does leave white stains on your top if you are in a hurry!</li>
            <li> Excellent service and product!</li>
            <li> I started using this when I traveled abroad for work frequently.  It is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used - no marks, nice smell, but not too strong, and works really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Nivea girl!!! It&#x27;s the only deodorant I&#x27;ll use. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried all the roll on deodorants available in the grocery store and pharmacies.. I have tried from the most expensive to the cheapest, and I have never found anything that worked for me...  Nivea deodorant is awesome!!! Too bad is not sold in stores in the US. I will keep buying from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Has done wonders!! Definitely ordering again! Especially with summer approaching!!!! Started working within a week of using.  Now after a few months. Wow. You will not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> First off, I am an Asian girl, mid-20&#x27;s with somewhat light olive skin. I purchased this product because I have uneven skin tone in my underarm from the side effects of shaving. I have been transitioning to waxing and I have been using this product for over 2 weeks now. Unlike the other deodorants I have used, this one does not have an overwhelming smell. It is very fresh and light. I also noticed my underarm skin getting smoother and softer (due to shaving, it has a lot of bumps before). Skin tone is still uneven but I guess it is still too early to tell. I will continue to use the product and hopefully it lightens up. I will try to update after a month or so. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;08/31/13&lt;br /&gt;My underarm is definitely a lot smoother. I&#x27;m still rating it 4 stars because for some reason, they don&#x27;t sell it here in any store like walmart, walgreens, cvs and believe me, I&#x27;ve looked. Why is Nivea no selling them here? It&#x27;s a tad expensive to keep ordering and shipping and bulks are rare. Oh well.</li>
            <li> I did not like the baby powdery smell.  Plus, it does not work that well as an antiperspirant.  I did not smell bad during the day, but you have to like the powder smell.</li>
            <li> I like how easily this applies. The bottle/container is very fancy feeling, I didn&#x27;t realize it was glass before I received it. The smell is pleasant but not overpowering. I don&#x27;t think it does anything in the way of stifling your sweat glands, but after doing weights and cardio and having already worn the deodorant around for several hours, I could only smell the slightest hint of BO, and I doubt anyone else could smell it.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and feels soft, not sticky at all. And I love the fragrance. Farley inexpensive. I feel fresh all day.</li>
            <li> The price of the product was great but the shipping was excessive, probably b/c it came from overseas.  In addition, the packaging was in a weak box and one of the bottles leaked out, causing the entire box to be wet and had to be sealed into a plastic bag by the USPS for delivery.</li>
            <li> I am from Europe, and in the USA, it is hard to find a deodorant that is not too &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34;. By powerful, I mean that your deodorant is overpowering , and it clashes with the perfume or eau de toilette you are wearing&lt;br /&gt;With this deodorant, I think that 48 hours is pushing it ... although I haven&#x27;t tried to wear it for that long. really, who would? ;-)&lt;br /&gt;Also, it does not stain your clothes. I am so glad I can find it on amazon.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d get pearly pits with this product but it does only what any deodorant would do. It smells amazing, doesn&#x27;t show up on my clothes, and lasts long but I really wanted a &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; effect and that isn&#x27;t what I got. I&#x27;ll probably try the whitening deodorant before I completely give up on the Nivea brand. I hope it works!</li>
