            <li>Might I say, I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this again.  </li>
            <li>Yesterday I worked an 8 hour shift and when I got off work, my face looked just as good as when I walked in.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and was very pleased to find it again since it is no longer in stores.</li>
            <li>I ordered this powder for my Grandmother for Christmas and she was so pleased!</li>
            <li>She was thrilled when she received it.  </li>
            <li>I love how it smells and</li>
            <li>glad I have this product on my beauty shelf.</li>
            <li>I love City products .</li>
            <li>Better than any mineral foundation.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>The best Loose Powder I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Best loose powder ever</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t cost tons like some of the more hipper brands today.</li>
            <li>the translucent works fine.  </li>
            <li>translucent and  color free...</li>
            <li>I was ecstatic to have found it available at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Coty&#x27;s translucent powder for years, and as I have light skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a loose powder as good as this, so I felt devastated when the drugstores stopped carrying it!</li>
            <li>and it is very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Since that time, I only use this kind of powder.</li>
            <li>Going to order more to last me a while!</li>
            <li>If you use a foundation, this powder will set the foundation lightly so that you don&#x27;t look &amp;#34; made-up or shiny&amp;#34;,  As the day wears on, this powder will not discolor into an orange  or yellow  plastic over-coat appearance.  </li>
            <li>The reason I gave it one star is because this shipment ( I ordered two ) is much darker than what I use and it is labeled &amp;#34;translucent&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li>An older lady told me about this stuff to fix my &amp;#34;oily makeup after 4 hours&amp;#34; issue.</li>
            <li>Once foundation is on take a large powder puff and actually beat it on your face,then take a big brush and blend the heck out of it until it looks natural, now you have your canvas to do the rest of your makeup on...</li>

            <li> The best Loose Powder I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I dont powder very much as I am dry but when I do I reach for this and it is very silky and smooth. I like it!</li>
            <li> I had used this product years ago....translucent and  color free... and those are the best qualities.  If you use a foundation, this powder will set the foundation lightly so that you don&#x27;t look &amp;#34; made-up or shiny&amp;#34;,  As the day wears on, this powder will not discolor into an orange  or yellow  plastic over-coat appearance.  In ND the product is hard to come by.  I was ecstatic to have found it available at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and was very pleased to find it again since it is no longer in stores.</li>
            <li> I remember seeing this product in my Mom&#x27;s bathroom. I love how it smells and glad I have this product on my beauty shelf.</li>
            <li> I know this product since I was in the USA for holidays. Since that time, I only use this kind of powder. Unfortunatelly I can&#x27;t get it in Germany.</li>
            <li> Wish it still came in the packaging that is pictured.  I don&#x27;t  like the plastic container with the insert.</li>
            <li> 070-24 is the number on the bottom of this powder.It&#x27;s the only one I will use because it&#x27;s translucent and just sets your foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It adds no color but it makes your makeup last all day and night. Once foundation is on take a large powder puff and actually beat it on your face,then take a big brush and blend the heck out of it until it looks natural, now you have your canvas to do the rest of your makeup on...</li>
            <li> Bought for Granny and she loved it!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this powder for my Grandmother for Christmas and she was so pleased! She used to use it and couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. Will definitely be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my mom</li>
            <li> I love City products . I have been a customer for over 25 years.</li>
            <li> I got this powder for my mother she has used it aleast since 1952 she just loves it. I hope they do not take it off the market.The last time I got it I got it from amazon where as I usually went to the neighborhood drug store. It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t cost tons like some of the more hipper brands today.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a loose powder as good as this, so I felt devastated when the drugstores stopped carrying it! Thank heaven I&#x27;ve found it again!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this again.  I missed it when the drug store stopped carrying it.  Better than any mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20 and African American. An older lady told me about this stuff to fix my &amp;#34;oily makeup after 4 hours&amp;#34; issue. Might I say, I&#x27;m very impressed. I got translucent and it works wonders. My face doesn&#x27;t look white or ghostly like some other brands make me look. Yesterday I worked an 8 hour shift and when I got off work, my face looked just as good as when I walked in. Before this product I&#x27;d have to touch up my makeup 2 or 3 times during the day! Going to order more to last me a while!</li>
            <li> Actually bought this for my mother.  She couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores any longer and has used it for years.  She was thrilled when she received it.  Just what she remembered and wanted.</li>
            <li> I venture to try other powders but I always come back to Coty</li>
            <li> Best loose powder ever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Coty&#x27;s translucent powder for years, and as I have light skin the translucent works fine.  The reason I gave it one star is because this shipment ( I ordered two ) is much darker than what I use and it is labeled &amp;#34;translucent&amp;#34;.  I would not recommend it.  Sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> I love this product it&#x27;s cuts down the oil in my skin and my make stays in place longer.</li>
