            <li>I was happy to find it for an affordable price on Amazon!</li>
            <li>it was awesome.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>

            <li>this color is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>but i surely wish it did, it would be perfect nail polish</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so bright</li>
            <li>I loved this color when I purchased it 3 years ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s streaky and the brush isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>I always get this color &amp; it&#x27;s definitely my favorite of all time!</li>
            <li>probably all sold out because it&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
            <li>each his own,</li>
            <li>I liked that it was made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>Looks beautiful in the bottle and was a good price at a big box store.  </li>
            <li>I have bought better nail polish than this at the dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>But I can just put on my top coat</li>
            <li>So pleased to find the color I have been looking for in the stores.</li>
            <li>Will order more soon.</li>
            <li>If I do top coat it, even after 10 minutes, it seems to smear with every touch.</li>
            <li>i love this color, but it does not stay on no time...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so bright &amp; pretty.</li>
            <li>I painted my nails with this at a friends house and it was neon pink and perfect.</li>
            <li>It is worth paying more for something that is quality.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old bottle that I loved.</li>
            <li>The neon pink is beautiful, but in the end it ends up looking like an Easter egg with no shine to it.</li>
            <li>I got it at the dollar tree, so i&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for it!</li>
            <li>but after putting on 3 coats it was so streaky, I normally use china glaze, but I was in a store and saw 2 colors of sinful I liked, but the 24/7 just did not cover, but I did love the other color I got called mint apple, went on smooth covered with 2 coats no streaks at all and very cute color..</li>
            <li>You get a good, solid color even with one coat.</li>
            <li>I love the bright pink!!</li>
            <li>The sad part is, the color is just beautiful, one of the best I have ever used actually.</li>
            <li>Overall a great purchase &amp; highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I wound up picking a bright pink, part of a set that was named after candies.</li>
            <li>This nail polish is a bright pink.</li>
            <li>It is not even worth two dollars.</li>
            <li>I have several bottles, and I kind of regret that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it and so has my daughter, so returning it wouldn&#x27;t be right.</li>
            <li>Also dries very fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky with how my nail polish shows on my nails</li>
            <li>so I had to put three coats to make it look solid... plus top coat because it dries matte.</li>
            <li>ROSE PINK AND RUNNY</li>
            <li>The first I tried was the bright neon pink solid color.  </li>
            <li>very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is such a beautiful neon pink, and it drys quickly compared to other brands like Avon or Sally Hansen.  </li>
            <li>It was the most vivid pink I could find.</li>
            <li>got something from this brand at my local grocery store, since it was cheap and the other cheap brands didn&#x27;t have colours like this brand</li>
            <li>it does get a little clumpy and isnt that shiny unless you put on a top coat.</li>
            <li>It was more of a mauve pink unlike the neon pink first used.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m going to invest a few more dollars and buy some higher quality polish in the future.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t top coat it, it chips off in big pieces, especially if it gets wet.</li>
            <li>The bottle that came in the mail is drastically darker than my old one.</li>
            <li>bought several bottles because they were less than $2 at the store and the colors are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Did not last long, the color was pretty.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, the colour was pretty dull with only one coat, so I added another coat after I thought it was dry, and the consistency went straight from \\&quot;nail polish\\&quot; to \\&quot;bubblegum\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It turns out the color is COMPLETELY different from the old version.</li>
            <li>Apparently they do not want to be told about their products.  </li>
            <li>I got the hot pink from a local store.  </li>
            <li>I wrote down the exact name and ordered it here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s weirdly thick, I didn&#x27;t find that it dried particularly fast, and after doing a quick search I discovered Sinful Colors tests on animals.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it was flat very flat!</li>
            <li> I do wish it was shiny, and lasted long.</li>
            <li> And won&#x27;t seem to dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like it&#x27;s so goopy that it never intends to dry</li>
            <li> The 24/7 color I recieved was not the same shade as the previous 24/7 I used.</li>
            <li> They obviously have not updated the picture for the nail Polish is a dark pink.</li>
            <li> like I paid a lot for a color that I expected to get and didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a pink, not hot pink/neon pink in color.&lt;br /&gt;Feel</li>
            <li> I tried to put a gloss on it, and the pink polish started to come off and onto the gloss brush instead!</li>
            <li> I will update this in a few days to see just how long this nail polish will stay on.</li>
            <li> I GOT ARE EXTREMELY RUNNY AND</li>
            <li> The color is a flat, dull shade of pink instead of the neon, highlighter pink in the picture.</li>
            <li> It is streaky even after 2 coats and has absolutely no shine, just a dull, flat streaky look.  </li>
            <li> An hour of furiously attempting to dry them later, they finally dried, although it looked very messy, half because the polish was runny and half because I kept on having to re-paint things because I&#x27;d accidentally bump into something and half of the coat would come off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stuck to literally EVERYTHING and would only stay together in little blobs, making it hard to spread around.</li>
            <li> When I went to repurchase the same color I was very disappointed to find out that it was not the same shade of neon hot pink.</li>
            <li> What a waste of my time on this.  </li>
            <li> Usually not a huge fan of Sinful Colors but</li>
            <li> I have bought some terrible nail polishes--can you say, \\&quot;those cheap nail polish sets they market towards little girls that chips off in 2 hours\\&quot;?--but</li>
            <li> But it goes on thick.</li>
            <li> disappointed and will be sending back the bottles I received.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, it is very dull.</li>
            <li> I think they had a bad batch, so I attempted to contact the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> AM TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is the worst nail polish I have ever used.  </li>

            <li> Like others have said, it is very dull. There is no shine at all to this polish. The sad part is, the color is just beautiful, one of the best I have ever used actually. The neon pink is beautiful, but in the end it ends up looking like an Easter egg with no shine to it. lol. I tried to put a gloss on it, and the pink polish started to come off and onto the gloss brush instead! I will update this in a few days to see just how long this nail polish will stay on. I got it at the dollar tree, so i&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for it! I do wish it was shiny, and lasted long. But by the looks of it I don&#x27;t think it will last long, and likely will also rub off like some others have already said. Let&#x27;s see how it handles at the beach!</li>
            <li> Usually not a huge fan of Sinful Colors but this color is AMAZING! I couldn&#x27;t find it in any drugstore - probably all sold out because it&#x27;s so amazing. I was happy to find it for an affordable price on Amazon! Definitely recommended for summer. I&#x27;m pretty picky with how my nail polish shows on my nails so I had to put three coats to make it look solid... plus top coat because it dries matte. Overall a great purchase &amp; highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have bought some terrible nail polishes--can you say, \\&quot;those cheap nail polish sets they market towards little girls that chips off in 2 hours\\&quot;?--but this has somehow wound up still being the worst.&lt;br /&gt;I got something from this brand at my local grocery store, since it was cheap and the other cheap brands didn&#x27;t have colours like this brand did. I wound up picking a bright pink, part of a set that was named after candies. The colour had something to do with bubblegum.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the names are supposed to only reflect the colour, not the consistency of the nail polish. That&#x27;s right, the colour was pretty dull with only one coat, so I added another coat after I thought it was dry, and the consistency went straight from \\&quot;nail polish\\&quot; to \\&quot;bubblegum\\&quot;. It stuck to literally EVERYTHING and would only stay together in little blobs, making it hard to spread around. An hour of furiously attempting to dry them later, they finally dried, although it looked very messy, half because the polish was runny and half because I kept on having to re-paint things because I&#x27;d accidentally bump into something and half of the coat would come off.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion: Don&#x27;t buy this. It is not even worth two dollars. I have bought better nail polish than this at the dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> I loved this color when I purchased it 3 years ago. When I went to repurchase the same color I was very disappointed to find out that it was not the same shade of neon hot pink. They changed the formula and in the process the shade as well.</li>
            <li> The bottle does not look like the picture. The color is a flat, dull shade of pink instead of the neon, highlighter pink in the picture.</li>
            <li> The 24/7 color I recieved was not the same shade as the previous 24/7 I used. It was more of a mauve pink unlike the neon pink first used. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I painted my nails with this at a friends house and it was neon pink and perfect. I wrote down the exact name and ordered it here. It turns out the color is COMPLETELY different from the old version. They obviously have not updated the picture for the nail Polish is a dark pink. It&#x27;s streaky and the brush isn&#x27;t good. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I am an OPI devotee and was overall unimpressed with this nail polish. It&#x27;s weirdly thick, I didn&#x27;t find that it dried particularly fast, and after doing a quick search I discovered Sinful Colors tests on animals. OPI doesn&#x27;t. Will definitely not be making the switch.</li>
            <li> I love the bright pink!! Almost glowing!!! I didn&#x27;t like it was flat very flat! But I can just put on my top coat and it&#x27;s shiny, but after putting on 3 coats it was so streaky, I normally use china glaze, but I was in a store and saw 2 colors of sinful I liked, but the 24/7 just did not cover, but I did love the other color I got called mint apple, went on smooth covered with 2 coats no streaks at all and very cute color.. I will give the 24/7 another try, I do love the color!! It&#x27;s so bright it&#x27;s like if you turned the lights out your fingers would glow!!! Lol..</li>
            <li> Did not last long, the color was pretty.</li>
            <li> Twice now I have been sent a different color than the one shown in the picture to the right.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed and will be sending back the bottles I received.</li>
            <li> So pleased to find the color I have been looking for in the stores. Will order more soon.</li>
            <li> The pictures just don&#x27;t do this polish a justice!  The color is such a beautiful neon pink, and it drys quickly compared to other brands like Avon or Sally Hansen.  I would recommend this product to anyone. Definently will buy again!</li>
            <li> Hm. Well. I have several bottles, and I kind of regret that. I&#x27;ll make a list of pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Great range of colors.&lt;br /&gt;Affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Takes forever to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Thick. I even bought thinner after my bottles started \\&quot;globbing.\\&quot; No good.&lt;br /&gt;Rubs off/chips very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought several bottles because they were less than $2 at the store and the colors are fantastic. Putting it on, it looks great. You get a good, solid color even with one coat. But it goes on thick. And won&#x27;t seem to dry. If I don&#x27;t top coat it, it chips off in big pieces, especially if it gets wet. If I do top coat it, even after 10 minutes, it seems to smear with every touch. It&#x27;s just like it&#x27;s so goopy that it never intends to dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To each his own, but I&#x27;m going to invest a few more dollars and buy some higher quality polish in the future.</li>
            <li> I always get this color &amp; it&#x27;s definitely my favorite of all time! It&#x27;s so bright &amp; pretty. Also dries very fast.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 different colors.  The first I tried was the bright neon pink solid color.  Looks beautiful in the bottle and was a good price at a big box store.  I liked that it was made in the USA.  It is the worst nail polish I have ever used.  It is streaky even after 2 coats and has absolutely no shine, just a dull, flat streaky look.  What a waste of my time on this.  It is worth paying more for something that is quality.</li>
            <li> I got the hot pink from a local store.  It will not cover even after 4 coats and is a matte finish.  I think they had a bad batch, so I attempted to contact the manufacturer.  Their contact page is a joke and never works.  Apparently they do not want to be told about their products.  I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old bottle that I loved. It was the most vivid pink I could find. The bottle that came in the mail is drastically darker than my old one. Same product code: 24/7 920. I would never buy this if I saw it in the store! Bummer.</li>
            <li> Color that came wasn&#x27;t the same as it appeared in the picture. It&#x27;s just a pink, not hot pink/neon pink in color.&lt;br /&gt;Feel like I paid a lot for a color that I expected to get and didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve used it and so has my daughter, so returning it wouldn&#x27;t be right.</li>
            <li> TOTALLY DIFFERENT COLOR THAN&lt;br /&gt;PHOTO AND WHAT 24/7&lt;br /&gt;ACTUAL COLOR IS.&lt;br /&gt;THE 6 BOTTLES I JUST GOT ARE&lt;br /&gt;A ROSE PINK AND RUNNY LIKE WATER.&lt;br /&gt;ALL THE SINFUL COLOR POLISHES I GOT ARE EXTREMELY RUNNY AND&lt;br /&gt;I AM TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is a bright pink. Although i did not buy it from amazon it was awesome. it does get a little clumpy and isnt that shiny unless you put on a top coat.</li>
            <li> i love this color, but it does not stay on no time... but i surely wish it did, it would be perfect nail polish</li>
