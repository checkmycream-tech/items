            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>This gave me one of the best shaves</li>
            <li>But the truth is, I just find that this stuff doesn&#x27;t do a very good job.</li>
            <li>This product is very good for the skin.</li>
            <li>this is very, very good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great performer with a brush and makes very good, cushiony lather.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of great shave creams.  </li>
            <li>My face feels great despite having to run a razor over it a couple of times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this KMF product for over a week now, and can happily report no issues with my skin...</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>I use this with my panasonic wet/dry in the shower - it works great.  </li>
            <li>Also I didn&#x27;t experience any rash or redness which is great.</li>
            <li>My Face does a great job of preparing the skin for shaving.  </li>
            <li>But in the end, this stuff just doesn&#x27;t do a great job.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great for travel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works great with my Frank Shaving Finest Badger Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great shave, no smell.</li>
            <li>I have not tried it by itself but it would probably work great also.</li>
            <li>It truly is an all around great product</li>
            <li>This is a really great product.</li>
            <li>and I have to say it works great.</li>
            <li>Great price too.</li>
            <li>My face felt great afterward.  </li>
            <li>Great shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Great shave.</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>Let the cologne or perfume take care of that - this is a great product for EVERYONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this stuff is awesome glad I discovered it, use it with brush and it lathers greatly try it</li>
            <li>Great product for anyone who is looking for an exceptional product</li>
            <li>It also has a rather pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Works good for making a lather for shaving</li>
            <li>If I wanted a face scrubber or cleaner, maybe this would be good, but not as a shaving lotion.</li>
            <li>and I agree - it is a really good product for about 1/5 the price of the others.  </li>
            <li>Looking for a good shave, Kiss</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good for traveling too.</li>
            <li>Fairly good choice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sensitive skin or not, who honestly thinks adding fragrance to shaving cream is a great idea?</li>
            <li>Not saying this is the best cream ever, but it is quite good and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>I was very glad I did.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product and</li>
            <li>, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>He has been very pleased with the lather and</li>
            <li>Product very refreshing without any discomfort.</li>
            <li>I will probably purchase it again until I find something better that we both are happy with.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it as well!</li>

            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of shave creams, but this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>Love that I can get this in a travel-ish size!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>It whips up easily, goes on smooth, and lubricates the DE razor perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is great, cheap, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>That was my own fault for not looking at the oz before I bought</li>
            <li>No harmful additives, like SLS or parabens, lathers up nicely...</li>
            <li>This product is just ok for emergency shaving when i run out of the good stuff i guess.</li>
            <li>Nivea is the good stuff and this stuff is just ok.</li>
            <li>Relieves irritation and tastes/smells nice.</li>
            <li>it lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>I liked that feeling on my legs also.</li>
            <li>Also, I was getting a nice soapy foam, but</li>
            <li>I have this nice &amp;#34;fragrance-free&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The best thing about this gel is that it doesn&#x27;t foam much at all.  </li>
            <li>It lathered nicely and didn&#x27;t give me any irritation afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, perfumey scent, but it is rather strong.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, perfumey scent, but it is rather strong.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling smooth and moist and no fragrance/parabens, nice!</li>
            <li>After trying different methods of getting a good lather, I concluded that just squirting a dab on my damp-soaked and shakened badger brush gave me the best results.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product works great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent product for those who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Best shaving cream I&#x27;ve used to far.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much better I would like lotion-like shaving creams over the foam kind.</li>
            <li>Shave is very smooth, Does not burn afterwards</li>
            <li>Very smooth and protects the skin well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In fact, he likes the brand better than some of the fancier men&#x27;s brands</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shave cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li>More soapy and foamy than I like a shave cream.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get a better shave for the money&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It works OK.</li>
            <li>Have tried many types of shave non-aerosol shave creams.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This stuff I love</li>
            <li>Just wish that something that smelled better and wasn&#x27;t a foam would give a better shave.</li>
            <li>We have not even needed to buy more yet.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Been using this product for many years.</li>
            <li>Being unscented makes it all the better.</li>
            <li>The vitamins, oils and aloe vera are soothing and moisturizing and allow for the best shave possible.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this product is the fact that I actually knew what the ingredients were.  </li>
            <li>I love this moisture shave cream.</li>
            <li>I used to buy the Boxy Shop brand, but I like this one even more.</li>
            <li>This suddenly became the most awesome shave soap ever!</li>
            <li>After doing quite a bit of online reading, I found that many people are using shaving cream with these electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>Many of these findings are subjective (like smell).  </li>
            <li>6 min. 16 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5</li>
            <li>Eshu lubricated my face better and felt like it was more soothing after shaving.  </li>
            <li>It provided better lubrication, but was also foamier.  </li>
            <li>The odor was better than the lower rated gels but still wasn&#x27;t something desirable.  </li>
            <li>Tolerable would be a better</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nivea for men was the second best gel I tried.  </li>
            <li>It has many positives.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my favorite of the shaving gels I tried.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;Nivea for men was the second best gel I tried.  </li>
            <li>It has many positives.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my favorite of the shaving gels I tried.  </li>
            <li>It works great with a shave brush and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s THE BEST, especially because there is not any fragrance.</li>
            <li>There are better products out there.</li>
            <li>i can use it before i use electric shaver or afterwards, makes the skin feel good and relieves any irritation right away.</li>
            <li>and I was really amazed how nice and silky my legs felt!  </li>
            <li>Love the texture (it gives nice, creamy lather with excellent slickness) and the all natural ingredients it is made of - no harsh chemicals or parabens.</li>
            <li>I usually buy higher end shaving creams but this is great for the price and for travelling or when you want to skip lathering with a brush, the best choice for it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Says it works great and leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I know exactly how much is in the tube, I have full control over dispensing the stuff, and at 3.4 oz, it&#x27;s perfect for TSA checkpoints.</li>
            <li>The ingredients include things like coconut oil, aloe vera, arnica, and vitamin E oil--all great things for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it is fragrance and preservative free; these are things that have always given me skin irritations.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog up my blades and easily washes out from razor.  </li>
            <li>It creates a silky lather that the razor just glides over and then rinses away easily.  </li>
            <li>You could easily see your skin and hair stubble.  </li>
            <li>Rub it on your face while wet, or better yet, use a good shaving brush - your face will love you for it!</li>
            <li>Hands down the best shaving cream I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent shave cream, with less toxic chemicals that we have been using for years in a travel size.</li>
            <li>I have used the product before and it is fine.</li>
            <li>Makes tremendous lather!</li>
            <li>or if it had to have one, that it was more mild.  </li>
            <li>or if it had to have one, that it was more mild.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect product for my sensitive skin, as well, and nearly fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>Works really well, nice close smooth shave and no rash/burn.</li>
            <li>It gave me a smooth, clean, easy shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take too much product to generate a nice lather</li>
            <li>Baby smooth face now.</li>
            <li>great product /  use a tiny amount and add some water and massage</li>
            <li>My skin felt smooth and hydrate after the shave.</li>
            <li>This fragrance free shaving cream from Kiss</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s officially Fragrance Free, but they don&#x27;t mask it, either.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, when this one runs out, one of the scented versions of this stuff will be available via Subscribe &amp; Save too.</li>
            <li>and the cap is quit secure</li>
            <li>We have to have fragrance free and this fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>This Gel has worked well for me and shave is smooth as well.</li>
            <li>I think it also makes for smoother, irritation free shave.</li>
            <li>I have deducted one star because it says it is &#x27;fragrance free&#x27; but that just does not seem to be the case for me.</li>
            <li>Great for electric shaving, especially if you slap some water on your face after applying this.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate at all and is truly fragrance free.</li>
            <li>, surprised how good it lathered up, I used with my merkur 38c  and gillete blue razor blade, a match made in heaven, now I enjoy shaving again, just great, buy it.</li>
            <li>Fragrance Free:  </li>
            <li>Fragrance Free:  </li>
            <li>It is good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is a good cream for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is EVEN BETTER in the shower (like everything else, right?</li>
            <li>Make sure you stay away from the water until you are done because it will come right off if you splash accidentally.</li>
            <li>love that it is a more natural shaving cream as many creams are FULL of chemicals.</li>
            <li>The 3.4 oz size is also TSA friendly.</li>
            <li>It contains antiseptic peppermint that cools and stimulates your skin and soapwort that forms a rich lather.</li>
            <li>to Shave:  5 min. 21 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  3 out of 5</li>
            <li>Dog Original Shave Gel:  </li>
            <li>sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br</li>
            <li>No residue, no sting, TSA friendly sizing, inexpensive...</li>
            <li>This meant it took longer to shave and longer to clean my razor afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I liked that it is made of natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I tend to use unscented products and this is a true unscented cream.  </li>
            <li>This shaving gel gives me a nice, natural lather</li>
            <li>Shave Cool Mint.  </li>
            <li>Shave Cool Mint.  </li>
            <li>It was better than shaving without any type of shave cream or gel, but not by much.</li>
            <li>You have a loyal customer now.</li>
            <li>Again the Eshu was faster to shave with than the Bold for Men or the Alphagel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is probably one of the most cost effective due to this.  </li>
            <li>It is probably one of the most cost effective due to this.  </li>
            <li>so, I put a couple drops on top of my dab of KMF cream and wow!</li>
            <li>The Alphagel left it feeling more smooth and cool.  </li>
            <li>My husband says he really does enjoy the cooling sensation from the peppermint in it.</li>
            <li>I love that this is made of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>The Kiss My Face Moisture Shave Fragrance Free is a fantastic natural product.</li>
            <li>you feel fresh, instead of your face</li>
            <li>end\\&quot; shave creams, this stuff is FANTASTIC for sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li>This one as good as most, although I think you can get by with a very small amount.</li>
            <li>Unlike many others, it actually protects the skin from blade razor cuts and is washed clean from an electic shaver as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Still smells funny, but it goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>There are several different smells and all do a great job.</li>
            <li>a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I had previously used Aveeno&#x27;s shaving lotion, and loved it, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores recently.</li>
            <li>After trying several shaving creams this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite shave products, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>This is much more similar to shaving with a lotion than shaving with a soap.</li>
            <li>;) ).</li>
            <li>My only problem is that the price raised from $4 to over $6, making it cheaper to buy it in the store than from the much more convenient Amazon.</li>
            <li>it is like using conditioner (if you have ever run out of lather on a road trip) only better.</li>
            <li>I love an alternative to the ingredients you find in the big name shaving creams.</li>
            <li>but I am only mentioning it so you can pay attention to the price per oz while shopping. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products but this one finally does what I&#x27;ve been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;-Good</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>This shave cream comes in a decidedly unmanly looking tube with pastel color scheme (a larger pump bottle is also available), but don&#x27;t let that deter you!</li>
            <li>After the shave my skin felt so soft and smooth,</li>
            <li>a result I&#x27;ve never been able to get with traditional shaving creams and gels.  </li>
            <li>So much better than your standard aerosol shaving cream!</li>
            <li>His face is so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I like this product because it&#x27;s a safe alternative to traditional shave cream and the packaging doesn&#x27;t leave rust on my shower shelves.</li>
            <li>Start hot water at bathroom sink faucet.  </li>
            <li>It definitely helps keep in the moisture in your legs and wherever else, and I love that it&#x27;s not foamy.</li>
            <li>to Shave:  4 min. 58 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  1 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  1 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  5 out of 5</li>
            <li>(Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face</li>
            <li>After I was done shaving and I washed the gel off of my face, I found it made my face feel really hot.  </li>

            <li>Was using one of the high priced shaving products in a tube and started reading reviews on other shaving gels/cremes and this got consistently good reviews from people</li>
            <li>It works very well without a lot of the gross chemicals leaving you with a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>stuff is amazing for the price, I can tell the difference in my face if I don&#x27;t add it to my other shaving creams.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean all after a wet shave for face and unit.</li>
            <li>Honestly feels better than the Proraso shaving cream I used to use, and seems to last longer too (as in you need less on the brush)</li>
            <li>Overall this is an outstanding product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It took a little more time to clean my razor afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It took a little more time to clean my razor afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I have used nearly every common shaving cream on the market and this is by far the best one I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Bull Dog had about as much foam as I would be willing to put up with and still use with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>The small quantity makes it a good travel item.</li>
            <li>My face felt only mildly irritated after each shave (barely noticeable) and my skin was in much better condition by the end of the week.  </li>
            <li>never makes my skin react and always leaves it super soft.</li>
            <li>I am highly sensitive to scents and even mild soap cause irritation while shaving.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find any shaving cream that didn&#x27;t dry out and irritate the skin on my legs until now.</li>
            <li>However, the product arrived with large stickers that had been removed (I am thinking this package has been re-purposed).</li>
            <li>Kind of a funny smell (doesn&#x27;t really bother me after the first 10 seconds though), and it dries out a little quick (easy to fix with a few drops of water).</li>
            <li>It is also a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The price is also really reasonable too.</li>
            <li>You do not need much to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaving cream!</li>
            <li>It packs really well</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work very well..</li>
            <li>It is cushiony smooth goodness that won&#x27;t make your razor drag or tug, and leaves your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I have found that it really makes a difference in building the lather, it makes the lather thicker and creamier.</li>
            <li>The foaming thing is a gimmick anyways, you don&#x27;t really need it.  </li>
            <li>Just a smidgen is all you really need.</li>
            <li>It went straight in the garbage can.</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want as much foam with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>It was much thicker than any of the lower rated gels I tested.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to shave with it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to shave with it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really moisturizes your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and have tried all the top high dollar shave creams with multiple razors.  </li>
            <li>(Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  3 out 5</li>
            <li>It actually was too clean, like it was left too much friction on the face, as opposed to a smooth, well-lubricated lotion/gel.  </li>
            <li>It is very slippery and it protects better from razor burn than any other shaving product we have tried.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it, especially if you have sensitive skin or can&#x27;t stand the smell of most shaving products.</li>
            <li>I open it &amp; add some doTERRA essential oils to scent it exactly how I want it which makes me like it even more.</li>
            <li>add a LITTLE more hot water.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than conventional cream.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li>Overall, not a bad shave, but</li>
            <li>My Face is my new go-to for my shaving needs!  </li>
            <li>It provides a close, comfortable shave, and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like the lathering type of shave cream (lather&#x3D;soap&#x3D;dryness).</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it because it&#x27;s gentle on his sensitive skin, moisturizing and provides a smoother cleaner shave.</li>
            <li>I tend to use a LOT to get decent coverage on my face, and then as I am shaving, it just rinses away</li>
            <li>I have used this (in this packaging and in the larger &amp;#34;Pump&amp;#34; container) for years now, mostly with a Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver and double blade razors.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and shaving with this gave me a  close shave and left my skin feeling comfortable afterwards.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend</li>
            <li>and like it a little better.</li>
            <li>Having not used other products, probably won&#x27;t, this could easily be 5-star.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described - thanks for the simple buying experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m afraid this is too good to be true - something will happen to kill this product or change the formula now that I have found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It rinses off easily which is good and bad.</li>
            <li>Blade clogging was moderate to major; it took some effort to clean it out.  </li>
            <li>After Use  3 out of 5  (felt raw but pretty smooth and 1 nick)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  5th</li>
            <li>This is a fragrance free shave cream that I like to add to my other shaving</li>
            <li>While on vacation I thought I needed new blades -  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sensitive for your skin.</li>
            <li>My skin was left feeling moisturized and very very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very sensitive to your skin.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this stuff!</li>
            <li>I bought this smaller tube of it to try it out first</li>
            <li>The razor goes down smooth, and when you&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other products, such as Headslick or Edge make for a much easier and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>It is fragrance free but does have a slight &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; odor.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the cool mint flavor but the other ones work just as well.</li>
            <li>After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  </li>
            <li>After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  2rd</li>

            <li>One of the few things I liked about the Alphagel was that it left my face feeling cool instead of raw like the Eshu.  </li>
            <li>My Face, my skin felt kind of rough after I shaved, however, afterwards the skin really did feel softer, and unlike other shaving cremes I&#x27;ve used this product didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky and dry.</li>
            <li>Well, the solution for both issues became clear.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>for sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;-Reduced or eliminated irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>, the last 10% really s-l-o-w-l-y, and you can&#x27;t take it through an airport.</li>
            <li>Some products with a similar consistency feel &#x27;slimy&#x27; and you really have to scrub to get it off your skin.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your Skin feeling soft with no irritation.</li>
            <li>Alphagel Sensitive Skin:  </li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t think enough to lubricate very well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Nivea for Men, Sensitive Shaving Gel: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BIL9HZE/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft with no irritation.</li>
            <li>and it makes a nice thin coat for a close shave.</li>
            <li>It is at least as good as any other foaming shaving cream but with the added benefit of being free of harsh chemicals etc...</li>
            <li>You may have different results if you use a different shaver or if your skin is more or less sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I have ranked them starting with the worst, Bold for Men and finished with the best, Kiss My Face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold</li>
            <li>I have tried using my hands and a shaving brush to apply it - the shaving brush worked a little better, but ultimately I still had the same problem.</li>
            <li>My shave is just as easy as always, much easier than with some thin shave creams.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out at all while you shave in the shower, and the steam really seems to increase the moisture levels on your skin.</li>
            <li>It has really helped my dry skin on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li>Creamy, with just a tiny bit of lather and it leaves my sensitive skin really soft.  </li>
            <li>like the fragrance free because I sometimes will pair this with a scented hard shaving soap.</li>
            <li>My skin was more irritated by the end of a week of usage; I had three nicks on the last day (only 1 for the Alphagel); and it left my face feeling really raw after shaving.  </li>
            <li>While described as fragrance free, there was a very slight plastic smell that I could only smell if I stuck it right up to my nose and sniffed heavily.  </li>
            <li>While described as fragrance free, there was a very slight plastic smell that I could only smell if I stuck it right up to my nose and sniffed heavily.  </li>
            <li>SO, I am going to continue my search for a natural product that will actually get the job done.</li>
            <li>my husband has sensitive skin and this is the only shave cream he uses.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;foam up\\&quot; when you apply it, but that is because it&#x27;s a natural product, without the chemicals in the traditional brands.  </li>
            <li>My Face which is at least as good if not better.</li>
            <li>so I like using a really good shaving cream to prevent cutting and irritation and this does the trick.</li>
            <li>I wish the tube were a little bigger because it does go quick between him and</li>
            <li>(Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  2 out 5</li>
            <li>(Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  1 out 5</li>

            <li>(Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  4 out 5</li>
            <li>Using a semi-wet brush in a small bowl, it whips up quickly into a silky lather.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and there isn&#x27;t that funky residue left by traditional shaving creams.</li>
            <li>let a LITTLE hot water onto the palm.  </li>
            <li>dog represented a major step up from the last shave gel (the Eshu).  </li>
            <li>After shave cream razor era trying to get a close shave, used a rotary triple head for years and tough with gray becoming dominant.</li>
            <li>Truth is, I hear most people buy this locally for a similar price, but I couldn&#x27;t find it and was tired of looking.  </li>
            <li>You only need a small amount for it to work; it is thick enough to protect my skin well (meaning my face felt good after a shave instead of raw); and I got a reasonably close shave from it.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve long been a fan of Kiss My Face products, so it was only natural that I try this shave cream in a convenient pump.  </li>
            <li>At first when I got it I was a little worried about using it, because I have used a lot of products that have just fallen flat on what they claim to do, however, once I used it</li>

            <li> This product is very good for the skin.</li>
            <li> this is very, very good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great performer with a brush and makes very good, cushiony lather.</li>

            <li> Great product for anyone who is looking for an exceptional product</li>
            <li> It also has a rather pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Works good for making a lather for shaving</li>
            <li> If I wanted a face scrubber or cleaner, maybe this would be good, but not as a shaving lotion.</li>
            <li> and I agree - it is a really good product for about 1/5 the price of the others.  </li>
            <li> Looking for a good shave, Kiss</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good for traveling too.</li>
            <li> Fairly good choice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sensitive skin or not, who honestly thinks adding fragrance to shaving cream is a great idea?</li>
            <li> Not saying this is the best cream ever, but it is quite good and the price is right.  </li>
            <li> I was very glad I did.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product and</li>
            <li> , I am very pleased with this product.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it as well!</li>
            <li> will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of shave creams, but this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Love that I can get this in a travel-ish size!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> It whips up easily, goes on smooth, and lubricates the DE razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is great, cheap, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> That was my own fault for not looking at the oz before I bought</li>
            <li> No harmful additives, like SLS or parabens, lathers up nicely...</li>
            <li> This product is just ok for emergency shaving when i run out of the good stuff i guess.</li>
            <li> Nivea is the good stuff and this stuff is just ok.</li>
            <li> Relieves irritation and tastes/smells nice.</li>
            <li> it lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> I liked that feeling on my legs also.</li>
            <li> Also, I was getting a nice soapy foam, but</li>
            <li> I have this nice &amp;#34;fragrance-free&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The best thing about this gel is that it doesn&#x27;t foam much at all.  </li>
            <li> It lathered nicely and didn&#x27;t give me any irritation afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant, perfumey scent, but it is rather strong.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant, perfumey scent, but it is rather strong.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling smooth and moist and no fragrance/parabens, nice!</li>
            <li> After trying different methods of getting a good lather, I concluded that just squirting a dab on my damp-soaked and shakened badger brush gave me the best results.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product works great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product for those who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream I&#x27;ve used to far.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much better I would like lotion-like shaving creams over the foam kind.</li>
            <li> Shave is very smooth, Does not burn afterwards</li>
            <li> Very smooth and protects the skin well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In fact, he likes the brand better than some of the fancier men&#x27;s brands</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shave cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li> More soapy and foamy than I like a shave cream.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get a better shave for the money&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It works OK.</li>
            <li> Have tried many types of shave non-aerosol shave creams.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff I love</li>
            <li> Just wish that something that smelled better and wasn&#x27;t a foam would give a better shave.</li>
            <li> We have not even needed to buy more yet.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Been using this product for many years.</li>
            <li> Being unscented makes it all the better.</li>
            <li> The vitamins, oils and aloe vera are soothing and moisturizing and allow for the best shave possible.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product is the fact that I actually knew what the ingredients were.  </li>
            <li> I love this moisture shave cream.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the Boxy Shop brand, but I like this one even more.</li>
            <li> This suddenly became the most awesome shave soap ever!</li>
            <li> After doing quite a bit of online reading, I found that many people are using shaving cream with these electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> Many of these findings are subjective (like smell).  </li>
            <li> 6 min. 16 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5</li>
            <li> Eshu lubricated my face better and felt like it was more soothing after shaving.  </li>
            <li> It provided better lubrication, but was also foamier.  </li>
            <li> The odor was better than the lower rated gels but still wasn&#x27;t something desirable.  </li>
            <li> Tolerable would be a better</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nivea for men was the second best gel I tried.  </li>
            <li> It has many positives.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my favorite of the shaving gels I tried.  </li>
            <li> The odor was better than the lower rated gels but still wasn&#x27;t something desirable.  </li>
            <li> Tolerable would be a better</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nivea for men was the second best gel I tried.  </li>
            <li> It has many positives.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my favorite of the shaving gels I tried.  </li>
            <li> It works great with a shave brush and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s THE BEST, especially because there is not any fragrance.</li>
            <li> There are better products out there.</li>
            <li> i can use it before i use electric shaver or afterwards, makes the skin feel good and relieves any irritation right away.</li>
            <li> and I was really amazed how nice and silky my legs felt!  </li>
            <li> Love the texture (it gives nice, creamy lather with excellent slickness) and the all natural ingredients it is made of - no harsh chemicals or parabens.</li>
            <li> I usually buy higher end shaving creams but this is great for the price and for travelling or when you want to skip lathering with a brush, the best choice for it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Says it works great and leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I know exactly how much is in the tube, I have full control over dispensing the stuff, and at 3.4 oz, it&#x27;s perfect for TSA checkpoints.</li>
            <li> The ingredients include things like coconut oil, aloe vera, arnica, and vitamin E oil--all great things for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it is fragrance and preservative free; these are things that have always given me skin irritations.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clog up my blades and easily washes out from razor.  </li>
            <li> It creates a silky lather that the razor just glides over and then rinses away easily.  </li>
            <li> You could easily see your skin and hair stubble.  </li>
            <li> Rub it on your face while wet, or better yet, use a good shaving brush - your face will love you for it!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best shaving cream I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent shave cream, with less toxic chemicals that we have been using for years in a travel size.</li>
            <li> I have used the product before and it is fine.</li>
            <li> Makes tremendous lather!</li>
            <li> or if it had to have one, that it was more mild.  </li>
            <li> or if it had to have one, that it was more mild.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect product for my sensitive skin, as well, and nearly fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> Works really well, nice close smooth shave and no rash/burn.</li>
            <li> It gave me a smooth, clean, easy shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take too much product to generate a nice lather</li>
            <li> Baby smooth face now.</li>
            <li> great product /  use a tiny amount and add some water and massage</li>
            <li> My skin felt smooth and hydrate after the shave.</li>
            <li> This fragrance free shaving cream from Kiss</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s officially Fragrance Free, but they don&#x27;t mask it, either.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, when this one runs out, one of the scented versions of this stuff will be available via Subscribe &amp; Save too.</li>
            <li> and the cap is quit secure</li>
            <li> We have to have fragrance free and this fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> This Gel has worked well for me and shave is smooth as well.</li>
            <li> I think it also makes for smoother, irritation free shave.</li>
            <li> I have deducted one star because it says it is &#x27;fragrance free&#x27; but that just does not seem to be the case for me.</li>
            <li> Great for electric shaving, especially if you slap some water on your face after applying this.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate at all and is truly fragrance free.</li>
            <li> , surprised how good it lathered up, I used with my merkur 38c  and gillete blue razor blade, a match made in heaven, now I enjoy shaving again, just great, buy it.</li>
            <li> Fragrance Free:  </li>
            <li> Fragrance Free:  </li>
            <li> It is good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a good cream for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is EVEN BETTER in the shower (like everything else, right?</li>
            <li> Make sure you stay away from the water until you are done because it will come right off if you splash accidentally.</li>
            <li> love that it is a more natural shaving cream as many creams are FULL of chemicals.</li>
            <li> The 3.4 oz size is also TSA friendly.</li>
            <li> It contains antiseptic peppermint that cools and stimulates your skin and soapwort that forms a rich lather.</li>
            <li> to Shave:  5 min. 21 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  3 out of 5</li>
            <li> Dog Original Shave Gel:  </li>
            <li> sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br</li>
            <li> No residue, no sting, TSA friendly sizing, inexpensive...</li>
            <li> This meant it took longer to shave and longer to clean my razor afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I liked that it is made of natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I tend to use unscented products and this is a true unscented cream.  </li>
            <li> This shaving gel gives me a nice, natural lather</li>
            <li> Shave Cool Mint.  </li>
            <li> Shave Cool Mint.  </li>
            <li> It was better than shaving without any type of shave cream or gel, but not by much.</li>
            <li> You have a loyal customer now.</li>
            <li> Again the Eshu was faster to shave with than the Bold for Men or the Alphagel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is probably one of the most cost effective due to this.  </li>
            <li> It is probably one of the most cost effective due to this.  </li>
            <li> so, I put a couple drops on top of my dab of KMF cream and wow!</li>
            <li> The Alphagel left it feeling more smooth and cool.  </li>
            <li> My husband says he really does enjoy the cooling sensation from the peppermint in it.</li>
            <li> I love that this is made of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> The Kiss My Face Moisture Shave Fragrance Free is a fantastic natural product.</li>
            <li> you feel fresh, instead of your face</li>
            <li> end\\&quot; shave creams, this stuff is FANTASTIC for sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li> This one as good as most, although I think you can get by with a very small amount.</li>
            <li> Unlike many others, it actually protects the skin from blade razor cuts and is washed clean from an electic shaver as well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Still smells funny, but it goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> There are several different smells and all do a great job.</li>
            <li> a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I had previously used Aveeno&#x27;s shaving lotion, and loved it, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores recently.</li>
            <li> After trying several shaving creams this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite shave products, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This is much more similar to shaving with a lotion than shaving with a soap.</li>
            <li> ;) ).</li>
            <li> My only problem is that the price raised from $4 to over $6, making it cheaper to buy it in the store than from the much more convenient Amazon.</li>
            <li> it is like using conditioner (if you have ever run out of lather on a road trip) only better.</li>
            <li> I love an alternative to the ingredients you find in the big name shaving creams.</li>
            <li> but I am only mentioning it so you can pay attention to the price per oz while shopping. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products but this one finally does what I&#x27;ve been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;-Good</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> This shave cream comes in a decidedly unmanly looking tube with pastel color scheme (a larger pump bottle is also available), but don&#x27;t let that deter you!</li>
            <li> After the shave my skin felt so soft and smooth,</li>
            <li> a result I&#x27;ve never been able to get with traditional shaving creams and gels.  </li>
            <li> So much better than your standard aerosol shaving cream!</li>
            <li> His face is so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it&#x27;s a safe alternative to traditional shave cream and the packaging doesn&#x27;t leave rust on my shower shelves.</li>
            <li> Start hot water at bathroom sink faucet.  </li>
            <li> It definitely helps keep in the moisture in your legs and wherever else, and I love that it&#x27;s not foamy.</li>

            <li> Was using one of the high priced shaving products in a tube and started reading reviews on other shaving gels/cremes and this got consistently good reviews from people</li>
            <li> It works very well without a lot of the gross chemicals leaving you with a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> stuff is amazing for the price, I can tell the difference in my face if I don&#x27;t add it to my other shaving creams.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean all after a wet shave for face and unit.</li>
            <li> Honestly feels better than the Proraso shaving cream I used to use, and seems to last longer too (as in you need less on the brush)</li>
            <li> Overall this is an outstanding product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It took a little more time to clean my razor afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It took a little more time to clean my razor afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I have used nearly every common shaving cream on the market and this is by far the best one I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Bull Dog had about as much foam as I would be willing to put up with and still use with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> The small quantity makes it a good travel item.</li>
            <li> My face felt only mildly irritated after each shave (barely noticeable) and my skin was in much better condition by the end of the week.  </li>
            <li> never makes my skin react and always leaves it super soft.</li>
            <li> I am highly sensitive to scents and even mild soap cause irritation while shaving.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find any shaving cream that didn&#x27;t dry out and irritate the skin on my legs until now.</li>
            <li> However, the product arrived with large stickers that had been removed (I am thinking this package has been re-purposed).</li>
            <li> Kind of a funny smell (doesn&#x27;t really bother me after the first 10 seconds though), and it dries out a little quick (easy to fix with a few drops of water).</li>
            <li> It is also a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The price is also really reasonable too.</li>
            <li> You do not need much to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaving cream!</li>
            <li> It packs really well</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work very well..</li>
            <li> It is cushiony smooth goodness that won&#x27;t make your razor drag or tug, and leaves your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have found that it really makes a difference in building the lather, it makes the lather thicker and creamier.</li>
            <li> The foaming thing is a gimmick anyways, you don&#x27;t really need it.  </li>
            <li> Just a smidgen is all you really need.</li>
            <li> It went straight in the garbage can.</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want as much foam with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> It was much thicker than any of the lower rated gels I tested.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to shave with it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to shave with it.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really moisturizes your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and have tried all the top high dollar shave creams with multiple razors.  </li>
            <li> (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  3 out 5</li>
            <li> It actually was too clean, like it was left too much friction on the face, as opposed to a smooth, well-lubricated lotion/gel.  </li>
            <li> It is very slippery and it protects better from razor burn than any other shaving product we have tried.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it, especially if you have sensitive skin or can&#x27;t stand the smell of most shaving products.</li>
            <li> I open it &amp; add some doTERRA essential oils to scent it exactly how I want it which makes me like it even more.</li>
            <li> add a LITTLE more hot water.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than conventional cream.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li> Overall, not a bad shave, but</li>
            <li> My Face is my new go-to for my shaving needs!  </li>
            <li> It provides a close, comfortable shave, and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like the lathering type of shave cream (lather&#x3D;soap&#x3D;dryness).</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it because it&#x27;s gentle on his sensitive skin, moisturizing and provides a smoother cleaner shave.</li>
            <li> I tend to use a LOT to get decent coverage on my face, and then as I am shaving, it just rinses away</li>
            <li> I have used this (in this packaging and in the larger &amp;#34;Pump&amp;#34; container) for years now, mostly with a Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver and double blade razors.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and shaving with this gave me a  close shave and left my skin feeling comfortable afterwards.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend</li>
            <li> and like it a little better.</li>
            <li> Having not used other products, probably won&#x27;t, this could easily be 5-star.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described - thanks for the simple buying experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid this is too good to be true - something will happen to kill this product or change the formula now that I have found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It rinses off easily which is good and bad.</li>
            <li> Blade clogging was moderate to major; it took some effort to clean it out.  </li>
            <li> After Use  3 out of 5  (felt raw but pretty smooth and 1 nick)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  5th</li>
            <li> This is a fragrance free shave cream that I like to add to my other shaving</li>
            <li> While on vacation I thought I needed new blades -  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sensitive for your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin was left feeling moisturized and very very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very sensitive to your skin.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this stuff!</li>
            <li> I bought this smaller tube of it to try it out first</li>
            <li> The razor goes down smooth, and when you&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other products, such as Headslick or Edge make for a much easier and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> It is fragrance free but does have a slight &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; odor.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the cool mint flavor but the other ones work just as well.</li>
            <li> After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  </li>
            <li> After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  2rd</li>

            <li> One of the few things I liked about the Alphagel was that it left my face feeling cool instead of raw like the Eshu.  </li>
            <li> My Face, my skin felt kind of rough after I shaved, however, afterwards the skin really did feel softer, and unlike other shaving cremes I&#x27;ve used this product didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky and dry.</li>
            <li> Well, the solution for both issues became clear.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> for sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;-Reduced or eliminated irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> , the last 10% really s-l-o-w-l-y, and you can&#x27;t take it through an airport.</li>
            <li> Some products with a similar consistency feel &#x27;slimy&#x27; and you really have to scrub to get it off your skin.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your Skin feeling soft with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Alphagel Sensitive Skin:  </li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t think enough to lubricate very well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Nivea for Men, Sensitive Shaving Gel: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BIL9HZE/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nivea for Men, Sensitive Shaving Gel: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BIL9HZE/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft with no irritation.</li>
            <li> and it makes a nice thin coat for a close shave.</li>
            <li> It is at least as good as any other foaming shaving cream but with the added benefit of being free of harsh chemicals etc...</li>
            <li> You may have different results if you use a different shaver or if your skin is more or less sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I have ranked them starting with the worst, Bold for Men and finished with the best, Kiss My Face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold</li>
            <li> I have tried using my hands and a shaving brush to apply it - the shaving brush worked a little better, but ultimately I still had the same problem.</li>
            <li> My shave is just as easy as always, much easier than with some thin shave creams.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out at all while you shave in the shower, and the steam really seems to increase the moisture levels on your skin.</li>
            <li> It has really helped my dry skin on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> Creamy, with just a tiny bit of lather and it leaves my sensitive skin really soft.  </li>
            <li> like the fragrance free because I sometimes will pair this with a scented hard shaving soap.</li>
            <li> My skin was more irritated by the end of a week of usage; I had three nicks on the last day (only 1 for the Alphagel); and it left my face feeling really raw after shaving.  </li>
            <li> While described as fragrance free, there was a very slight plastic smell that I could only smell if I stuck it right up to my nose and sniffed heavily.  </li>

            <li> SO, I am going to continue my search for a natural product that will actually get the job done.</li>
            <li> my husband has sensitive skin and this is the only shave cream he uses.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;foam up\\&quot; when you apply it, but that is because it&#x27;s a natural product, without the chemicals in the traditional brands.  </li>
            <li> My Face which is at least as good if not better.</li>
            <li> so I like using a really good shaving cream to prevent cutting and irritation and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> I wish the tube were a little bigger because it does go quick between him and</li>
            <li> (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  2 out 5</li>
            <li> (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  1 out 5</li>
            <li> (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  </li>
            <li> (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  4 out 5</li>
            <li> (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  4 out 5</li>
            <li> (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  4 out 5</li>
            <li> (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  4 out 5</li>
            <li> Using a semi-wet brush in a small bowl, it whips up quickly into a silky lather.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and there isn&#x27;t that funky residue left by traditional shaving creams.</li>
            <li> let a LITTLE hot water onto the palm.  </li>
            <li> dog represented a major step up from the last shave gel (the Eshu).  </li>
            <li> After shave cream razor era trying to get a close shave, used a rotary triple head for years and tough with gray becoming dominant.</li>
            <li> Truth is, I hear most people buy this locally for a similar price, but I couldn&#x27;t find it and was tired of looking.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount for it to work; it is thick enough to protect my skin well (meaning my face felt good after a shave instead of raw); and I got a reasonably close shave from it.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount for it to work; it is thick enough to protect my skin well (meaning my face felt good after a shave instead of raw); and I got a reasonably close shave from it.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive/acne prone skin and also get rashes frequently from shaving but no more with this shave cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long been a fan of Kiss My Face products, so it was only natural that I try this shave cream in a convenient pump.  </li>
            <li> At first when I got it I was a little worried about using it, because I have used a lot of products that have just fallen flat on what they claim to do, however, once I used it</li>
            <li> While it didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling cool like the Alphagel, it was the least irritating and my facefelt better after shaving than with any other product.  </li>
            <li> While it didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling cool like the Alphagel, it was the least irritating and my facefelt better after shaving than with any other product.  </li>
            <li> This was both good and bad.  </li>
            <li> This left a large amount of glue on a small package.</li>
            <li> Its a natural product without any unnecessary ingredients which is why I am willing to make the effort.  </li>
            <li> One small dot of this stuff in the palm of my hand does my whole face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not as thick as most of my shaving creams, but all the benefits this shaving cream has is the reason I like to add a little bit in my shaving mug and mix them up with my other ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While this smelled a little better than the Alphagel, I thought this gel produced worse results.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is smaller than expected, I should&#x27;ve realized it was only 3.4 oz.</li>
            <li> I also expected the tube to be bigger.</li>
            <li> If you wet shave (double edge razor shave)</li>
            <li> I spent some time researching which shaving creams and gels to try and settled on the following.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had in a long time.  </li>
            <li> A tiny amount is all that&#x27;s needed to thoroughly lubricate the face and neck for shaving and it does not clog a multi-blade razor the way that other non-aerosol shave creams do.</li>
            <li> My skin was quite dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> shaving gel is described as a dry shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> As others have said it its thin enough to see what your doing and really keeps your face lubricated well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nivea shave gel (sensitive) for years, and while it worked well, you can never tell when that pressurized can is really empty, the entire second half comes out slowly</li>
            <li> After seeing the Shave Butter on Dollar Shave Club, I came to Amazon to see if they had something similar for less than eight bucks.</li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t get around enough, but I&#x27;ve used this as my only shaving lotion for the past 20 years</li>
            <li> Art of Shaving pre-shave oil which has a slight frangrance that&#x27;s actually pleasing...</li>
            <li> This is probably why it lubricated my face so well and left it feeling less irritation.  </li>
            <li> This is probably why it lubricated my face so well and left it feeling less irritation.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, for 1/4 of the price of the \\&quot;high</li>
            <li> This one little bottle has lasted several months.</li>
            <li> bottle did look small but it did last me a long time</li>
            <li> not a real nice thick lather - like I really was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Wet face and hands, lather, shave at the sink, wet hands and refoam what is on face to shave again for closer.</li>
            <li> I do not really like this one.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too</li>
            <li> A little bit goes an insanely long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, it lathers well</li>
            <li> The small tube lasts over a month, and I shave my legs almost daily.</li>
            <li> repeat until foam gets the desired consistency and use as you would any other shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I had a lot of trouble getting it to shave closely, which is why it took so long to shave with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product was designed specifically for men, but it definitely works for women too.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and one tube typically lasts about a month.</li>
            <li> I also use it to make a superlather with some average lathering soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well as a standalone or as a base for another shave soap&#x27;s lather on top.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t look down on this product because of the name.</li>
            <li> Its like watered down school glue.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be buying any other brands now!</li>
            <li> I started adding a little dab of this to my scuttle when I am building my lather with other soaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m grateful to all the previous reviews that convinced me to purchase this</li>
            <li> Has an odd smell to be a non fragrance cream.</li>
            <li> less creamy and moisturizing than the Trader Joe&#x27;s brand.</li>
            <li> I seem to need to shave less often with this cream/lotion than my husbands shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> bang for the buck (I shave twice a week and use about a quarter-size of product per lower half of leg each time.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another rating mentioned KISS MY FACE use with a wet shave electric razor, the past two weeks have been skin side up.</li>
            <li> Trying to find a replacement to Headblade Headslick, which I like a lot, but hate the menthol scent and the bottle it comes in which gets gunked up way too easy.  </li>
            <li> Just takes a little.</li>
            <li> Little strings of the stuff were dripping all over my chest.  </li>
            <li> It was also a little faster shaving with this than the Alphagel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not very sure about the cream I get.</li>
            <li> I used heavy lotion after I shave anyway however.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few minutes of patient working at the foam to get it to the point that it spreads on the face.  </li>
            <li> Dead</li>
            <li> There are a few negatives however.  </li>
            <li> There are a few negatives however.  </li>
            <li> It is slick and just a little lathers up quite a bit.  </li>

            <li> I did notice that by the end of the week my face was feeling raw</li>

            <li> how close a shave he can get using just a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> From my past experience with \\&quot;Kiss</li>
            <li> The most terrible shaving experience I ever had.</li>
            <li> The foaminess isn&#x27;t so excessive that I would discourage people from not using it with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> If you hate the change that the Edge Sensitive product underwent a couple of years ago, where it smells like they started sharing base ingredients with a roach spray, you will LOVE this.</li>
            <li> It does have an odor that I don&#x27;t care for but it wasn&#x27;t anywhere near as bad as the Alphagel.  </li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t smell like a dingy bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell was the least objectionable of any of the six that I tried.  </li>

            <li> For the price there is no reason not to at least give this shave cream a try.</li>

            <li> It may have been the thickest of the gels, but wasn&#x27;t so thick to create a problem.  </li>
            <li> I have ridiculously dry skin on my legs (especially in winter) and this product has helped combat the insane itchiness I would typically get after shaving.</li>
            <li> The razor seemed to slide over the flat portions of my face without cutting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very small</li>
            <li> While the Kiehl&#x27;s one i used, I need to add a lot of water to a very small portion.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a little too expensive for the size.</li>
            <li> This is not a good thing.  </li>
            <li> It is thin which helps you see and feel the hair on your body or face that you are shaving.</li>
            <li> Lubrication was poor during shaving too.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Hard to go wrong with this one at this price.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it does not contain animal ingredients, parabens or artificial colors.</li>
            <li> It smells like those pucks you find in dirty highway gas station urinals.  </li>
            <li> My wife thought my face didn&#x27;t smell bad afterwards, but when I had her smell the gel from the tube, she said, &amp;#34;Oh my god, that is awful!&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and not adding a bunch of smelly and painful additives.</li>
            <li> I was actually disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I use Edge (which I hate for a bunch of reasons)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I found this shaving gel to have the worst smell of any that I tried.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go within 10 feet of mass market shaving products. Since Tom&#x27;s of Maine discontinued their shaving product I&#x27;ve used Kiss My Face which is at least as good if not better.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this for traveling and he likes it. In fact, he likes the brand better than some of the fancier men&#x27;s brands so we&#x27;re sticking with this for home use in a bigger size as well.</li>
            <li> I prefer a shaving lotion, instead of a gel or cream because I think they last longer. I had previously used Aveeno&#x27;s shaving lotion, and loved it, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores recently. This was a great substitute! The small tube lasts over a month, and I shave my legs almost daily.</li>
            <li> After trying several shaving creams this is my favorite.  It is slick and just a little lathers up quite a bit.  It is also a reasonable price.  There are plenty of great shave creams.  But in my opinion this is the best for the money.  The 3.4 oz size is also TSA friendly.</li>
            <li> I actually used this to help shave my beard! My face feels great despite having to run a razor over it a couple of times. I like it better than conventional cream.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite shave products, especially for the price. It provides a close, comfortable shave, and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like the lathering type of shave cream (lather&#x3D;soap&#x3D;dryness). This is much more similar to shaving with a lotion than shaving with a soap. Very, very little irritation after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gripes: Kind of a funny smell (doesn&#x27;t really bother me after the first 10 seconds though), and it dries out a little quick (easy to fix with a few drops of water). Definitely recommend this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update Update Update*** 08.18.2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I recently started shower shaving, and what do ya know? This stuff is EVEN BETTER in the shower (like everything else, right? ;) ). It doesn&#x27;t dry out at all while you shave in the shower, and the steam really seems to increase the moisture levels on your skin. Still smells funny, but it goes away pretty quickly. Seriously, for 1/4 of the price of the \\&quot;high end\\&quot; shave creams, this stuff is FANTASTIC for sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li> Creamy, with just a tiny bit of lather and it leaves my sensitive skin really soft.  Haven&#x27;t had razor burn since I began using it. My only problem is that the price raised from $4 to over $6, making it cheaper to buy it in the store than from the much more convenient Amazon.</li>
            <li> I usually buy higher end shaving creams but this is great for the price and for travelling or when you want to skip lathering with a brush, the best choice for it in my opinion. It&#x27;s very sensitive for your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! A tiny amount is all that&#x27;s needed to thoroughly lubricate the face and neck for shaving and it does not clog a multi-blade razor the way that other non-aerosol shave creams do. It&#x27;s the perfect product for my sensitive skin, as well, and nearly fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product for those who have sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using this KMF product for over a week now, and can happily report no issues with my skin...no rash, no redness, no breakout, etc. I&#x27;m grateful to all the previous reviews that convinced me to purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take too much product to generate a nice lather (that also depends on the brush you use). It whips up easily, goes on smooth, and lubricates the DE razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for use in my travel bag.  While on vacation I thought I needed new blades -  and I still wasn&#x27;t getting a close shave.  The razor seemed to slide over the flat portions of my face without cutting.  I finally realized it was the shaving creme... bought some Jason&#x27;s and my close shave returned.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. He absolutely loves it because it&#x27;s gentle on his sensitive skin, moisturizing and provides a smoother cleaner shave. It also has a rather pleasant scent. The price is also really reasonable too.</li>
            <li> Works well as a standalone or as a base for another shave soap&#x27;s lather on top. Leave my skin moist, but not greasy. This will be a fixture of my shaves for some time to come; whether with a DE razor, or in a pinch with a cartridge like my Mach 3.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shave cream.  I have sensitive skin and this is one of the only creams I have found that don&#x27;t cause me to itch or get red bumps.  I also like that there is no scent.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried kiss my face shaving cream buy this now!  I actually prefer the grapefruit or pomegranate scent but this size is perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> Got this to try for shaving, seems like i always get a rash or razor burn.  Works really well, nice close smooth shave and no rash/burn.</li>
            <li> my husband loves it.  Baby smooth face now.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work that Well for me.  Preferred Dr bonners formulas</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It does what it said it would, and I like that. Before I used Kiss My Face, my skin felt kind of rough after I shaved, however, afterwards the skin really did feel softer, and unlike other shaving cremes I&#x27;ve used this product didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky and dry. At first when I got it I was a little worried about using it, because I have used a lot of products that have just fallen flat on what they claim to do, however, once I used it I was very glad I did.</li>
            <li> Has an odd smell to be a non fragrance cream. But it works great!</li>
            <li> great product /  use a tiny amount and add some water and massage in.&lt;br /&gt;your razor glides over your skin and your face is enriched at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sold on this product.  A keeper</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff at a friend&#x27;s house. it is like using conditioner (if you have ever run out of lather on a road trip) only better. I am going to order the bigger bottle next time and probably give some smaller ones as gifts.</li>
            <li> I use this product to shave my legs.  It works well and seems to have a moisturizing after effect.  I used heavy lotion after I shave anyway however.  It is good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product and the company does not test on animals.</li>
            <li> I use this with my panasonic wet/dry in the shower - it works great.  As others have said it its thin enough to see what your doing and really keeps your face lubricated well.  It doesn&#x27;t clog up my blades and easily washes out from razor.  I have tried the store aerosols with my electric and there is no comparison. This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> this inexpensive shave cream provides a close shave and moisturizes the skin. The small quantity makes it a good travel item. KMF also makes larger sizes i think.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay...less creamy and moisturizing than the Trader Joe&#x27;s brand. More soapy and foamy than I like a shave cream. I was actually disappointed. I would have returned it if I&#x27;d bought it at a store. My skin was quite dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love that this is made of natural ingredients. I love the smell. I love an alternative to the ingredients you find in the big name shaving creams. But the truth is, I just find that this stuff doesn&#x27;t do a very good job. I have to use a LOT of this to get even the slightest bit of coverage on my face, and then as I am shaving, it just rinses away and I have to re-apply. I have tried using my hands and a shaving brush to apply it - the shaving brush worked a little better, but ultimately I still had the same problem. When I use Edge (which I hate for a bunch of reasons) I just don&#x27;t have the same problems. SO, I am going to continue my search for a natural product that will actually get the job done.</li>
            <li> My husband likes the way it makes his face feel when he&#x27;s shaving and I like that Kiss My Face doesn&#x27;t test on animals, so all in all, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and have tried all the top high dollar shave creams with multiple razors.  At the end of the day... You can&#x27;t get a better shave for the money&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It worked for shaving</li>
            <li> It works OK. I think it dulled my razor faster than regular shave gel. I also expected the tube to be bigger. That was my own fault for not looking at the oz before I bought but I am only mentioning it so you can pay attention to the price per oz while shopping. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to shave for years now.  I would never go back to shaving foam.  This product is very good for the skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive/acne prone skin and also get rashes frequently from shaving but no more with this shave cream. I was concerned because it didn&#x27;t say non-comedegonic but after calling the manufacturer they reassured it is and it would not clog pores or cause breakouts. I&#x27;ve been using this for almost two months with no issues and its best cream I&#x27;ve ever used for face shaving.</li>
            <li> I like it for shaving my legs and I have also used it to wash my face.  I just mixed a bit of water in my hand and applied it to my face and washed it off with a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Have tried many types of shave non-aerosol shave creams. This one as good as most, although I think you can get by with a very small amount.</li>
            <li> Works good for making a lather for shaving</li>
            <li> I seem to need to shave less often with this cream/lotion than my husbands shaving cream.  Love it!</li>
            <li> one of the best shave creams I ever try. My skin felt smooth and hydrate after the shave. Also I didn&#x27;t experience any rash or redness which is great.</li>
            <li> This fragrance free shaving cream from Kiss My Face does a great job of preparing the skin for shaving.  KISS MY FACE ARE GREAT PRODUCTS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products but this one finally does what I&#x27;ve been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;-Good bang for the buck (I shave twice a week and use about a quarter-size of product per lower half of leg each time.)&lt;br /&gt;-Pleasant smell (nothing like Nair! shew!)&lt;br /&gt;-Good for sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;-Reduced or eliminated irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to you, I hope you get the same results!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly! You do not need much to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and excellent!</li>
            <li> I keep this soap in my travel Dopp kit. Using a semi-wet brush in a small bowl, it whips up quickly into a silky lather.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who has sensitive skin. He absolutely loves it! Says it works great and leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent shave cream, with less toxic chemicals that we have been using for years in a travel size.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this stuff! I&#x27;ve used Nivea shave gel (sensitive) for years, and while it worked well, you can never tell when that pressurized can is really empty, the entire second half comes out slowly, the last 10% really s-l-o-w-l-y, and you can&#x27;t take it through an airport. After seeing the Shave Butter on Dollar Shave Club, I came to Amazon to see if they had something similar for less than eight bucks. I found this. It&#x27;s great! My shave is just as easy as always, much easier than with some thin shave creams. I know exactly how much is in the tube, I have full control over dispensing the stuff, and at 3.4 oz, it&#x27;s perfect for TSA checkpoints. About the only thing I didn&#x27;t dig was the scent. It&#x27;s officially Fragrance Free, but they don&#x27;t mask it, either. So it smells like spreading spackle under your nose. But you get it over it. Recommended. Hopefully, when this one runs out, one of the scented versions of this stuff will be available via Subscribe &amp; Save too.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described - thanks for the simple buying experience.</li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t get around enough, but I&#x27;ve used this as my only shaving lotion for the past 20 years and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used nearly every common shaving cream on the market and this is by far the best one I have ever tried. I have hyper-sensitive skin and this cream never makes my skin react and always leaves it super soft.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t look down on this product because of the name. It&#x27;s a great performer with a brush and makes very good, cushiony lather. There are several different smells and all do a great job. If you wet shave (double edge razor shave) I highly recommend this shaving cream!</li>
            <li> No harmful additives, like SLS or parabens, lathers up nicely...gives you a perfect shave! Won&#x27;t be buying any other brands now!</li>
            <li> My husband won&#x27;t use anything else.  All kinds sitting around unused, and I have to order this for him....</li>
            <li> Trying to find a replacement to Headblade Headslick, which I like a lot, but hate the menthol scent and the bottle it comes in which gets gunked up way too easy.  This stuff I love it&#x27;s scent, and I liked that it is made of natural ingredients.  But in the end, this stuff just doesn&#x27;t do a great job.  I tend to use a LOT to get decent coverage on my face, and then as I am shaving, it just rinses away and I have to re-apply. Other products, such as Headslick or Edge make for a much easier and comfortable shave.  Just wish that something that smelled better and wasn&#x27;t a foam would give a better shave.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best shaving cream I have ever tried. Both myself and the misses use it. She likes it every bit as well as I do. It is thin which helps you see and feel the hair on your body or face that you are shaving. It is very slippery and it protects better from razor burn than any other shaving product we have tried. Also, a little goes a long way. One small dot of this stuff in the palm of my hand does my whole face. We have not even needed to buy more yet. This gets my highest recommendations.</li>
            <li> I bought this moisture shave for my husband to take with him while he travels.  It packs really well and the cap is quit secure so there is no leakage or spilling.  He has been very pleased with the lather and how close a shave he can get using just a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just want to let you know that I tried it myself for my legs and I was really amazed how nice and silky my legs felt!  My skin was left feeling moisturized and very very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again but this time in a bigger tube so we can share.  Great product for anyone who is looking for an exceptional product&lt;br /&gt;at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work very well.. I was used to Dollar Shave club lotion, and moving to this was a definite downgrade.  Threw it away and went back to DSC.  It actually was too clean, like it was left too much friction on the face, as opposed to a smooth, well-lubricated lotion/gel.  If I wanted a face scrubber or cleaner, maybe this would be good, but not as a shaving lotion.</li>
            <li> We have to have fragrance free and this fits the bill.  Husband likes it and it&#x27;s great for travel.</li>
            <li> I am highly sensitive to scents and even mild soap cause irritation while shaving. This Gel has worked well for me and shave is smooth as well.</li>
            <li> This shave cream comes in a decidedly unmanly looking tube with pastel color scheme (a larger pump bottle is also available), but don&#x27;t let that deter you! This cream rocks! It is cushiony smooth goodness that won&#x27;t make your razor drag or tug, and leaves your skin smooth and soft. I will not use a foamy canned goo again! Rub it on your face while wet, or better yet, use a good shaving brush - your face will love you for it!</li>
            <li> I have used this (in this packaging and in the larger &amp;#34;Pump&amp;#34; container) for years now, mostly with a Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver and double blade razors.  Unlike many others, it actually protects the skin from blade razor cuts and is washed clean from an electic shaver as well.</li>
            <li> Not saying this is the best cream ever, but it is quite good and the price is right.  Truth is, I hear most people buy this locally for a similar price, but I couldn&#x27;t find it and was tired of looking.  I tend to use unscented products and this is a true unscented cream.  Makes a terrific lather in a bowl or on the face. I also use it to make a superlather with some average lathering soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great with my Frank Shaving Finest Badger Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to go wrong with this one at this price.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for many years.</li>
            <li> Great shave, no smell.</li>
            <li> Was using one of the high priced shaving products in a tube and started reading reviews on other shaving gels/cremes and this got consistently good reviews from people so I tried it and I agree - it is a really good product for about 1/5 the price of the others.  My wife tried it for shaving her legs and loves it as well so we are now on our 3rd re-order of the product.</li>
            <li> From my past experience with \\&quot;Kiss My Face\\&quot; company I know they&lt;br /&gt;make quality products. Shave is very smooth, Does not burn afterwards&lt;br /&gt;but I think it&#x27;s a little too expensive for the size. It&#x27;s a very small tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** UPDATE 5/3/2014 **&lt;br /&gt;The bottle did look small but it did last me a long time so I am giving it&lt;br /&gt;5 stars.</li>
            <li> I started adding a little dab of this to my scuttle when I am building my lather with other soaps. I have found that it really makes a difference in building the lather, it makes the lather thicker and creamier. I think it also makes for smoother, irritation free shave. Being unscented makes it all the better. I have not tried it by itself but it would probably work great also.</li>
            <li> my husband has sensitive skin and this is the only shave cream he uses. I love it as well! A little goes a long way too</li>
            <li> The Kiss My Face Moisture Shave Fragrance Free is a fantastic natural product. It contains antiseptic peppermint that cools and stimulates your skin and soapwort that forms a rich lather. The vitamins, oils and aloe vera are soothing and moisturizing and allow for the best shave possible. I like the fact that it does not contain animal ingredients, parabens or artificial colors. Overall this is an outstanding product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> KMF&#x27;s shaving cream is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;foam up\\&quot; when you apply it, but that is because it&#x27;s a natural product, without the chemicals in the traditional brands.  The foaming thing is a gimmick anyways, you don&#x27;t really need it.  I prefer the cool mint flavor but the other ones work just as well.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes an insanely long way. Just a smidgen is all you really need. I have deducted one star because it says it is &#x27;fragrance free&#x27; but that just does not seem to be the case for me. Great for electric shaving, especially if you slap some water on your face after applying this.</li>
            <li> This product is just ok for emergency shaving when i run out of the good stuff i guess. Doesn&#x27;t even come close to comparing to the Nivea Shaving Cream i purchased after. Nivea is the good stuff and this stuff is just ok.</li>
            <li> This stuff is simply wonderful!  I used it to shave my legs and it worked wonders.  It creates a silky lather that the razor just glides over and then rinses away easily.  Some products with a similar consistency feel &#x27;slimy&#x27; and you really have to scrub to get it off your skin.  But not with this one.  After the shave my skin felt so soft and smooth, a result I&#x27;ve never been able to get with traditional shaving creams and gels.  The best thing about this product is the fact that I actually knew what the ingredients were.  The ingredients include things like coconut oil, aloe vera, arnica, and vitamin E oil--all great things for my sensitive skin.  I also love that it is fragrance and preservative free; these are things that have always given me skin irritations.  It truly is an all around great product and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kiss My Face is my new go-to for my shaving needs!  I bought this smaller tube of it to try it out first and I definitely plan on getting the larger bottle next!</li>
            <li> So much better than your standard aerosol shaving cream! Leaves my skin soft and there isn&#x27;t that funky residue left by traditional shaving creams.</li>
            <li> love that it is a more natural shaving cream as many creams are FULL of chemicals. will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> Best shave. Just takes a little.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  I haven&#x27;t nicked myself once.  It is fragrance free but does have a slight &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; odor.  I bought a scented one next and like it a little better.</li>
            <li> The most terrible shaving experience I ever had. Its like watered down school glue. I wouldn&#x27;t shave my dog&#x27;s rear end with this stuff. It went straight in the garbage can.</li>
            <li> I have ridiculously dry skin on my legs (especially in winter) and this product has helped combat the insane itchiness I would typically get after shaving. A little goes a long way and one tube typically lasts about a month.</li>
            <li> Love this! I open it &amp; add some doTERRA essential oils to scent it exactly how I want it which makes me like it even more.</li>
            <li> Closest, smoothest shave EVER.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these to put in my travel kit. I have used the product before and it is fine. However, the product arrived with large stickers that had been removed (I am thinking this package has been re-purposed). This left a large amount of glue on a small package. I dont want glue all over my fingers while shaving so I won&#x27;t be using these. I should have just gone to a regular store and purchased it. I recommend the product, however do not buy from Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. It works very well without a lot of the gross chemicals leaving you with a very smooth shave. My husband uses it as well without complaints. It is reasonably priced and lasts quite a while. This one little bottle has lasted several months. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> After shave cream razor era trying to get a close shave, used a rotary triple head for years and tough with gray becoming dominant. Another rating mentioned KISS MY FACE use with a wet shave electric razor, the past two weeks have been skin side up. Wet face and hands, lather, shave at the sink, wet hands and refoam what is on face to shave again for closer. Easy to clean all after a wet shave for face and unit. Product very refreshing without any discomfort. Having not used other products, probably won&#x27;t, this could easily be 5-star.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream I&#x27;ve used to far. Relieves irritation and tastes/smells nice.</li>
            <li> This is a good cream for sensitive skin. It won&#x27;t sting or burn,&lt;br /&gt;And it lathers nicely. The razor goes down smooth, and when you&lt;br /&gt;finish you feel fresh, instead of your face feels like it was put in washer&lt;br /&gt;on rinse cycle. Looking for a good shave, Kiss My Face is one.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaving cream for my husband to use and I have to say it works great. His face is so smooth and soft. You can even use it to shave your legs. Thats a plus in my book. Yes, I did try to use it on my legs. My husband says he really does enjoy the cooling sensation from the peppermint in it. I liked that feeling on my legs also. I wish the tube were a little bigger because it does go quick between him and I using it together. So now I know to purchase the double pack next time. It&#x27;s really good for traveling too. I love this moisture shave cream. You have a loyal customer now. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The bottle is smaller than expected, I should&#x27;ve realized it was only 3.4 oz. This shaving gel gives me a nice, natural lather and I would get it again.</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome glad I discovered it, use it with brush and it lathers greatly try it and you&#x27;ll be hooked!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of shave creams, but this is my favorite! A little goes a long way, it lathers well and it makes a nice thin coat for a close shave. Great price too. I used to buy the Boxy Shop brand, but I like this one even more.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using a badger brush to whip this up and it is wonderful. Very smooth and protects the skin well.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fragrance free because I sometimes will pair this with a scented hard shaving soap. Makes tremendous lather!</li>
            <li> Love that I can get this in a travel-ish size!</li>
            <li> i can use it before i use electric shaver or afterwards, makes the skin feel good and relieves any irritation right away.</li>
            <li> Fairly good choice.  It gave me a smooth, clean, easy shave.  My face felt great afterward.  However, it is a strange stringy, gluey substance.  Little strings of the stuff were dripping all over my chest.  Blade clogging was moderate to major; it took some effort to clean it out.  This likely won&#x27;t be my final choice for day-to-day shave support.</li>
            <li> Great shaving cream. You must follow the directions on the label. You don&#x27;t need to use as much as traditional, canned shaving cream. Doesn&#x27;t irritate at all and is truly fragrance free.</li>
            <li> this is very, very good, surprised how good it lathered up, I used with my merkur 38c  and gillete blue razor blade, a match made in heaven, now I enjoy shaving again, just great, buy it.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it&#x27;s a safe alternative to traditional shave cream and the packaging doesn&#x27;t leave rust on my shower shelves. Hubby doesn&#x27;t care for it as well as regular shave cream but he tolerates it. I guess since he&#x27;s the user I have to give it 3 stars. I will probably purchase it again until I find something better that we both are happy with.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream/gel I have ever used.  I have very sensitive skin and this product works great!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what I do:  squirt an amount to just fill the bottom of the palm.  Start hot water at bathroom sink faucet.  rub hands together until the shave lotion covers both hands.  let a LITTLE hot water onto the palm.  rub vigorously until foaming starts.  add a LITTLE more hot water.  repeat until foam gets the desired consistency and use as you would any other shaving cream.  It takes a few minutes of patient working at the foam to get it to the point that it spreads on the face.  Its a natural product without any unnecessary ingredients which is why I am willing to make the effort.  It is at least as good as any other foaming shaving cream but with the added benefit of being free of harsh chemicals etc...</li>
            <li> Best shave cream I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> One of the benefits of wet shaving is that you can use all natural products. I&#x27;ve long been a fan of Kiss My Face products, so it was only natural that I try this shave cream in a convenient pump.  After trying different methods of getting a good lather, I concluded that just squirting a dab on my damp-soaked and shakened badger brush gave me the best results. Now, this is supposed to be fragrance-free...but, upon closer sniffing, I smell milk paint!  Yuk! Also, I was getting a nice soapy foam, but not a real nice thick lather - like I really was hoping for. Well, the solution for both issues became clear. I have this nice &amp;#34;fragrance-free&amp;#34; Art of Shaving pre-shave oil which has a slight frangrance that&#x27;s actually pleasing...so, I put a couple drops on top of my dab of KMF cream and wow! This suddenly became the most awesome shave soap ever! This one dab allowed enough for three passes and some! I would think that you could use just about any pre-shave oil that you like...even olive oil! Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I am not very sure about the cream I get. I have only used 2 kinds of shaving cream (i used to use shaving foam from Gillette), this one and another from Kiehls. This one is quite watery compare to the one I got from Kihel&#x27;s. I have to use a lot each time to cover all my beard. While the Kiehl&#x27;s one i used, I need to add a lot of water to a very small portion. I do not really like this one. I hope the one I got has some problem. I have only opened one of the cream I bought, will watch out for the second.</li>
            <li> I can travel with this shaving cream in my carryon. Lathers perfectly with a shaving brush. Great shave. Great price.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps keep in the moisture in your legs and wherever else, and I love that it&#x27;s not foamy. You can actually see what you&#x27;re doing. It rinses off easily which is good and bad. Make sure you stay away from the water until you are done because it will come right off if you splash accidentally. It has really helped my dry skin on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> Very sensitive to your skin. Leaves your Skin feeling soft with no irritation. I highly recommend this product for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> For Christmas I received a Braun Series 7 799CC-AWD shaver.  This electric shaver is designed for use in the shower.  After doing quite a bit of online reading, I found that many people are using shaving cream with these electric shavers.  Please note that using shaving cream with an electric shaver is different than using shaving cream with a blade.  You don&#x27;t want as much foam with an electric shaver.  Some are even oils instead of creams.  I spent some time researching which shaving creams and gels to try and settled on the following.  I tried them all out for several months.  Here are my findings based on shaving with my electric shaver with my skin.  You may have different results if you use a different shaver or if your skin is more or less sensitive.  Many of these findings are subjective (like smell).  I have ranked them starting with the worst, Bold for Men and finished with the best, Kiss My Face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold for Men:  http://www.amazon.com/Bold-For-Men-Dry-Shave/dp/B000OZZH18/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1390669335&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;bold+for+men+shave+gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  4 min. 58 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  1 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  1 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  5 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  2 out 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  1 out of 5  (very raw, 3 nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  Dead last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaving gel is described as a dry shaving gel.  I used it in the shower on my damp face without any water.  I don&#x27;t think this impeded its usage at all.  I selected it to test because of the favorable reviews for using it, including reviewers who used it in the shower.  While this smelled a little better than the Alphagel, I thought this gel produced worse results.  My skin was more irritated by the end of a week of usage; I had three nicks on the last day (only 1 for the Alphagel); and it left my face feeling really raw after shaving.  After I was done shaving and I washed the gel off of my face, I found it made my face feel really hot.  This is not a good thing.  The Alphagel left it feeling more smooth and cool.  I did like how this gel didn&#x27;t foam at all.  You could easily see your skin and hair stubble.  It was also a little faster shaving with this than the Alphagel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington Alphagel Sensitive Skin:  http://www.amazon.com/Remington-Shaves-Alphagel-Sensitive-Shave/dp/B005ACNPLO/ref&#x3D;sr_1_15?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1390068105&amp;sr&#x3D;8-15&amp;keywords&#x3D;alpha+gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  6 min. 16 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  4 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  1 out 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  3 out of 5  (felt raw but pretty smooth and 1 nick)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  5th overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I found this shaving gel to have the worst smell of any that I tried.  It smells like those pucks you find in dirty highway gas station urinals.  My wife thought my face didn&#x27;t smell bad afterwards, but when I had her smell the gel from the tube, she said, &amp;#34;Oh my god, that is awful!&amp;#34;.  The best thing about this gel is that it doesn&#x27;t foam much at all.  After shaving with it for a week my skin became irritated and started to bleed in a couple of places.  Lubrication was poor during shaving too.  It just wasn&#x27;t think enough to lubricate very well.  I had a lot of trouble getting it to shave closely, which is why it took so long to shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eshu Shave Gel:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SOMEG2/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  5 min. 21 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  3 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  3 out5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  2 out of 5  (raw, 2 nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  4th Overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a noticeable improvement between the last shaving gel and this one.  Eshu lubricated my face better and felt like it was more soothing after shaving.  It does have an odor that I don&#x27;t care for but it wasn&#x27;t anywhere near as bad as the Alphagel.  It comes out as an oil but does foam up as you shave with it.  The foaminess isn&#x27;t so excessive that I would discourage people from not using it with an electric razor.  Overall, not a bad shave, but I did notice that by the end of the week my face was feeling raw and I definitely needed a day or two for it to recover before shaving again.  One of the few things I liked about the Alphagel was that it left my face feeling cool instead of raw like the Eshu.  Again the Eshu was faster to shave with than the Bold for Men or the Alphagel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bull Dog Original Shave Gel:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IX45FQ/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  7 min. 22 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  4 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  4 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  2 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  3 out 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  3rd Overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bull dog represented a major step up from the last shave gel (the Eshu).  It was much thicker than any of the lower rated gels I tested.  This was both good and bad.  It provided better lubrication, but was also foamier.  This meant it took longer to shave and longer to clean my razor afterwards.  Bull Dog had about as much foam as I would be willing to put up with and still use with an electric razor.  My face felt only mildly irritated after each shave (barely noticeable) and my skin was in much better condition by the end of the week.  No nicks all week.  The odor was better than the lower rated gels but still wasn&#x27;t something desirable.  Tolerable would be a better description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea for Men, Sensitive Shaving Gel: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BIL9HZE/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  6 min. 48 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  4 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  4 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  4 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  1 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  4 out 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  2rd Overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea for men was the second best gel I tried.  It has many positives.  You only need a small amount for it to work; it is thick enough to protect my skin well (meaning my face felt good after a shave instead of raw); and I got a reasonably close shave from it.  There are a few negatives however.  It had was the foamiest of any of the gels I tried.  It took a little more time to clean my razor afterwards.  It has a pleasant, perfumey scent, but it is rather strong.  I would have preferred that it didn&#x27;t have a scent at all or if it had to have one, that it was more mild.  At least it didn&#x27;t smell like a dingy bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kiss My Face Moisture Shave, Fragrance Free:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DU1Q4W/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  4 min. 12 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  5 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  5 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  5 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  5 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  4 out 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  1st Overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my favorite of the shaving gels I tried.  While it didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling cool like the Alphagel, it was the least irritating and my facefelt better after shaving than with any other product.  It comes out of the tube as a cream consistency.  It may have been the thickest of the gels, but wasn&#x27;t so thick to create a problem.  This is probably why it lubricated my face so well and left it feeling less irritation.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to shave with it.  It is probably one of the most cost effective due to this.  The smell was the least objectionable of any of the six that I tried.  While described as fragrance free, there was a very slight plastic smell that I could only smell if I stuck it right up to my nose and sniffed heavily.  While shaving I didn&#x27;t notice an odor.  This gel also was the fastest to shave with and also gave me the closest shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I had tried all of these for several months I also tried the Kiss My Face Moisture Shave Cool Mint.  It has a mint scent to it.  I didn&#x27;t notice any cooling effect and after shaving and getting dressed, my wife didn&#x27;t notice any mint smell at all.ll week.  The odor was better than the lower rated gels but still wasn&#x27;t something desirable.

            <li> Just the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever seen. I believe glycerin is the key. Oh, and not adding a bunch of smelly and painful additives. If you hate the change that the Edge Sensitive product underwent a couple of years ago, where it smells like they started sharing base ingredients with a roach spray, you will LOVE this. No odor. No residue, no sting, TSA friendly sizing, inexpensive...I&#x27;m afraid this is too good to be true - something will happen to kill this product or change the formula now that I have found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive skin or not, who honestly thinks adding fragrance to shaving cream is a great idea? Let the cologne or perfume take care of that - this is a great product for EVERYONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this. It&#x27;s just the best. Period.</li>
            <li> This shave cream is the equal of shave creams 3x its price tag. It works great with a shave brush and is very moisturizing. For the price there is no reason not to at least give this shave cream a try.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  My skin is pretty sensitive so I like using a really good shaving cream to prevent cutting and irritation and this does the trick. Leaves my skin feeling smooth and moist and no fragrance/parabens, nice!</li>
            <li> Have been using this creme for shaving my legs for over a year. Love the texture (it gives nice, creamy lather with excellent slickness) and the all natural ingredients it is made of - no harsh chemicals or parabens. It leaves my skin feeling soft with no irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product was designed specifically for men, but it definitely works for women too. I haven&#x27;t been able to find any shaving cream that didn&#x27;t dry out and irritate the skin on my legs until now. This is definitely the silkiest shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s THE BEST, especially because there is not any fragrance.</li>
            <li> Best shave cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great product!  This gave me one of the best shaves I&#x27;ve had in a long time.  I have sensitive skin, and shaving with this gave me a  close shave and left my skin feeling comfortable afterwards. It lathered nicely and didn&#x27;t give me any irritation afterwards.  Definitely a product I will continue using.  I would highly recommend it, especially if you have sensitive skin or can&#x27;t stand the smell of most shaving products.</li>
            <li> It was better than shaving without any type of shave cream or gel, but not by much. There are better products out there.</li>
            <li> This is a fragrance free shave cream that I like to add to my other shaving creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not as thick as most of my shaving creams, but all the benefits this shaving cream has is the reason I like to add a little bit in my shaving mug and mix them up with my other ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing for the price, I can tell the difference in my face if I don&#x27;t add it to my other shaving creams.  This stuff really moisturizes your face.</li>
            <li> Honestly feels better than the Proraso shaving cream I used to use, and seems to last longer too (as in you need less on the brush)</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t switched to anything since I got this. I didn&#x27;t realize how much better I would like lotion-like shaving creams over the foam kind. This is great, cheap, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
