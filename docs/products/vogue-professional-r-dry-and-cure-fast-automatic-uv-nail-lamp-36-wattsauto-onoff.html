            <li>I love this gel light!!!</li>
            <li>Love this machine!</li>
            <li>I love this machine!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a good light to begin with then stopped working after 1 month.</li>
            <li>The first hand of shellac went great.</li>
            <li>Followed my Orly FX top coat - cure 180 seconds.  </li>
            <li>I swapped the bulbs around to make sure it was the bulb and not the socket</li>
            <li>I love this lamp.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the $150.00 one I bought through the beauty supply.</li>
            <li>love this</li>
            <li>and I have mine that I love.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing another one to better service my Clients.</li>
            <li>Love this machine but do not forget gloves to protect you while using.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works like a charm just like going to the salon but in the comfort if home.</li>
            <li>Just got my lamp for a Christmas gift and so good so far ...will give more once</li>
            <li>The light worked fine</li>
            <li>As  I tried putting my fingers inside the unit, it started making noise and flashing its light- just like a microwave when you don&#x27;t have anything in it</li>
            <li>I WAS TOLD THAT A UV LIGHT IS SLOWER AT DRYING YOUR POLISH THAN A LED LIGHT</li>
            <li>I polish my nails and see how quick it dries</li>
            <li>This light is to large to put on my table.</li>
            <li>If the fan is on and you turn on the light the whole unit shuts off.</li>
            <li>I would not buy it if I had a chance to see it first.  </li>
            <li>hands (where most signs of aging show up quickly anyway) and the little trays use less acetone then a bowl and are more comfortable to soak in.</li>
            <li>, it works pretty well, sometimes you have to run a second time for gel to be completly dry, but overall very good.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use with digital controls !</li>
            <li>Having done my own nails for over a year now it perplexed me as to why this suddenly happened; until I realized that I had never replaced my little 9w LED lamp.  </li>
            <li>Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting both!  </li>
            <li>I really like that it starts by itself when you place your hand in it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>And for those that are like me, don&#x27;t hesitate this is the real deal..</li>
            <li>I really recommend this item</li>
            <li>very please I am buying another one</li>
            <li>You can put your whole hand inside instead of 4 fingers in one time.</li>
            <li>Is it too much to expect something to work when you buy it?</li>
            <li>She said she likes this one better because she can choose the time where as my other one has pre set times.</li>
            <li>It dries the Polish just fine,  but the light bulbs are so loose I have to be careful they don&#x27;t fall out.  </li>
            <li>just got it brand new out of the box timer doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Buy the product you will be so amaze the work it does, Try the gel and also dry the nail polish as quick  as 1 23</li>
            <li>This works well to dry nails quickly, and it has a timer</li>
            <li>She used it a few times and everything seemed fine and she loves it.</li>
            <li>so you can see haw much time you have left</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional nail technician.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>We swapped it out with a replacement bulb which looked exactly the same, had the same writing on it and was bought at a salon product store</li>
            <li>The polish that I did last night with this new lamp looks a lot better and feels harder than with my little LED lamp.  </li>

            <li> It dries the nail polish but leaves it soft which is useless.</li>
            <li> IT DRIED</li>

            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2432K7Y7N9872]]UPDATE: Was great for one use and then broke.  See video.  The lamp was plugged into a wall outlet and kept on a flat surface, there is no reason for it to be acting up.  Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: it is lightweight, unlike another reviewer stated, it works well for curing all kinds of gel polish (I use gelish, orly fx, red carpet manicure, etc), you can put your entire hand in, thumb included, and the lights are replicable when they start to wear out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The instructions are crap.  I cannot figure out how to use the pre-set times on this thing.  One button appears used.  There is a slight crack in the cover over the button and it pushes down differently then the others.  No curing times are listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was having issues with lifting and peeling of my gel nail polish.  Having done my own nails for over a year now it perplexed me as to why this suddenly happened; until I realized that I had never replaced my little 9w LED lamp.  The polish that I did last night with this new lamp looks a lot better and feels harder than with my little LED lamp.  Time will tell if it begins lifting or peeling. I use a Gelish base coat - cure 60 seconds.  With Orly FX, gelish, or red carpet manicure colors - cure 180 seconds.  Followed my Orly FX top coat - cure 180 seconds.  Amazon suggested that I buy these with UV blocking gloves made for nails as well as these neat little acetone trays for individual fingers.  I highly recommend getting both!  UV ages hands (where most signs of aging show up quickly anyway) and the little trays use less acetone then a bowl and are more comfortable to soak in.</li>
            <li> Plugged it in and it caught on fire. I guess if u want crispy fingers it would be a great product</li>
            <li> Love this machine! Easy to use with digital controls !</li>
            <li> Use the device 4 times. It just simply  stopped  working. I e-mailed the company,  I received twice, no response. So  I sent  the  device back  for warranty  repair per  instructions in  February 2014- the box  was returned un-open in June.</li>
            <li> This machine had a flaw. The first hand of shellac went great. For the 2nd hand I ran into problems. As  I tried putting my fingers inside the unit, it started making noise and flashing its light- just like a microwave when you don&#x27;t have anything in it or when you put the wrong item in it.</li>
            <li> Bought this a couple months ago for the girlfriend to do her nails. She used it a few times and everything seemed fine and she loves it. After only a month one of the bulbs went out. I swapped the bulbs around to make sure it was the bulb and not the socket and it was the bulb. We swapped it out with a replacement bulb which looked exactly the same, had the same writing on it and was bought at a salon product store and they didn&#x27;t work, the machine just startsed making a clicking and buzzing noise. I&#x27;m thinking maybe we have a defective machine. I&#x27;d buy this again but not if it&#x27;s going to mess up after a month.</li>
            <li> Bought this over a year ago still working great!</li>
            <li> Sets Shellac nails perfectly. Would be 5 stars if instructions were clearer and the unit a little smaller. Has three modes--fan, heat, both. Press the &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; button to get the one you want. Up and down arrows set time. I really like that it starts by itself when you place your hand in it. For the price, a great purchase. No instructions on how long the lamps will last.</li>
            <li> I like the Pro Dry, it works pretty well, sometimes you have to run a second time for gel to be completly dry, but overall very good.  Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Can you use both hands</li>
            <li> I love this lamp.  Works well, I can do my nails at home!  I also bought one for my daughter.  Great product.</li>
            <li> this unit does not work. It dries the nail polish but leaves it soft which is useless. Try something else this doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Hello guys-&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27; m very satisfied with the product. I always check the reviews before deciding to purchase. And for those that are like me, don&#x27;t hesitate this is the real deal.. 😉..&lt;br /&gt;Excellent..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picky buyer</li>
            <li> I love this gel light!!! It&#x27;s great in my salon.  I only do nails in my salon.  It&#x27;s great. Much better than the $150.00 one I bought through the beauty supply.</li>
            <li> love this I use it a lot  the drying time is great . I really recommend this item</li>
            <li> Do not spend over $300. Buy the product you will be so amaze the work it does, Try the gel and also dry the nail polish as quick  as 1 23&lt;br /&gt;Very very please I am buying another one so great it is</li>
            <li> It dries the Polish just fine,  but the light bulbs are so loose I have to be careful they don&#x27;t fall out.  I would not buy it if I had a chance to see it first.  I marked one star only because I could not mark half a star.   The auto start does not work.</li>
            <li> The light worked fine but it was too big for my nail table so I had to return it. But it was shipped to me in good time and was in perfect condition. The only complaint I would have had was no instruction book.</li>
            <li> It works and is big and heavy.  You can put your whole hand inside instead of 4 fingers in one time.</li>
            <li> I love this machine! great product for the price and it cures ALL gel types. even has a sensor so you dont have to keep pushing the start button.</li>
            <li> Worked great for about 3 uses, then broke.</li>
            <li> This works well to dry nails quickly, and it has a timer so you can see haw much time you have left</li>
            <li> I WAS TOLD THAT A UV LIGHT IS SLOWER AT DRYING YOUR POLISH THAN A LED LIGHT BUT THIS PRODUCT PROVED THAT TO BE FALSE..IT DRIED MY GEL POLISH IS A MATTER OF MINUTES!! MUST BUY!!!</li>
            <li> Just got my lamp for a Christmas gift and so good so far ...will give more once I polish my nails and see how quick it dries</li>
            <li> One of the bulbs was broken upon arrival.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter in law because she&#x27;s always borrowing my other nail dryer. She said she likes this one better because she can choose the time where as my other one has pre set times. So now we&#x27;re all happy she has her own that she loves and I have mine that I love.</li>
            <li> I love it... Easy to use and works like a charm just like going to the salon but in the comfort if home.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, arrived as it was offered and works perfectly. We are very pleased with the product. It is wonderfull</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a good light to begin with then stopped working after 1 month. I emailed them about returning it and never heard back!</li>
            <li> Piece of crap don&#x27;t waste your money...just got it brand new out of the box timer doesn&#x27;t work. If the fan is on and you turn on the light the whole unit shuts off. No wonder sales are final.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product, I recommend it to all</li>
            <li> Unit was a gift for my life ,she never opened it until she received nail products to use with this dryer.It did not work but it was over thirty days so a return was out of the question.Lesson learned. Is it too much to expect something to work when you buy it?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional nail technician. This light is to large to put on my table. The fan doesn&#x27;t blow hard enough to be felt. The controls are on the client side. Would not recommend .</li>
            <li> Its does all it said it would.  Cures both my Shellac in 30 seconds and my hard gel in 2 minutes.  This is just what I needed!</li>
            <li> This lamp is awesome! There is no need to reset the timer every time you use it like other UV Lamps. The Timer remains set until you change it and it&#x27;s not heavy at all. Another great feature is the hand plate to keep your hand in place while drying. So happy I made this purchase. I will be purchasing another one to better service my Clients. Totally recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this machine but do not forget gloves to protect you while using. It does need an improved set of directions</li>
