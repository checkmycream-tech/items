            <li> i put in garbage. don&amp;#34;t waste money</li>
            <li> Just got it, BROKEN. It&#x27;s very fragile. Doesn&#x27;t fit right on the face. Won&#x27;t be able to use. Don&#x27;t buy it. Cheap!</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected and doesn&#x27;t line up on face as shown, not even on my teenage granddaughter. Because of this problem you try to do one eye brow at a time and it still doesn&#x27;t line up accurately ....... very awkward and inconvenient to use.</li>
            <li> This is really a bad product. It does not adjust to different face shapes and brow shapes.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even fit correctly &amp;#62;:(</li>
            <li> I waste my money buying this rubbish if I had a choirs I would not have given it a rating at all</li>
            <li> One of the items came broken hard plastic couldn&#x27;t get my eye pencil in to trace</li>
            <li> very difficult to work with, i wear glasses... i also thought that there would be 3 differnt molds, the one that i received did not quite match my brow shape...  the mold was way too narrow and short,&lt;br /&gt;should cost .99 cents or less.</li>
            <li> I only received one and it was bent on one side &amp; broken on the other. will never order Again</li>
            <li> Most definitely will let all my friends know to purchase this product also! I have problems applying my eye brows on. Either one side is lopsided or the they don&#x27;t match at all. With this tool my eye brows come out perfectly every single time! And very easy to use and clean!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for someone, and the only complaint was that the instructions were not in English.</li>
            <li> This product was broken when I received it</li>
            <li> impossible to line tool were eyebrows are. Tool only goes a little way toward eyebrows therefore stencil brows land on eyelid.</li>
            <li> Different kind of tool</li>
            <li> NOT EASY TO USE, HARD TO LINE UP WITH OTHER SIDE, SHAPE DOES NOT LOOK NATURAL.</li>
            <li> took forever to receive it then it was cracked!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so much the tool, it&#x27;s more so I have really messed up brows. They are very high up and the tool can&#x27;t be adjusted to accommodate that. so it doesn&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> Pencil doesn&#x27;t fit into the holes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it :/ if it was bigger it would have been nice to use!</li>
            <li> Threw it away not good</li>
            <li> This cheap tool isn&#x27;t simply working. You have to have a lot of brows in order to use it successfully. IMHO I would not spend money on this.</li>
            <li> Play toy for kids. Need to go back to the drawing board with these items.  Cannot be used easily!</li>
            <li> I was supposed to get three stencils only revived ONE,the blue one , am very disappointed with this order.</li>
            <li> VERY DIFFICULT TO DO BOTH EYE BROWS AT THE SAME TIME. SO THEY ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT UNLESS YOU HAVE THE TIME TO DO ONE AT A TIME</li>
            <li> Not the size i wanted</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care much for this. First I thought I&#x27;d be getting 3 different ones with slightly different brow shapes but no I only got one and it just messes me up holding that thing on my face</li>
            <li> Very very very bad and received broken</li>
            <li> Hard to manage but would have been great if the instructions were in English too.</li>
            <li> I do not like this little item.</li>
