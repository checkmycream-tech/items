            <li>I love my shampoo.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, only shampoo that works for me!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, I use it with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My hair is also more shinny and softer.</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo for many years.  </li>
            <li>The product is okay.</li>
            <li>I love both products.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo have used it for years with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like it gets my hair very clean.</li>
            <li>This product is perfection, after the first use you can see how good it is for your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is gray and I do not need to use any die to get a light lovely ash color.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a shampoo to maintain brunette hair that is dyed, this isn&#x27;t the product for you, if you are looking for a good pantene shampoo in general, then you&#x27;ll love this product.</li>
            <li>Gives you silky and fluffy touch and wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a nice scent and cleans my hair really well.  </li>
            <li>t gets my hair squeaky clean and seems to enhance the fading color.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to this shampoo and matching conditioner, my hair has retained some of the original brunette color, while leaving the gray, more of a silver than gray.  </li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t suit my hair - leaves my wavy/curly hair frizzy and quickly leaves build-up.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of flat hair I&#x27;m going to move on; would be a nice shampoo if you don&#x27;t have fine hair.</li>
            <li>only shampoo that works with my hair, i couldn&#x27;t find anything to work better!</li>
            <li>love it ..keeps me from having to color my hair so frequently</li>
            <li>I love the scent and if you have color treated brunette hair, it really helps the color stay vibrant and longer.</li>
            <li>Does not dry my hair out, and when combined with the matching conditioner, my hair has never looked better even though I am going gray.  </li>
            <li>The texture of my hair is so smooth and soft now.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair daily so must make sure the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>I love using this shampoo along with Pantene Brunette Daily color enhancing conditioner in between hair color&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I really recommend it!</li>
            <li>After having my hair colored brown with highlights I decided to try this; I liked it very much initially but it does weigh my fine hair down.  </li>
            <li>This is a very &amp;#34;lite&amp;#34; shampoo.</li>
            <li>Seems available only on Amazon, now.</li>
            <li>I really like the Pantene products for colored hair - I always buy the brunette</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather much at all and my hair looks greasy after shampooing and blow drying.</li>
            <li>makes a lot of suds, really cleans hair</li>
            <li>This is NOT to help colored hair to last longer, it is to help your natural brunette color look better, which it does for me.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo promises to do everything, it strips hair just like most other drug store shampoos.  </li>
            <li>It also has a lower rating on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s scale, which means it has fewer harmful chemicals in it than most conventional shampoos.</li>
            <li>New holy grail!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend any of these products in whatever haircolor you are trying to preserve.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Liquid crystal technology helps build a new protective layer to protect color-treated hair.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t live in the US</li>
            <li>this shampoo  leaves my hair soft and keep my brunette radiant.</li>
            <li>I find that using the shampoo (and conditioners) really make my hair color last.  </li>
            <li>Now, it doesn&#x27;t help to maintain my color like the blonde conditioner does, but it is the same quality and keep as other pantene products, and in the store, cheaper then them most of the time.</li>
            <li>I am a shampoo snob, having only used the high end brands.</li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t cover serious grey but if you just want a light tint it works very well.</li>
            <li>Pantene Pro-V Brunette Expressions Daily Color Enhancing Shampoo maintains your hair between color applications while giving you  soft shiny hair.</li>
            <li>This product enhances my natural Brunette color so the grey in my hair doesn&#x27;t seem as noticable.  </li>

            <li> This is a short review compared to my others because it is so much like the other shampoos in Pantene there is not much to say about it.</li>
            <li> I am using another product daily (for another reason) that was fading my color, making my hair look grey.  </li>
            <li> I like to stretch it out as long as possible just to save on my hair.  </li>
            <li> other colors seem to be the same shampoo with different pigment added to them, so red works with brown, brown works with red, doesn&#x27;t matter</li>
            <li> I recently gave up dying my hair (I&#x27;m 30 with some grey) and wanted something to just blend in.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this people think I&#x27;ve been dying my medium brown hair darker and mistake my grey for highlights.</li>
            <li> The dark color of the shampoo gets washed out twice, once after shampooing and again after conditioning.  </li>
            <li> and I can use a permanent color every six/seven weeks as I did previously..</li>
            <li> but I have a few grays in the front of my hairline.  </li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have the harsh chemicals that hair coloring products have.  </li>
            <li> Having a hard time getting it up at 9000&#x27; in the Colorado Rockies though.</li>

            <li> I used to get this shampoo at the grocery store, but they don&#x27;t sell it anymore.....this shampoo  leaves my hair soft and keep my brunette radiant.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this in stores, great for colored hair.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  I swear it blends my grays in.  I am 51 and I have never dyed my hair but I have a few grays in the front of my hairline.  Using this shampoo daily with the conditioner hides my grays!</li>
            <li> Good Shampoo for the price.</li>
            <li> This too keeps my color lasting longer.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and good pricing, and quick delivery.</li>

            <li> I am using another product daily (for another reason) that was fading my color, making my hair look grey.  Using this shampoo has restored the color and I can use a permanent color every six/seven weeks as I did previously..</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do what it says it will do. It s just simply shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Does NOT enhance your hair color.</li>
            <li> I used head and shoulders before. Switched to try this stuff out and I was blown away. The texture of my hair is so smooth and soft now. My hair is also so shiny and I&#x27;ve only used this stuff twice. This shampoo and the conditioner make a great duo. New holy grail!  And I can&#x27;t complain about the price either :)</li>
            <li> Luv it!!!  This is a very &amp;#34;lite&amp;#34; shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t suit my hair - leaves my wavy/curly hair frizzy and quickly leaves build-up. You get what you pay for here.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff. I like the way her hair smells</li>
            <li> I like this product, I purchase it all the time. Now, it doesn&#x27;t help to maintain my color like the blonde conditioner does, but it is the same quality and keep as other pantene products, and in the store, cheaper then them most of the time. If you are looking for a shampoo to maintain brunette hair that is dyed, this isn&#x27;t the product for you, if you are looking for a good pantene shampoo in general, then you&#x27;ll love this product.

            <li> 06/26/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CANNOT FIND THIS PRODUCT IN THE STORES ANYMORE.  CAN ALWAYS&lt;br /&gt;DEPEND ON AMAZON FOR ANYTHING!!!  I HAVE HAIR TO MY WAIST AND&lt;br /&gt;MUST TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT AS I DONATE MY HAIR TO &amp;#34;LOCKS OF&lt;br /&gt;LOVE&amp;#34; OR SOMEONE ELSE.  THIS WILL BE MY 5th OR 6TH TIME.  IT IS GOD&#x27;S&lt;br /&gt;WORK, NOT MINE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MANY BLESSINGS TO U &amp; URS!</li>
            <li> I love my shampoo. Good for colored hair. Gives you silky and fluffy touch and wonderful smell.</li>

            <li> I use this shampoo along with the same brand conditioner. I wash my hair daily so must make sure the shampoo and conditioner I select doesn&#x27;t build up or over condition and get greasy. Have been very satisfied with this product so plan on continuing to buy.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Liquid crystal technology helps build a new protective layer to protect color-treated hair.\\&quot;  This shampoo promises to do everything, it strips hair just like most other drug store shampoos.  Read before you criticize.</li>

            <li> I do not feel that this shampoo helps my color to last longer and I feel it is a bit drying.  The dark color of the shampoo gets washed out twice, once after shampooing and again after conditioning.  Not at all as advertized.</li>
            <li> makes a lot of suds, really cleans hair</li>

            <li> This product is perfection, after the first use you can see how good it is for your hair. I saw in Pantene&#x27;s website that the product is discontinued, which is a terrible shame, it&#x27;s their best product. I don&#x27;t live in the US and yet I decided to buy it just to have it again. I really recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and condition! Best one out there for colored hair!</li>

This won&#x27;t cover serious grey but if you just want a light tint it works very well.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for many years.  Tried others, but I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> The product is okay. It does the job what i needed to do. I recommend it for Brunettes to use.</li>
            <li> It is great shampoo with the added advantage of imparting a hint of color. I will continue using it forever.</li>
            <li> Pantene Brunettes is my only brand of shampoo and hair conditioner that I buy.  I love both products.</li>
            <li> love it ..keeps me from having to color my hair so frequently</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo have used it for years with the conditioner.  I am lost without it. My WM quiet selling it so I am on a hunt for it now.</li>
