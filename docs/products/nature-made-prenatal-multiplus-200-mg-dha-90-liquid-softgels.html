            <li>Again, the price is GREAT!</li>
            <li>it is suppose to be good for you!</li>
            <li>Good job Nature Made!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this vitamin.  </li>
            <li>I bought these multivitamins from Costco for a great price.  </li>
            <li>They are packed with great stuff including beta carotene (the not retinyl form of Vitamin A), but I just can&#x27;t get over the smell and taste.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re not kids, and don&#x27;t need attractive colors to help us take these vitamins.  </li>
            <li>This is an AMAZING price for a 3 month supply ALL IN ONE!.  </li>
            <li>they have so many great benefits!</li>
            <li>i think is good for my wife.   </li>
            <li>They also made me feel good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not so good.</li>
            <li>It made me more nauseous than I was otherwise!</li>
            <li>The fewer pills the better!</li>
            <li>My cousin recommended these caps for my first baby since she had 2 wonderful babies after using those pills...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad the company listened to their consumers!</li>
            <li>I ordered this product online because i had really liked the pills i had gotten from the grocery store (when i was traveling).</li>
            <li>I did my own research</li>
            <li>That means there is more synthetic dye in this product than the one thing we need most, folic acid!</li>
            <li>: strong nails, softer hair (I thought this was a wives tale), extremely gentle in the stomach, clinically proven absorption, best nutrient values I found together, swallows smoothly/easily, Walmart had a spectacular price!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first 150 pill bottle was great, no smell and no aftertaste.  </li>
            <li>Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Size: large&lt;br /&gt;-Texture: plasticky coating, very smooth</li>
            <li>These softgel pills are Excellent, I will stick with these throughout my entire pregnancy journey!</li>
            <li>How the coupon work even better??  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that it is the prenatals now.  </li>
            <li>ok to take just one dose....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with the price and its complete-ness, I&#x27;ll be overlooking the coloring.  </li>
            <li>You cant get any better than that.  </li>
            <li>I feel much more confident knowing that I will be ingesting something that will not put my baby in harm&#x27;s way.</li>
            <li>If you can do it then more power to you.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m also wondering whether its safe to take the vitamins since i believe they were overheated.</li>
            <li>The top is sectioned into 6</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care if it costs more, as it will outweigh</li>
            <li>No fishy smells or aftertaste, so far so good!</li>
            <li>Taking the old ones I had a beautiful, healthy baby.</li>
            <li>I was super happy to find these multi vitamin with DHA and they have been very gentle on my stomach, no burping no fishy taste and no nausea.  </li>
            <li>For the most part, they&#x27;ve been fine.  </li>
            <li>I was taking Rainbow Light and had no problems with them, but thought I would try some that were more affordable.  </li>
            <li>These have been great so far</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s a softgel, it is easy to swallow</li>
            <li>I do not experience the fish after taste and it&#x27;s relatively easy to swallow.</li>
            <li>and i could stomach them easily without problems-</li>
            <li>They are really easy to swallow</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fine...</li>
            <li>them fine-</li>
            <li>They were cheap</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even touch them without having to scrub my hands clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>I do need to take it with food because it upsets my stomach once it starts dissolving -- but that&#x27;s a good sign that it IS actually dissolving.  </li>
            <li>a good sign - Nature Made may actually act on customer feedback.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no nausea, no bad or fishy after taste.</li>
            <li>I had prescription prenatals while pregnant</li>
            <li>These smell and taste like fish and for a pregnant women with nausea ...</li>
            <li>My pregnant senses can&#x27;t tolerate these.</li>
            <li>Perfect Prenatals - they&#x27;re more expensive, and you have to take three a day</li>
            <li>as I quick started my research as soon as I found this).</li>
            <li>she mentioned that the soft gel caps are really easy to swallow -- and they were!</li>
            <li>I was so excited at first to find an affordable prenatal vitamin that was one pill per day, and included DHA.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s everything I was trying to avoid at first, but the trade off just isn&#x27;t worth it at all!</li>
            <li>I am now going to look into buying a more natural prenatal vitamin.</li>
            <li>I am pregnant with #2 and with my first child I could not find a DHA pill that I could handle</li>
            <li>The new jar has no dye and actually smells good.</li>
            <li>These pills are not only easy on your stomach (which is often a concern for me!)</li>
            <li>the staff was good looking with little smell.</li>
            <li>Many of my girlfriends have to take many small pills to get all the nutrients doctors want in a pill</li>
            <li>This one is pretty flavorless to me and I believe the liquid softgel makes it absorb faster to not upset the tummy.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first, to try these pills.</li>
            <li>, i really had to hold my breath when i swallow them!).</li>
            <li>I would prefer a higher content of iron and calcium, but itÂ´s</li>
            <li>sure enough they heard the compliance and changed their formula...</li>
            <li>When I first started taking them, I thought the a company that calls themselves \\&quot;Nature</li>
            <li>the bottle must have gotten too hot in shipping-</li>
            <li>and I did find supporting evidence to their claims.</li>
            <li>I am also taking a calcium supplement on top of this because it does not have enough calcium.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s value and benefit in the long run with avoiding harmful effects and delivering the health benefits that is safe for my child.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too many pregnant women (myself included) could barely swallow these because of the fishy taste/smell in recent years.</li>
            <li>These pills are so large I cannot swallow them without gagging.</li>
            <li>also don&#x27;t think that Nature Made discloses where they get their fish oil for the DHA component, so it may or may not be pure.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking at 2 bottles of this prenatal right now - one that&#x27;s from July of 2012 that I just finished, and a new one that I bought in April 2013.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re much milder on my system.</li>
            <li>Overall I think the pills are fabulous.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Well, I understand it might be upsetting to discover the food coloring if you&#x27;re really anti-food coloring...  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking these but after reading about the red dye I&#x27;m going to try Rainbow Light Multivitamin/DHA pack.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve read it may be responsible for ADD, learning disabilities, and even autism.  </li>
            <li>The particular bottle i received had a much stronger smell of fish, each time i opened it</li>
            <li>i was surprised at how much the fish oil smelled!</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t taste any particular flavor with the pills.</li>
            <li>It is also a decent price.  </li>
            <li>I just now opened my second bottle and my fingers still stink 10 minutes later from barely touching one pill.  </li>
            <li>I researched a bit more and found that the company pulled red 40 from the ingredients recently.</li>
            <li>(I usually take additional fish oil, but if sometimes I don&#x27;t, I feel secure that I&#x27;ve gotten adequate DHA).  </li>
            <li>: at first they are strong, after a few weeks you won&#x27;t notice the taste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking these vitamins for 2 weeks now and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to swallow and relatively inexpensive (especially compared to others with DHA).</li>
            <li>I bought them at different times from different stores, and they both have a strong smell of fish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m due in a few weeks and so far my pregnancy, weight, and blood results have been great.</li>
            <li>definitely* advise anyone who doesn&#x27;t like the fishy aftertaste to find another vitamin, but if you either can deal with the taste or know you&#x27;ll be drinking or eating right after, I like them.</li>
            <li>These vitamins go down easy and make me feel healthier.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve had no trouble swallowing the large softgel pills.</li>
            <li>I am going to return the remainder of these, and I&#x27;m getting the New Chapter</li>
            <li>Red 40 is rumored to give children higher risk of ADHD.</li>
            <li>pretty much daily</li>
            <li>I ordered these vitamins, and despite having pretty serious morning sickness, swallowed them easily and tolerated</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller than a horse-pill but you need to drink a glass of water to make sure it goes down.</li>
            <li>Red 40, yellow 6 and blue1 are is in this vitamins, that dissappointed me very much as the old simple prenatal have no artificial coloring.</li>
            <li>The container is filled with a black substance like pepper, but the grain size is much smaller, and it wreaks of fish.</li>
            <li>The bottle looks different and has a pink pregnant woman on the front label.</li>
            <li>It first happened one day when I took them on an empty stomach.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth noting that I have two different bottles of these, a smaller one and a larger one.  </li>
            <li>This pill is the same size as some samples my doc gave me, so with enough water it went down easy.</li>
            <li>If you have a jar that&#x27;s new enough to have a carbon filter in it, it probably doesn&#x27;t have the dyes in it anymore.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that I would prefer more calcium.    </li>
            <li>Made\\&quot; just used beets for coloring, until about 2 weeks later I decided to read the back label more carefully and noticed they have Red 40, and blue and yellow.  </li>
            <li>i wont be ordering on line again because i cant depend on the shipping not becoming too hot (we live in the desert).</li>
            <li>Even my husband jumped back from the smell, and he doesn&#x27;t have a sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li>These vitamins have an overwhelming fishy odor to them, much worse than any fish oil capsules I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li>These vitamins have an overwhelming fishy odor to them, much worse than any fish oil capsules I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li>Nature Made on the other hand, just went down fine</li>
            <li>Red 40 has been linked to ADHD in kids, to tumor growth, and many other issues - and to put it in a prenatal vitamin for no good reason at all is just unconscionable.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m due in a few weeks and so far my pregnancy, weight, and blood results have been great.</li>
            <li> definitely* advise anyone who doesn&#x27;t like the fishy aftertaste to find another vitamin, but if you either can deal with the taste or know you&#x27;ll be drinking or eating right after, I like them.</li>
            <li> These vitamins go down easy and make me feel healthier.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve had no trouble swallowing the large softgel pills.</li>
            <li> I am going to return the remainder of these, and I&#x27;m getting the New Chapter</li>
            <li> Red 40 is rumored to give children higher risk of ADHD.</li>
            <li> pretty much daily</li>
            <li> I ordered these vitamins, and despite having pretty serious morning sickness, swallowed them easily and tolerated</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than a horse-pill but you need to drink a glass of water to make sure it goes down.</li>
            <li> Red 40, yellow 6 and blue1 are is in this vitamins, that dissappointed me very much as the old simple prenatal have no artificial coloring.</li>
            <li> The container is filled with a black substance like pepper, but the grain size is much smaller, and it wreaks of fish.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks different and has a pink pregnant woman on the front label.</li>
            <li> It first happened one day when I took them on an empty stomach.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth noting that I have two different bottles of these, a smaller one and a larger one.  </li>
            <li> This pill is the same size as some samples my doc gave me, so with enough water it went down easy.</li>
            <li> If you have a jar that&#x27;s new enough to have a carbon filter in it, it probably doesn&#x27;t have the dyes in it anymore.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I would prefer more calcium.    </li>
            <li> Made\\&quot; just used beets for coloring, until about 2 weeks later I decided to read the back label more carefully and noticed they have Red 40, and blue and yellow.  </li>
            <li> i wont be ordering on line again because i cant depend on the shipping not becoming too hot (we live in the desert).</li>
            <li> Even my husband jumped back from the smell, and he doesn&#x27;t have a sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li> These vitamins have an overwhelming fishy odor to them, much worse than any fish oil capsules I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li> These vitamins have an overwhelming fishy odor to them, much worse than any fish oil capsules I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li> Nature Made on the other hand, just went down fine</li>
            <li> Red 40 has been linked to ADHD in kids, to tumor growth, and many other issues - and to put it in a prenatal vitamin for no good reason at all is just unconscionable.  </li>
            <li> ALSO the reason I started researching this pill in the first place, was because I found a very odd container within the packaged bottle itself!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that the absence of the dyes and presence of the carbon filter are</li>
            <li> Not to mention the unnecessary additives that the other reviews stated, these vitamins gave me really gross fish burps like so many other DHA/ Omega 3 supplements.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come out of the haze of constant nausea and started doing more homework, only to find out that these vitamins contain Red 40, among other artificial colors.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I was having problems remembering to take my previous regimen of three pills per day, often remembering in the morning and then missing my second or third doses, and was just so sick that I didn&#x27;t really do my homework - having one pill to take per day that would supposedly give me everything I needed</li>
            <li> In addition, they are huge and difficult to swallow.</li>
            <li> In addition, they are huge and difficult to swallow.</li>
            <li> So forget about the horror stories about artificial coloring coz if it were a RISK at all, then it should have been recalled after so many years of manufacturing them.</li>
            <li> I made sure to read the labels and avoid those containing artificial color dye.</li>
            <li> And NEVER take them on an empty stomach even though the bottle only \\&quot;suggests\\&quot; you take it with food.  </li>
            <li> My only wish with the pill is that it was a little smaller.</li>
            <li> Why would you put something like that into a pill meant for the nourishment of a developing fetus which is at its most vulnerable?!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different prenatals during my pregnancy and this is the only one I could find that is over the counter and has folic acid + DHA + iron.  </li>
            <li> Makes me so grateful that I didn&#x27;t need to skip pills, or take something watered down (like folic acid only) to get by.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking them for several weeks now and, while they are easy to swallow, I have gotten a really bad fishy after taste from them.</li>
            <li> Each pie has tiny little holes, like you would find on salt n pepper shakers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding all these components in one tablet and had to take multiple pills earlier in my pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> whether or not I have them on an empty stomach.  </li>
            <li> You usually need a prescription if you want the 200mg of DHA mixed in with your prenatal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not willing to take the risk on my unborn baby.</li>
            <li> These did not give me fishy burps/taste like some other people have.</li>
            <li> It sounds crazy, but it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> These vitamins are listed in several articles about the worst prenatal vitamins on the market - I&#x27;m ashamed that I didn&#x27;t do more research before I bought and took them for a crucial month of my pregnancy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a couple other reviews that pointed out this product contains harmful food dyes that is linked to ADHD in children.</li>
            <li> Nordic Naturals is the only kind that I know of that doesn&#x27;t produce this side effect, but Nature Made is THE WORST of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I tend to think not since I&#x27;ve been on these for 6 months (not pregnant yet)</li>
            <li> Other reviewers discussed this already... its sad that a women in among the most delicate times of her life has to take a supplement with artificial junk in it... as if there isn&#x27;t enough intake of that already.....</li>
            <li> In my previous pregnancies, I&#x27;ve had trouble keeping my prenatal down because of nausea.  </li>
            <li> I found that if I took the pill before breakfast I would feel  a little queasy</li>
            <li> Infact, an article from CBS news stated that just by eliminating the artificial ingredient from children&#x27;s diets lowered the ADHD activity by 50%, just the same as them taking prescibed medications for it; ones like Ritaline were such an examle that was given in the article.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken a few bottles of these pills during my years of pregnancy and nursing.  </li>
            <li> My niece who is 4 yrs old cannot have anything with red 40 because she becomes violent as a side-effect.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t taste bad, they are just too large to swallow.</li>
            <li> I am not only in shock, but angry.</li>
            <li> And they just came out with a Vitamin D for kids, chewable and guess what... the same artificial routine.</li>
            <li> I saw reviews that complained about the taste</li>
            <li> I was breathing heavily, and the doctors couldn&#x27;t find anything wrong.  </li>
            <li> The only downfall is if I take it during the day it DOES make me feel sick.  </li>
            <li> and they were enormous (though tasteless and never upset my stomach) and prohibitively expensive.</li>
            <li> i got confused.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if the bottle became overheated or a capsule is broken like another reviewer suggested.</li>
            <li> My friends have always told me how awful prenatal vitamins are, large pills, bad after taste, nausea, etc.</li>
            <li> This pill has allowed me to take a proper prenatal thoughout a very bad bout with morning sickness!  </li>
            <li> And especially Red 40, that&#x27;s probably the worst one there is!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just found out yesterday that they have Red 40 in them. I am not going to take them anymore. It&#x27;s not necessary for them to be Red. Even if there is a chance that Red 40 unsafe it should not be in a prenatal. I am very unhappy with this product. I too was fooled by the name.</li>
            <li> These vitamins have an overwhelming fishy odor to them, much worse than any fish oil capsules I&#x27;ve ever smelled. In addition, they are huge and difficult to swallow. Bad combination when you&#x27;re already nauseated.</li>
            <li> This prenatal gave me a horrible taste in my mouth for about 24 hours after I took it.  It made me more nauseous than I was otherwise! I told my doc and he gave me a prescription for PreferaOB prenatals and they&#x27;re much milder on my system.</li>
            <li> Red 40, yellow 6 and blue1 are is in this vitamins, that dissappointed me very much as the old simple prenatal have no artificial coloring. Taking the old ones I had a beautiful, healthy baby.</li>
            <li> If the name wasn&#x27;t Nature Made it wouldn&#x27;t make me so mad their vitamins almost always have artificial ingredients. A vitamin- it is suppose to be good for you! And they just came out with a Vitamin D for kids, chewable and guess what... the same artificial routine. They should have to change their name!</li>
            <li> Not to mention the unnecessary additives that the other reviews stated, these vitamins gave me really gross fish burps like so many other DHA/ Omega 3 supplements.  Nordic Naturals is the only kind that I know of that doesn&#x27;t produce this side effect, but Nature Made is THE WORST of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers discussed this already... its sad that a women in among the most delicate times of her life has to take a supplement with artificial junk in it... as if there isn&#x27;t enough intake of that already.....</li>
            <li> You usually need a prescription if you want the 200mg of DHA mixed in with your prenatal.  Without a prescription, the 2 separate bottles will run you about $20+ for a months supply of DHA and about $10 for the prenatal.  This is an AMAZING price for a 3 month supply ALL IN ONE!.  There is one pill...not two.  The only downfall is if I take it during the day it DOES make me feel sick.  I take it before bed and I&#x27;m fine...otherwise, I&#x27;ve learned to skip it.  Again, the price is GREAT!</li>
            <li> In my previous pregnancies, I&#x27;ve had trouble keeping my prenatal down because of nausea.  Not with this pill!  Since it&#x27;s a softgel, it is easy to swallow and *doesn&#x27;t* have a gritty or fishy aftermath.  I like that this prenatal has DHA built-in (I usually take additional fish oil, but if sometimes I don&#x27;t, I feel secure that I&#x27;ve gotten adequate DHA).  This pill has allowed me to take a proper prenatal thoughout a very bad bout with morning sickness!  Makes me so grateful that I didn&#x27;t need to skip pills, or take something watered down (like folic acid only) to get by.  I also like that it&#x27;s *one* pill - and not a pill pack.  The fewer pills the better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these vitamins for 2 weeks now and I highly recommend them. Many of my girlfriends have to take many small pills to get all the nutrients doctors want in a pill but with Nature Made Prenatal MultiPlus I only had to take one pill. I found that if I took the pill before breakfast I would feel  a little queasy but once I started eating before taking the pill I didn&#x27;t have a problem. My only wish with the pill is that it was a little smaller. It&#x27;s smaller than a horse-pill but you need to drink a glass of water to make sure it goes down. I saw reviews that complained about the taste but I can&#x27;t taste any particular flavor with the pills. Overall I think the pills are fabulous.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the reaction to artificial colorings that some reviewers do and I would *definitely* advise anyone who doesn&#x27;t like the fishy aftertaste to find another vitamin, but if you either can deal with the taste or know you&#x27;ll be drinking or eating right after, I like them. They&#x27;re easy to swallow and relatively inexpensive (especially compared to others with DHA). I had prescription prenatals while pregnant and they were enormous (though tasteless and never upset my stomach) and prohibitively expensive. For nursing, these work well.</li>
            <li> These vitamins go down easy and make me feel healthier. I&#x27;ve always had difficulty tolerating big pills or tastes from the pill itself. This one is pretty flavorless to me and I believe the liquid softgel makes it absorb faster to not upset the tummy. Works for me!</li>
            <li> Since my husband and I are TTC, my OB/GYN suggested I start taking a prenatal vitamin with DHA.  After comparing prices, brands, ingredients, etc. I picked up a bottle of Nature Maid Prenatal MultiPlus 200mg DHA - Liquid Softgels. My friends have always told me how awful prenatal vitamins are, large pills, bad after taste, nausea, etc. I was hesitant at first, to try these pills. So far, I&#x27;ve had no trouble swallowing the large softgel pills. I&#x27;ve had no nausea, no bad or fishy after taste. These softgel pills are Excellent, I will stick with these throughout my entire pregnancy journey!</li>
            <li> the staff was good looking with little smell. i think is good for my wife.   but one thing insteresting is that together with the bill there is also a Coupon code. but after i read over. i got confused.  the coupon was expired till Sep.30th, but the order was placed on Oct.3rd by me.  How the coupon work even better??  haha</li>
            <li> My cousin recommended these caps for my first baby since she had 2 wonderful babies after using those pills... she mentioned that the soft gel caps are really easy to swallow -- and they were! What I like about this is the fact that they don&#x27;t have the nasty after taste (unlike the nature&#x27;s bounty brand, i really had to hold my breath when i swallow them!). Nature Made on the other hand, just went down fine and I never had problems with morning sickness or whatever nasty things they&#x27;d say about prenatal vitamins. They also made me feel good. So forget about the horror stories about artificial coloring coz if it were a RISK at all, then it should have been recalled after so many years of manufacturing them. It&#x27;s not like you are putting nuclear reactive particles in your system...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken a few bottles of these pills during my years of pregnancy and nursing.  For the most part, they&#x27;ve been fine.  They were cheap (I got them at Costco), and I felt like I was getting the nutrition I needed for my babies.  However, something in my body changed.  It first happened one day when I took them on an empty stomach.  An hour later, I found myself in the ER.  I was breathing heavily, and the doctors couldn&#x27;t find anything wrong.  After giving me pain relievers, they sent me on my way (after 3+ hours and hundreds of dollars later).  Since that was the only thing I had that morning I had my suspicions that it was the prenatal.  Another day I didn&#x27;t eat, the same thing happened.  I had all the same symptoms, but thankfully, I got some food in my system so even though I had severe cramping in my upper abdominals, I didn&#x27;t have to go to the doctor.  Now, though, it seems like whenever I take these pills I get these terrible cramps - whether or not I have them on an empty stomach.  I&#x27;m sure that it is the prenatals now.  I just threw away my last bottle.  The expiration date is still a year out, so I know it&#x27;s not that. Please, please, PLEASE, if you are going to take these, pay attention to your body.  It might start suddenly reject them.  And NEVER take them on an empty stomach even though the bottle only \\&quot;suggests\\&quot; you take it with food.  It should be a requirement!!!</li>
            <li> I would prefer a higher content of iron and calcium, but itÂ´s ok to take just one dose.... do not leave a bad taste fishy</li>
            <li> Well, I understand it might be upsetting to discover the food coloring if you&#x27;re really anti-food coloring...  But EVERYthing has SOMEthing you don&#x27;t want!  I&#x27;m so pleased with the price and its complete-ness, I&#x27;ll be overlooking the coloring.  The only complaint I have is that I would prefer more calcium.    I do need to take it with food because it upsets my stomach once it starts dissolving -- but that&#x27;s a good sign that it IS actually dissolving.  I do not experience the fish after taste and it&#x27;s relatively easy to swallow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this vitamin.  I&#x27;ve used a few different prenatals during my pregnancy and this is the only one I could find that is over the counter and has folic acid + DHA + iron.  I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding all these components in one tablet and had to take multiple pills earlier in my pregnancy.  While it isn&#x27;t the smallest pill and the taste is nothing to speak of (especially compared with gummies), it does the job and it allows me to take only one pill a day.  It is also a decent price.  I&#x27;m due in a few weeks and so far my pregnancy, weight, and blood results have been great.</li>
            <li> I am taking these prenatal vitamins on advice from my doctor.  These pills are not only easy on your stomach (which is often a concern for me!), they do not give you &#x27;vitamin burps&#x27;!  You cant get any better than that.  If you need a prenatal vitamin, these are definitely the ones you want to be taking.  Good job Nature Made!</li>
            <li> These pills are so large I cannot swallow them without gagging. They don&#x27;t taste bad, they are just too large to swallow.</li>
            <li> I started taking these PNV&#x27;s after the pharmacist recommended them to me when I requested a prenatal with DHA. I&#x27;ve been taking them for several weeks now and, while they are easy to swallow, I have gotten a really bad fishy after taste from them. They are gel capsules, and they contain Red 40. After doing my research, I threw my bottle away and am going to buy another brand tomorrow. Red 40 is rumored to give children higher risk of ADHD. I&#x27;m not willing to take the risk on my unborn baby. I feel much more confident knowing that I will be ingesting something that will not put my baby in harm&#x27;s way.</li>
            <li> These did not give me fishy burps/taste like some other people have. I&#x27;ve been taking these but after reading about the red dye I&#x27;m going to try Rainbow Light Multivitamin/DHA pack.</li>
            <li> I bought these multivitamins from Costco for a great price.  My first 150 pill bottle was great, no smell and no aftertaste.  I just now opened my second bottle and my fingers still stink 10 minutes later from barely touching one pill.  There was no way that was going into my mouth.  It&#x27;s overpowering.  I&#x27;m wondering if the bottle became overheated or a capsule is broken like another reviewer suggested. In any case, these are going back.  Yuck.</li>
            <li> I purchased these and took one, then read the ingredients and realized it contains red dye 40. Red dye 40 was listed in the ingredients BEFORE folic acid. That means there is more synthetic dye in this product than the one thing we need most, folic acid! I am not only in shock, but angry. How can a company called \\&quot;Nature Made\\&quot; get away with this. Red dye 40 is not only harmful to us, but also to our developing baby. DO NOT BUY THESE! PLEASE!</li>
            <li> I have never been so constipated in my life! I was taking Rainbow Light and had no problems with them, but thought I would try some that were more affordable.  I have had nothing but tummy troubles since taking these. I also get the yucky fish burps! I am getting rid of these and going back to the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> These smell and taste like fish and for a pregnant women with nausea ... it&#x27;s not so good. They are packed with great stuff including beta carotene (the not retinyl form of Vitamin A), but I just can&#x27;t get over the smell and taste. My husband was even turned off noting that they smell like salmon. My pregnant senses can&#x27;t tolerate these. If you can do it then more power to you.  It&#x27;s worth noting that I have two different bottles of these, a smaller one and a larger one.  I bought them at different times from different stores, and they both have a strong smell of fish.</li>
            <li> After researching lots of prenatals, I decided to buy these. I made sure to read the labels and avoid those containing artificial color dye. I purchased these for that reason, so I was shocked to see reviews that blast Nature Made for this....I went to there website and sure enough they heard the compliance and changed their formula...no color dye! This pill is the same size as some samples my doc gave me, so with enough water it went down easy. No fishy smells or aftertaste, so far so good!</li>
            <li> I agree, I&#x27;m so angry that they would put artificial food coloring in these PRENATALS.  We&#x27;re not kids, and don&#x27;t need attractive colors to help us take these vitamins.  When I first started taking them, I thought the a company that calls themselves \\&quot;Nature Made\\&quot; just used beets for coloring, until about 2 weeks later I decided to read the back label more carefully and noticed they have Red 40, and blue and yellow.  It&#x27;s all over the web to try and avoid eating food with Red 40 during pregnancy.  I will never trust this company again, especially since their name implies that they are \\&quot;natural\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Why would you put artificial colors in a prenatal vitamin?!  And especially Red 40, that&#x27;s probably the worst one there is!  My niece who is 4 yrs old cannot have anything with red 40 because she becomes violent as a side-effect.  It sounds crazy, but it&#x27;s true.  And I&#x27;ve read it may be responsible for ADD, learning disabilities, and even autism.  Why would you put something like that into a pill meant for the nourishment of a developing fetus which is at its most vulnerable?!</li>
            <li> I was so excited at first to find an affordable prenatal vitamin that was one pill per day, and included DHA.  I ordered these vitamins, and despite having pretty serious morning sickness, swallowed them easily and tolerated them fine- no offensive smells, and no gagging.  Honestly, I was having problems remembering to take my previous regimen of three pills per day, often remembering in the morning and then missing my second or third doses, and was just so sick that I didn&#x27;t really do my homework - having one pill to take per day that would supposedly give me everything I needed was just too appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve come out of the haze of constant nausea and started doing more homework, only to find out that these vitamins contain Red 40, among other artificial colors.  Why on earth?! Red 40 has been linked to ADHD in kids, to tumor growth, and many other issues - and to put it in a prenatal vitamin for no good reason at all is just unconscionable.  These vitamins are listed in several articles about the worst prenatal vitamins on the market - I&#x27;m ashamed that I didn&#x27;t do more research before I bought and took them for a crucial month of my pregnancy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t think that Nature Made discloses where they get their fish oil for the DHA component, so it may or may not be pure.  I am going to return the remainder of these, and I&#x27;m getting the New Chapter Perfect Prenatals - they&#x27;re more expensive, and you have to take three a day (I&#x27;ve also heard they have an earthy smell that I&#x27;m afraid will make me gag) - that&#x27;s everything I was trying to avoid at first, but the trade off just isn&#x27;t worth it at all! I&#x27;ll grapple with vitamins three times a day if that&#x27;s what I need to do to avoid feeding my baby poisonous substances!</li>
            <li> These vitamins have an overwhelming fishy odor to them, much worse than any fish oil capsules I&#x27;ve ever smelled. Even my husband jumped back from the smell, and he doesn&#x27;t have a sensitive nose.  I can&#x27;t even touch them without having to scrub my hands clean afterwards. In addition, they are huge and difficult to swallow. Bad combination when you&#x27;re already nauseated.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product online because i had really liked the pills i had gotten from the grocery store (when i was traveling). they werent too fishy and i could stomach them easily without problems- i wasnt burping up fish oil. none of the grocery stores nearby carry this prenatal vitamin.   The particular bottle i received had a much stronger smell of fish, each time i opened it i was surprised at how much the fish oil smelled! the bottle must have gotten too hot in shipping- finally i noticed one of the capsules was expanded and thats where the smell was originating from. i wont be ordering on line again because i cant depend on the shipping not becoming too hot (we live in the desert). i&#x27;m also wondering whether its safe to take the vitamins since i believe they were overheated.</li>
            <li> I never took daily vitamins on a daily basis. I never saw or felt enough benefit from them. Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Size: large&lt;br /&gt;-Texture: plasticky coating, very smooth&lt;br /&gt;-Taste: at first they are strong, after a few weeks you won&#x27;t notice the taste. Drink a glass of water with it and you will forget about it!&lt;br /&gt;-Smell: fishy, but come on it has omega 3s!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: strong nails, softer hair (I thought this was a wives tale), extremely gentle in the stomach, clinically proven absorption, best nutrient values I found together, swallows smoothly/easily, Walmart had a spectacular price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the nails/hair I can say that I used to have heartburn pretty much daily an had to take a one a day pill for it. Shortly after I started taking these I realized I never get heartburn anymore. Coincidence? I tend to think not since I&#x27;ve been on these for 6 months (not pregnant yet) and I had been getting heartburn for about 6 years...you make the call but I&#x27;d like to take these daily for the rest of my life they have so many great benefits!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a couple other reviews that pointed out this product contains harmful food dyes that is linked to ADHD in children. I did my own research and I did find supporting evidence to their claims. These pills contain Red 40, Blue 1, and Yellow 6; all of which are harmful to children. Infact, an article from CBS news stated that just by eliminating the artificial ingredient from children&#x27;s diets lowered the ADHD activity by 50%, just the same as them taking prescibed medications for it; ones like Ritaline were such an examle that was given in the article. ALSO the reason I started researching this pill in the first place, was because I found a very odd container within the packaged bottle itself! This is my second bottle that I&#x27;ve purchased, and I didn&#x27;t not find this unidentified small container in the last packaged bottle the first time. It is made of plasic, and it&#x27;s diameter is about 3/4\\&quot; and it&#x27;s height is about 1\\&quot;. The top is sectioned into 6 \\&quot;pie\\&quot; shapes that covers the entire area, like as if you were looking at a pie chart. Each pie has tiny little holes, like you would find on salt n pepper shakers. The container is filled with a black substance like pepper, but the grain size is much smaller, and it wreaks of fish. My hands are now contaminated with this smell (I&#x27;ve not washed them yet, as I quick started my research as soon as I found this). The containe is wrapped with a label that says \\&quot;Do Not Eat\\&quot; oh, and here it says the contents are carbon. However, my fingers are now drenched with anchovie smell. I am now going to look into buying a more natural prenatal vitamin. I don&#x27;t care if it costs more, as it will outweigh it&#x27;s value and benefit in the long run with avoiding harmful effects and delivering the health benefits that is safe for my child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just look into it... I did.</li>
            <li> I bought these after a lot of research.  They have the recommended amount of folic acid (according to Mayo Clinic).  They are really easy to swallow and I have not had any problems with aftertaste.  I am also taking a calcium supplement on top of this because it does not have enough calcium.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking at 2 bottles of this prenatal right now - one that&#x27;s from July of 2012 that I just finished, and a new one that I bought in April 2013. If you have a jar that&#x27;s new enough to have a carbon filter in it, it probably doesn&#x27;t have the dyes in it anymore. The carbon filter is there for the same reason you can put one into a diaper pail - it absorbs odor. PS: You&#x27;re not supposed to open the filter, it will smell like fish. Too many pregnant women (myself included) could barely swallow these because of the fishy taste/smell in recent years. I&#x27;d say that the absence of the dyes and presence of the carbon filter are a good sign - Nature Made may actually act on customer feedback. The new jar has no dye and actually smells good.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant with #2 and with my first child I could not find a DHA pill that I could handle therefore I never took one. I was super happy to find these multi vitamin with DHA and they have been very gentle on my stomach, no burping no fishy taste and no nausea.  I was concerned about them after reading that Nature Made added red 40 in the vitamin.I researched a bit more and found that the company pulled red 40 from the ingredients recently. The bottle looks different and has a pink pregnant woman on the front label. I looked at the bottle I had, saw the woman and saw no red 40. These have been great so far and I&#x27;m so glad the company listened to their consumers!</li>
