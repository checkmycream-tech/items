            <li>Works great for fresh cuts, or whether I am wolfing 6 weeks or longer.</li>
            <li>This brush is great after every fresh cut.  </li>
            <li>This brush is almost everything all the wavers been sayin it is, when I first used it alot of the brissles fell out like a dog shedding lol</li>

            <li>love this brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is more like a soft brush, does not have the feel of a medium brush, but it feels great and is effective.  </li>
            <li>I love all my Crown Brushes...</li>
            <li>I love my softy, but believe it or not this one is softer, even though it&#x27;s marketed as a Soft/Medium either way</li>

            <li>I love using this brush after getting a haircut.</li>

            <li>Fortunately the store was nice enough to swap it out.</li>
            <li>This brush has quickly become my go to brush to get my waves popping.  </li>
            <li>Any brush will do the trick and you do not need a crown brush to get, develop, and/or maintain waves, but it will allow you to brush your hair evenly and with high quality bristles that makes for better waving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My right side was my weak side, but after a month using the Premium, it is now my best side.  </li>
            <li>The brush is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>do own several crowns.  </li>
            <li>Nicely made brush, although I did feel one bristle that was obviously synthetic.</li>
            <li>I have about 13 brushes, but this brush does the best and you can brush less and still get the same effect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for laying ur hair down</li>
            <li>it was layin my hair down really good</li>
            <li>The handled premium brush is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>and I support them 100% and plan on doing more business with them in the very near future.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buy this brush, you will see your waves your transform the first time</li>
            <li>I only use my softee when my hair is shorter, but following it with this brush really gives my hair a nice sheen.  </li>
            <li>Always high quality products from crown!</li>
            <li>I am a Jewish woman with lightly curly hair, I had give the brush away.</li>
            <li>polishes your hair and really stretches your curls without messing up your pattern and making your hairs stick up all over the place.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s really helped with my connections.</li>
            <li>I can see my rough spot gettin better tho</li>
            <li>better waves in a matter of days, with less brushing....</li>
            <li>100% Boar Bristles, and man is it so soft!!</li>
            <li>I Own the Hard, Med, and this crown the Premium (with Med Boar Bristles).  </li>
            <li>so its just right for low cuts.</li>
            <li>The bristles live up to their claims:</li>
            <li>I have all 4 of the crown quality products brushes the soft,</li>
            <li>so I will say the money spent was worth it</li>
            <li>It states its a medium but its actually a Medium soft  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s softer than d regular soft.</li>
            <li>anyone that view my previous review, it was a common misunderstanding and everything has been resolved, CQP is an honest company</li>
            <li>Great purchase, you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li>The bristles in the bruah were falling out not worth the price really</li>
            <li>either so not sure spending the extra money was worth it.</li>

            <li> either so not sure spending the extra money was worth it.</li>
            <li> If your hair is nappy like mine, just hit them thangs with the Med or a comb and watch this brush get busy laying your hair down.  </li>
            <li> I was particularly careful with my CQP brush since it came with instructions, and only used cold-lukewarm water.</li>
            <li> This brush came with some brisells missing didnt think about sending it back to posibly get another brush to have the same outcome....</li>
            <li> Waiting for CQP to drop that new Hard Brush, but I guess I have to use the diane 8115</li>
            <li> You can only use cold water to clean them otherwise the brush will crack.</li>
            <li> After using a CQP brush, you will never want to use any other brush.  </li>
            <li> I too was skeptical about paying that much for a brush, but now that I got it I wished I had bought one sooner.  </li>
            <li> The curvature of this  brush lays my hair down helping my waves connect and given my hair shine / softness.</li>
            <li> This brush is for African American hair, if you have any other type of curly hair is useless.</li>
            <li> This time I taped over the logo, because otherwise it comes off in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> I have to retract my previous review on CQP.</li>
            <li> I usually use it for a finisher after I do my regular brushing with my Med brush when my hair is 1-2&#x27; and my hard brush when wolfing.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about this brush just yet.  </li>
            <li> the medium the hard along with the premium.</li>
            <li> A little on the expensive side</li>
            <li> That is about the only bad thing I have to say about this brush.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I need stronger bristles, and this company does not appear to make a hard bristle brush that is 100% boar.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re serious about getting waves you need these brushes!</li>
            <li> needless to say they have not been helpful at all.</li>
            <li> I was thinking 30 something for a brush man that&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> If you do not get waves with this brush its because you are doing something wrong!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The brush is great, help create deep quality wave. Just wished they put the correct bristle quality in description next time.</li>
            <li> Best brush I ever owned, already seeing results!</li>
            <li> The bristles live up to their claims: better waves in a matter of days, with less brushing....the only reason I rated the brush a 3 and not a 5 is because the brush is too fragile. You can only use cold water to clean them otherwise the brush will crack. The instructions say,&amp;#34;do not submerge in boiling water...&amp;#34; I never use boiling water on my brushes. I was particularly careful with my CQP brush since it came with instructions, and only used cold-lukewarm water. My medium brush still cracked. Fortunately the store was nice enough to swap it out. My premium brush cracked as well...smh...hopefully there will be improvements to the finish.</li>
            <li> This brush has quickly become my go to brush to get my waves popping.  My right side was my weak side, but after a month using the Premium, it is now my best side.  Works great for fresh cuts, or whether I am wolfing 6 weeks or longer. I also own the Caesar Med and the Crown Soft.  If your hair is nappy like mine, just hit them thangs with the Med or a comb and watch this brush get busy laying your hair down.

            <li> The bristles in the bruah were falling out not worth the price really</li>
            <li> This is great. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush ever!!  I own 8 Crown Brushes and I absolutely love them all.  The brush is worth the price.  After using a CQP brush, you will never want to use any other brush.  I have been spinning on and off for 30 years and I can say unequivocally, that the crown brushes are the best wave brushes ever made!  Trust me, buy the CQP brushes, and start spinnin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This brush is the best brush I have ever owned. I have about 13 brushes, but this brush does the best and you can brush less and still get the same effect. If you do not get waves with this brush its because you are doing something wrong!!</li>
            <li> Got this for a friend and he&#x27;s really enjoying this brush! Always high quality products from crown! Works great! :D</li>
            <li> Very good product. A little on the expensive side but it does what it says.</li>
            <li> This brush is for African American hair, if you have any other type of curly hair is useless. Seller did not indicate for AA hair only. Bristles do not penetrate hair. I am a Jewish woman with lightly curly hair, I had give the brush away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good brush.. love every minute brushing with it</li>
            <li> I have to retract my previous review on CQP. I have the medium soft Crown Gold Brush and it is by far the best brush i&#x27;ve even owned. Let me begin by stating this brush is top notch quality! The curvature of this  brush lays my hair down helping my waves connect and given my hair shine / softness. I highly recommend buy this brush, you will see your waves your transform the first time your use this brush guaranteed! I currently own CQP medium and soft brush and plan on purchasing there King Brush and No Line Durags when released, which I learned about while reading an inspirational article on CQP CEO Robert Watson [...]&lt;br /&gt;For anyone that view my previous review, it was a common misunderstanding and everything has been resolved, CQP is an honest company and I support them 100% and plan on doing more business with them in the very near future.</li>
            <li> It states its a medium but its actually a Medium soft  so its just right for low cuts. i like CQP brushes nuf said.</li>
            <li> i use this brush before i rag up. polishes your hair and really stretches your curls without messing up your pattern and making your hairs stick up all over the place. love this brush. The contour of the brush is perfect for my head and is really helping my connections on the top area.</li>
            <li> If u hav the cash go for it. MUST HAV. It&#x27;s softer than d regular soft. It&#x27;s good for laying ur hair down nd puttin the finishing touches</li>
            <li> All Wave enthusiast if you want to take your brush quality to the highest level, this is the product you want to add.  Any brush will do the trick and you do not need a crown brush to get, develop, and/or maintain waves, but it will allow you to brush your hair evenly and with high quality bristles that makes for better waving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do own several crowns.  I Own the Hard, Med, and this crown the Premium (with Med Boar Bristles).  This brush is more like a soft brush, does not have the feel of a medium brush, but it feels great and is effective.  I usually use it for a finisher after I do my regular brushing with my Med brush when my hair is 1-2&#x27; and my hard brush when wolfing.  This brush is great after every fresh cut.  It also is designed to to contour to your head.  Great purchase, you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> Awsome get waves popping with fewer brush strokes.</li>
            <li> I love all my Crown Brushes... But this one here has it all!!! 100% Boar Bristles, and man is it so soft!! I love my softy, but believe it or not this one is softer, even though it&#x27;s marketed as a Soft/Medium either way I love it!! Waiting for CQP to drop that new Hard Brush, but I guess I have to use the diane 8115 til&#x27; they figure out If/When it&#x27;s gonna be released!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@CQP Bring back that &amp;#34;Hard White&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> This brush feels great on your head.&lt;br /&gt;Makes brushing your hair a form of&lt;br /&gt;therapy and relaxing.  What a pleasure!</li>
            <li> Great for finishing off your brushing session before you put your durag on. And it&#x27;s really helped with my connections. I can use it at any stage in my wolfing process too</li>
            <li> The information on this product was not correct. The brush was bought for a Cauasian Lady...the brush is used for African American men to put waves in their hair. The product was sent back and company hasn&#x27;t refunded money to my account. It has been 13 business days. I&#x27;ve contacted the seller... needless to say they have not been helpful at all. I know the item has had plenty of time to get back to them.  I would not suggest buying from this seller/company.</li>
            <li> Nicely made brush, although I did feel one bristle that was obviously synthetic. Unfortunately, I need stronger bristles, and this company does not appear to make a hard bristle brush that is 100% boar.</li>
            <li> This brush is almost everything all the wavers been sayin it is, when I first used it alot of the brissles fell out like a dog shedding lol but once I got it good it was layin my hair down really good I can see my rough spot gettin better tho so I will say the money spent was worth it an I will get another one.</li>
            <li> Man this brush is the best ! Waves are booming all over. I was thinking 30 something for a brush man that&#x27;s crazy. But this is the master of all brush. Period.</li>
            <li> Not sure about this brush just yet.  The 360 Gold Premium Crown Wave Brush/ Med. Boar Bristle doesnt seem to add any additional waves.  Doesnt take away either so not sure spending the extra money was worth it.</li>
            <li> This brush came with some brisells missing didnt think about sending it back to posibly get another brush to have the same outcome....</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Feels extremely good to my head. I love using this brush after getting a haircut. I have all 4 of the crown quality products brushes the soft,the medium the hard along with the premium. If you&#x27;re serious about getting waves you need these brushes!</li>
            <li> The handled premium brush is exactly what I needed. I now have 5 CQP brushes for my hair at different lengths.</li>
            <li> BEST BRUSH YOU CAN BUY...NOTHING COMES CLOSE..THE BRUSH FITS IN YOUR HANDS SO PERFECTLY AND WHEN YOU BRUSH YOUR HAIR, THE WAVES COME IN A WEEK</li>
