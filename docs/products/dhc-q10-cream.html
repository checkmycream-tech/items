            <li>I have not reordered yet, but it seems like a good cream</li>
            <li>She asked what kind of face work did I get.</li>
            <li>Nicely emolliant cream.  </li>
            <li>but once I graduated my skin broke out more</li>
            <li>hating clogged pores and trying to cover up blemishes with a product that causes more blemishes is counterproductive.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Do I need to say more????</li>
            <li>its ok still trying it out</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I took benadryl, ibuprofen and put an ice pack on my face and thought it was getting better.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this cream and other DHC products.  </li>
            <li>I first used this product through a sample in the catalog and liked the results.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel silky smooth</li>
            <li>I used free sample 2 days ago.  </li>
            <li>Also, the sample was free</li>
            <li>but I think when you&#x27;re spending that much $ on a face/body cream, make sure it&#x27;s hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>Like what the f%!k Did not follow the step as listed I quickly went and wash that stuff off with soap and water than with hot water</li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin and this silky cream leaves my face looking and feeling great.</li>
            <li>I use hot water in the washcoth</li>
            <li>It had a much bigger jar packaging for Taiwan market when they started and I totally love it.</li>
            <li>This company should stop testing there products on people and test it on themselves first.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft ans smooth</li>
            <li>As a teen my skin was fine</li>
            <li>If i wash my face too much my face is oily and i i dont use anything my face breaks out.  </li>
            <li>Soaks in well if you don&#x27;t use too too much.</li>
            <li>This cream works very well.  </li>
            <li>If used with the Vitamin C cream you can expect real results.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to q10 cream.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to trying this product.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this cream was in my early 20 and have been using ever since.</li>
            <li>I really like this product it leaves my skin really soft</li>
            <li>At first, thought it might be poison ivy (looks and feels similar - swollen, itchy bumps all over face), but doesn&#x27;t make much sense for it to be poison ivy...</li>
            <li>Till this day I mainly go makeup free due to me</li>
            <li>it increased it so if you try any new product always remember to test it out on a small section to make sure it doesnt cause an allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not too hot Hot enough you can handle and place it on my face and repeat on neck to open up the pores....</li>
            <li>I have used DHC products in the past and enjoyed them.</li>
            <li>If that was the case I can name a number of products that I would consider \\&quot;toxic\\&quot; that have actually made my skin break out even more or had little to results.  </li>
            <li>I use this cream at night before bed and it makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>This is the product that really works on dry skin type.</li>
            <li>Wish I would have read Mrs. Reese&#x27;s review to try it somewhere other than my face first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve barely been outside lately, and haven&#x27;t been anywhere near poison ivy that I am aware of.  </li>
            <li>Went to the DHC website and quickly perused the negative reviews for this product on their website...  </li>
            <li>This product left my skin soft but by afternoon my skin felt dry.  </li>

            <li> This product left my skin soft but by afternoon my skin felt dry.  </li>
            <li> I tried to use other products to replace it but eventually still coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> and it doesnt dry my face out.  </li>
            <li> Frankly, it did not live up to it&#x27;s advertisement.</li>
            <li> Think I will be much more cautious before using a &amp;#34;free sample&amp;#34; next time.  :(</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> and my entire face was swollen, full of crusted over blisters and so painful that we went to the emergency room.</li>
            <li> I had read that other people had an allergic reaction ive been using this since feb and havent had any issues.  </li>
            <li> I tied other brands and my face breaks out</li>
            <li> Try it on a small area of your skin prior to putting it on you face.</li>
            <li> It is very light and it doesnt have a terrible smell which some facial creams can have.</li>
            <li> Be very, very careful with this product!</li>
            <li> it sting a little and face feels tight</li>
            <li> some people can&#x27;t use certain products doesn&#x27;t make them bad.  </li>
            <li> Now the packaging is too small and too pricey.</li>
            <li> but since I&#x27;ve never had any known allergies or skin reactions in the past, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have heeded her advice-trust</li>
            <li> Now I am in my late 30, I can still have people complementing about my skin.  </li>
            <li> After I ordered this product and used it less than a week I began to have dry patches and then horrible reddness that involved my entire face.</li>
            <li> The rash has progressed to blisters and is itchy, tight, and quite uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a little less swollen but so itchy and blisters are painful if I accidentally scratch and they break.</li>
            <li> It is a little worse today, but don&#x27;t think it is as bad a case as Arthur Cracker... not yet anyway.  </li>
            <li> After trying a sample of DHC cream that I received in mail, next morning sever allergy occur on my face, with very painful blisters.</li>
            <li> (Not saying it couldn&#x27;t happen, just unlikely)  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I will not be ordering any of their products - ever!</li>

            <li> I had read that other people had an allergic reaction ive been using this since feb and havent had any issues.  It makes my skin feel silky smooth and it doesnt dry my face out.  I use it in the set it came in and seems to work great.  If i wash my face too much my face is oily and i i dont use anything my face breaks out.  I tied other brands and my face breaks out and then i switched to dhc and it was the only one that i could use without breaking out tried proactiv but instead of reducing acne it increased it so if you try any new product always remember to test it out on a small section to make sure it doesnt cause an allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update:  10/22/2013 still no problems and I&#x27;ve had people compliment me on how I look.  some people can&#x27;t use certain products doesn&#x27;t make them bad.  If that was the case I can name a number of products that I would consider \\&quot;toxic\\&quot; that have actually made my skin break out even more or had little to results.  As a teen my skin was fine but once I graduated my skin broke out more and I realized that my makeup had a lot to do with my skin breaking out as well and it wasn&#x27;t just the lotions I use.  Till this day I mainly go makeup free due to me hating clogged pores and trying to cover up blemishes with a product that causes more blemishes is counterproductive.  Hope you all can eventually find a product that works well for you.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I have been receiving the DHC catalog for years and using their samples. However, I have never ordered anything form them. My husband ordered me several items for my birthday in March. A month later I was visiting a friend whom I had not seen since I had started using this product. She asked what kind of face work did I get. Ha. She actually thought I had a facelift! Do I need to say more????</li>
            <li> I use this cream at night before bed and it makes my skin feel soft. It is very light and it doesnt have a terrible smell which some facial creams can have.</li>
            <li> It is not as good as they claim.  I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing this review from a sample I tried, OMzG My face started to burn and tightening I only put on the cream Like what the f%!k Did not follow the step as listed I quickly went and wash that stuff off with soap and water than with hot water I used it as a steam to open up my pores. I use hot water in the washcoth not too hot Hot enough you can handle and place it on my face and repeat on neck to open up the pores....it sting a little and face feels tight It feels like glycerin needing of moisture...... If glycerin does not get moisture it start to blister I will not be buying or using that samples</li>
            <li> I have not reordered yet, but it seems like a good cream</li>
            <li> Great cream. Brightens your skin snd adds a ton of moisture without clogging.  My husband also steals it in the winter months.</li>
            <li> Soooooo wish I had read Arthur Cracker&#x27;s review before trying this! Like Arthur Cracker, I have never had an allergic reaction to anything cosmetic, so it never even crossed my mind to look into it before putting it on my face.  I used free sample 2 days ago.  Rash started to appear yesterday.  At first, thought it might be poison ivy (looks and feels similar - swollen, itchy bumps all over face), but doesn&#x27;t make much sense for it to be poison ivy... I&#x27;ve barely been outside lately, and haven&#x27;t been anywhere near poison ivy that I am aware of.  (Not saying it couldn&#x27;t happen, just unlikely)  It is a little worse today, but don&#x27;t think it is as bad a case as Arthur Cracker... not yet anyway.  Went to the DHC website and quickly perused the negative reviews for this product on their website...  4 of them said they had allergic reactions as well.  Think I will be much more cautious before using a &amp;#34;free sample&amp;#34; next time.  :(</li>
            <li> I tried a sample while visiting family. My mother always uses their products so I didn&#x27;t think anything of it. I used it Sunday and I woke up Monday with a swollen face and a rash on the area I used the product. The rash has progressed to blisters and is itchy, tight, and quite uncomfortable. Needless to say I will not be ordering any of their products - ever!</li>
            <li> I have used DHC products in the past and enjoyed them. I first used this product through a sample in the catalog and liked the results. After I ordered this product and used it less than a week I began to have dry patches and then horrible reddness that involved my entire face. It is now a week since I used the product and my skin has not normalized. The only thing I can put on it is olive oil. My face is like red sandpaper. Be very, very careful with this product!</li>
            <li> Nicely emolliant cream.  Soaks in well if you don&#x27;t use too too much.</li>
            <li> its ok still trying it out</li>
            <li> I really like this product it leaves my skin really soft</li>
            <li> This product left my skin soft but by afternoon my skin felt dry.  Frankly, it did not live up to it&#x27;s advertisement.</li>
            <li> DHC Q10 Cream.  This cream works very well.  If used with the Vitamin C cream you can expect real results.  They must be used together.</li>
            <li> This is the product that really works on dry skin type. I have very dry skin since I was a teenager. It can brightens and moisturises my skin all day. I always can see an instant result if I use it. It works perfectly with any markup I put on. The first time I used this cream was in my early 20 and have been using ever since. It had a much bigger jar packaging for Taiwan market when they started and I totally love it. Now the packaging is too small and too pricey. I tried to use other products to replace it but eventually still coming back to this one. Now I am in my late 30, I can still have people complementing about my skin.  Thanks to q10 cream.</li>
            <li> Great. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to trying this product. However, when I did it made my face burn and itch. It didn say anything about that being part of the experience so I can only assume I am allergic to it. Try it on a small area of your skin prior to putting it on you face.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It has made a difference in the appearance of my skin.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> After trying a sample of DHC cream that I received in mail, next morning sever allergy occur on my face, with very painful blisters. This company should stop testing there products on people and test it on themselves first.</li>
            <li> Call off the dogs, the hunt is over! This moisturizer is perfect for me. I have dry sensitive skin and this silky cream leaves my face looking and feeling great.</li>
            <li> I am reviewing this product that I received as a sample from DHC. I put this on my face on Thursday and didn&#x27;t notice any burning or redness. The next day, my face was noticeably red (I did not put any of the Q10 on) and by 11:00 am I was developing blisters on my chin, cheeks and forehead that kept progressing throughout the day. I took benadryl, ibuprofen and put an ice pack on my face and thought it was getting better. Saturday morning and my entire face was swollen, full of crusted over blisters and so painful that we went to the emergency room. I was diagnosed with severe dermatitis and now I&#x27;m taking prednisone, benedryl and hydrocortisone topical. It&#x27;s 5 pm and I&#x27;m a little less swollen but so itchy and blisters are painful if I accidentally scratch and they break. Wish I would have read Mrs. Reese&#x27;s review to try it somewhere other than my face first but since I&#x27;ve never had any known allergies or skin reactions in the past, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have heeded her advice-trust me Heed her advice!!!! Also, the sample was free but I think when you&#x27;re spending that much $ on a face/body cream, make sure it&#x27;s hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft ans smooth</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this cream and other DHC products.  I will continue to use this product every day.</li>
