            <li>/&gt;Ended up returning - it&#x27;s eh, just ok… weighs at 1lb… went for Babyliss Nano Titanium (more elegant and lighter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also has a safety GFCI breaker on the plug, which is just more of a testament to quality, but can also save your life if you&#x27;re using this somewhere that doesn&#x27;t have one.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it&#x27;s purple. :)</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for about a year, and it is still going strong.  </li>

            <li>Still - it works fine.</li>
            <li>Lucky it didn&#x27;t catch on fire!</li>
            <li>elegant, powerful, but fingers could easily slip fancy roundish</li>
            <li>This little hair dryer is great!</li>
            <li>This foldable little dryer is perfect for an overnight bag.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and powerful - the most important features of a travel hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I chose this hairdryer because it is light in weight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as great as the last one.</li>
            <li>According to the discription in the ad by Amazon, it was suppose to be light weight.</li>
            <li>Delivers on the quality promised, functional and light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more powerful than any blow dryer that I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>I know it is a good dryer, but I was just looking for something more lightweight and smaller.</li>
            <li>So far, so good. . .</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s great for travel because it folds in half and is very, very light in weight.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent little hairdryer!  </li>
            <li>Revlon Perfect Heat 1875W Fast Dry Compact Dryer (0.8lbs)</li>
            <li>I bought this dryer being excited about the compact size and the 1875W.  </li>
            <li>And this model was perfect for travel in that it&#x27;s small and dual voltage.</li>
            <li>Downside is that our hair gets sucked into it and that isn&#x27;t fun!</li>
            <li>Small, perfect for traveling or just for home.</li>
            <li>Good, handy little hair dryer that I can keep in a drawer at the bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li>It took forever to dry my hair and did not do a great job...</li>
            <li>less than ideal.</li>
            <li>great small hair dryer that I&#x27;m able to keep in the camper for when we travel about.</li>
            <li>it is quite good in shape and it is convenient to use as it is not so big.</li>
            <li>Had another one for many years and it very stopped working.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it so much I had to get 3 of them...</li>
            <li>Does a good basic job as a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>- good airflow but 1600w and looks a bit like standard hotel dryers</li>
            <li>Very compact the way I wanted it to be able to travel with it.  </li>
            <li>Tried and true.  </li>
            <li>I say spend the extra 30 bucks and get a good blow dryer.</li>
            <li>It works fine; more powerful than the older, heavier dryer I owned.</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because it is compact and would have been great for travel if it wasn&#x27; for the other issue</li>
            <li>This dryer is compact and worked fine for the first two months.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Conair, you lost a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>It blows lots of air and dries your hair really quickly.  </li>
            <li>dryer drys her hair well and quickly.</li>
            <li>Luckily for me (sarcasm), mine is permanently at 125 volts.</li>
            <li>It would be more accurate to say that significant torque needs to be applied--very carefully so as not to break the plastic--to turn the switch.</li>
            <li>Quieter than most without hurting your ears with high pitched noise.  </li>
            <li>Great for small spaces, after gym, people that MUST travel with a dryer, and I imagine, people with easy to manage hair.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with overall quality.</li>
            <li>the high setting is perfect for those fast blow dry mornings.</li>
            <li>This one did a good job to dry my hair on the go.</li>
            <li>fast, efficient drying and easy to fold up to put away.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>But, overall, I am pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li>Honestly, how many people have black interiors?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great little hairdryer</li>
            <li>This is a great little hair dryer.</li>
            <li>For the price, this is a great little hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little yet powerful hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pity, but otherwise good.</li>
            <li>This is the second one I&#x27;ve own.</li>
            <li>Powerful and versatile.</li>
            <li>it is convenient to have  hot or cool wind by pressing the button or not.</li>
            <li>My mom liked it so much, I gave her my old one and just bought this one again for myself.  </li>
            <li>but I use it all the time because it&#x27;s powerful and lightweight.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This dryer  has good, strong air flow and is conveniently small for traveling.  </li>
            <li>Folds up nicely and is just as strong as an average hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>High heat seems to work fine still.</li>
            <li>Otherwise...just right.  </li>
            <li>The cool does nothing and the hot is too hot.  </li>
            <li>Its small, light and folds inside which is good for travelling purpose.</li>
            <li>The high speed will do when she gets older, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use or taking on trips!</li>
            <li>Two stars only because the hair dryer itself works fine and because it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>Works very well and dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Hot but not too hot.  </li>
            <li>Only flaw- would like more focused air stream.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer especially for traveling.  </li>
            <li>Cricket Pro 7144 Professional Friction Free Dual Voltage Travel Hair Dryer,… (1lb)</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have enough space for the cord protector!</li>
            <li>when I first got it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Need a better guard on it, but hey for the price I just hope it lasts longer than our last one&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li>folding handle is very convenient and it is well worth its price.</li>
            <li>Pretty sturdy also.</li>
            <li>The directions say &amp;#34;flick&amp;#34; the switch to convert to 250 voltage, but be aware that you cannot just &amp;#34;flick&amp;#34; the switch.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also quieter than most the big ones I&#x27;ve tried and given away.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t terribly powerful but worked well enough to dry my hair and works better than most hotel dryers.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my small vanity, has the same power as my large dryer.  </li>
            <li>The low setting is not so loud but there really wasn&#x27;t much heat, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting very hot because it is the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting, but it was barely warm.  </li>
            <li>My last Conair 1875 finally gave out and I was delighted to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Babyliss Bambino Nano Titanium Ulta Lightweight Hair Dryer, 1000 Watt (0.6lb) - soooo light, 1000Watt but quiet powerful, almost like an 1875&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li>Even on the high setting, it dries my hair very quickly without blowing it all over the place into tangles or burning it up, like my old non-ionic hairdryer used to.</li>
            <li>- loud high pitch sound 1600Watts&lt;</li>
            <li>Easy to carry to pool and back.</li>
            <li>We own 4 of these as they will probably quit making them for something of less quality soon.</li>
            <li>The hi and low switch is not what the ProBaby was like and isn&#x27;t easy for me to use, but I&#x27;ll get accustomed to it.  </li>
            <li>As strong as a big dryer.</li>
            <li>The Conair is three times more powerful and dries my hair in less than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This dryer works fine, but was bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>I bought this Conair to replace an older model that I had had for over 10 years!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very compact and lightweight, with a large nozzle for lots of airflow.  </li>
            <li>My previous Vagabond, which I loved and traveled with for many years, finally kicked the bucket and I replaced it today with the current model.</li>
            <li>Nice little hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Guess some things require a visit to a real store.</li>
            <li>It just doesnt seem to have as much power as it says it should.</li>
            <li>Very convenient, two options</li>
            <li>My girlfriend wants to exchange now.</li>
            <li>I really like mini hairdryers.</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and compact when it folds.</li>
            <li>it costs too much electricity!!!!&lt;br /&gt;i have to turn off all the lights when i use this product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;it is quite too mass</li>
            <li>I can take it any where I go, without taking up much room.  </li>
            <li>You could really damage your ear drums with this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>The fan is too powerfull and blows all the curls straight.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Compact and lightweight and works really well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t ask for much from a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Compact and works very well.</li>
            <li>It works pretty much as well as my normal hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It works good but much larger than what I expected.  </li>
            <li>This dryer woks better than my regular dryer and is not too loud.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem like it is strong, but dries our long hair fast.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as powerful as other hair dryers I own with the same wattage.  </li>
            <li>I love that the settings are not too hot and the low speed is perfectly low, even for a toddler.</li>
            <li>It is small and powerful and I love the fold-up handle for travel in a suitcase.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for low maintenance, low budget, easy, this is it!</li>
            <li>Amazing for a small hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>not long enough for my wife to plug in and use while showering :-)</li>
            <li>I need a dryer that would dry my hair quickly!</li>
            <li>Wife needed it for our 4000 mile road trip on our Harley Ultra Classic.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I could no longer turn the hair dryer to high.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going on HIGH.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy &amp; completely functional dryer.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and compact yet powerful but quiet.  </li>
            <li>It is much better than others I have used (they did not last long).</li>
            <li>Has lasted about 6 months and feels just as solid and powerful as it did</li>
            <li>It still is much quieter than many she has used in the past.</li>
            <li>It is powerful so that it dries the hair (mine is short) in no time.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer not only because it is designed for travel but that it has better air flow than any other hair dryer my wife has bought.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer is fine if you don&#x27;t need to change the voltage, but I bought it for international traveling, and it&#x27;s a big con for me that the switch doesn&#x27;t turn to 250 volts.</li>
            <li>I went on vacation in August, and purchased this hair dryer to fit in my 1 suitcase with all my other stuff.  </li>
            <li>so I needed a new one.</li>
            <li>Great little hair dryer that gives you what you need without being too huge or expensive.  </li>
            <li>My previous one was dying, and I&#x27;ve found most of the dryers today to be big and heavy, with smallish nozzles for a more concentrated flow for styling.  </li>
            <li>so far anyway!</li>
            <li>Of course, Amazon only allows refunds for the first month.</li>
            <li>this doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do that!</li>
            <li>This is that same model as my last one, only with half-again more power.</li>
            <li>and I am able to dry my long hair within minutes!</li>
            <li>Great little dryer, small, compacted, reliable and drys my hair.</li>
            <li>The low speed mode is too slow,the high speed mode is too fast...</li>
            <li>There are only 2 settings cool and hot for heat both too extreme for me.  </li>
            <li>Most have lasted for a couple of years with daily use before they start slowing down.</li>
            <li>this little gadget is super powerful, even on the &#x27;low&#x27; setting (which is where it will stay if you change the voltage to 250).</li>
            <li>I needed a compact dryer as I dont dry my hair often, but needed something tiny to fit in my luggage if needed.</li>
            <li>Good dual-voltage travel dryer, although a bit larger than expected, and a little weaker than an 1875 should be, IMHO.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get hot enough for me on both high and low controls.</li>
            <li>I like it because it has a &#x27;cool&#x27; setting and also because of the small size of this hair dryer it is easily portable and storable due to the folding handle and the retractable cord</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so loud, my ears are literally ringing after a few&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>seconds of use near the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it and got the old one out of the trash to compare side by side.</li>
            <li>It was seven months old.</li>
            <li>takes up nearly zero space &amp; works quite well</li>
            <li>but once I turned it on it was horribly loud.</li>
            <li>Have used it for nearly 1 year&lt;</li>
            <li>BTW, when I disassembled my old one to see if I could fix it</li>
            <li>It gets a little hot when on the high speed, but as long as I hold it several inches away from his head, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>The cool down button lets you customize your heat.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want a really powerful dryer but this one is not very powerful at all.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really get hot, was not impressed, it was cheap though.</li>
            <li>I had an older model for years that we traveled with and it finally wore out.</li>
            <li>I had a small travel hair dryer that finally broke after many years of use.</li>
            <li>The is slightly smaller than the older 1875 model</li>
            <li>High speed has lots of volume, but doesn&#x27;t seem as forceful as my last hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I can adjust the wind from low to high.</li>
            <li>The dryer only works on LO when at 250 voltage setting and there is a safety feature preventing it from from being switched to HIGH.</li>
            <li>Folds compactly and is powerful enough to dry hair.</li>
            <li>It does not dry my hair as fast as my smaller hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, light and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>so I can  fit it in a small draw in the bathroom,</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t very powerful, which was expected, however I could only use the low setting in Europe.</li>
            <li>small enough to travel with but big enough to be effective.</li>
            <li>and essentially it can only be used on the High setting now, which barely goes as fast as the Low setting used to.</li>
            <li>Conair 1875 Watt Folding Handle Compact Hair Dryer (1lb) - feels heavier than other 1lb dryers even if exact weight</li>
            <li>Small, compact, powerful!</li>
            <li>This hair dryer was purchased to replace an older version of the same model which has served well for several years.</li>
            <li>However only high power setting is possible in 240v.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t completely died yet (6 months later), but I&#x27;m not optimistic.</li>
            <li>I stripped the switch bare trying to turn the damn thing.</li>
            <li>I can barely see where the arrow is, which points to which voltage setting</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t gotten accustomed to using this blow dryer and it is somewhat heaver and larger than the old one I had for 25 years, it seems to be close.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks of use, something broke so that not all of the heating coils engage when on low heat, thus the air is fairly cool.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find a hairdryer that produces more than a weak stream of air, and this one certainly does!  </li>
            <li>This one was a great disappointment!</li>
            <li>I have seen hair dryers die before, but usually not after such limited use, and I haven&#x27;t seen them go out in smoke and flames before.</li>
            <li>Guess I should condier myself lucky, at least mine is working ...</li>
            <li>Small but powerful enough.</li>
            <li>Works well, but not as light and small as other travel dryers I have had.</li>
            <li>This dryer, which was advertised as a  &amp;#34;travel dryer,&amp;#34; was too heavy and too large to be practical for me to use as a travel dryer.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Ended up returning - it&#x27;s eh, just ok… weighs at 1lb… went for Babyliss Nano Titanium (more elegant and lighter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also has a safety GFCI breaker on the plug, which is just more of a testament to quality, but can also save your life if you&#x27;re using this somewhere that doesn&#x27;t have one.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it&#x27;s purple. :)</li>

            <li> According to the discription in the ad by Amazon, it was suppose to be light weight.</li>
            <li> Delivers on the quality promised, functional and light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more powerful than any blow dryer that I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> I know it is a good dryer, but I was just looking for something more lightweight and smaller.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. . .</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s great for travel because it folds in half and is very, very light in weight.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent little hairdryer!  </li>
            <li> Revlon Perfect Heat 1875W Fast Dry Compact Dryer (0.8lbs)</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer being excited about the compact size and the 1875W.  </li>
            <li> And this model was perfect for travel in that it&#x27;s small and dual voltage.</li>
            <li> Downside is that our hair gets sucked into it and that isn&#x27;t fun!</li>
            <li> Small, perfect for traveling or just for home.</li>
            <li> Good, handy little hair dryer that I can keep in a drawer at the bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li> It took forever to dry my hair and did not do a great job...</li>
            <li> less than ideal.</li>
            <li> great small hair dryer that I&#x27;m able to keep in the camper for when we travel about.</li>
            <li> it is quite good in shape and it is convenient to use as it is not so big.</li>
            <li> Had another one for many years and it very stopped working.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it so much I had to get 3 of them...</li>
            <li> Does a good basic job as a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> - good airflow but 1600w and looks a bit like standard hotel dryers</li>
            <li> Very compact the way I wanted it to be able to travel with it.  </li>
            <li> Tried and true.  </li>
            <li> I say spend the extra 30 bucks and get a good blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It works fine; more powerful than the older, heavier dryer I owned.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because it is compact and would have been great for travel if it wasn&#x27; for the other issue</li>
            <li> This dryer is compact and worked fine for the first two months.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Conair, you lost a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> It blows lots of air and dries your hair really quickly.  </li>
            <li> dryer drys her hair well and quickly.</li>
            <li> Luckily for me (sarcasm), mine is permanently at 125 volts.</li>
            <li> It would be more accurate to say that significant torque needs to be applied--very carefully so as not to break the plastic--to turn the switch.</li>
            <li> Quieter than most without hurting your ears with high pitched noise.  </li>
            <li> Great for small spaces, after gym, people that MUST travel with a dryer, and I imagine, people with easy to manage hair.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with overall quality.</li>
            <li> the high setting is perfect for those fast blow dry mornings.</li>
            <li> This one did a good job to dry my hair on the go.</li>
            <li> fast, efficient drying and easy to fold up to put away.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> But, overall, I am pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Honestly, how many people have black interiors?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great little hairdryer</li>
            <li> This is a great little hair dryer.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a great little hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little yet powerful hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pity, but otherwise good.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve own.</li>
            <li> Powerful and versatile.</li>
            <li> it is convenient to have  hot or cool wind by pressing the button or not.</li>
            <li> My mom liked it so much, I gave her my old one and just bought this one again for myself.  </li>
            <li> but I use it all the time because it&#x27;s powerful and lightweight.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This dryer  has good, strong air flow and is conveniently small for traveling.  </li>
            <li> Folds up nicely and is just as strong as an average hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> High heat seems to work fine still.</li>
            <li> Otherwise...just right.  </li>
            <li> The cool does nothing and the hot is too hot.  </li>
            <li> Its small, light and folds inside which is good for travelling purpose.</li>
            <li> The high speed will do when she gets older, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use or taking on trips!</li>
            <li> Two stars only because the hair dryer itself works fine and because it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Works very well and dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Hot but not too hot.  </li>
            <li> Only flaw- would like more focused air stream.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer especially for traveling.  </li>
            <li> Cricket Pro 7144 Professional Friction Free Dual Voltage Travel Hair Dryer,… (1lb)</li>
            <li> Just make sure you have enough space for the cord protector!</li>
            <li> when I first got it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Need a better guard on it, but hey for the price I just hope it lasts longer than our last one&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li> folding handle is very convenient and it is well worth its price.</li>
            <li> Pretty sturdy also.</li>
            <li> The directions say &amp;#34;flick&amp;#34; the switch to convert to 250 voltage, but be aware that you cannot just &amp;#34;flick&amp;#34; the switch.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also quieter than most the big ones I&#x27;ve tried and given away.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t terribly powerful but worked well enough to dry my hair and works better than most hotel dryers.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my small vanity, has the same power as my large dryer.  </li>
            <li> The low setting is not so loud but there really wasn&#x27;t much heat, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting very hot because it is the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting, but it was barely warm.  </li>
            <li> My last Conair 1875 finally gave out and I was delighted to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Babyliss Bambino Nano Titanium Ulta Lightweight Hair Dryer, 1000 Watt (0.6lb) - soooo light, 1000Watt but quiet powerful, almost like an 1875&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li> Even on the high setting, it dries my hair very quickly without blowing it all over the place into tangles or burning it up, like my old non-ionic hairdryer used to.</li>
            <li> - loud high pitch sound 1600Watts&lt;</li>
            <li> Easy to carry to pool and back.</li>
            <li> We own 4 of these as they will probably quit making them for something of less quality soon.</li>
            <li> The hi and low switch is not what the ProBaby was like and isn&#x27;t easy for me to use, but I&#x27;ll get accustomed to it.  </li>
            <li> As strong as a big dryer.</li>
            <li> The Conair is three times more powerful and dries my hair in less than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This dryer works fine, but was bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I bought this Conair to replace an older model that I had had for over 10 years!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very compact and lightweight, with a large nozzle for lots of airflow.  </li>
            <li> My previous Vagabond, which I loved and traveled with for many years, finally kicked the bucket and I replaced it today with the current model.</li>
            <li> Nice little hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Guess some things require a visit to a real store.</li>
            <li> It just doesnt seem to have as much power as it says it should.</li>
            <li> Very convenient, two options</li>
            <li> My girlfriend wants to exchange now.</li>
            <li> I really like mini hairdryers.</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and compact when it folds.</li>
            <li> it costs too much electricity!!!!&lt;br /&gt;i have to turn off all the lights when i use this product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;it is quite too mass</li>
            <li> I can take it any where I go, without taking up much room.  </li>
            <li> You could really damage your ear drums with this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> The fan is too powerfull and blows all the curls straight.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Compact and lightweight and works really well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ask for much from a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Compact and works very well.</li>
            <li> It works pretty much as well as my normal hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It works good but much larger than what I expected.  </li>
            <li> This dryer woks better than my regular dryer and is not too loud.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem like it is strong, but dries our long hair fast.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as powerful as other hair dryers I own with the same wattage.  </li>
            <li> I love that the settings are not too hot and the low speed is perfectly low, even for a toddler.</li>
            <li> It is small and powerful and I love the fold-up handle for travel in a suitcase.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for low maintenance, low budget, easy, this is it!</li>
            <li> Amazing for a small hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> not long enough for my wife to plug in and use while showering :-)</li>
            <li> I need a dryer that would dry my hair quickly!</li>
            <li> Wife needed it for our 4000 mile road trip on our Harley Ultra Classic.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I could no longer turn the hair dryer to high.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going on HIGH.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy &amp; completely functional dryer.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and compact yet powerful but quiet.  </li>
            <li> It is much better than others I have used (they did not last long).</li>
            <li> Has lasted about 6 months and feels just as solid and powerful as it did</li>
            <li> It still is much quieter than many she has used in the past.</li>
            <li> It is powerful so that it dries the hair (mine is short) in no time.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer not only because it is designed for travel but that it has better air flow than any other hair dryer my wife has bought.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is fine if you don&#x27;t need to change the voltage, but I bought it for international traveling, and it&#x27;s a big con for me that the switch doesn&#x27;t turn to 250 volts.</li>
            <li> I went on vacation in August, and purchased this hair dryer to fit in my 1 suitcase with all my other stuff.  </li>
            <li> so I needed a new one.</li>
            <li> Great little hair dryer that gives you what you need without being too huge or expensive.  </li>
            <li> My previous one was dying, and I&#x27;ve found most of the dryers today to be big and heavy, with smallish nozzles for a more concentrated flow for styling.  </li>
            <li> so far anyway!</li>
            <li> Of course, Amazon only allows refunds for the first month.</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do that!</li>
            <li> This is that same model as my last one, only with half-again more power.</li>
            <li> and I am able to dry my long hair within minutes!</li>
            <li> Great little dryer, small, compacted, reliable and drys my hair.</li>
            <li> The low speed mode is too slow,the high speed mode is too fast...</li>
            <li> There are only 2 settings cool and hot for heat both too extreme for me.  </li>
            <li> Most have lasted for a couple of years with daily use before they start slowing down.</li>
            <li> this little gadget is super powerful, even on the &#x27;low&#x27; setting (which is where it will stay if you change the voltage to 250).</li>
            <li> I needed a compact dryer as I dont dry my hair often, but needed something tiny to fit in my luggage if needed.</li>
            <li> Good dual-voltage travel dryer, although a bit larger than expected, and a little weaker than an 1875 should be, IMHO.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get hot enough for me on both high and low controls.</li>
            <li> I like it because it has a &#x27;cool&#x27; setting and also because of the small size of this hair dryer it is easily portable and storable due to the folding handle and the retractable cord</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so loud, my ears are literally ringing after a few&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> seconds of use near the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it and got the old one out of the trash to compare side by side.</li>
            <li> It was seven months old.</li>
            <li> takes up nearly zero space &amp; works quite well</li>
            <li> but once I turned it on it was horribly loud.</li>
            <li> Have used it for nearly 1 year&lt;</li>
            <li> BTW, when I disassembled my old one to see if I could fix it</li>
            <li> It gets a little hot when on the high speed, but as long as I hold it several inches away from his head, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> The cool down button lets you customize your heat.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want a really powerful dryer but this one is not very powerful at all.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really get hot, was not impressed, it was cheap though.</li>
            <li> I had an older model for years that we traveled with and it finally wore out.</li>
            <li> I had a small travel hair dryer that finally broke after many years of use.</li>
            <li> The is slightly smaller than the older 1875 model</li>
            <li> High speed has lots of volume, but doesn&#x27;t seem as forceful as my last hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I can adjust the wind from low to high.</li>
            <li> The dryer only works on LO when at 250 voltage setting and there is a safety feature preventing it from from being switched to HIGH.</li>
            <li> Folds compactly and is powerful enough to dry hair.</li>
            <li> It does not dry my hair as fast as my smaller hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, light and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> so I can  fit it in a small draw in the bathroom,</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t very powerful, which was expected, however I could only use the low setting in Europe.</li>
            <li> small enough to travel with but big enough to be effective.</li>
            <li> and essentially it can only be used on the High setting now, which barely goes as fast as the Low setting used to.</li>
            <li> Conair 1875 Watt Folding Handle Compact Hair Dryer (1lb) - feels heavier than other 1lb dryers even if exact weight</li>
            <li> Small, compact, powerful!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was purchased to replace an older version of the same model which has served well for several years.</li>
            <li> However only high power setting is possible in 240v.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t completely died yet (6 months later), but I&#x27;m not optimistic.</li>
            <li> I stripped the switch bare trying to turn the damn thing.</li>
            <li> I can barely see where the arrow is, which points to which voltage setting</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten accustomed to using this blow dryer and it is somewhat heaver and larger than the old one I had for 25 years, it seems to be close.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, something broke so that not all of the heating coils engage when on low heat, thus the air is fairly cool.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a hairdryer that produces more than a weak stream of air, and this one certainly does!  </li>
            <li> This one was a great disappointment!</li>
            <li> I have seen hair dryers die before, but usually not after such limited use, and I haven&#x27;t seen them go out in smoke and flames before.</li>
            <li> Guess I should condier myself lucky, at least mine is working ...</li>
            <li> Small but powerful enough.</li>
            <li> Works well, but not as light and small as other travel dryers I have had.</li>
            <li> This dryer, which was advertised as a  &amp;#34;travel dryer,&amp;#34; was too heavy and too large to be practical for me to use as a travel dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to put in a drawer but powerful enough to (quickly) dry my hair when I am in a hurry</li>
            <li> I do have several other dryers that I end up giving away or trash them they are way to big and heavy, so this is just right</li>
            <li> I was a little bummed that purple was no longer a color option (strange, since it is in the other Conair models), but was extremely upset to discover that the power cord is now a full six inches shorter!</li>
            <li> A waste of money, since I like drying my hair on High.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that generally takes 15 minutes to dry with my Revlon 1875.  </li>
            <li> The cord is maybe 4 feet long, way to short for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was on a recent trip with my daughter who has very long hair.  </li>
            <li> Probably not good for focused air needed for blow-drying into a &#x27;do&#x27;, but just right when all I need is to dry it and pull it back into a braid.</li>
            <li> and she used it on her short hair and to dry her Yorkie.  </li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have long thick hair and looking for a jet stream of hot air.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at the power of this little hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This one is a little noisier than her old one, but is by no means a problem noise-wise.</li>
            <li> Hope it has a long life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s twice as heavy as my old dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was larger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> It does the trick on my long hair</li>
            <li> for the size of the dryer, it&#x27;s quite heavy and there is no attachment for the end of the dryer to direct flow.  </li>
            <li> so my arms don&#x27;t get worn out drying my long hair.</li>
            <li> The noise from the dryer is not loud.</li>
            <li> Then when I turned it on it made a strange humming noise, started smoking, and there were flames firing up inside the unit.</li>
            <li> They take forever if you just want to blow your long hair dry.  </li>
            <li> Comparing this to other travel dryers… was going to use for travel with 220v where typically only &amp;#34;low heat&amp;#34; can be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I leave the setting set for European voltage and just use it for foreign travel.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my craft room to help glue dry.  </li>
            <li> and it does dry the hair.</li>
            <li> Used it a few times only, and got a different model because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know it wasn&#x27;t much money, but they shouldn&#x27;t build them to fail in such a short time!</li>
            <li> They last as long as any other I&#x27;ve had and take up so much less room.</li>
            <li> The new model is even more sturdy but the weak link is the handle that pivots, but the for the price how can you go wrong!</li>
            <li> This makes a huge impact on how far from the outlet I can stand while drying my hair and is incredibly annoying.</li>
            <li> Retractable cord is starting to not retract after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer in July for a 2 week trip and since have only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> I had expected a cordless dryer.....</li>
            <li> It will not easily convert back and forth for purposes of EU to US travel as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that big a deal, but not easy either.</li>
            <li> I had even used it a few times in place of my every day Conair dryer and had no major complaints.</li>
            <li> It is small &amp; quiet..</li>
            <li> 0.6lb - babyliss nano titanium)&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;feels heavier than other 1lb dryers</li>
            <li> We bought 2 of them and they both died within a couple weeks of each other.  </li>
            <li> But I was disappointed when it arrived, because it weighed more it was discribed.</li>
            <li> I never had any issue with Conair Products in past and I will keep on buying it in future.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t concentrate the air flow, just a very wide</li>
            <li> Also, the wide opening on the blower end makes it harder to focus on a particular area making it difficult to control what section of hair is styled and what&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> that you turn to change voltage is down right impossible for an average female to operate.</li>
            <li> It collapses small enough and is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the newer model has a much, much longer stiff cord protector extending down from the wall plug - it&#x27;s actually too long, and I&#x27;m unable to plug this newer model into the only convenient electrical outlet.</li>
            <li> It lasted less than 2 months and failed.&lt;br /&gt;After using Conair for years, I trusted the brand.</li>
            <li> However, Conair is obviously experiencing serious quality issues in their manufacturing.</li>
            <li> It is less tiring to hold it since I have arthritis in my fingers.</li>
            <li> Stylist Travel Dryer, Black (1lb) -</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was to replace my wife&#x27;s previous Conair travel hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Duplicate of my previous dryer--love it.</li>
            <li> but within a couple of months or less it stopped blowing altogether.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it less than a couple of months and it has about half of the power of air coming out of it.</li>
            <li> I only used it to dry my bangs which took about five painful minutes since I could barely stand the noise.  </li>
            <li> Foldable and takes up little space in a suitcase.</li>
            <li> This little dryer does the trick.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> returned - too bulky and heavy</li>
            <li> I had trouble at home turning the button with a coin as recommended by the tech support people when I called for assistance.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer really dried out my hair..</li>
            <li> I do use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Too heavy.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It folds in half for maximum storage!  </li>
            <li> It dried my hair in no time and is a cinch to pack, as it is small and has a folding handle.</li>
            <li> I had one just like it in the past.</li>
            <li> I wanted something small</li>
            <li> I took it to my daughters house this past weekend</li>
            <li> Small and compact but does what it was made for.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Conair but this product has given me doubts.</li>
            <li> Lots of power in a small package.  </li>
            <li> In the past, the dryers I have purchased lasted at least a couple of years.  </li>
            <li> likes--or at least my fuzzy cat does</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a Conair that we had used for at least 15 years.</li>
            <li> After that the motor started going really slowly</li>
            <li> Also, I took this to Europe, since it&#x27;s adaptable to both 125 and 250 volts, and it was extremely difficult to change the setting from one to the other.</li>
            <li> The one supplied by the resort was SO SLOW!</li>
            <li> I might not win this battle.</li>
            <li> Maybe mine was faulty, but I was definitely not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> After approximately 4,300 uses the mechanical switch broke</li>
            <li> Terrible hair dryer, it will stop working after 20 seconds of using it in high mode.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dead, Jim. :-(</li>
            <li> but unfortunately the Fantasy did not.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want my hairdryer demanding unnecessary attention in my decor!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to turn the switch to 250 volts.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great.  Compact.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really get hot, was not impressed, it was cheap though.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want a really powerful dryer but this one is not very powerful at all.</li>
            <li> Hot but not too hot.  Lightweight.  Compact.  Only flaw- would like more focused air stream.  Otherwise...just right.  Hope it has a long life.</li>
            <li> This dryer, which was advertised as a  &amp;#34;travel dryer,&amp;#34; was too heavy and too large to be practical for me to use as a travel dryer. I returned it for a refund. I did not even try to use it. I have one that serves me well at home, so I know it is a good dryer, but I was just looking for something more lightweight and smaller.</li>
            <li> Works great, really handy and portable.  Arrived quickly.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Guess I should condier myself lucky, at least mine is working ... so far anyway! A lot bigger than I had hoped it would be. High speed has lots of volume, but doesn&#x27;t seem as forceful as my last hair dryer. Guess some things require a visit to a real store. Otherwise, it&#x27;s okay. Just hope it stays working.</li>
            <li> I bought this for traveling and it works ok. It just doesnt seem to have as much power as it says it should.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a very good price. I&#x27;ve waited a while to publish this review to make sure that it was dependable. So far, so good. . .</li>
            <li> The plug to the hairdry melted within 2 months of use. Lucky it didn&#x27;t catch on fire!</li>
            <li> Great packaging and quick shipping. I love that the settings are not too hot and the low speed is perfectly low, even for a toddler. The high speed will do when she gets older, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> Very convenient, two options</li>
            <li> Easy to carry to pool and back. Folds compactly and is powerful enough to dry hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  It folds in half for maximum storage!  Easy to use and I am able to dry my long hair within minutes!</li>
            <li> Could never get the wattage adjusted -- cracked the handle before it was used.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this again. I had an older model for years that we traveled with and it finally wore out.</li>
            <li> Small but powerful enough. Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> This foldable blow dryer packs well in addition to packing a punch. Good power and I like the color. My girlfriend wants to exchange now. I might not win this battle.</li>
            <li> Very good value hair dryer if you are on a budget. Very compact and light weight, good for traveling or stay at home use. It folds for convenient storage.</li>
            <li> it is quite good in shape and it is convenient to use as it is not so big. the power of it is really nice</li>
            <li> Works well. Folds easily. Very handy for travel. Had another one for many years and it very stopped working. (Was stolen from our van during a cross country trip.)</li>
            <li> Works well, but not as light and small as other travel dryers I have had.</li>
            <li> works well, good ppwer, nice size for travel. would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and compact yet powerful but quiet.  This is the best ever hairdryer.  Great for everyday use or taking on trips!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy &amp; completely functional dryer. An excellent value. Arrived quickly &amp; in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> The dual-voltage \\&quot;switch\\&quot; looks like a screw, but the guide says I flick it to 250 so that I can plug it in supplies over 125. I flick and turn with all my might and after breaking two fingernails and slicing the plastic \\&quot;switch\\&quot; with a screwdriver, I imagined it turn just a wee bit. I gave up on it and now I need to go buy an AC converter..</li>
            <li> Great folding hair dryer for a great price.  I needed a hair dryer to take on the Fantasy carnival cruise.  The Glory had a hair dryer in the drawer but unfortunately the Fantasy did not.  It is going on another cruise this Fall on the same Fantasy.</li>
            <li> I really like mini hairdryers. This one is sturdy and cute! :)  I have two wishes though - one that we could pick the color that we get and two, that the companies making the hairdryers would give them a white cord. Honestly, how many people have black interiors? I don&#x27;t want my hairdryer demanding unnecessary attention in my decor! But, overall, I am pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Great price. compact size.</li>
            <li> I had a small travel hair dryer that finally broke after many years of use. i looked on line for a similar one but the Conair was the only one that folded so I though it might be the same size. it was not. Great for home but too large for travel.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as powerful as other hair dryers I own with the same wattage.  But it does the job.</li>
            <li> This little hair dryer is great! I had one just like it in the past. It lasted 20 years. It fits perfectly in my suit case, has just the right amount of power and heat. It is much better than others I have used (they did not last long). It is well constructed too. A good purchase. I had looked every where for a replacement and had to settle for inferior products. I am really happy Amazon had it. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at the power of this little hair dryer. It works pretty much as well as my normal hair dryer. It&#x27;s a good size too; small enough to travel with but big enough to be effective.</li>
            <li> This is so nice! I can adjust the wind from low to high. Nice for travelers</li>
            <li> I have pixie hair and this is perfect for daily styling.</li>
            <li> The low speed mode is too slow,the high speed mode is too fast... but it is good!</li>
            <li> Used it a few times only, and got a different model because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The cord is maybe 4 feet long, way to short for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s so loud, my ears are literally ringing after a few&lt;br /&gt;  seconds of use near the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It doesn&#x27;t concentrate the air flow, just a very wide blow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It&#x27;s twice as heavy as my old dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Retractable cord is starting to not retract after a few uses.</li>
            <li> My previous Vagabond, which I loved and traveled with for many years, finally kicked the bucket and I replaced it today with the current model. I was a little bummed that purple was no longer a color option (strange, since it is in the other Conair models), but was extremely upset to discover that the power cord is now a full six inches shorter! I couldn&#x27;t believe it and got the old one out of the trash to compare side by side. Shorter. By a lot. This makes a huge impact on how far from the outlet I can stand while drying my hair and is incredibly annoying. Would have happily paid more for the longer cord. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worked for a while and then started tripping the GFCI. This morning it blew up in my hand as I was using it. It was seven months old.</li>
            <li> Its is just what i wanted. Love it.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, ideal for my purposes if it hadn&#x27;t broken.    After a few weeks of use, something broke so that not all of the heating coils engage when on low heat, thus the air is fairly cool. High heat seems to work fine still. It&#x27;s a pity, but otherwise good.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer being excited about the compact size and the 1875W.  In using it for the last couple of months, the force of air flow has weakened substantially to the point where I need to purchase another dryer. My obvious choice will NOT be this one.  It appears to have a plastic fan which may limit its longevity.  Also, the wide opening on the blower end makes it harder to focus on a particular area making it difficult to control what section of hair is styled and what&#x27;s not. In the past, the dryers I have purchased lasted at least a couple of years.  This one was a great disappointment!</li>
            <li> This is a great little yet powerful hair dryer.  I went to Mexico in December 2014 and did not have this yet. The one supplied by the resort was SO SLOW! It took forever to dry my hair and did not do a great job...so I bought this when I knew I&#x27;d be away for 2 weeks in February and was very pleased. It&#x27;s very light, easy to handle and very powerful. It dried my hair in no time and is a cinch to pack, as it is small and has a folding handle. Shipment was fast and efficient. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Folds nicely. Very nice for travel.no matter what the voltage. Just be sure to select the correct voltage before plugging it in. (Was set for 110 when we received it since it was shipped to a USA address).</li>
            <li> This is absolutely fabulous! Very lightweight and compact when it folds. Perfect for travel. Cheaper than the retail stores. Great product for the money...an awesome color too!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my craft room to help glue dry.  I wanted something small so it was easy to store.  It is the perfect size and has two speeds which makes it great when working on crafts.  I do wish it had hook or something from which I could hang it.  it arrived on time in good packaging.  I would even consider buying another for when we travel because of it size and weight.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve own. I loved the first and used it for years for travel and the gym. It&#x27;s small, light and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It was larger than I expected.  I wanted a smaller size to conserve space and weight for traveling.  Therefore, I returned it.</li>
            <li> A great hair dryer for home or travel. Original one lasted many years, so bought another. Powerful and versatile. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this one for several times. Folds nice for travel, blowing noise doesn&#x27;t hurt my ears. I use it everyday. Most have lasted for a couple of years with daily use before they start slowing down. Good heat temperature, not too hot.</li>
            <li> I went on vacation in August, and purchased this hair dryer to fit in my 1 suitcase with all my other stuff.  It workds great -- drying my hair in good time.</li>
            <li> it costs too much electricity!!!!&lt;br /&gt;i have to turn off all the lights when i use this product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;it is quite too mass</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer for traveling, or for the gym, or for someone who doesn&#x27;t have a large space for storage</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd hair dryer....I LOVE it so much I had to get 3 of them... One for the kids &amp; one for me &amp; an extra just in case! It is small &amp; quiet..I can take it any where I go, without taking up much room.  I do recommend this hair dryer...you will never go back to those big, noisy ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I bought this on sale.This is very handy and it is dual voltage.  However only high power setting is possible in 240v.</li>
            <li> Good, handy little hair dryer that I can keep in a drawer at the bathroom sink.  I&#x27;m a head shaver so I only needed this for my son (occasionally) and for guests.  Works great.</li>
            <li> works great, and has a cool button function. I needed a compact dryer as I dont dry my hair often, but needed something tiny to fit in my luggage if needed.</li>
            <li> Even though it is travel size, I use it as my every day hairdryer. I love it! It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer especially for traveling.  It is easy to throw in the suit case.  I took it to my daughters house this past weekend and then I did not have to bother her to use hers. Works great.</li>
            <li> A great item to have when traveling to Europe because of its dual voltage capability . Easy to use. Convenient to carry.</li>
            <li> It works good but much larger than what I expected.  I do like the color and it does dry the hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs!</li>
            <li> the delivery is fast with good wrap. it works well. it is convenient to have  hot or cool wind by pressing the button or not. I like it</li>
            <li> Good size for travel, just what I ordered, and it arrived in the time promised.</li>
            <li> great small hair dryer that I&#x27;m able to keep in the camper for when we travel about. takes up nearly zero space &amp; works quite well</li>
            <li> Very happy with this hair dryer</li>
            <li> This unit is very compact, easy to pack and travel, generates a good level of heat, very quickly.  A Very handy Item!</li>
            <li> Does a good basic job as a hair dryer.  No frills.  I like that it folds, and the biggest thing for me is that it will accept 110 and 220V power, which is necessary for some overseas travel.</li>
            <li> This is my second one of these.  My mom liked it so much, I gave her my old one and just bought this one again for myself.  It does the trick on my long hair and she used it on her short hair and to dry her Yorkie.  Nice little hair dryer.</li>
            <li> likes--or at least my fuzzy cat does</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this through Amazon.com but bought it from Target today and will return it tomorrow.  I like it because it has a &#x27;cool&#x27; setting and also because of the small size of this hair dryer it is easily portable and storable due to the folding handle and the retractable cord but once I turned it on it was horribly loud. The low setting is not so loud but there really wasn&#x27;t much heat, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting very hot because it is the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting, but it was barely warm.  And the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting was like a million decibels.  I only used it to dry my bangs which took about five painful minutes since I could barely stand the noise.  If I had to use it again I would only use it with earplugs.  You could really damage your ear drums with this hairdryer. Also, the air blew a bit diffusely, not a focused stream.  I advise others to not even consider this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> My last Conair 1875 finally gave out and I was delighted to find it on Amazon. It is small and powerful and I love the fold-up handle for travel in a suitcase.</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery</li>
            <li> Thought it was going to be smaller</li>
            <li> Very nice just as described!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this model hairdryer for years. One function quit working, so I bought a replacement from a department store. It lasted 2-3 months (and the store wouldn&#x27;t take it back), so I ordered the same model from Amazon. It lasted less than 2 months and failed.&lt;br /&gt;After using Conair for years, I trusted the brand. And this model was perfect for travel in that it&#x27;s small and dual voltage. However, Conair is obviously experiencing serious quality issues in their manufacturing. Conair, you lost a loyal customer. I got burned not just once, but twice.</li>
            <li> I chose this hairdryer because it is light in weight. It is less tiring to hold it since I have arthritis in my fingers. It works fine; more powerful than the older, heavier dryer I owned.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer not only because it is designed for travel but that it has better air flow than any other hair dryer my wife has bought. These things are disposable and at this price that makes that part more than acceptable.</li>
            <li> looking for something smaller than this to travel with.</li>
            <li> Even on the high setting, it dries my hair very quickly without blowing it all over the place into tangles or burning it up, like my old non-ionic hairdryer used to. I&#x27;ll probably take it while traveling even though all the hotels I stay at offer hairdryers. Probably not good for focused air needed for blow-drying into a &#x27;do&#x27;, but just right when all I need is to dry it and pull it back into a braid.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I couldn&#x27;t find one in the store to replace mine that I&#x27;ve loved for many years.  It&#x27;s just as great as the last one. Dries great and is really compact.  I took the last one to Europe and didn&#x27;t have any problems using it there.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Perfect size, workded as expected.</li>
            <li> Comparing this to other travel dryers… was going to use for travel with 220v where typically only &amp;#34;low heat&amp;#34; can be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ended up returning - it&#x27;s eh, just ok… weighs at 1lb… went for Babyliss Nano Titanium (more elegant and lighter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;foldable&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;1lb (found others at 0.6lb - babyliss nano titanium)&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;powerful heat, although Vidal Sassoon Vsdr5523 1875w had lower hum sound&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;1lb (found others at 0.6lb - babyliss nano titanium)&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;feels heavier than other 1lb dryers&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;basic design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the products tested… ended up keeping Babyliss.  See specific Pros/Cons with each review but here&#x27;s the highlight:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Cricket Pro 7144 Professional Friction Free Dual Voltage Travel Hair Dryer,… (1lb) - loud high pitch sound 1600Watts&lt;br /&gt;2.  Vidal Sassoon Vsdr5523 1875w Stylist Travel Dryer, Black (1lb) - great but found Babyliss much lighter&lt;br /&gt;3.  Conair 1875 Watt Folding Handle Compact Hair Dryer (1lb) - feels heavier than other 1lb dryers even if exact weight&lt;br /&gt;4.  Babyliss Bambino Nano Titanium Ulta Lightweight Hair Dryer, 1000 Watt (0.6lb) - soooo light, 1000Watt but quiet powerful, almost like an 1875&lt;br /&gt;5.  Revlon Perfect Heat 1875W Fast Dry Compact Dryer (0.8lbs) - looks elegant, powerful, but fingers could easily slip fancy roundish low/off/high switch&lt;br /&gt;6.  Vidal Sasson VS784 1875W Travel Dryer (0.8lbs) - good, looks like Revlon but better grip on switch to low/high/off&lt;br /&gt;7.  Andis Micro Turbo 1600 Watt Dual Voltage Hair Dryer - White (33805) (0.8lbs) - good airflow but 1600w and looks a bit like standard hotel dryers</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was purchased to replace an older version of the same model which has served well for several years. Unfortunately, the newer model has a much, much longer stiff cord protector extending down from the wall plug - it&#x27;s actually too long, and I&#x27;m unable to plug this newer model into the only convenient electrical outlet. Consequently, this one will serve as a travel hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great little hairdryer and I would highly recommend it. Just make sure you have enough space for the cord protector!</li>
            <li> This dryer is compact and worked fine for the first two months. After that the motor started going really slowly and essentially it can only be used on the High setting now, which barely goes as fast as the Low setting used to. Of course, Amazon only allows refunds for the first month. A waste of money, since I like drying my hair on High. It hasn&#x27;t completely died yet (6 months later), but I&#x27;m not optimistic. Also, I took this to Europe, since it&#x27;s adaptable to both 125 and 250 volts, and it was extremely difficult to change the setting from one to the other. When I turned it on in England, after changing the voltage indicator, it shorted out our US/UK plug adapter and didn&#x27;t work at all. So I&#x27;m not convinced that it actually does change between voltages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 12/18/14: It&#x27;s dead, Jim. :-(</li>
            <li> Works great, very compact.</li>
            <li> for the size of the dryer, it&#x27;s quite heavy and there is no attachment for the end of the dryer to direct flow.  less than ideal.</li>
            <li> Small and compact but does what it was made for. Works very well and dries hair quickly. Foldable and takes up little space in a suitcase. Very pleased with overall quality.</li>
            <li> Small, compact, powerful!</li>
            <li> I bought this Conair to replace an older model that I had had for over 10 years! The is slightly smaller than the older 1875 model but I prefer that. The folding arm functions well and the high setting is perfect for those fast blow dry mornings.</li>
            <li> It does not dry my hair as fast as my smaller hair dryer.  It has enough heat but the force of the blower is insufficient.</li>
            <li> Conair 124TL Folding Handle 1875-Watt Dryer great item, Fast drying. great colors. I do have several other dryers that I end up giving away or trash them they are way to big and heavy, so this is just right</li>
            <li> I love that this is dual voltage and foldable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer in July for a 2 week trip and since have only used it a few times. It was compact and easy to travel with. It isn&#x27;t terribly powerful but worked well enough to dry my hair and works better than most hotel dryers. I had even used it a few times in place of my every day Conair dryer and had no major complaints. Until I used it for a recent trip and when I turned it on it puttered, then started smoking and sparking. I have seen hair dryers die before, but usually not after such limited use, and I haven&#x27;t seen them go out in smoke and flames before. I usually buy Conair but this product has given me doubts.</li>
            <li> this little gadget is super powerful, even on the &#x27;low&#x27; setting (which is where it will stay if you change the voltage to 250). and its compact size, which gets even more compact when you fold it in, is wonderful for carrying around in your bag. all in all i am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I went on a trip where I wasn&#x27;t sure there would be hair dryers.  This one did a good job to dry my hair on the go.</li>
            <li> Amazing for a small hair dryer.  Folds up nicely and is just as strong as an average hair dryer.  Has lasted about 6 months and feels just as solid and powerful as it did when I first got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also has a safety GFCI breaker on the plug, which is just more of a testament to quality, but can also save your life if you&#x27;re using this somewhere that doesn&#x27;t have one.</li>
            <li> I like it so I can  fit it in a small draw in the bathroom, if it didn&#x27;t fold I couldn&#x27;t put it in draw.</li>
            <li> Nice Travel Hair Dryer</li>
            <li> Basic hairdryer that folds.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like it is strong, but dries our long hair fast.  Downside is that our hair gets sucked into it and that isn&#x27;t fun! Need a better guard on it, but hey for the price I just hope it lasts longer than our last one&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother buying this brand.  We bought 2 of them and they both died within a couple weeks of each other.  I wish someone made something that lasted longer than 6 months! I know it wasn&#x27;t much money, but they shouldn&#x27;t build them to fail in such a short time!</li>
            <li> returned - too bulky and heavy</li>
            <li> Perfect to keep in the travel trailer. Wife hasn&#x27;t used it yet, but soon.</li>
            <li> This is just like the one I have. According to the discription in the ad by Amazon, it was suppose to be light weight. But I was disappointed when it arrived, because it weighed more it was discribed.</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling and going on cruises - compact and easy to take along!</li>
            <li> Great for traveling overseas. It folds great into luggage. Just remember to switch it to currency when overseas.</li>
            <li> There are only 2 settings cool and hot for heat both too extreme for me.  The cool does nothing and the hot is too hot.  The fan is too powerfull and blows all the curls straight.</li>
            <li> when I flipped to 220 I could no longer turn the hair dryer to high. and now can&#x27;t flip back to 110.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer at a great price and I really like it. It has a lot of power and it folds easily for when I travel. Oh, and it&#x27;s purple. :)</li>
            <li> Pro: The hair dryer worked well in Greece and Turkey. The size and power are great.     Con: The screw head like \\&quot;button\\&quot; that you turn to change voltage is down right impossible for an average female to operate. I had trouble at home turning the button with a coin as recommended by the tech support people when I called for assistance. I finally had to use a screw driver! Now I leave the setting set for European voltage and just use it for foreign travel.</li>
            <li> Great dryer with good fan speeds.  Quieter than most without hurting your ears with high pitched noise.  The cool down button lets you customize your heat. Folds up for easy packing. We own 4 of these as they will probably quit making them for something of less quality soon.</li>
            <li> The product is good. Working Properly, the variable speed switch is defective. It&#x27;s not going on HIGH. Please Help !!!</li>
            <li> Great little hair dryer that gives you what you need without being too huge or expensive.  Great for small spaces, after gym, people that MUST travel with a dryer, and I imagine, people with easy to manage hair.  This is definitely a no-frills, standard, and simple dryer.  If you&#x27;re looking for low maintenance, low budget, easy, this is it!</li>
            <li> Wife needed it for our 4000 mile road trip on our Harley Ultra Classic. Good compact fit. Works great.</li>
            <li> It works great, I love the color, compact style. Easy to work and handle. It will travel nicely as well.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent little hairdryer!  It is hard to find a hairdryer that produces more than a weak stream of air, and this one certainly does!  It blows lots of air and dries your hair really quickly.  I&#x27;ve had mine for about a year, and it is still going strong.  I just bought my mother one for her birthday (she loves it), as well as a second one for myself for travel.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Very compact the way I wanted it to be able to travel with it.  Great price.</li>
            <li> I had expected a cordless dryer.....that is what I had asked for. I returned the product</li>
            <li> I bought this with the sole purpose of shrink wrapping my windows in the winter. this doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do that!</li>
            <li> I bought it for traveling but I use it all the time because it&#x27;s powerful and lightweight. Definitely recommend the hair dryer and the seller.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t very powerful, which was expected, however I could only use the low setting in Europe. By the end of my trip I ended up just letting my hair air-dry.</li>
            <li> Have used it for nearly 1 year&lt;br /&gt;The folding handle is very convenient and it is well worth its price.</li>
            <li> Works well. Perfect for travel. Compact, light weight, as good as any full size dryer. Pretty sturdy also. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Came in a timely manner.  Nice and travel size</li>
            <li> We needed a hair dryer for my baby after getting out of the tub. This little dryer does the trick. It gets a little hot when on the high speed, but as long as I hold it several inches away from his head, it&#x27;s fine. Can&#x27;t beat the price and the size, it fits nicely in a top drawer when we have guests.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. Very nice and not heavy</li>
            <li> Took my husband and 3 different screwdrivers to &amp;quot;flip&amp;quot; the voltage switch to 250 from 125. It is definitely not a &amp;quot;flip of a switch,&amp;quot; as the directions state.  It would be more accurate to say that significant torque needs to be applied--very carefully so as not to break the plastic--to turn the switch. The dryer only works on LO when at 250 voltage setting and there is a safety feature preventing it from from being switched to HIGH. That feature is good. It will not easily convert back and forth for purposes of EU to US travel as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Excellent, practical, very good product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this travel hair dryer. Compact and lightweight and works really well.</li>
            <li> Tried and true.  My last Conair lasted 15 years.  I was so glad to see the style was still available.  Compact, but has power.</li>
            <li> Broke after 2 uses. But It couldnt be returned because I was in a different country</li>
            <li> Great dryer. Nice and light weight so my arms don&#x27;t get worn out drying my long hair. Great power too.</li>
            <li> Small, perfect for traveling or just for home. My grandmother loved this hair dryer and the price is great. We are happy!</li>
            <li> I use this dryer to help speed along my paintings. It works well for that purpose. I like the compact size, it is easy to store with my art supplies.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer really dried out my hair..I say spend the extra 30 bucks and get a good blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Great little dryer, small, compacted, reliable and drys my hair. I dont think there is much more to say about this. I do use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to put in a drawer but powerful enough to (quickly) dry my hair when I am in a hurry</li>
            <li> This is a great little hair dryer. I&#x27;m on my third one now. They last as long as any other I&#x27;ve had and take up so much less room. And they&#x27;re ideal for travel.</li>
            <li> The dryer is not much smaller than my regular dryer.  The directions say &amp;#34;flick&amp;#34; the switch to convert to 250 voltage, but be aware that you cannot just &amp;#34;flick&amp;#34; the switch.  You either need to use a coin or a tool.  It&#x27;s not that big a deal, but not easy either.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was to replace my wife&#x27;s previous Conair travel hair dryer. This one is a little noisier than her old one, but is by no means a problem noise-wise. It still is much quieter than many she has used in the past.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer drys her hair well and quickly. Plus it was a great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> for the price and  size of item works ok.</li>
            <li> Good product. Took over a week to ship.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife before leaving on vacation. It works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-light weight&lt;br /&gt;-dries hair quickly&lt;br /&gt;-folds up for easy packing in the luggage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Cord not long enough for my wife to plug in and use while showering :-)</li>
            <li> Terrible hair dryer, it will stop working after 20 seconds of using it in high mode. I gave it two stars because it is compact and would have been great for travel if it wasn&#x27; for the other issue</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good travel dryer and this one is perfect. I would suggest anyone to buy it. I took it internationally and worked like a charm the entire trip.</li>
            <li> I was on a recent trip with my daughter who has very long hair.  She coveted my travel hairdryer, so I bought her one.  It&#x27;s lightweight and powerful - the most important features of a travel hair dryer.  I don&#x27;t like to take my chances with hotel dryers, so I pack this one wherever I go.</li>
            <li> I love conair products. I never had any issue with Conair Products in past and I will keep on buying it in future. I bought this one for my mom because of its size. Its small, light and folds inside which is good for travelling purpose. My mom loved the size and color. The noise from the dryer is not loud.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get hot enough for me on both high and low controls. I need a dryer that would dry my hair quickly!</li>
            <li> Duplicate of my previous dryer--love it.</li>
            <li> Delivers on the quality promised, functional and light.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these and at first it had really good forceful air and did great but within a couple of months or less it stopped blowing altogether. So, I thought maybe I had gotten hair or something in it and I got another one. I&#x27;ve had it less than a couple of months and it has about half of the power of air coming out of it. What a bummer! Its going in the trash. I&#x27;ll have to find one that lasts longer.</li>
            <li> BEST COMPACT HAIRDRYER I&#x27;VE EVER OWNED.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with short hair, so the air flow of this hair dryer is perfect.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have long thick hair and looking for a jet stream of hot air.</li>
            <li> Bought for trip but tried out before hand to make sure that it would work on my trip. This dryer woks better than my regular dryer and is not too loud.  It collapses small enough and is not too heavy. Also, my daughter loves the color.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is fine if you don&#x27;t need to change the voltage, but I bought it for international traveling, and it&#x27;s a big con for me that the switch doesn&#x27;t turn to 250 volts. It looks as though it can easily turn with a coin. Do not be fooled. It&#x27;s impossible to turn the switch to 250 volts. I stripped the switch bare trying to turn the damn thing. I can barely see where the arrow is, which points to which voltage setting it&#x27;s at. Luckily for me (sarcasm), mine is permanently at 125 volts. Maybe mine was faulty, but I was definitely not happy with this product. Would not recommend to a friend. Two stars only because the hair dryer itself works fine and because it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t style my hair with a dryer, I just blow it for volume, then use the curling iron if I&#x27;m in the mood.  My previous one was dying, and I&#x27;ve found most of the dryers today to be big and heavy, with smallish nozzles for a more concentrated flow for styling.  They take forever if you just want to blow your long hair dry.  This is that same model as my last one, only with half-again more power. And it&#x27;s very compact and lightweight, with a large nozzle for lots of airflow.  It&#x27;s also quieter than most the big ones I&#x27;ve tried and given away.  Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it! Very cute and compact. In love with the color.</li>
            <li> We bought this to have an additional one in case the one we are using breaks. It is powerful so that it dries the hair (mine is short) in no time.</li>
            <li> Bought for a friend! She says it is a very nice dryer! Loves it!</li>
            <li> works great and folds, great for travel and for the gym. My only complaint is that the cord could be just a little bit longer, I feel like I am stuck at the wall, but other than that a great little hair dryer.</li>
            <li> As strong as a big dryer. This is my 2nd one. The old one still works great. And I&#x27;ve had it 8 years! Perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ask for much from a blow dryer. Compact size and reliability. I had an identical model branded with a different name that lasted me 12 years. After approximately 4,300 uses the mechanical switch broke so I needed a new one. Can&#x27;t beat the price. BTW, when I disassembled my old one to see if I could fix it I noticed the 120/240 volt &amp;#34;switch&amp;#34; did not seem to be connected to anything.</li>
            <li> Good dual-voltage travel dryer, although a bit larger than expected, and a little weaker than an 1875 should be, IMHO. Still - it works fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I hoped it would be....fast, efficient drying and easy to fold up to put away.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The only reason this doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t have a concentrator nozzle ... and I can&#x27;t find one that fits!</li>
            <li> This dryer works fine, but was bigger than I thought it would be. I wouldn&#x27;t classify it as compact or even a travel dryer. It would be too big to take on a trip. Too heavy.</li>
            <li> nice inexpensive product for our office emergencies.</li>
            <li> I use it for traveling because it is compact.  It is not the strongest hair dryer but compact and fits into my bags.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a great little hairdryer.  Folds nicely.  Wish it had a retractable cord, though.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a Conair that we had used for at least 15 years. Very happy with the purchase and was pleasantly surprised to learn it has a voltage converter that allows my wife to take it with us when we travel abroad.</li>
            <li> This dryer  has good, strong air flow and is conveniently small for traveling.  It is a good bargain for the price and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This foldable little dryer is perfect for an overnight bag. It has plenty of power and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Just what we needed for our travel bag.</li>
            <li> I just love my Conair 1875 Blow Dryer.  It&#x27;s more powerful than any blow dryer that I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I have long hair that generally takes 15 minutes to dry with my Revlon 1875.  The Conair is three times more powerful and dries my hair in less than 5 minutes.  And it&#x27;s great for travel because it folds in half and is very, very light in weight.  I happily give this dryer 5 stars and would give it 10 if the option was available.</li>
            <li> I used this dryer only a couple of times. Then when I turned it on it made a strange humming noise, started smoking, and there were flames firing up inside the unit. Yikes! I What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Lots of power in a small package.  Perfect for my small vanity, has the same power as my large dryer.  I also love the color :-)</li>
            <li> Compact and works very well. I like it!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten accustomed to using this blow dryer and it is somewhat heaver and larger than the old one I had for 25 years, it seems to be close.  The hi and low switch is not what the ProBaby was like and isn&#x27;t easy for me to use, but I&#x27;ll get accustomed to it.  It&#x27;s a great dryer.</li>
            <li> This the second one we have purchased in twenty years!  The new model is even more sturdy but the weak link is the handle that pivots, but the for the price how can you go wrong!</li>
            <li> perfect travel hairdryer; folds compactly</li>
    </ol>
