            <li>I buy like 10 at once in the Summer:)</li>
            <li>Edited to add our latest results</li>
            <li>My daughters love the smell and all week kept asking &amp;#34;is that the yummy smelling stuff?&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>We made sure to reapply after playing in the water even though it&#x27;s water resistant.  </li>
            <li>but this is still our favorite beach/pool sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Well pleased with product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>I love that my kids can easily apply it</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s got nice natural ingredients and a good EWG rating it blends easily</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin, as many Jason products are.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but a bit greasy at first</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, fair skin.</li>
            <li>This has a great, creamy feel that rubbed in easily and did not leave a white sheen.</li>
            <li>Like it very much!!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m comfortable using it.</li>
            <li>Works great, Never dries their skin and actually moisturizes.</li>
            <li>Did I mention it smells fabulous and no one burned or got sun with it on.  </li>
            <li>It rubs on smoothly and protects well from the sun.</li>
            <li>Having totally pale &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; skin, we applied Jason&#x27;s and it worked great!  </li>
            <li>It does have a fairly strong smell but it is tropical and pleasant enough.  </li>
            <li>Its very smooth to put on, like actual lotion and smells great and doesn&#x27;t make you look white or cakey.  </li>
            <li>Highly suggest - I am ordering more for the summer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural sunscreens and this is hands-down my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I burned right thru this product.</li>
            <li>The first two days, I used this sunscreen with just a nice tan building after several hours on the beach each day.</li>
            <li>This product worked well for us in Kauai, especially considering we were coming from winter in Montana :).  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon Prime, I got another tube of this delivered to our vacation home during our trip, and we&#x27;ve had no additional burns!</li>
            <li>It rubs in and dries fast.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Despite reapplying sunscreen 3 times in a couple hours, I was fried to a crisp on my chest, back and shoulders.</li>
            <li>get it from a near by store</li>
            <li>This rubs in really well - no whiteness, no greasiness, feels just about the same as regular chemical sunblock.  </li>
            <li>Very watery and oily, not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li>I am posting a similar review for the Jason Sun Facial Sunscreen SPF 20 Broad Spectrum because it also contains unwanted chemical sunscreens.</li>

            <li> We spent entire days on the beach.  </li>
            <li> : We spent a week on the Florida panhandle.</li>
            <li> It has a fairly strong tropical scent which was noticeable even to friends when they stood close, but it is not an unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Other sunscreens give us face rash.</li>
            <li> The active ingredients are: Homosalate 10%, Ethylhexyl  Methoxycinnamate 7.5%, Octocrylene 7.0%, Ethylhexyl Salicylate  5.0%,  Butyl Methoxydbenzoylmethane 3.0%, and Titanium Dioxide 1.0%.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the smell</li>
            <li> and I was incredibly pale.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact there are fewer nasty ingredients compared to regular sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, had to return to Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not exposing them to all the nasty stuff in commercial sunscreens.</li>
            <li> and I felt bad clearing out store&#x27;s inventory every time</li>
            <li> It does not smell bad.</li>

            <li> So it&#x27;s got nice natural ingredients and a good EWG rating it blends easily but it is a bit on the smelly side.  Coconut and something.  The smell keeps me from giving it a five star rating.</li>
            <li> We love the Jason brand sunscreen for our face. Other sunscreens give us face rash.</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Like the consistency. Smell is strong but pleasant It has some chemicals but it is on the EWG list so I&#x27;m comfortable using it. it&#x27;d be great if we could not use any chemicals but we&#x27;d probably be stuck with 8SPF (coconut oil). Which may work for every day running around but not if you travel into tropics, going to the beach or are fair skin.</li>
            <li> This product worked well for us in Kauai, especially considering we were coming from winter in Montana :).  I like the fact there are fewer nasty ingredients compared to regular sunscreen.  I wish it was in a larger tube however.</li>
            <li> I use this on all three of my girls. Works great, Never dries their skin and actually moisturizes. SMELLS soooooo Good!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I get it from a near by store but I started ordering from Amazon cause I buy like 10 at once in the Summer:) and I felt bad clearing out store&#x27;s inventory every time</li>
            <li> Great smell, works well.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, fair skin. This product was not enough SPF coverage for me. I burned right thru this product. Very watery and oily, not quite what I expected. Sorry, had to return to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural sunscreens and this is hands-down my favorite.  Doesn&#x27;t have lots of junk in it and works great!  Its very smooth to put on, like actual lotion and smells great and doesn&#x27;t make you look white or cakey.  It rubs in and dries fast.  Did I mention it smells fabulous and no one burned or got sun with it on.  Will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Excellent! This has a great, creamy feel that rubbed in easily and did not leave a white sheen. We used it for a visit to Costa Rica and didn&#x27;t burn a bit (although it was cloudy). It has a fairly strong tropical scent which was noticeable even to friends when they stood close, but it is not an unpleasant scent. I love that my kids can easily apply it and I&#x27;m not exposing them to all the nasty stuff in commercial sunscreens. I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again!  Edited to add our latest results: We spent a week on the Florida panhandle. The first two days, I used this sunscreen with just a nice tan building after several hours on the beach each day. On day three, I ran out. I had just enough for my face, and then I used a commercial, chemical-laden brand we picked up at the local souvenir shop on the rest of my body. Despite reapplying sunscreen 3 times in a couple hours, I was fried to a crisp on my chest, back and shoulders. My face was unburned. Thanks to Amazon Prime, I got another tube of this delivered to our vacation home during our trip, and we&#x27;ve had no additional burns! This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this sunscreen!  Worked amazingly and I loved not having to worry about all the toxic chemicals! Worked great, never burned! Going to purchase again!</li>
            <li> Nice smell, easy to put on and not greasy.  Like it very much!!</li>
            <li> Great sun protection with nice moisturizing properties.  Pleasant scent and long-lasting protection.  Great for both adults and children.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use it every day before going outside. It does not smell bad. I do look shiny, but that is the UV block. It came packaged well.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want chemical sunscreens do NOT buy this! The description is so misleading. I did notice that the description says spf 36 but the picture shows spf 45. I received the product pictured. The active ingredients are: Homosalate 10%, Ethylhexyl  Methoxycinnamate 7.5%, Octocrylene 7.0%, Ethylhexyl Salicylate  5.0%,  Butyl Methoxydbenzoylmethane 3.0%, and Titanium Dioxide 1.0%. The description only lists the inactive ingredients. I am posting a similar review for the Jason Sun Facial Sunscreen SPF 20 Broad Spectrum because it also contains unwanted chemical sunscreens. Returning both. Amazon has been great about the returns, but I will not be buying Jason products again.</li>
            <li> We recently went to FL for Spring Break with the kids.  We spent entire days on the beach.  Having totally pale &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; skin, we applied Jason&#x27;s and it worked great!  My daughters love the smell and all week kept asking &amp;#34;is that the yummy smelling stuff?&amp;#34;.  We made sure to reapply after playing in the water even though it&#x27;s water resistant.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This rubs in really well - no whiteness, no greasiness, feels just about the same as regular chemical sunblock.  It does have a fairly strong smell but it is tropical and pleasant enough.  I used this in Barbados in March and I was incredibly pale.  I never got burned when I used this sun block (with regular reapplication after swimming).  Highly suggest - I am ordering more for the summer.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the smell but this is still our favorite beach/pool sunscreen. It rubs on smoothly and protects well from the sun.</li>
            <li> Effective and nice scent. Good for sensitive skin, as many Jason products are.</li>
            <li> Well pleased with product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Using this for years. Nuf sed.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but a bit greasy at first</li>
    </ol>
