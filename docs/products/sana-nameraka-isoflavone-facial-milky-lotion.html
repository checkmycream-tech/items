            <li>So the product is really good!</li>
            <li>good product.</li>

            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>It works good.</li>
            <li>No color, no smell, feel like very healthy.</li>
            <li>That is what we need in America the most!    </li>
            <li>This lotion is very light; it&#x27;s good for oily skin type and during the summer.  </li>
            <li>however, I&#x27;d stick to Kiehl&#x27;s cucumber toner for the warmer months and use this on top as lotion b4 sleep.</li>
            <li>I really love its feeling on face or body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay product.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s pretty good for this price range.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel silky and smooth, I love it.  </li>
            <li>This lotion does a good job on your skin, it was absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably not the best product for a super dry skin.</li>
            <li>Very rich but light weight and easy to spread and be absorbed.</li>
            <li>Soy - as a drink, in the shape of tofu and as cosmetics - flippin&#x27; fantastic.</li>
            <li>It worked well, and absorbed by my skin very quick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Little to no scent and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>very gentle and smooth.</li>
            <li>I used to buy them when I went back to my homeland, I&#x27;m glad I can purchase them on Amazon too!</li>
            <li>This whole line of cosmetics is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Its very very watery/milky and smells very funny.</li>
            <li>i put it right after i wash my face, or after shower, or before i put make up on.</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin, but it works just fine.</li>
            <li>And it keeps you very Moisture a lot!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of much more expensive moisture, but not feel as good as this one.</li>
            <li>my skin is very sentitive and oily on T-zone .this</li>
            <li>lotion works very well on any skin type  .</li>
            <li>It is sold very propular in Hong Kong</li>
            <li>I used up the whole bottle from the very beginning.</li>
            <li>And the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not lotion, it&#x27;s milky lotion, so it is really liquidity.</li>
            <li>it is very gentle  and natural with any fragance .</li>
            <li>Its texture is very smooth, and not super oily.</li>
            <li>Good packaging from seller and a little extra treat tucked in too!  </li>

            <li> This lotion leaves your skin feeling moisturized without weighing it down, you only need a tiny bit!</li>
            <li> For winter, this one is my toner and it works well on my dry</li>

            <li> I will contact this seller again for other products.</li>
            <li> But I bought it to use as a toner, and during spring &amp; summer, this may be a tad heavy on application.</li>

            <li> This lotion is very light; it&#x27;s good for oily skin type and during the summer.  I like that it is fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> Soy - as a drink, in the shape of tofu and as cosmetics - flippin&#x27; fantastic. This lotion leaves your skin feeling moisturized without weighing it down, you only need a tiny bit! This whole line of cosmetics is fantastic.

            <li> Very good product.  Makes my skin feel silky and smooth, I love it.  Good packaging from seller and a little extra treat tucked in too!  I will contact this seller again for other products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavier than I thought. After all, it is milky lotion, not a toner. But I bought it to use as a toner, and during spring &amp; summer, this may be a tad heavy on application. However, it does absorb fairly well anyways and you may not mind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me however, I&#x27;d stick to Kiehl&#x27;s cucumber toner for the warmer months and use this on top as lotion b4 sleep. For winter, this one is my toner and it works well on my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little to no scent and absorbs quickly. Good buy.</li>
            <li> I brought a seris products of this brand.  Because my japanese friends told me that, this is the cheapest beauty product. And no Alchol in it.    I like it a lot. It&#x27;s different from American beauty product.   Because I&#x27;m asian. So I dont like to use western product here a lot. I prefer something from Asian. because it&#x27;s desgin for our skin^^ even though sometimes they also have it here in USA.    And it keeps you very Moisture a lot! That is what we need in America the most!    So the product is really good!</li>
            <li> Not recommended for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really love its feeling on face or body. Very rich but light weight and easy to spread and be absorbed. No color, no smell, feel like very healthy.

            <li> It worked well, and absorbed by my skin very quick. It&#x27;s not lotion, it&#x27;s milky lotion, so it is really liquidity. And I think it work well on my face!</li>
            <li> very gentle and smooth. i have sensitive skin, but it works just fine. i put it right after i wash my face, or after shower, or before i put make up on.</li>

            <li> very helpful for asian skin.</li>
            <li> It works good. It&#x27;s probably not the best product for a super dry skin. But it&#x27;s pretty good for this price range. Its texture is very smooth, and not super oily. Also since it&#x27;s made in Japan, you don&#x27;t have to worry about GMO soys.</li>
            <li> This Japanese lotion is not the average lotion. Its very very watery/milky and smells very funny. Not what i expected from a Japanese brand but not for me.</li>
            <li> This lotion does a good job on your skin, it was absorbed quickly. I heard this product from a tv show and bought it for a try, i have been using it for 2 weeks and my skin was not dry like before. And the price was not too high, recommend for teenage.</li>
