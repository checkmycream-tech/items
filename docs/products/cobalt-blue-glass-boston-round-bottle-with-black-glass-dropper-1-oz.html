            <li> Keeps the  product longer due to the dark color--and kind looks pretty as well</li>
            <li> perfect! made homemade ear cleanser for my son, per the pediatrician&#x27;s instructions. this was the perfect size for what i needed it for.</li>
            <li> Looks great in my bathroom. I use it for my essential oils</li>
            <li> Wrapped great. ..used for essential oils in my medicine cabinet. This is perfect and arrived in tact.  Worth  the price</li>
            <li> Attractive eyedropper bottles.</li>
            <li> beautiful bottle works well I use it for my orange essential oil.</li>
            <li> The cap took me a little while to trust. It seems like it won&#x27;t screw down tight, but it is sealed when I close it for sure. I bought it to keep my eliquid in, and I carry it in my front coverall pocket. Has never leaked, and looks great. If I do leave it out on my desk, the cobalt keeps my juice from UV light. -Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to put some oil in.  The oil I put in it doesn&#x27;t leak.  I like it.</li>
            <li> The plastic dissolved and the whole dropper fell apart shortly after I purchased.  It made the oil I had inside unusable because it smelled like plastic and chemicals.</li>
            <li> Medical grade glass bottle is perfect for storing light sensitive liquids. the cobalt color is so much prettier than the traditional Beer Bottle Brown. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great did everything I needed it to</li>
            <li> delivered quickly, easy to clean and works well.  Only downside is you can only fill the dropper halfway, but that is probably the same with all droppers, not a defect in this dropper.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> See my review for the frosted bottle</li>

            <li> I ordered this to pour my Sea Buckthorn Oil into when the dropper bottle broke. This one is much nicer</li>
            <li> Well packed.  Product is as expected.</li>
