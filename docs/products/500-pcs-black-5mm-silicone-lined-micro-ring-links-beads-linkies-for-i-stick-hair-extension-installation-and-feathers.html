            <li> Now some will crack and become hard to get off, but that&#x27;s no problem just squeeze them in the opposite direction until you hear or feel it break</li>
            <li> It is a little wait to get it</li>
            <li> it was extremely difficult trying to get the hair through the beads because the cylinder was very small if you want somthing that is going to make the process a tad bit quicker</li>
            <li> They are completely useless to me.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this purchase.</li>

I am disappointed with this purchase. the silicone is there to protect your hair. For all the people who are okay with not having it still a the silicone is there to protect your hair.

            <li> I found with these links they were easy to install but slipped out of my hair after about 2 weeks. I have oily hair so I figured this was the problem. I applied them to my sister&#x27;s hair and they stayed in a lot longer since she has coarse hair. Not bad for the price.</li>

            <li> Great value and quality</li>
            <li> After waiting close to a month for the delivery, the links delivered were without the silicon lining. They are completely useless to me. I just threw them away.</li>
            <li> Took a while to arrive but it was definitely worth the wait. I can&#x27;t find a deal like this anywhere else</li>
