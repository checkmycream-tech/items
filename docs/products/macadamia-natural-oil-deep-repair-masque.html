            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried the sample size of this product many times and it always comes through for me.  </li>
            <li>I love the way the smell lasts in my hair.</li>
            <li>so I was glad to be able to try a sample.</li>
            <li>the strands look and feel nourished, no brittle ends :)</li>
            <li>but I do need more moisture.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>It just smells good, it didn&#x27;t really work on me.</li>
            <li>This deep repair mask is great, better than the healing oil</li>
            <li>Also, be sure to wash out the shower well, because the residue of this stuff can make it super slippery.</li>
            <li>for this masque, if buying the real product, from an authorized retailer, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite product!</li>
            <li>I dunno if my hair is naturally awesome or what, but it pretty much looks and feels the same.</li>
            <li>This is hte first time I&#x27;ve used it however being deployed and in an extremely arid region of the world, this product has done amazing things for my hair!!</li>
            <li>Truely and must buy</li>
            <li>i bought the full size and plan on using it long-term.</li>
            <li>I have used it twice, made my hair nice and soft</li>
            <li>That says a lot about how much I like this product because the full size isn&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
            <li>I buy this for my wife at her frequent request, and we love it.</li>
            <li>Of course the product itself is worth ONE dollar, but when your shopping online, theirs always a price for shipping.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m not doing something right.</li>
            <li>When I am able to afford the full size product I will definitely get it.</li>
            <li>Just super soft and silky and every other good adjective you could imagine.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I love this product and I am convinced I show buy a larger amount as soon as possible. :)</li>
            <li>This conditioner is similar to the Aussie Deeep Conditioner, but much better.  </li>
            <li>I used the rusk deep conditioning system before this and that worked better,</li>
            <li>glad I didn&#x27;t buy the big tub</li>
            <li>I finally bought the full size from Target when it was $3 off the original price.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really get stellar results or anything from this.</li>
            <li>but my grandmother is mixed so my hair is really fine</li>
            <li>(although that was nice too just a little overpriced it seems).</li>
            <li>left my hair much softer but any good coinditioner can do same thing i have super short hair</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend this product!</li>
            <li>This has really helped with the breakage.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I am a product junkie that likes to find quality products for reasonable prices.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely did NOT work on my hair.</li>
            <li>And I really don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li>After rinsing it out my hair felt soft and my curls were very defined.</li>
            <li>I have seriously been touching and twirling my hair all day!</li>
            <li>My hair is kind of soft and blah to begin with, but this makes it feel thick and luxurious.  </li>
            <li>I didnt&#x27; expect it to make my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>and in return, I got nothing but silky soft hair...</li>
            <li>It felt drier, plus the real one is suppose to be white</li>
            <li>This had all natural ingredients in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cynthia B.</li>
            <li>I have heard good things about Macadamia hair products, but they are too expensive for me</li>
            <li>It made it soft &amp; smooth but didn&#x27;t weigh it down like a lot of deep condtioners</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t very damaged, but i was a bit dry.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and soft for several days after use.</li>
            <li>do (which makes my naturally wavy hair fall flat).</li>
            <li>It felt fine when i put it into my damp hair, but when my hair dried it didn&#x27;t feel as soft as it usually is.</li>

            <li> It felt fine when i put it into my damp hair, but when my hair dried it didn&#x27;t feel as soft as it usually is.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft for a bit but dry ends were still dry.</li>
            <li> and it was extremely dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> I have been having problems for about 2yrs with dry, splitting ends at the bottom of my hair.</li>
            <li> I will try something else in this product line to help nourish my dry hair.</li>
            <li> but its also really dry</li>
            <li> I guess I will pay full price from now on for this product because after ordering this and a large tub of it I now realize that products sold from unauthorized retailers, sold at prices below what the manufacturer will sell for, are fake or at least partially fake/altered.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll never live without it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is unbelievable how soft and silky this makes my hair.  </li>
            <li> She has very dry ends</li>
            <li> This one once product comes in a little packet because, it is only one once of product.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of good reviews about this product, but i hated it.</li>
            <li> The packet is small but I only had to use about half of it for my entire hair (medium length)</li>
            <li> but because its thick on top i only got one use out of this ....not too bad</li>
            <li> Made no difference to my naturally wavy, and very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Well, I think this is confusing because what am I reviewing Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Masque or all sales of this product on Amazon?</li>
            <li> my hair is thick, and i have tried various products.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair fall off after I rinse it off like other leave in conditioners I have used in the past, I also bought the oil spray.</li>
            <li> When I use this, it&#x27;s like I have another person&#x27;s hair for a few days.  </li>
            <li> it was a small pak of product, what a rip off.</li>
            <li> I sugest buying this sample size to see how it would work for you, because the bigger sizes are quite expensive.</li>
            <li> It was dull and needed help.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair and it looks healthier and shinny for at least a few days up to a week after I use it.  </li>
            <li> It was a little disappointing to see it in that little packet, but it was understandable.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately this conditioner did not work for me.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this product is way overpriced and it doesn&#x27;t even work that great. It did nothing extra for my hair...save your money and buy something better that will give you more product for your dollar</li>
            <li> I buy this for my wife at her frequent request, and we love it. Her hair comes out feeling amazing. Just super soft and silky and every other good adjective you could imagine. It&#x27;s AMAZING. Also, be sure to wash out the shower well, because the residue of this stuff can make it super slippery.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any incredible results but my hair felt smoother and shinier after one use.</li>
            <li> This product is just as good as the cream and my hair feels amazing after words. Truely and must buy</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! My hair has been bleached three times, and dyed about 30 more and it was extremely dry and damaged. I used this product and my hair felt so silky! I then went swimmingto find it still in the silky soft state, also it smells wonderful so that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feels after using this product!  I have thin hair and it looks healthier and shinny for at least a few days up to a week after I use it.  Would definatley recommend!!</li>
            <li> I have been having problems for about 2yrs with dry, splitting ends at the bottom of my hair. After one application of this deep repair I could see a difference! Highly reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I just tried it today and just love it. I left the Macadamia oil deep repair on for 30 min. and in return, I got nothing but silky soft hair...love it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the finest conditioners I&#x27;ve every used; quite possibly the best! Fair price too considering what&#x27;s offered out there.</li>
            <li> This deep repair mask is great, better than the healing oil (although that was nice too just a little overpriced it seems). I bleached my hair &amp; followed up with this conditioner &amp; let me just say that it made my hair feel better after the bleaching than before. It made it soft &amp; smooth but didn&#x27;t weigh it down like a lot of deep condtioners do (which makes my naturally wavy hair fall flat).</li>
            <li> I looked at the photo of what this was, when I got it it was a small pak of product, what a rip off. you can get this at any dollar store.</li>
            <li> I bought this about six months ago and I love it, it leaves my hair feeling silky smooth and smells good too. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair fall off after I rinse it off like other leave in conditioners I have used in the past, I also bought the oil spray.</li>
            <li> This repair is awesome! I will order again in the future. This has really helped with the breakage. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product would be great for many but for me it did nothing.  I mixed it with another product to get the effect I wanted however, my stylist use the entire line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair after using. It added no moisture or softness. Just acted as though nothing went onto my hair. I would not repurchase. I sugest buying this sample size to see how it would work for you, because the bigger sizes are quite expensive.</li>
            <li> This one once product comes in a little packet because, it is only one once of product. It was a little disappointing to see it in that little packet, but it was understandable. I love how this product makes your hair smell and feel. It is like your hair took a bath in yummyness. For my hair, this product didn&#x27;t work it&#x27;s magic for more than two days. Maybe I&#x27;m not doing something right. Who knows? Regardless, I love this product and I am convinced I show buy a larger amount as soon as possible. :)</li>
            <li> yes, after one use.. i notice my hair is more moisturized and not as lifeless. i bought the full size and plan on using it long-term. i hope it makes my hair even better.</li>
            <li> You people are so delusional.  Of course the product itself is worth ONE dollar, but when your shopping online, theirs always a price for shipping.  It says &amp;#34;Free shipping&amp;#34; meaning that the shipping was moved over to the actual price of the product.&lt;br /&gt;But anyways this isn&#x27;t as good as everyone says,  I don&#x27;t see a difference in my hair at all.  I dunno if my hair is naturally awesome or what, but it pretty much looks and feels the same.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really get stellar results or anything from this. Glad I used it and my hair felt refreshed but then again I&#x27;d just washed it...</li>
            <li> Would love a jar of this but it is a bit pricey. Was great that i could try it out instead of getting a jar.</li>
            <li> My daughter used 4 of these.She has very dry ends and we did not notice a difference. Works okay. Makes hair soft for a bit but dry ends were still dry.</li>
            <li> The packet is small but I only had to use about half of it for my entire hair (medium length) so I have enough left over to use it again. It made my hair feel amazing, it&#x27;s so silky and that&#x27;s only with one wash. It smells so good, I&#x27;m definitely recommending this product and am saving up to buy the 8oz one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I know I shouldn&#x27;t but I cannot stop touching my hair! I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of good reviews about this product, but i hated it. My hair isn&#x27;t very damaged, but i was a bit dry. So i decided to try this product out. It felt fine when i put it into my damp hair, but when my hair dried it didn&#x27;t feel as soft as it usually is. It felt drier, plus the real one is suppose to be white, my was almost orange.</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie that likes to find quality products for reasonable prices.  I have tried the sample size of this product many times and it always comes through for me.  I finally bought the full size from Target when it was $3 off the original price.  That says a lot about how much I like this product because the full size isn&#x27;t cheap.  I have cotton-like curly hair with flyaways along my hairline.  This conditioner is similar to the Aussie Deeep Conditioner, but much better.  This conditioner really smoothes my hair, leaves my hair moisturized and detangles wonderfully.  I love the way the smell lasts in my hair.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I have heard good things about Macadamia hair products, but they are too expensive for me so I was glad to be able to try a sample. I have kinky curly hair. I used this product as directed, while in the shower. After rinsing it out my hair felt soft and my curls were very defined. It smells great too.  I am very pleased with my results. When I am able to afford the full size product I will definitely get it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well and I&#x27;ll never live without it.&lt;br /&gt;The 1 ounce are great for travel or gifts.</li>
            <li> left my hair much softer but any good coinditioner can do same thing i have super short hair but because its thick on top i only got one use out of this ....not too bad</li>
            <li> This was a good product. It placed shine back into my hair. It was dull and needed help.  This had all natural ingredients in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cynthia B.</li>
            <li> my hair is thick, and i have tried various products. i have tried several of macadamia oil&#x27;s products, and yes, it works. the strands look and feel nourished, no brittle ends :)</li>
            <li> I liked this product, the trial size packet is a generous  amount. I have used it twice, made my hair nice and soft but I do need more moisture. The scent is strong but I liked it. I will try something else in this product line to help nourish my dry hair.</li>
            <li> When I use this, it&#x27;s like I have another person&#x27;s hair for a few days.  It is unbelievable how soft and silky this makes my hair.  My hair is kind of soft and blah to begin with, but this makes it feel thick and luxurious.  This is my new favorite product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely did NOT work on my hair. And I really don&#x27;t like the smell ): Glad i bought this packet and not the bigger bottle. Made no difference to my naturally wavy, and very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Well, I think this is confusing because what am I reviewing Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Masque or all sales of this product on Amazon? Is it enough to just rate a given seller? I think not. I purchased a 1 ounce package of this from Ulta and the packages are not the same, not even close. I guess I will pay full price from now on for this product because after ordering this and a large tub of it I now realize that products sold from unauthorized retailers, sold at prices below what the manufacturer will sell for, are fake or at least partially fake/altered. The results are just not the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this masque, if buying the real product, from an authorized retailer, it is amazing. It&#x27;s absolutely the best product I&#x27;ve ever used in my hair. My hair is shiny and soft for several days after use. Amazing!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would help my hair, but it made no noticeable difference. Thankfully I didn&#x27;t buy a larger size!</li>
            <li> It just smells good, it didn&#x27;t really work on me. I used the rusk deep conditioning system before this and that worked better, glad I didn&#x27;t buy the big tub</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! This is hte first time I&#x27;ve used it however being deployed and in an extremely arid region of the world, this product has done amazing things for my hair!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner did not work for my hair at all. I am african american but my grandmother is mixed so my hair is really fine but its also really dry so I was hoping this would help add some moisture but unfortunately this conditioner did not work for me.</li>
            <li> This is so moisturizing! I didnt&#x27; expect it to make my hair so soft! I have seriously been touching and twirling my hair all day! I&#x27;m totally buying the bigger one!</li>
