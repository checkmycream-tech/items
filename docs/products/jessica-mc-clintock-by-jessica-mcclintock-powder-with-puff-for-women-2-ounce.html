            <li>Super fast delivery and great product.  </li>
            <li>Very nice - fragrance is soft and feminine</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume is Jessica Mc Clintock, and I was so excited to find powder in this scent.  </li>
            <li>She liked it so much I decided to try it myself and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I love that I found such a great place to get my dusting powder.  </li>
            <li>The aroma doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as the store bought product.</li>
            <li>One of my most favorite scents of all time, hard to find in stores now so very happy to find on line.</li>
            <li>mother is also a huge Jessica McClintock fan.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is light and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I always like the powder form because it seems to really just smell warm when you wear it.</li>
            <li>This powder have strong wonderful smell of that particular fragrance and it will last forever.</li>
            <li>Great product, possible to find in stores</li>
            <li>Light fragrance, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>So light and not over powering. .</li>
            <li>SO I KNEW I WOULD ENJOY IT.</li>
            <li>I thought after reading the reviews that I would enjoy this scent.</li>
            <li>The Jessica McClintock (original fragrance) powder is so finely milled</li>
            <li>Just wish I could buy more to keep in stock, but can&#x27;t afford right now.</li>
            <li>Sweet cutesy chemical created concoctions nowadays just do not work for me.</li>
            <li>Then I remembered the wonderful subtle scent of Jessica McClintock.</li>
            <li>Fresh and Clean.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping, no complaints.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment and well packed combined with low price makes it a great deal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The powder is boldly scented.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for it, but it is mild</li>
            <li>this powder and powderpuff is delicate and very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It smells exactly like its perfume counterpart, &amp; that is a treat in itself!  </li>
            <li>I rarely use it because it gets all over everything when I shake it out.</li>
            <li>It has a soft floral scent that I love.</li>
            <li>and after too much time and drama, I agreed to accept a shaker version, instead, at the original sale price for one with a puff.  </li>
            <li>The little puff is perfect for applying under the arms and chest, and I think my hubby will like that I&#x27;m not leaving a cloud of white powder</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent...happy to find this individually at this price.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>When I noticed the powder and puff on their site for a much higher price, I contacted them again (and again and again...)</li>
            <li>Have always gotten positive compliments.</li>
            <li>This is a classic fragrance that is mild enough to wear everyday but impressive enough to be noticed.</li>
            <li>canister arrived full and it&#x27;s of average size, so it can easily be held in the hand.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Not a lot of citrus to this, very perfumey.</li>
            <li>I expected more for the money</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t notice it much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It had too much of a chemical smell</li>
            <li>It was a real surprise to find the dusting powder that I have been searching for so long, available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t going to rate this at all because I was angry and had nothing good to say, but I noticed another buyer with the same problem I had more than a year ago.  </li>
            <li>I use powder everyday, morning and night, and love using this scented powder at night before bed.  </li>
            <li>Love.it Fresh scent and lasting!</li>
            <li>When I was searching &amp; searching for a new fragrance it seems futile.</li>
            <li>Live it...perfect gift</li>
            <li>For many years I have been faithful to my White Diamonds powder I wanted to explore other options....</li>
            <li>THIS is the pretty bergamont perfume that people will ask &#x27;What is that you are wearing&amp;#34; and only us old school ladies will know what you are talking about.</li>
            <li>My only negative is that I wish there was more!</li>
            <li>And the large jar w/ powder puff is essential for body pampering!  </li>
            <li>Due to &amp;#34;hot flashes&amp;#34; I use this everyday and just love how it makes me feel and smell!</li>
            <li>I have trouble finding it in local department stores, but so glad I can get it on-line.</li>
            <li>The lemon is probably the most subtle.</li>
            <li>smells lightly sweet and the scent lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;The powder is not heavy or too fluffy.  </li>
            <li>This is what I wanted, but also realized it was extremely pricey, It cost three times more than usual.</li>

As a girl growing up in the 70&#x27;s/80&#x27;s/90&#x27;s I had the luxury of wearing Loves Baby Soft, Tabu and the heavy scented 80&#x27;s like Opium, Poison, Shalimar,Obsession, Giorgio Beverly Hills, and Clinique&#x27;s Aromatics Elixir...Sweet cutesy chemical created concoctions nowadays just do not work for me. In my search I racked my brain as to what I can wear that is quality and doesn&#x27;t smell like everyone else. Then I remembered the wonderful subtle scent of Jessica McClintock. THIS is the pretty bergamont perfume that people will ask &#x27;What is that you are wearing&amp;#34; and only us old school ladies will know what you are talking about. I always like the powder form because it seems to really just smell warm when you wear it. Jessica is perfect for a date night and the office. Not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> This powder have strong wonderful smell of that particular fragrance and it will last forever.I like it very much.Thank you.</li>
            <li> Shipping was prompt and item was as expected.</li>
            <li> I love bath powder, and Jessica McLintock makes a perfectly scented soft powder that makes me feel like a million bucks.</li>
            <li> Does smell some what different.  Must just be because it powder not the perfume.  Not a whole lot but I will by again</li>
            <li> Due to &amp;#34;hot flashes&amp;#34; I use this everyday and just love how it makes me feel and smell! I will continue to order this thru AMAZON!</li>
            <li> One of my most favorite scents of all time, hard to find in stores now so very happy to find on line. Good price and quick shipping. Thank you</li>
            <li> This is what I wanted, but also realized it was extremely pricey, It cost three times more than usual.</li>
            <li> I love it. The perfume was cancelled in all the stores nearby, but now I was able to get it.</li>
            <li> This is an older product and not easy to find.  My daughter ask for Jessica Mc Clintock for Christmas. Was able to find the colonge but not powder. So was able to find at amazon.</li>
            <li> Very nice - fragrance is soft and feminine</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  Thank you.  Tri-City Treasures,  you rock. Wonderful perfumed powder.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even find this product in the department stores any more.  I have always enjoyed it and wear the Jessica Mc Clintock fragrance, too.  It was a real surprise to find the dusting powder that I have been searching for so long, available on Amazon.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume is Jessica Mc Clintock, and I was so excited to find powder in this scent.  I use powder everyday, morning and night, and love using this scented powder at night before bed.  The little puff is perfect for applying under the arms and chest, and I think my hubby will like that I&#x27;m not leaving a cloud of white powder like I usually do with the baby powder I normally use.</li>
            <li> I always use this after my shower.  I absolutely love the aroma.  I have trouble finding it in local department stores, but so glad I can get it on-line.</li>
            <li> Great product, possible to find in stores</li>
            <li> it was ok, but it did have kind of a burnt tire smell,</li>
            <li> I have always loved the scent of Jessica Mcclintock products....this powder and powderpuff is delicate and very pleasant.  This makes a very nice gift item, too.</li>
            <li> My mother in law loves this stuff, great inexpensive gift for the holidays</li>
            <li> I prefer the cylinder powder box.  It&#x27;s easier to pack and you can control the amount one uses.</li>
            <li> Mother in laws favorite!</li>
            <li> My mother has always loved body powders. She applies it twice a day, every day. My father is allergic to most perfumes, but they find the scented powders don&#x27;t bother him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother is also a huge Jessica McClintock fan. She has her perfume but because of my fathers sensitivities to it, she almost never gets to wear it. I discovered this body powder and bought it for her as a gift. It now gives her the chance to wear one of her favorite fragrances more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder is boldly scented. The white jasmine is the strongest of the notes. The lemon is probably the most subtle. Not a lot of citrus to this, very perfumey. Extremely feminin and the scent holds for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The canister arrived full and it&#x27;s of average size, so it can easily be held in the hand. It comes with a powder puff for application and was packaged well, so nothing came spilled. This is a wonderful gift for for anyone who enjoys the Jessica McClintock signature scent or someone who likes perfumed body powders.</li>
            <li> I bought Jessica McClintock powder &amp; cologne for my Aunt a number of years ago.  She liked it so much I decided to try it myself and fell in love with it.  I always get compliments when I wear it.  Light fragrance, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have never used powder before and frankly,&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried about getting an &amp;#34;old lady fragrance&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;This smells lightly sweet and the scent lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;The powder is not heavy or too fluffy.  Feels great too.</li>
            <li> A light and lovely companion to the spray fragrance that always makes me feel good and doesn&#x27;t overwhelm the folks around me.</li>
            <li> This powder smells so good. I expected more for the money so I didn&#x27;t reorder. If you have the cash don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery great product</li>
            <li> Just wish I could buy more to keep in stock, but can&#x27;t afford right now. Will order more when I run out!</li>
            <li> I thought there would be a tad more powder in this.  I remember getting a different scent that lasted for a year.  This won&#x27;t.  I probably won&#x27;t get another one in the future.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like much scent, this is just perfect not too strong, or overpowering.My husband likes it also. And not too expensive, withing my budget</li>
            <li> Live it...perfect gift</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift to my mother. She loves it. People compliment her on the smell. I don&#x27;t care for it, but it is mild so I don&#x27;t notice it much.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery and great product.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love that I found such a great place to get my dusting powder.  What a saving!  I love Jessica Mc Clintock. I wore the same fragrance for 20 years. So light and not over powering. . Have always gotten positive compliments.</li>
            <li> Love.it Fresh scent and lasting!</li>
            <li> Fresh and Clean.  I love this fragrance!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to rate this at all because I was angry and had nothing good to say, but I noticed another buyer with the same problem I had more than a year ago.  I wanted the powder and puff at the sale price when I ordered.  I was told that they were out of them and wouldn&#x27;t receive more so they wouldn&#x27;t charge me for it.  When I noticed the powder and puff on their site for a much higher price, I contacted them again (and again and again...) and after too much time and drama, I agreed to accept a shaker version, instead, at the original sale price for one with a puff.  Many months after I ordered, I got the product.  I rarely use it because it gets all over everything when I shake it out. I wanted a box and puff.</li>
            <li> this product i never try but the fragrance smell horrible just not what i expected from jessica mc clintock sorry!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A PRODUCT THAT I HAVE USED BEFORE SO I KNEW I WOULD ENJOY IT. THE PRICE EVEN WITH THE SHIPPING AND HANDLING CAN&#x27;T BE BEAT</li>
            <li> My only negative is that I wish there was more!</li>
            <li> I thought after reading the reviews that I would enjoy this scent. I absolutely LOVE putting on powder after a bath and could not wait to use this powder. For many years I have been faithful to my White Diamonds powder I wanted to explore other options.... What a MISTAKE! For me I found this powder to smell like Raid Wasp Spray! It had too much of a chemical smell and I could not even stand to smell myself after the bath that I had to drown myself in Euphoria perfume to not smell that smell!  I would not and will not recommend this perfume to anyone I know personally... I guess I am a powder snob when it comes to this one! Sorry!!</li>
            <li> Been wearing this for years.  It&#x27;s my trademark.  I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This is not what I received.  I like the scent but I did not receive powder with puff.  I did not get an email asking if it was ok to substitute the product I ordered.</li>
            <li> Love all the Jessica McClintock products.</li>
            <li> The aroma doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as the store bought product.</li>
            <li> This is a classic fragrance that is mild enough to wear everyday but impressive enough to be noticed. Buy it for anyone but I suggest you get it for yourself.</li>
            <li> I love this powder. I don&#x27;t like wearing perfume to bed, so I use this powder after showering and feel fresh and smell wonderful for the hubby. It has a soft floral scent that I love. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and product!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this scent. Thank you for carrying all the products so I can layer my scent.</li>
            <li> This goes along with the perfume that I bought for&lt;br /&gt;the wife for Christmas.  It is her favorite and has&lt;br /&gt;been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Usually I have a bad reaction to perfume scents but I have never had this one cause a problem for me.  Glad to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using Jessica for years and I love it.</li>
            <li> What can you say about anything Jessica...it&#x27;s all extravagant!  The Jessica McClintock (original fragrance) powder is so finely milled it&#x27;s like powdering yourself in gold dust!  Obviously the fragrance was my choice since this is my perfume of choice, but not all lotions/powders/soaps are infused with the opulent fragrance of their perfume name.  Not so with the Jessica McClintock powder.  It smells exactly like its perfume counterpart, &amp; that is a treat in itself!  And the large jar w/ powder puff is essential for body pampering!  I will never get enough of this powder, every day after a shower it is the ultimate pampering addition to any beauty regime.</li>
