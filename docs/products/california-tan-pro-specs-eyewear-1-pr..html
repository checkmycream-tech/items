            <li>I love the glasses I don&#x27;t know why I never bought them before.</li>
            <li>The don&#x27;t leave my eyes hurting after tanning like most glasses do.</li>
            <li>I like these connected eye protectors much better than the separate ones.</li>

            <li>these tanning goggles are just as the site says they are very comfortable to wear comes with a nice bag to keep them in and they are snug enough around the eyes you dont look like a racoon.</li>
            <li>Beds with high pressure bulbs are VERY BRIGHT and also require various controls to be used in the bed.</li>
            <li>Love the fit and the clear strechy band around.</li>

            <li>Shipping was super fast too</li>
            <li>Thanks for make a stellar product!</li>
            <li>If it breaks, some fishing line will work just fine as long as you fit it to you before you cut it.</li>
            <li>Overall, they do what they need to do, and the fit is good, but I bought two pairs for myself because the strap broke on the first, as well as the little notch where the strap is supposed to snap into the sides of the goggle.</li>
            <li>Got these in pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Must say i really like these goggles, work fine if you lay on your back since they are strapless.</li>
            <li>I have used these eye protectors for a while and they protect very well.  </li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t really designed for sunlight, but that&#x27;s what i use them for.  </li>
            <li>They do the job very well protecting my eyes.</li>
            <li>It fits really well, doesn&#x27;t leave any marks around your eyes or on the sides.</li>
            <li>My husband had no complaints about the fit, but he&#x27;s much bigger than me.</li>
            <li>The Ten Pro-Specs are made of a really nice plastic and they actually fold up.  </li>
            <li>and they block the light as long as they are adjusted correctly.</li>
            <li>They allow you to see more than just thru the little circle.</li>
            <li>I was just hoping I would be able to see a little with them on.</li>
            <li>I live them and recommend them to everyone I know.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to fall off after using a few times!</li>
            <li>They come with a soft carrying pouch and the seller even threw in a sample packet of lotion!</li>
            <li>The right eye cup was so loose and wobbly</li>
            <li>The string that comes with them are clear so you wont get a tan line.</li>
            <li>These work, but be warned that the strap is pretty flimsy, and I had to tighten it to work on my little feminine head.</li>
            <li>The elastic I&#x27;m a little iffy on, but considering you don&#x27;t need to tighten it too much</li>

            <li> I really liked these for indoor tanning! I had a pair last year and lost them.  I ordered a new pair received today and was very disappointed after opening them up! They had been used as there was tanning lotion on them! The right eye cup was so loose and wobbly I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to fall off after using a few times!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these specs for years and I can&#x27;t part with them. They look sleek and serve their purpose well!</li>
            <li> The goggles seem to be pretty good. I&#x27;ve only used them a few times but they stay in place while laying in the bed and they block the light as long as they are adjusted correctly. They are different from the ones I&#x27;ve used before though. The entire eye piece is &#x27;see through&#x27;. It&#x27;s like a very dark tint covering each eye piece. They also feel a little flimsy compared to others I&#x27;ve used but I&#x27;ll just have to wait and see how well they hold up. They come with a soft carrying pouch and the seller even threw in a sample packet of lotion! It did take a little longer then expected to receive my order but I think there may have been some snow delays up north. I&#x27;d still order from them again. Bottom line, the goggles do what they are supposed to and at a good price.</li>
            <li> I have used these eye protectors for a while and they protect very well.  The negative is the little rubber strap will not stay connected to the side of the eye cup.</li>
            <li> I have always used the hard, plastic specs when tanning and they don&#x27;t stay in place and are uncomfortable.  The Ten Pro-Specs are made of a really nice plastic and they actually fold up.  The come with a little bag to put them in and I can just keep then in a little pocket in my purse.</li>
            <li> These are the best eye protection I have found. Love the fit and the clear strechy band around. UNTIL I lose the next pair!</li>
            <li> Great tanning eyewear. They allow you to see more than just thru the little circle. I live them and recommend them to everyone I know. My husband even uses them.</li>
            <li> Good: strap can come off but hasn&#x27;t broken yet. easy to reattach.  durable plastic with flexible nose piece on hinges. slightly silvered finish.  Bad: tiny clear band keeps it on.  Looks like it might break.  It is still holding though.  These aren&#x27;t really designed for sunlight, but that&#x27;s what i use them for.  Put in some black tape inside the eye sockets.  Great for a little porch sunlight.</li>
            <li> the product is what it clams. It took a bit to get use to but it seem to be a good set.</li>
            <li> I think these hard-to-find indoor tanning specs are the best ever.  They have a smooth silicone type strap (not elastic that can snap) that lasts longer than the eye part.  I like to flip over when I tan indoor so that I tan better and these specs do the job of eye protection and wearability.  I have worn out 2 pairs and this purchase makes it my third.  I also still have the straps for both pairs - they don&#x27;t stretch out like elastic ones!  Thanks for make a stellar product!</li>
            <li> I love the glasses I don&#x27;t know why I never bought them before. The don&#x27;t leave my eyes hurting after tanning like most glasses do.</li>
            <li> I bought these after my eyesight at night has been getting worse (which I learned can be attributed to not wearing protective eye wear while tanning or in the sun). They fit snug to my face and don&#x27;t let any light in. The elastic I&#x27;m a little iffy on, but considering you don&#x27;t need to tighten it too much, I think it will last several uses. If it breaks, some fishing line will work just fine as long as you fit it to you before you cut it.</li>
            <li> I bought a pair from the salon. They come apart for no tan lines. The elastic strap did break. They do the job very well protecting my eyes. HOWEVER, the description says that these will not give the racoon effect. They do I don&#x27;t like using them because of it.</li>
            <li> The product is great. It fits really well, doesn&#x27;t leave any marks around your eyes or on the sides.</li>
            <li> I use stand up tanning booths, instead of beds, so I needed tan-through goggles that wouldn&#x27;t leave a line, but they also needed to have a strap to keep them on.  These work, but be warned that the strap is pretty flimsy, and I had to tighten it to work on my little feminine head. My husband had no complaints about the fit, but he&#x27;s much bigger than me. Overall, they do what they need to do, and the fit is good, but I bought two pairs for myself because the strap broke on the first, as well as the little notch where the strap is supposed to snap into the sides of the goggle. Not well made, but they do what we wanted them to do.</li>
            <li> Best tanning goggles ever!!</li>
            <li> These googles fit so well I don&#x27;t need the strap even when I stand up.  The biggest down side is that they skew light so well, it&#x27;s hard to read the display when you get in...Otherwise, had over a year...great product!</li>
            <li> I like these connected eye protectors much better than the separate ones. Plus, these came with a nice bag. Quality.</li>
            <li> Like the item overall, however I prefer standing in tanning beds and eyewear doesn&#x27;t always stay on all the time. Overall I do like them and continue to use them. Shipping was super fast too</li>
            <li> The glasses offer good protection. The band around the head lasts only a few times. But, I do not need the band so not big deal to me!</li>
            <li> Feel like I am wearing sunglasses vs goggles. Can see the numbers,fan controls, etc while in the tanning bed without having to take these off. Love how flexible they are too.</li>
            <li> these tanning goggles are just as the site says they are very comfortable to wear comes with a nice bag to keep them in and they are snug enough around the eyes you dont look like a racoon. and you truely can see better thru them when wearing them.</li>
            <li> Beds with high pressure bulbs are VERY BRIGHT and also require various controls to be used in the bed. These protect your eyes and allow you to see mister, fan and radio controls. Others give you sand eye since they are not up to the job.</li>
            <li> The product does block the light. I was just hoping I would be able to see a little with them on. Maybe I got a blurry set, I&#x27;m not sure. But they serve their purpose.</li>
            <li> Got these in pretty fast. Must say i really like these goggles, work fine if you lay on your back since they are strapless.</li>
            <li> These are the best tanning goggles. The string that comes with them are clear so you wont get a tan line. Adjusts to fit eyes of all shapes and i like the little bag that comes with them to keep them stored away.</li>
            <li> The pair I received was hazardously defective.  There was a small area near the center of one of the lenses that had no UV protective coating.  If I had worn it in a tanning bed, one of my eyes might well have been damaged.</li>
