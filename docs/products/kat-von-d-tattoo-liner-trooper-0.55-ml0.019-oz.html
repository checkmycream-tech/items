            <li>Great Eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>As most of us ladies can probably relate we have gone from end to end of the cosmetic shelves looking for the perfect eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Results--&gt;color remains bright, no smudging after 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I was shopping at Sephora for a good liner pen yesterday.</li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I had read some good reviews on it, and wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li>She loved the product while it lasted.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and perfect.  </li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>The tip is very fine and precise, and the liner itself is great, I fell asleep with it on once and in the morning it was still perfectly in place; it didn&#x27;t crust off, smudge, or budge!</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner!  </li>
            <li>My favorite eyeliner!</li>
            <li>Anyone that does top eye liner I recommend this!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite liquid liners!</li>
            <li>Excellent product &amp; fast serr!</li>
            <li>It makes more sense to hold it like a pencil!</li>
            <li>To be honest, none compare to this one.</li>
            <li>It stayed on nicely.</li>
            <li>I was already wearing makeup of my own</li>
            <li>The liners were all nice and I like Kat Von D&#x27;s make up line.</li>
            <li>However it still looks nice just fading away.</li>
            <li>This is really the best eyeliner out there</li>
            <li>, it goes on presised, the tip doesnt break or bend, I really liked it.</li>
            <li>This is BY FAR the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever owned!!!</li>
            <li>The best I&#x27;ve found so far is Benefit Push Up Liner.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s by far the best ever.</li>
            <li>Love it, glides on nicely and stays on</li>
            <li>So easy and can make a perfect straight line.</li>
            <li>So easy to use!</li>
            <li>Stays on all day and is easy to use!</li>
            <li>It has a very fine tip, which allows for superior precision with regard to drawing extremely fine lines (something I absolutely love, but which is not for everyone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product - smooth - ease of control application - great item</li>
            <li>I love the tip of this liner.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not putting it close to your eye, I suppose it would work better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen anything better and it&#x27;s cheaper than this product is.</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Love this eye liquid eye liner.</li>
            <li>This liner doesn&#x27;t go on or stay any better than an ELF liner.</li>
            <li>I love this liner.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend recommended this eyeliner to me and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love love love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Worked for a week then spotty and cheap!</li>
            <li>it has a thing in it that you shake like a magic marker to produce more liquid...</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>This is my favorite liner and buy two at a time when I get it.  </li>
            <li>I jut fell in love with it</li>
            <li>It has the perfect design especially regarding the brush!</li>
            <li>love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li>I love this brow liner...</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, and I love the fact that I can wipe my face with tissues and never worry about wiping off my brows.</li>
            <li>I have more control over it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;HIGHLY recommend this liner!!! :)</li>
            <li>Although if you&#x27;re looking for something that would last overnight, this one is not the best bet.</li>
            <li>This is super easy to use and gives gorgeous results.</li>
            <li>The lines you are able you are able to make are very precise and fine</li>
            <li>Even for the price this liner is absolutely worth it!!</li>
            <li>Best I have had in a long time!</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s definitely worth the buy if you&#x27;re looking for great makeup and a fun tattoo making pen.</li>
            <li>and you are still able to thicken the line easily if you wanted.</li>
            <li>I bought this eyeliner based on the good reviews it had but also because I already use the Kat Von D lock it foundation and love it so much.</li>
            <li>without a primer underneath you will get flaking, its not really matte and its not the best eyeliner ever..</li>
            <li>I prefer felt tip because it&#x27;s more precise</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and stays all day.  </li>
            <li>This product does not stay on, easily smudges,wouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It easily comes off with &amp;#34;soap and water&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the formula stays put.  </li>
            <li>but it comes off really easily, so you may have to carry the pen with you to touch it up if it gets wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and stays on for 7+ hours.</li>
            <li>It comes off easily with soap and water though.</li>
            <li>Results--&gt;still strong.</li>
            <li>Super fine tip!</li>
            <li>Also, it stands up to light rubbing, but comes off easily with eye makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Applies smooth, easily, and with precision.</li>
            <li>HUGE plus.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so vastly different from that I experienced, I wonder if I got a dud, but experienced the same problems with the tester in Sephora, so I don&#x27;t think I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s great, especially for liquid eyeliner newbies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought quite a few eye liners and this one seems to be on of the best liquid liner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Really precise lines.</li>
            <li>Overall, its great in the beginning</li>
            <li>I think it is fantastic</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on how great my eyes look...</li>
            <li>Also came with a free lip linerðŸ˜„</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just fantastic, period.</li>
            <li>bought my liner at Sephora for cheaper; it&#x27;s available in brush form and felt tip form.</li>
            <li>This stays looking pretty good for about 6, so I&#x27;m pretty stoked about it.  </li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for the perfect eyeliner and this is it!  </li>
            <li>It does not run or smudge and comes off super easy when I wash my face at night.</li>
            <li>Was really amazed at the positive reviews!!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to splurge on this product!</li>
            <li>Precise, full coverage that does not smudge, cake, or smear...</li>
            <li>Perfect, smudge free and crisp black color.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best lasting through sweat and water.</li>
            <li>I have tried SEVERAL liquid eyeliners and this one BY FAR is the best liquid eyeliner I have ever used (and I&#x27;ve been using eyeliner for over 15 years!).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s special about this at all...</li>
            <li>SUPER EXCITED TO USE IT.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>Definitely, worth the price versus investing in a bunch of cheap liners.</li>
            <li>The only added benefit is the snap close top which I assume will do more to keep the product moist and air proof.</li>
            <li>I have super oily skin and sweat profusely.</li>
            <li>I saw some reviews which worried me because some people said it faded quickly</li>
            <li>but luckily I didn&#x27;t find that to be the case</li>
            <li>Love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Shipped incredibly fast, super fine tip.</li>
            <li>It survived a sweaty hot day, a thunderstorm, and not to mention, my oily lids - all in one day!</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, love it, will keep buying it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>even in hot, humid weather!</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner... easy to put on, I don&#x27;t have to go over the same line again and again.</li>
            <li>You are able to achieve such fine lines that I use it to draw bottom lashes that look natual.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not super good at doing eyeliner, but this is really user friendly!</li>
            <li>but it won&#x27;t apply easily near moisture like most eyeliner pens.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is definitely worth your money although i&#x27;m just gonna to sephora now</li>
            <li>I have tried many different eyeliners, and this one is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>It is waterproof, if it is a fresh tube.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>it is kind of smudging from the inner corner of my eyes, but the line itself over the eye line stays on all day</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as good as I expected</li>
            <li>it makes it thin and perfect</li>
            <li>When I washed my makeup off for the night, it came off nice and easy with a little water.</li>
            <li>The pen is great and the tip is very well made, but when you glide it, not even black.</li>
            <li>that I have delicate skin and this product don&#x27;t make me feel itchiness is super great product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, easy to use, long lasting.</li>
            <li>I love how the eyeliner doesn&#x27;t have the little sponge like most eyeliner</li>
            <li>This is extremely easy to apply - the brush is flexible and not stiff.</li>
            <li>and it takes me only a few minutes to get perfect lines on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>this is the best liquid eyeliner i&#x27;ve ever had, it lasted me about 6 months before i had to restock, and i&#x27;m a regular day to day eyeliner user, give or take a few.</li>
            <li>It is only $18.00 at the Sephora store and if you order online, they have free shipping and free returns on $50 purchases.</li>
            <li>I recommend it very much</li>
            <li>Just something to note, and be aware of.  </li>
            <li>However, I think it&#x27;s a great product that will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Over the last 15 years, I have owned many eyeliners.</li>
            <li>hot weather (hot Texas summers) and humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy more when I&#x27;ve used this one up</li>
            <li>With one coat it&#x27;s pretty translucent.</li>
            <li>You can literally do caligraphy with it if you wanted to haha!</li>
            <li>My new favorite- over my old go to Stila.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t get all the positive reviews for this product.</li>
            <li>Nice and dark and stays in place so well.</li>
            <li>While this product is great for fine lines and your upper lid, I had no trouble rubbing it off (and I suppose they make it this way in case you mess up while applying it!)</li>
            <li>It really stay on for a long time, I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>This is the only eyeliner I can easily apply and that stays put.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I strongly value the worth of an eyeliner based on its ability to last throughout the day, this eyeliner not only delivers in function, but also in fun.</li>
            <li>This stuff is for real.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought cheaper dupes and believe me, buy the real thing.</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for really temporary, temporary tattoos, it works...</li>
            <li>Stood up to intense gym work outs and all day wear.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this eyeliner!</li>
            <li>Fortunately you shall look no further!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also available at Sephora for only $20, so I&#x27;d buy there unless there isn&#x27;t a Sephora nearby.</li>
            <li>The tip is NOT felt but a bunch of bristles that work to allow you to line your eyes with so much definition.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, the tip doesn&#x27;t lose its shape throughout using.</li>
            <li>I really like the shape of the eyeliner, too.  </li>
            <li>I have other liquid liners that I prefer more</li>
            <li>Will order a back up right away!</li>
            <li>You have to let the area dry completely before touching it.</li>
            <li>Delivers nice lines and isn&#x27;t messy at all!</li>
            <li>last a full day if you didn&#x27;t blink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This full size will be good for about a year, and I wear thick, winged liner every single day.</li>
            <li>However, once wet, it washes off really easily with a washcloth.</li>
            <li>Recommend it highly..</li>
            <li>You must follow the instructions of applying it to clean, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Normally by this point, my eyeliner will be smudged everywhere...</li>
            <li>After wearing this eyeliner for the last several months, I have discovered that it easily lasts throughout the day (even throughout the length of my workday, which is basically 7AM - 6PM).</li>
            <li>It is a very bold black color and does not fade at all during the day.</li>
            <li>Easy for precision and long lasting saturated color.</li>
            <li>This liner goes on smoothly and is easily controlled so that you can create thick or thin lines:)  </li>
            <li>This is the first eyeliner I have seen that actually does what it says.</li>
            <li>Overall greatly impressed but not good for people that don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday.</li>
            <li>Reading all the previous reviews, I was expecting something better than what I actually got.</li>
            <li>I only have black, but want more colors.</li>
            <li>This one lasts long, easy to apply and stays on long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to apply and is a nice solid application; and I&#x27;m hopeful it will last a long time due to its cost and the fact I only wear liner for about a week, every 6-8 weeks!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the liner, it was easy to use, went on dark and sharp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend HIP L&#x27;OREAL eyeliner over this bar far.</li>
            <li>It glides on so seamlessly.</li>
            <li>its not as opaque as i like and doesnt last that much, i prefer the stila one</li>
            <li>every penny don&#x27;t hesitant it&#x27;s effortless to get a professional line, it stays put</li>
            <li>By far.</li>
            <li>Most of my temporary tattoos last a few days.</li>
            <li>If it gets a little wet and you let it dry before letting anything touch it, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>However, I do have to apply multiple coats to obtain a smooth, dark shade.</li>
            <li>If you want a super pigmented ultra black liner don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.</li>
            <li>As far as it being spotty over time I brought this from sephora in 2010 when the kvd line was somewhat new, I use it often and brought my 2nd trooper liner in 2015.</li>
            <li>That night I scrubbed my waterproof make up off with some ponds cold cream; The best product I have found to remove waterproof make up w little pressure and no eye irritability.</li>
            <li>This gives me the most amazing defined line and its almost impossible to mess up using it.</li>
            <li>but I do love how you guys game samples</li>
            <li>I had smudging with other eyeliners or they would dry out quickly.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the few extra bucks</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any staying power-- not even close to lasting throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cat eyes/winged liner is my &amp;#34;thing.&amp;#34; I won&#x27;t leave the house without it--even if I have no other makeup on.</li>
            <li>It is capable of making a very thin and precise line with the brush tip, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>While it lasts, which is not long at all.</li>
            <li>After the day spent doing my normal activities, I was sold.  </li>
            <li>The color is rich and dark black.  </li>
            <li>you can make a thin layer or thick and is super easy to use besides</li>
            <li>I have dark oily skin and most liquid liners especially in heat smear and look icky on me.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> As most of us ladies can probably relate we have gone from end to end of the cosmetic shelves looking for the perfect eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Results--&gt;color remains bright, no smudging after 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I was shopping at Sephora for a good liner pen yesterday.</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I had read some good reviews on it, and wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li> She loved the product while it lasted.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth and perfect.  </li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> The tip is very fine and precise, and the liner itself is great, I fell asleep with it on once and in the morning it was still perfectly in place; it didn&#x27;t crust off, smudge, or budge!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner!  </li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Anyone that does top eye liner I recommend this!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite liquid liners!</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; fast serr!</li>
            <li> It makes more sense to hold it like a pencil!</li>
            <li> To be honest, none compare to this one.</li>
            <li> It stayed on nicely.</li>
            <li> I was already wearing makeup of my own</li>
            <li> The liners were all nice and I like Kat Von D&#x27;s make up line.</li>
            <li> However it still looks nice just fading away.</li>
            <li> This is really the best eyeliner out there</li>
            <li> , it goes on presised, the tip doesnt break or bend, I really liked it.</li>
            <li> This is BY FAR the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever owned!!!</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve found so far is Benefit Push Up Liner.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s by far the best ever.</li>
            <li> Love it, glides on nicely and stays on</li>
            <li> So easy and can make a perfect straight line.</li>
            <li> So easy to use!</li>
            <li> Stays on all day and is easy to use!</li>
            <li> It has a very fine tip, which allows for superior precision with regard to drawing extremely fine lines (something I absolutely love, but which is not for everyone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product - smooth - ease of control application - great item</li>
            <li> I love the tip of this liner.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not putting it close to your eye, I suppose it would work better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen anything better and it&#x27;s cheaper than this product is.</li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Love this eye liquid eye liner.</li>
            <li> This liner doesn&#x27;t go on or stay any better than an ELF liner.</li>
            <li> I love this liner.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend recommended this eyeliner to me and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love love love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Worked for a week then spotty and cheap!</li>
            <li> it has a thing in it that you shake like a magic marker to produce more liquid...</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> This is my favorite liner and buy two at a time when I get it.  </li>
            <li> I jut fell in love with it</li>
            <li> It has the perfect design especially regarding the brush!</li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> I love this brow liner...</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and I love the fact that I can wipe my face with tissues and never worry about wiping off my brows.</li>
            <li> I have more control over it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;HIGHLY recommend this liner!!! :)</li>
            <li> Although if you&#x27;re looking for something that would last overnight, this one is not the best bet.</li>
            <li> This is super easy to use and gives gorgeous results.</li>
            <li> The lines you are able you are able to make are very precise and fine</li>
            <li> Even for the price this liner is absolutely worth it!!</li>
            <li> Best I have had in a long time!</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s definitely worth the buy if you&#x27;re looking for great makeup and a fun tattoo making pen.</li>
            <li> and you are still able to thicken the line easily if you wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeliner based on the good reviews it had but also because I already use the Kat Von D lock it foundation and love it so much.</li>
            <li> without a primer underneath you will get flaking, its not really matte and its not the best eyeliner ever..</li>
            <li> I prefer felt tip because it&#x27;s more precise</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and stays all day.  </li>
            <li> This product does not stay on, easily smudges,wouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It easily comes off with &amp;#34;soap and water&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and the formula stays put.  </li>
            <li> but it comes off really easily, so you may have to carry the pen with you to touch it up if it gets wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and stays on for 7+ hours.</li>
            <li> It comes off easily with soap and water though.</li>
            <li> Results--&gt;still strong.</li>
            <li> Super fine tip!</li>
            <li> Also, it stands up to light rubbing, but comes off easily with eye makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Applies smooth, easily, and with precision.</li>
            <li> HUGE plus.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so vastly different from that I experienced, I wonder if I got a dud, but experienced the same problems with the tester in Sephora, so I don&#x27;t think I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s great, especially for liquid eyeliner newbies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought quite a few eye liners and this one seems to be on of the best liquid liner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Really precise lines.</li>
            <li> Overall, its great in the beginning</li>
            <li> I think it is fantastic</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on how great my eyes look...</li>
            <li> Also came with a free lip linerðŸ˜„</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just fantastic, period.</li>
            <li> bought my liner at Sephora for cheaper; it&#x27;s available in brush form and felt tip form.</li>
            <li> This stays looking pretty good for about 6, so I&#x27;m pretty stoked about it.  </li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for the perfect eyeliner and this is it!  </li>
            <li> It does not run or smudge and comes off super easy when I wash my face at night.</li>
            <li> Was really amazed at the positive reviews!!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it to splurge on this product!</li>
            <li> Precise, full coverage that does not smudge, cake, or smear...</li>
            <li> Perfect, smudge free and crisp black color.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lasting through sweat and water.</li>
            <li> I have tried SEVERAL liquid eyeliners and this one BY FAR is the best liquid eyeliner I have ever used (and I&#x27;ve been using eyeliner for over 15 years!).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s special about this at all...</li>
            <li> SUPER EXCITED TO USE IT.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> Definitely, worth the price versus investing in a bunch of cheap liners.</li>
            <li> The only added benefit is the snap close top which I assume will do more to keep the product moist and air proof.</li>
            <li> I have super oily skin and sweat profusely.</li>
            <li> I saw some reviews which worried me because some people said it faded quickly</li>
            <li> but luckily I didn&#x27;t find that to be the case</li>
            <li> Love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Shipped incredibly fast, super fine tip.</li>
            <li> It survived a sweaty hot day, a thunderstorm, and not to mention, my oily lids - all in one day!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, love it, will keep buying it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> even in hot, humid weather!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner... easy to put on, I don&#x27;t have to go over the same line again and again.</li>
            <li> You are able to achieve such fine lines that I use it to draw bottom lashes that look natual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super good at doing eyeliner, but this is really user friendly!</li>
            <li> but it won&#x27;t apply easily near moisture like most eyeliner pens.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is definitely worth your money although i&#x27;m just gonna to sephora now</li>
            <li> I have tried many different eyeliners, and this one is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> It is waterproof, if it is a fresh tube.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> it is kind of smudging from the inner corner of my eyes, but the line itself over the eye line stays on all day</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as good as I expected</li>
            <li> it makes it thin and perfect</li>
            <li> When I washed my makeup off for the night, it came off nice and easy with a little water.</li>
            <li> The pen is great and the tip is very well made, but when you glide it, not even black.</li>
            <li> that I have delicate skin and this product don&#x27;t make me feel itchiness is super great product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, easy to use, long lasting.</li>
            <li> I love how the eyeliner doesn&#x27;t have the little sponge like most eyeliner</li>
            <li> This is extremely easy to apply - the brush is flexible and not stiff.</li>
            <li> and it takes me only a few minutes to get perfect lines on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> this is the best liquid eyeliner i&#x27;ve ever had, it lasted me about 6 months before i had to restock, and i&#x27;m a regular day to day eyeliner user, give or take a few.</li>
            <li> It is only $18.00 at the Sephora store and if you order online, they have free shipping and free returns on $50 purchases.</li>
            <li> I recommend it very much</li>
            <li> Just something to note, and be aware of.  </li>
            <li> However, I think it&#x27;s a great product that will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Over the last 15 years, I have owned many eyeliners.</li>
            <li> hot weather (hot Texas summers) and humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy more when I&#x27;ve used this one up</li>
            <li> With one coat it&#x27;s pretty translucent.</li>
            <li> You can literally do caligraphy with it if you wanted to haha!</li>
            <li> My new favorite- over my old go to Stila.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t get all the positive reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> Nice and dark and stays in place so well.</li>
            <li> While this product is great for fine lines and your upper lid, I had no trouble rubbing it off (and I suppose they make it this way in case you mess up while applying it!)</li>
            <li> It really stay on for a long time, I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyeliner I can easily apply and that stays put.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I strongly value the worth of an eyeliner based on its ability to last throughout the day, this eyeliner not only delivers in function, but also in fun.</li>
            <li> This stuff is for real.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought cheaper dupes and believe me, buy the real thing.</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for really temporary, temporary tattoos, it works...</li>
            <li> Stood up to intense gym work outs and all day wear.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Fortunately you shall look no further!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also available at Sephora for only $20, so I&#x27;d buy there unless there isn&#x27;t a Sephora nearby.</li>
            <li> The tip is NOT felt but a bunch of bristles that work to allow you to line your eyes with so much definition.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, the tip doesn&#x27;t lose its shape throughout using.</li>
            <li> I really like the shape of the eyeliner, too.  </li>
            <li> I have other liquid liners that I prefer more</li>
            <li> Will order a back up right away!</li>
            <li> You have to let the area dry completely before touching it.</li>
            <li> Delivers nice lines and isn&#x27;t messy at all!</li>
            <li> last a full day if you didn&#x27;t blink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This full size will be good for about a year, and I wear thick, winged liner every single day.</li>
            <li> However, once wet, it washes off really easily with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> Recommend it highly..</li>
            <li> You must follow the instructions of applying it to clean, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Normally by this point, my eyeliner will be smudged everywhere...</li>
            <li> After wearing this eyeliner for the last several months, I have discovered that it easily lasts throughout the day (even throughout the length of my workday, which is basically 7AM - 6PM).</li>
            <li> It is a very bold black color and does not fade at all during the day.</li>
            <li> Easy for precision and long lasting saturated color.</li>
            <li> This liner goes on smoothly and is easily controlled so that you can create thick or thin lines:)  </li>
            <li> This is the first eyeliner I have seen that actually does what it says.</li>
            <li> Overall greatly impressed but not good for people that don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday.</li>
            <li> Reading all the previous reviews, I was expecting something better than what I actually got.</li>
            <li> I only have black, but want more colors.</li>
            <li> This one lasts long, easy to apply and stays on long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough to apply and is a nice solid application; and I&#x27;m hopeful it will last a long time due to its cost and the fact I only wear liner for about a week, every 6-8 weeks!  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the liner, it was easy to use, went on dark and sharp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend HIP L&#x27;OREAL eyeliner over this bar far.</li>
            <li> It glides on so seamlessly.</li>
            <li> its not as opaque as i like and doesnt last that much, i prefer the stila one</li>
            <li> every penny don&#x27;t hesitant it&#x27;s effortless to get a professional line, it stays put</li>
            <li> By far.</li>
            <li> Most of my temporary tattoos last a few days.</li>
            <li> If it gets a little wet and you let it dry before letting anything touch it, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> However, I do have to apply multiple coats to obtain a smooth, dark shade.</li>
            <li> If you want a super pigmented ultra black liner don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.</li>
            <li> As far as it being spotty over time I brought this from sephora in 2010 when the kvd line was somewhat new, I use it often and brought my 2nd trooper liner in 2015.</li>
            <li> That night I scrubbed my waterproof make up off with some ponds cold cream; The best product I have found to remove waterproof make up w little pressure and no eye irritability.</li>
            <li> This gives me the most amazing defined line and its almost impossible to mess up using it.</li>
            <li> but I do love how you guys game samples</li>
            <li> I had smudging with other eyeliners or they would dry out quickly.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the few extra bucks</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any staying power-- not even close to lasting throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cat eyes/winged liner is my &amp;#34;thing.&amp;#34; I won&#x27;t leave the house without it--even if I have no other makeup on.</li>
            <li> It is capable of making a very thin and precise line with the brush tip, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> While it lasts, which is not long at all.</li>
            <li> After the day spent doing my normal activities, I was sold.  </li>
            <li> The color is rich and dark black.  </li>
            <li> you can make a thin layer or thick and is super easy to use besides</li>
            <li> I have dark oily skin and most liquid liners especially in heat smear and look icky on me.</li>
            <li> went to work w bare eyes, its now late at night and although it has faded my liner is still very visable.</li>
            <li> It only took about 3 uses before it started drawing on as grey and spotty.</li>
            <li> Been buying Stila liner for so long now, looked for something to replace it because it doesnt last too long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad because of how much I enjoy this liner.</li>
            <li> but it lasts for a long time..</li>
            <li> Lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this one in the color \\&quot;trooper\\&quot; (simple black) at Sephora.</li>
            <li> it had a rubber thin tip which is very easy to apply, and the eyeliner it self is very dark black!</li>
            <li> but I am very passionate about not liking this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One stick can be used for a very long time as well.</li>
            <li> I drew a heart on my wrist, as soon as it was dry</li>
            <li> The longer it is open, the less water/smudge proof it becomes.  </li>
            <li> Once I received it which was on time, i tried a very small thin line on my hand and it didn&#x27;t smudge nor removed easily, i should rub it off with soap and water to rinse it, and what i also noticed was the tip of the pin</li>
            <li> I had the absolute worse problem with eye makeup ending up under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> empty handed.</li>
            <li> The color is not as pigmented as I had expected.</li>
            <li> Three days later she came to me upset that her liner dried out.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> and I have gone through quite a few different brands.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of wet liners.</li>
            <li> Its takes several applications to achieve a dark black look.</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time; I&#x27;ve had a mini sample it for almost half a year and it hasn&#x27;t gotten even close to running out, even though I use it every day.</li>
            <li> : I try to wipe the eyeliner off my hand after 20 minutes of hard-core shopping for other cosmetics.</li>
            <li> My other eyeliners sort of melt after a while, but this one doesn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li> I was extremely upset about this eye liner.</li>
            <li> I ran out the other day</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say that a few times I&#x27;ve gone to bed without taking my makeup off after a long night of partying.</li>
            <li> If it gets a little wet however, it will smear if you touch it before it dries.</li>
            <li> The one problem I have with it is that it&#x27;s sometimes hard to get the proper amount of product on the applicator.</li>
            <li> My go to before this was The Body Shop&#x27;s liquid liner, but this one beats it, hands down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got through quite a few tunes over the past couple years or so, but it does last at least a few months of even daily wear.</li>
            <li> This one will last at least 4-5 months with everyday use.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t the typical sponge like tip</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect but it is HIGHLY pigmented and stays ALL DAY with no smudging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It looks like someone dipped the pen in water and when you apply it, get this streaky mess.</li>
            <li> The formula was a little sticky even when &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;, which causes the liner to stick to the folds in my skin and then begin to wear off.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser showed me a tube of this and drew a little line, on my hand, with it.</li>
            <li> Just a little water, and one or two scrubs with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> Not worth 18.00 stick with covergirl or maybelline on this one!</li>
            <li> Using this Kat von D eyeliner, it is possible to create an endless array of looks, ranging from the everyday (the one you put on in the morning without thinking) to the dramatic (the one you want to show off in the club).</li>
            <li> waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> However, my lids are SUPER oily and the liner starts to pull away from the lashline throughout the day if I do not use a base.  </li>
            <li> My usual method of shopping for eyeliners is as follows: I walk throughout the store for 1/2 hour, during which time I draw on my hand with the prospective liners.</li>
            <li> I give them at least 1-2 minutes to set.</li>
            <li> I haven nothing negative to stay about this product.</li>
            <li> Not many eyeliners could survive my oily lids, but this one did!</li>
            <li> Several applications its a liquid eyeliner that is very difficult to do while staying uniform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wings are serious now.</li>
            <li> Results--&gt;stays put for 4-5 serious wipes with the makeup remover, then eventually comes off.</li>
            <li> product is expensive, bought from sephora dried out in 2 days returned it and got another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I mean, I was so tired one night</li>
            <li> Having hooded eyelids, I have a hard time finding liner that stays put for longer than an hour!  </li>
            <li> on the other hand very expensive for what it do</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that had a thin point for precision eyelining, but could also be built up for those nights</li>
            <li> Was not impressed with this eyeliner..was expecting a game changer</li>
            <li> I have had this liner a couple weeks shy of 1 year</li>
            <li> and im sorry</li>
            <li> Very thin liner, have to get used to it.</li>
            <li> very thin line when applied.</li>
            <li> Biggest disappointment with an eyeliner ever.</li>
            <li> Let me explain why the tattoo liner is bad, it&#x27;s the formula.</li>
            <li> So disappointed!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is BY FAR the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever owned!!! So easy to use! Delivers nice lines and isn&#x27;t messy at all! Will order a back up right away! Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the tip of this liner.  It&#x27;s a brush as opposed to a marker so it won&#x27;t fray or lose color, get worn out or anything like that.  The color is rich and dark black.  However, my lids are SUPER oily and the liner starts to pull away from the lashline throughout the day if I do not use a base.  Just something to note, and be aware of.  However, I think it&#x27;s a great product that will last a long time.  This full size will be good for about a year, and I wear thick, winged liner every single day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is for real. Perfect line every time. My wings are serious now.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner!  I was looking for something that had a thin point for precision eyelining, but could also be built up for those nights I want thicker, sexier liner.  Also, it stands up to light rubbing, but comes off easily with eye makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Reading all the previous reviews, I was expecting something better than what I actually got. While this product is great for fine lines and your upper lid, I had no trouble rubbing it off (and I suppose they make it this way in case you mess up while applying it!) and if my eyes were watery, forget it. Nothing would stay on. If you&#x27;re not putting it close to your eye, I suppose it would work better. I don&#x27;t like a lot of skin space between the eye and liner personally but it won&#x27;t apply easily near moisture like most eyeliner pens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend HIP L&#x27;OREAL eyeliner over this bar far. Stays on all day. It&#x27;s based on the Bobby Brown gel eyeliner. I&#x27;ve never seen anything better and it&#x27;s cheaper than this product is.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for the perfect eyeliner and this is it!  It is easy to apply and stays all day.  I had smudging with other eyeliners or they would dry out quickly.  This one will last at least 4-5 months with everyday use.</li>
            <li> I never have written a review but I am very passionate about not liking this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. product is expensive, bought from sephora dried out in 2 days returned it and got another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. This product does not stay on, easily smudges,wouldn&#x27;t last a full day if you didn&#x27;t blink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Its takes several applications to achieve a dark black look. Several applications its a liquid eyeliner that is very difficult to do while staying uniform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY!!!</li>
            <li> Over the last 15 years, I have owned many eyeliners. To be honest, none compare to this one. I initially bought this one in the color \\&quot;trooper\\&quot; (simple black) at Sephora. My usual method of shopping for eyeliners is as follows: I walk throughout the store for 1/2 hour, during which time I draw on my hand with the prospective liners. I give them at least 1-2 minutes to set. Then I try the following:&lt;br /&gt;1. Smudge test: Results--&gt;did not even budge.&lt;br /&gt;2. Saliva test: you can guess how this works. Results--&gt;color remains bright, no smudging after 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;3. Time test: I try to wipe the eyeliner off my hand after 20 minutes of hard-core shopping for other cosmetics. Results--&gt;still strong. If anything, stronger: stays on the skin throughout vigorous smudging attempts, as well as digestive enzyme applications (you guessed it, the saliva test repeated once again).&lt;br /&gt;4. Makeup remover test: this is what convinced me to buy this one. Results--&gt;stays put for 4-5 serious wipes with the makeup remover, then eventually comes off. After wearing this eyeliner for the last several months, I have discovered that it easily lasts throughout the day (even throughout the length of my workday, which is basically 7AM - 6PM). I withstands my eyes tearing up, hot weather (hot Texas summers) and humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: This eyeliner is for those who want precision. It has a very fine tip, which allows for superior precision with regard to drawing extremely fine lines (something I absolutely love, but which is not for everyone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I strongly value the worth of an eyeliner based on its ability to last throughout the day, this eyeliner not only delivers in function, but also in fun. Using this Kat von D eyeliner, it is possible to create an endless array of looks, ranging from the everyday (the one you put on in the morning without thinking) to the dramatic (the one you want to show off in the club). So rest assured, while you are experimenting with your look, your creation will stay put throughout the night...as well as the next morning.ok, your creation will stay put throughout the night...as well as the next morning.</li>
            <li> Shipped incredibly fast, super fine tip. SUPER EXCITED TO USE IT. Incredibly generous seller who threw in a sample mascara from benefit for my purchase. Every review deserves 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t get all the positive reviews for this product. They&#x27;re so vastly different from that I experienced, I wonder if I got a dud, but experienced the same problems with the tester in Sephora, so I don&#x27;t think I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was not pigmented AT ALL on me. Had to go over the line multiple times to get a decent black color. The formula was a little sticky even when &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;, which causes the liner to stick to the folds in my skin and then begin to wear off. It doesn&#x27;t have any staying power-- not even close to lasting throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cat eyes/winged liner is my &amp;#34;thing.&amp;#34; I won&#x27;t leave the house without it--even if I have no other makeup on. So I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different liners--Stilla, Too Faced 3 way liner, Tarte liquid eyeliner, I&#x27;ve tried it all. The best I&#x27;ve found so far is Benefit Push Up Liner. It&#x27;s not perfect but it is HIGHLY pigmented and stays ALL DAY with no smudging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one. Biggest disappointment with an eyeliner ever.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner! Stays on all day and is easy to use!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!! While it lasts, which is not long at all. The first time I used the liner, it was easy to use, went on dark and sharp. It only took about 3 uses before it started drawing on as grey and spotty. I&#x27;m sad because of how much I enjoy this liner. Probably wouldnt buy again.</li>
            <li> Having hooded eyelids, I have a hard time finding liner that stays put for longer than an hour!  This stays looking pretty good for about 6, so I&#x27;m pretty stoked about it.  It&#x27;s easy enough to apply and is a nice solid application; and I&#x27;m hopeful it will last a long time due to its cost and the fact I only wear liner for about a week, every 6-8 weeks!  Even if it dries up in between, I&#x27;ll re-order...</li>
            <li> I had the absolute worse problem with eye makeup ending up under my eyes.  I tried just about every waterproof product on the market. My hairdresser showed me a tube of this and drew a little line, on my hand, with it. After the day spent doing my normal activities, I was sold.  It easily comes off with &amp;#34;soap and water&amp;#34;. I have gone through two tubes and just purchased a third. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is one of the best eyeliners I have purchased.  It really stay on for a long time, I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner, have been using it for years. The only thing is that it dries after couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyeliner I can easily apply and that stays put. LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a liquid liner person and this one is the easiest to use. I use Tattoo liner when I&#x27;m in a moring rush and it takes me only a few minutes to get perfect lines on my eyelids. What I don&#x27;t like is the fact that at the end of the day (after 10 hours), it get smudge at the corners of my under eyes.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner is great. It survived a sweaty hot day, a thunderstorm, and not to mention, my oily lids - all in one day! Not many eyeliners could survive my oily lids, but this one did! My husband was impressed too.</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeliner. The one problem I have with it is that it&#x27;s sometimes hard to get the proper amount of product on the applicator. Otherwise it&#x27;s great, especially for liquid eyeliner newbies.</li>
            <li> I purchased one from Sephora and for anyone with doubts, have no fear. This is the BEST liquid liner pen I have ever owned. It&#x27;s easy to use and the formula stays put.  I&#x27;ve bought cheaper dupes and believe me, buy the real thing. It&#x27;s worth it to splurge on this product!</li>
            <li> This is going to be a 2 fold review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This is a great eyeliner! I put this on, and went about my day. My eye itched and without thinking, I rubbed my eye. Normally by this point, my eyeliner will be smudged everywhere... when I took out my mirror to look, the eyeliner was in place, no smudging, wasn&#x27;t even worn off. It stayed on all night. It didn&#x27;t smudge or smear or fade at all. When I washed my makeup off for the night, it came off nice and easy with a little water. So this is an excellent eyeliner. This is the first eyeliner I have seen that actually does what it says. Stays on all day, and doesn&#x27;t smudge. Was VERY happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. This isn&#x27;t the best temporary tattoo pen. Most of my temporary tattoos last a few days. I have one that I made several days ago that still hasn&#x27;t washed off. This tattoo pen works to a point. I drew a heart on my wrist, as soon as it was dry I covered it with baby powder (to set it in. just use a makeup brush to brush it in and brush off the excess powder) once I did this, it didn&#x27;t smudge or smear. It stayed on nicely. If it gets a little wet however, it will smear if you touch it before it dries. You have to let the area dry completely before touching it. If it gets a little wet and you let it dry before letting anything touch it, you&#x27;re good to go. However, once wet, it washes off really easily with a washcloth. you don&#x27;t need makeup remover, soap or anything. Just a little water, and one or two scrubs with a washcloth. So if you are looking for really temporary, temporary tattoos, it works... but it comes off really easily, so you may have to carry the pen with you to touch it up if it gets wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as an eyeliner - A++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a temporary tattoo (emphasis on the temporary) - B+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s definitely worth the buy if you&#x27;re looking for great makeup and a fun tattoo making pen.</li>
            <li> Very thin liner, have to get used to it. Very nice color!</li>
            <li> I was shopping at Sephora for a good liner pen yesterday.I was already wearing makeup of my own so I tried various ones by overlapping. The liners were all nice and I like Kat Von D&#x27;s make up line. However I was not sold on paying an arn and a leg so I went home empty handed. That night I scrubbed my waterproof make up off with some ponds cold cream; The best product I have found to remove waterproof make up w little pressure and no eye irritability. When I looked in the mirror I was suprised to see my eyes still outlined. I tried again, I woke up the next morning went to work w bare eyes, its now late at night and although it has faded my liner is still very visable. This reminds me of lipsticks that stain your lips. However it still looks nice just fading away. I&#x27;m going to wash my face in the shower tonight and I wander if it will still be there tomorrow. Overall greatly impressed but not good for people that don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday.</li>
            <li> I haven nothing negative to stay about this product. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> very thin line when applied. but it lasts for a long time.. on the other hand very expensive for what it do</li>
            <li> Love this eye liquid eye liner. Anyone that does top eye liner I recommend this! So easy and can make a perfect straight line.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s special about this at all... This liner doesn&#x27;t go on or stay any better than an ELF liner. The only added benefit is the snap close top which I assume will do more to keep the product moist and air proof.</li>
            <li> Great product, stays put when I put it on.  I would definitely buy more when I&#x27;ve used this one up</li>
            <li> Another excellent product from Kat von D</li>
            <li> BEST EYELINER I&#x27;VE EVER USED. I immediately bought it again in brown and also bought for my daughter. This is super easy to use and gives gorgeous results. I&#x27;ll want it in every color! Don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
            <li> I have severely oily skin. Nothing ever worked for me. Nothing. I tried it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well...... this one works. Hold, stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> This is really the best eyeliner out there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought quite a few eye liners and this one seems to be on of the best liquid liner I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s easy to apply and stays on for 7+ hours. One stick can be used for a very long time as well. The only downside is that it&#x27;s not waterproof, so sometimes when I accidentally rub my eyes, the liner would smudge a bit. Will definitely purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> this is the best liquid eyeliner i&#x27;ve ever had, it lasted me about 6 months before i had to restock, and i&#x27;m a regular day to day eyeliner user, give or take a few. and if you know how to use it, your make up will always be on point. this is definitely worth your money although i&#x27;m just gonna to sephora now so i don&#x27;t have to pay shipping</li>
            <li> This product is blowing my mind. I considered winged eyeliner to be a task that would always take 20 minutes and require multiple corrections with qtips to be presentable. Not with this!!! It glides on so seamlessly. Every day can be a winged eyeliner day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie and I&#x27;ve tried every waterproof liner out there. This is by far the best lasting through sweat and water. Really precise lines. I have super oily skin and sweat profusely. Stood up to intense gym work outs and all day wear. My absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> It stays put!  It lasts all day.  I love this liner.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different eyeliners, and this one is my absolute favorite. It is capable of making a very thin and precise line with the brush tip, and it lasts all day. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with smudging or flaking with this liner. It is a very bold black color and does not fade at all during the day. It also lasts a long time; I&#x27;ve had a mini sample it for almost half a year and it hasn&#x27;t gotten even close to running out, even though I use it every day. I would highly recommend this eyeliner!</li>
            <li> its not as opaque as i like and doesnt last that much, i prefer the stila one</li>
            <li> As most of us ladies can probably relate we have gone from end to end of the cosmetic shelves looking for the perfect eyeliner. Fortunately you shall look no further! My girlfriend recommended this eyeliner to me and I absolutely love it. It does not run or smudge and comes off super easy when I wash my face at night. Totally worth the few extra bucks and I recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super good at doing eyeliner, but this is really user friendly! Super fine tip! Goes where you want it to!! I only have black, but want more colors.</li>
            <li> It is waterproof, if it is a fresh tube.  The longer it is open, the less water/smudge proof it becomes.  I used it to create &amp;#34;temporary&amp;#34; type tattoos and as an eyeliner.  It is the best waterproof one I have had but it&#x27;s a bit pricey.  Especially since it seems to lose its potency over a short period of time.  Overall, its great in the beginning and then it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I love love love this eyeliner. I had read some good reviews on it, and wanted to give it a try. My other eyeliners sort of melt after a while, but this one doesn&#x27;t budge. I think it is fantastic and I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, easy to use, long lasting. I recommend it very much</li>
            <li> Awesome eyeliner and yes it&#x27;s cheaper at sephora but I do love how you guys game samples</li>
            <li> Goes on beautifully, doesn&#x27;t stay as well as I hoped</li>
            <li> This is extremely easy to apply - the brush is flexible and not stiff. However, I do have to apply multiple coats to obtain a smooth, dark shade. With one coat it&#x27;s pretty translucent. Great for drawing wings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also available at Sephora for only $20, so I&#x27;d buy there unless there isn&#x27;t a Sephora nearby.</li>
            <li> Was really amazed at the positive reviews!!!!&#x27; Worked for a week then spotty and cheap! Do Not Buy!!!!! So disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this at Sephora after I bought the ink liner. I was extremely upset about this eye liner. The ink liner is incredible which is why I was upset when I got this. Let me explain why the tattoo liner is bad, it&#x27;s the formula. The pen is great and the tip is very well made, but when you glide it, not even black. It looks like someone dipped the pen in water and when you apply it, get this streaky mess. I also have shaken the pen to maybe help this problem, but it doesn&#x27;t. Buy the ink liner, avoid this.</li>
            <li> I have had this liner a couple weeks shy of 1 year and it&#x27;s by far the best ever. I ran out the other day &amp; I miss it already cant wait for this replacement it&#x27;s worth every penny don&#x27;t hesitant it&#x27;s effortless to get a professional line, it stays put &amp; I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on how great my eyes look...</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner... easy to put on, I don&#x27;t have to go over the same line again and again. Easy for precision and long lasting saturated color. My new favorite- over my old go to Stila.</li>
            <li> Applies smooth, easily, and with precision. This is my go to eyeliner. I love it! Nice and dark and stays in place so well.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day. I have allergies and my eyes water, so like by the end of the day it is kind of smudging from the inner corner of my eyes, but the line itself over the eye line stays on all day, it goes on presised, the tip doesnt break or bend, I really liked it. I have used it for like 2 months and it hasnt run out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect for it to be this GREAT!! Once I received it which was on time, i tried a very small thin line on my hand and it didn&#x27;t smudge nor removed easily, i should rub it off with soap and water to rinse it, and what i also noticed was the tip of the pin wasn&#x27;t the typical sponge like tip it had a rubber thin tip which is very easy to apply, and the eyeliner it self is very dark black! This is an awsome pen liner truly a tattoo liner, i would totally buy it again if i ran out of this one</li>
            <li> If you want a super pigmented ultra black liner don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it. The tip is NOT felt but a bunch of bristles that work to allow you to line your eyes with so much definition. I have dark oily skin and most liquid liners especially in heat smear and look icky on me. As far as it being spotty over time I brought this from sephora in 2010 when the kvd line was somewhat new, I use it often and brought my 2nd trooper liner in 2015. It last+ it has a thing in it that you shake like a magic marker to produce more liquid... Definitely, worth the price versus investing in a bunch of cheap liners.</li>
            <li> Love it, glides on nicely and stays on</li>
            <li> The color is not as pigmented as I had expected. I have other liquid liners that I prefer more but it is great for creating the shape you want. I often use it as an outline and fill in/ go over it with another liner</li>
            <li> Was not impressed with this eyeliner..was expecting a game changer and im sorry its just not..without a primer underneath you will get flaking, its not really matte and its not the best eyeliner ever..im still on the search for the perfect one! Not worth 18.00 stick with covergirl or maybelline on this one!</li>
            <li> Been buying Stila liner for so long now, looked for something to replace it because it doesnt last too long.  This one lasts long, easy to apply and stays on long. Not necessarily waterproof, but washes off when you intend to take it off. Stays on perfect throughout the day and does not smudge. I would not put this on the eye rim though. Fantastic product, love it, will keep buying it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> I love this product so I got it for a present. Three days later she came to me upset that her liner dried out. Of course I was embarrassed. She loved the product while it lasted.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite liner and buy two at a time when I get it.  It goes on so smooth and perfect.  Love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this! Also came with a free lip linerðŸ˜„</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite liquid eyeliner. The tip is very fine and precise, and the liner itself is great, I fell asleep with it on once and in the morning it was still perfectly in place; it didn&#x27;t crust off, smudge, or budge!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite liquid liners!</li>
            <li> and planning to get one for my daughter - she saw it-tried it- and was as impressed as I  This is a fabulous product - smooth - ease of control application - great item</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  I purchased on the recommendation of an internet model who I like.  It wasn&#x27;t as good as I expected and I have gone through quite a few different brands.</li>
            <li> This is the eyeliner I have been waiting for! Precise, full coverage that does not smudge, cake, or smear...even in hot, humid weather!</li>
            <li> I wanted to get another of these since I ran out of the last one.  I looked on Sephora where it was $18.00 for the same size of the same product.  I wanted to use my Amazon gift cards to purchase it and was amazed at the price difference.  I&#x27;m going back to Sephora but wanted to give you Amazon shoppers a heads up.  Amazon has some wonderful deals, but not on this item!</li>
            <li> This is THE best Liqiud eyeliner I have ever tried. By far. It&#x27;s just fantastic, period. I&#x27;ve got through quite a few tunes over the past couple years or so, but it does last at least a few months of even daily wear. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeliner based on the good reviews it had but also because I already use the Kat Von D lock it foundation and love it so much. I dont think ill ever be  able to go back to my drugstore eyeliner now. This gives me the most amazing defined line and its almost impossible to mess up using it. It also lasts me my entire 10hr work day. I saw some reviews which worried me because some people said it faded quickly but luckily I didn&#x27;t find that to be the case and I never even need to retouch it during the day. Definitely an A+++ for me.</li>
            <li> This is  it! I jut fell in love with it you can make a thin layer or thick and is super easy to use besides that I have delicate skin and this product don&#x27;t make me feel itchiness is super great product</li>
            <li> Best liquid eyeliner I have ever used!</li>
            <li> This is the best liner I have ever used! Even for the price this liner is absolutely worth it!! I used it til it was all used up! It has the perfect design especially regarding the brush! You can literally do caligraphy with it if you wanted to haha!</li>
            <li> Great Eyeliner. Perfect, smudge free and crisp black color. OVERPRICED! It is only $18.00 at the Sephora store and if you order online, they have free shipping and free returns on $50 purchases.</li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> Best I have had in a long time!</li>
            <li> Although I was looking for something that would still be there in the morning this liner does last through the day.  The lines you are able you are able to make are very precise and fine and you are still able to thicken the line easily if you wanted. You are able to achieve such fine lines that I use it to draw bottom lashes that look natual.</li>
            <li> I love this brow liner...I wish I had known about it when I was going through chemo, because I kept accidentally wiping my drawn-on eyebrows off.  This brow liner stays on until you wash it off with soap and water or a cleanser.  You must follow the instructions of applying it to clean, dry skin.  You should apply it before applying anything to your skin after washing your face.  I have oily skin, and I love the fact that I can wipe my face with tissues and never worry about wiping off my brows.</li>
            <li> Got it for temp tattoos. Wasn&#x27;t great for that, but became my fav eyeliner!</li>
            <li> I loved it. Last forever. I had been looking for makeup that doesn&#x27;t smug or wear off. I will continue to purchase this type of makeup Thank you</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; fast serr!</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner I have ever used!! Recommend it highly..</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeliner in the sephora store and as soon as I tried it it worked perfectly. I love how the eyeliner doesn&#x27;t have the little sponge like most eyeliner this one has brush hairs and it helps the shape of the line for your eye it makes it thin and perfect ðŸ‘Œ</li>
            <li> Product as described. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have tried SEVERAL liquid eyeliners and this one BY FAR is the best liquid eyeliner I have ever used (and I&#x27;ve been using eyeliner for over 15 years!). My go to before this was The Body Shop&#x27;s liquid liner, but this one beats it, hands down. This has staying power. It doesn&#x27;t fade, doesn&#x27;t smudge off during the day, lasts throughout the work day and then some. I mean, I was so tired one night, I slept with the eyeliner on overnight. Woke up and the eyeliner was still intact and had not faded. I don&#x27;t recommend going to bed with makeup on, obviously, but that just tells you the staying power of this liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my liner at Sephora for cheaper; it&#x27;s available in brush form and felt tip form. I prefer felt tip because it&#x27;s more precise / I have more control over it. Plus, the felt tip makes it quicker to apply in the morning before work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend this liner!!! :)</li>
            <li> The easiest eyeliner to do a cat eye with. Very sturdy, the tip doesn&#x27;t lose its shape throughout using. Lasts all day long. Although if you&#x27;re looking for something that would last overnight, this one is not the best bet.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of wet liners. This beats all of them! Let&#x27;s just say that a few times I&#x27;ve gone to bed without taking my makeup off after a long night of partying. When I woke up my eye shadow was gone but the liner was in tact! It comes off easily with soap and water though.HUGE plus.</li>
            <li> This liner goes on smoothly and is easily controlled so that you can create thick or thin lines:)  I really like the shape of the eyeliner, too.  It makes more sense to hold it like a pencil!</li>
