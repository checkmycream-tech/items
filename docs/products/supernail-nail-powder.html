            <li>I must say, this powder is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Do Your Own Nails at Home or Just Save Money on Fills  See full instructions at  [...]  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, and didn&#x27;t clamp when putting on.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The acrylic dries very quickly and gets stuck on the brush.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I may not keep searching, My first time using it</li>
            <li>Easy to file to make it smooth</li>
            <li>it worked just fine, I have grown out my nails and wanted some added strength</li>
            <li>Very good product, as I expected.</li>
            <li>Used for my acrylic glitter mixes works great goes on smooth hold and last for a while</li>
            <li>The jar comes filled with product to the rim.</li>
            <li>This stuff works good so far.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Product does not last for more than week, it starts chipping and its just not that much of a good qaulity.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, super light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very new with learning how to do my own nails at home.</li>
            <li>another person said this has a gritty consistency , but this may most likely be because of my inexperience and not having the perfect liquid to powder</li>
            <li>Its very fine so you wont get a bumpy finish that needs too much filing.</li>
            <li>was last night and so far it&#x27;s just awesome!</li>
            <li>Just got it right now!</li>
            <li>Good color, never yellow.</li>
            <li>arrived on time , full container , packaged neatly .</li>
            <li>This powder is good if your a beginner in learning to do acrylic nails, they pop off the next day!</li>
            <li>Only good for a quick fix for an event.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that it would work fine for and acrylic overlay, but for acrygel application it&#x27;s not milled fine enough.</li>
            <li>However, the seller sent out the products quickly.</li>
            <li>lasts a while,  pretty sure will be ordering this product again in the future other than that I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product!</li>
            <li>I bought this to strengthen the tip of weak nails and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I spent hours roaming the amazon trying to find a good product.</li>
            <li>I have to say, this product line was so awesome that once I finished my nails, it seriously looked as though I had them done in a salon!</li>
            <li>I gave up on doing my own nails a long time ago because I couldn&#x27;t find any acrylic powder that didn&#x27;t lift or more importantly turn yellow.  </li>
            <li>I immediately knew I made the right purchase.</li>
            <li>so obviously my nails aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; but the actual acrylic is great.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable, too.</li>
            <li>I was just hoping it was more than what you get when you buy a kit at the store (which is TINY)</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that it sets very quickly.</li>
            <li>Dries clear &amp; quick.</li>
            <li>Its a pretty decent size and amount</li>
            <li>No false bottoms,etc.</li>
            <li>(Haha) I&#x27;ve used the store-bought versions and you could see every grain of powder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>some even were said to be only halfway filled.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so much powder in there</li>
            <li>i got the 2 ounce container in clear and the container is smaller than i expected but it works pretty good  </li>
            <li>, I am very happy to know that this small jar will last a very long time, so the price and quality are outstanding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>See partial instructions for the same product at The Only 2 oz jar of Super Nail Supernail Acrylic Powder on Amazon with a 30 day 3D Warranty against Delay, Dislike, or Damage: get refund or free replacement ~ Original Brand ~</li>
            <li>I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be enough but its more than enough..</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend</li>
            <li>Will last me a long time :)</li>
            <li>Definitely getting ur money worth</li>
            <li>But right now my nails are damaged by artifical nails and really short.</li>
            <li>The container says clear powder but the actual powder is more natural and not clear at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sure I would buy it again for this reason, but I&#x27;m happy with the large amount of product for a small price</li>
            <li>in mind, I used this same brand name for the whole nail process!</li>
            <li>&amp; it came early !</li>
            <li>Seems like the exact same stuff they use in the salons.</li>
            <li>This powder I used with the liquid and its extremely cheap although expensive, and the product doesn&#x27;t set good like other acrylics.</li>
            <li>so far maybe I&#x27;ll come back with a better rating after I get my other things in the mail.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with some old eyeshadow of mine to make some pretty acrylic nail colors</li>
            <li>I ordered clear powder.</li>
            <li>works well and comes out clear .</li>
            <li>It goes on cloudy but sets up clear</li>
            <li>I use acrylic on my natural nails kinda like an acrylic overlay.</li>
            <li>I can see my natural nail through this acrylic powder.</li>
            <li>When used with the Supernail liquid it does set very fast, a little too fast for me as a beginner.</li>
            <li>Would&#x27;ve gotten 5 stars if the powder had actually been clear.</li>
            <li>This powder is white (clear).</li>
            <li>I will be going to school soon for Nail Technology but cannot currently purchase professional products.</li>
            <li>you can see from the photos it comes full and the the jar is in no way small.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really crazy about this product as it&#x27;s very grainy, so you have to do a lot of extra filing and buffing to achieve the smooth, salon results that you are looking for.</li>

            <li> Many other products I saw selling for the same price and had false bottoms or were misrepresented in size in some way</li>
            <li> Its also a lot of product so this will last me a really long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and it does say clear, but when I put it on it looks a little bit cloudy over my white tips...</li>
            <li> I definitely will buy the pink and white powder!</li>
            <li> Supernail, like other acrylic powders, depends on proper application, to avoid lifting and breaking, etc.  </li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> A lot comes in that little 2 ounce jar!</li>
            <li> It requires a lot of filling and what&#x27;s very sad is that the nails just popped off in a few days which gave me a bad reputation as a professional.</li>
            <li> so I just did two thin layers</li>
            <li> Some unhappy people don&#x27;t read the instructions for applying it, like priming and using the correct brush and dabbing not sliding the brush, etc.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I got this I was prepared to be disappointed, I wasn&#x27;t.</li>

This powder is very fine and there are no worries about having your nails look like you used sand! (Haha) I&#x27;ve used the store-bought versions and you could see every grain of powder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I am very happy to know that this small jar will last a very long time, so the price and quality are outstanding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, I used this same brand name for the whole nail process! (Primer, liquid &amp; powder)</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money. It lifts and does not hold. I will not purchase it again. However, the seller sent out the products quickly.</li>
            <li> Used for my acrylic glitter mixes works great goes on smooth hold and last for a while</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and didn&#x27;t clamp when putting on. Easy to file to make it smooth and I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I used it once and it did the trick. No issues.... I will order the product again...</li>
            <li> This powder I used with the liquid and its extremely cheap although expensive, and the product doesn&#x27;t set good like other acrylics. It requires a lot of filling and what&#x27;s very sad is that the nails just popped off in a few days which gave me a bad reputation as a professional.</li>
            <li> Shipping is pretty good,  price is good too for the size you get....  lasts a while,  pretty sure will be ordering this product again in the future other than that I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this to strengthen the tip of weak nails and it works perfectly.  The price was very reasonable, too.</li>
            <li> Even tho I didn&#x27;t go to school to learn how to do acrylic nails I must say, this powder is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I will be going to school soon for Nail Technology but cannot currently purchase professional products. Supernail works well for me doing my own nails at home. This powder is very fine, doesn&#x27;t crystallize or leave bubbles/cloudiness. I&#x27;ve used it as a filler to create custom glitter acrylics and it does just what I need it to do. When used with the Supernail liquid it does set very fast, a little too fast for me as a beginner. Not sure I would buy it again for this reason, but I&#x27;m happy with the large amount of product for a small price and I will use it up!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. It comes with a lot of powder defiantly enough to last a while. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Some unhappy people don&#x27;t read the instructions for applying it, like priming and using the correct brush and dabbing not sliding the brush, etc.  Supernail, like other acrylic powders, depends on proper application, to avoid lifting and breaking, etc.  See partial instructions for the same product at The Only 2 oz jar of Super Nail Supernail Acrylic Powder on Amazon with a 30 day 3D Warranty against Delay, Dislike, or Damage: get refund or free replacement ~ Original Brand ~ Do Your Own Nails at Home or Just Save Money on Fills  See full instructions at  [...]  [...]    It is probably not the fault of the brand, but the application, that will cause lifting.</li>
            <li> I love this product...I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be enough but its more than enough.. I definitely will buy the pink and white powder!</li>
            <li> Just got it right now! &amp; it came early !</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> My search for the perfect acrylic powder and liquid has ended. This brand is great quality at an affordable price. I ordered the 4oz powder and I recieved all 4 oz. No false bottoms,etc. This powder combined with this brand of liquid does not yellow or lift. The only downfall is that it sets very quickly. I would not recommend to a beginner for this reason only. Give this brand a try. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used this as soon as I got it in and my nails look great no yellowing. The only problem I have had is my nails break off but I think that is my fault for not applying a heavier coating and using a cheaper liquid acrylic but for the price the powder is really a great buy!</li>
            <li> This stuff works good so far. I&#x27;ve had my nails on a couple days. I haven&#x27;t did lengthy nails yet. Easy to apply. I will be ordering this again. Glad I ordered two containers.</li>
            <li> Really great product! It works well every application! Good color, never yellow. It is every bit what I needed in a nail product.</li>
            <li> Very good product, as I expected. Thanks</li>
            <li> I ordered clear powder. The container says clear powder but the actual powder is more natural and not clear at all.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, it&#x27;s a pretty good powder and a good deal for the price. Would&#x27;ve gotten 5 stars if the powder had actually been clear.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and it does say clear, but when I put it on it looks a little bit cloudy over my white tips... It&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li> I bought this to sprinkle on top of my gel polish to make my nails stronger and worked great. Its also a lot of product so this will last me a really long time.</li>
            <li> great size.. But everyones nails I did kept poping off... this doesn&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li> Best acrylic powder I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Works well. I am still learning how to do my own nails but seems to d the job, Will buy again,</li>
            <li> great value for 2 oz jar. good product . recieved on time</li>
            <li> arrived on time , full container , packaged neatly . works well and comes out clear . great for the price and would definitaley purchase again</li>
            <li> Easy to use, super light. Dries clear &amp; quick.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I spent hours roaming the amazon trying to find a good product. Many other products I saw selling for the same price and had false bottoms or were misrepresented in size in some way some even were said to be only halfway filled. When I got this I was prepared to be disappointed, I wasn&#x27;t. I have attached photos to show you what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like another person said this has a gritty consistency , but this may most likely be because of my inexperience and not having the perfect liquid to powder ratio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see from the photos it comes full and the the jar is in no way small.</li>
            <li> Easiest powder I have used to apply.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> Very good buy. I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m able to get a good size for the price because I love doing my own nails.</li>
            <li> Love the size of this bottle. I use acrylic on my natural nails kinda like an acrylic overlay. But right now my nails are damaged by artifical nails and really short.</li>
            <li> Love this plently of products (:</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really crazy about this product as it&#x27;s very grainy, so you have to do a lot of extra filing and buffing to achieve the smooth, salon results that you are looking for. I&#x27;m sure that it would work fine for and acrylic overlay, but for acrygel application it&#x27;s not milled fine enough.</li>
            <li> This powder is so far the best I&#x27;ve used and I can honestly say I may not keep searching, My first time using it was last night and so far it&#x27;s just awesome! I&#x27;m still just learning/teaching my self how to do my own nails so obviously my nails aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; but the actual acrylic is great. Plus, it&#x27;s a nice size. I was just hoping it was more than what you get when you buy a kit at the store (which is TINY) but when I got this all I can say is compared to that tiny one this one is huge! Will last me a long time :)</li>
            <li> This powder works great I mixed it with some old eyeshadow of mine to make some pretty acrylic nail colors and it worked great with this powder and along with the supernail monomer I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> i got the 2 ounce container in clear and the container is smaller than i expected but it works pretty good  and the shipping was great it came on time and the packaging was good too!</li>
            <li> i just got mines just two day after ordering. Its a pretty decent size and amount</li>
            <li> Great product. Seems like the exact same stuff they use in the salons.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so much powder in there it seams like it will last forever literally !! Definitely getting ur money worth</li>
            <li> It goes on cloudy but sets up clear I can see my natural nail through this acrylic powder. I like it so far maybe I&#x27;ll come back with a better rating after I get my other things in the mail.</li>
            <li> Product does not last for more than week, it starts chipping and its just not that much of a good qaulity. Only good for a quick fix for an event.</li>
            <li> This powder is good if your a beginner in learning to do acrylic nails, they pop off the next day! if you want your nails to lay this isn&#x27;t the powder for you</li>
            <li> i love it its perfect</li>
            <li> So much better than the brand I purchased at the convenient store, lol. Thank you</li>
            <li> This powder is white (clear). Its very fine so you wont get a bumpy finish that needs too much filing. The jar comes filled with product to the rim. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to do the *dip it* - Acrygel and it worked just fine, I have grown out my nails and wanted some added strength so I just did two thin layers and I&#x27;m happy with it. looks a bit cloudy so I will just add some color to it. I will try to show a photo</li>
            <li> The acrylic dries very quickly and gets stuck on the brush. I just need more practice applying the acrylic to my nails. Over all, I like it. A lot comes in that little 2 ounce jar! It&#x27;s going to last me a while.</li>
            <li> I gave up on doing my own nails a long time ago because I couldn&#x27;t find any acrylic powder that didn&#x27;t lift or more importantly turn yellow.  This product is amazing.  I immediately knew I made the right purchase. I&#x27;m so satisfied.  No yellow tint or lifting.  Everyone thinks I went to the nail shop. I posted a photo also.</li>
