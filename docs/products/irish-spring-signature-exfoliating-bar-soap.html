            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for that, they may not be the best choice.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s especially nice to use if you shower just before bed, because you&#x27;re going to crawl under the sheets and drift off into a pleasant waterfall-like dream-state as you&#x27;re transported to the Emerald Isle...</li>
            <li>It has a roughness to it that feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li>scent is great.</li>
            <li>This 3-pack of individually-wrapped bars of soap is quite good.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints, but I doubt that I would seek this out for purchase, unless there was a really good sale.</li>
            <li>This is good soap.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is good soap for all the purposes I use soap for.</li>
            <li>The soap doesn&#x27;t leave any funky residue and the exfoliating texture feels good.</li>
            <li>3 full size bars with an awesome scent that also exfoliates the skin.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but not overly strong.  </li>
            <li>First off, this soap has a very pleasant scent, lathers well, and washes away nicely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a just-showered smell...</li>
            <li>This exfoliating soap is very close to perfect.</li>
            <li>Good deodorant soap with a pleasant sloughing texture and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Rinses off very easily and leaves you feeling &amp;</li>
            <li>This soap targets men for sure.  </li>
            <li>The packaging and size feels more like an artisanal soap.  </li>
            <li>Love the feel of the lather as I wasusing it.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed by the sheer size of this bar of soap...</li>
            <li>Marketed to men, but the scent would be ok for most folks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells great and leaves skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild, nice and understated.</li>
            <li>So overall a very nice soap, and if you already love the Irish Spring scent, then I think you may have found the perfect bar.</li>
            <li>This product is great, as far as bar soaps go.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely be buying MORE of this great soap.</li>
            <li>It has a very mild scent and my husband likes it.</li>
            <li>I do not like soaps/detergents with strong fragrances.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not so strong that it sticks to you.</li>
            <li>These are substantial, rectangular shaped bars that are comfortable and easy to grip and stay put.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really happy that I got to try the Irish Spring Signature For Men Exfoliating Bar Soap and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li>Fantastic scent.  </li>
            <li>The scent is masculine, pleasant and clean.</li>
            <li>Smells super strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mild, manly scent, is a good sized bar of soap that last longer than other brands, is a good price, and also included exfoliating scrubbing &#x27;bits&#x27; that provide a nice, gentle yet effective exfoliation.</li>
            <li>There are many mentions of &amp;#34;Man&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;Men&amp;#34; throughout its packaging - too funny.  </li>
            <li>My husband likes it and it leaves a pleasant Irish Spring scent.  </li>
            <li>It has strong suds, and smells fresh while providing benefits without having to apply any pressure.</li>
            <li>Neither the color or the smell of the bar scream a particular gender; I think a good performing soap would be appreciated by anyone.</li>
            <li>Neither the color or the smell of the bar scream a particular gender; I think a good performing soap would be appreciated by anyone.</li>
            <li>So they allow a good grip and last a lot longer.</li>
            <li>lather was a pleasant surprise because the bar was labeled as \\&quot;exfoliating.\\&quot; The exfoliating component is oatmeal, a mild scrub when wet and</li>

            <li>I love this new bar and put one in each of three showers where they&#x27;ve proved to be a hit with both genders.</li>
            <li>The bars are block shaped, I think if they were slightly rounded or contoured, they would be more effective to use.  </li>
            <li>Fresh, crisp, and clean.</li>
            <li>Be warned, these bars are huge, much bigger than most, and the corners aren&#x27;t rounded off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked how Irish Spring smells.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d say these are worth trying.</li>
            <li>It feels good going on and isn&#x27;t rough on the skin - but still feels manly, whatever</li>
            <li>This bar is more natural in color with visible oatmeal.</li>
            <li>I think I would have preferred a more neutral (like Lever 2000 or Ivory) or an earthy natural scent like Shea butter or sandalwood, but you get used to the scent pretty quickly</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a pleasantly scented bar soap that lathers up big and then rinses clean to leave your skin feeling smooth, this might be exactly what you want, regardless of how big your hands are.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;ll get you clean and ready to go.</li>
            <li>He likes the smell and wants to see how his skin is after using for a full week.</li>
            <li>The soap was slightly drying, but it did clean and leave a nice scent and did, in fact, exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;Fix</li>
            <li>At $4.99, these 6 inch blocks are a great bargain; they certainly last a lot longer than standard soaps.</li>
            <li>Irish Spring exfoliating soap is really quite great: seriously, this is my husband&#x27;s new favorite soap!!</li>
            <li>- the product smells just like the wonderful green version of soap - it&#x27;s a crisp scent that takes you back to the waterfalls of Ireland (are there waterfalls in Ireland?)</li>
            <li>A good product that could use a little improvement.  </li>
            <li>It smells pretty snazzy too.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>There are just not enough oatmeal bits to do a believable job of exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s just about the size, maybe a better designation would have been \\&quot;FOR BIG HANDS.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s just about the size, maybe a better designation would have been \\&quot;FOR BIG HANDS.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I was expecting something more along the lines of the Irish Spring soap I used years ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unmistakably based off of the original Irish Spring scent, which smells clean, spicy and sporty.</li>
            <li>This is the classic, pleasant scent that everyone loves with just a little bit of grit in it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent, but it wore off pretty quickly after a shower, unlike regular Irish Spring soap.</li>
            <li>I am most interested in the bar for the purposes of exfoliating skin in areas that get dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li>That product really exfoliates (maybe too much so)!</li>
            <li>it was pretty much unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>The soap does feel more moisturing than the classic Irish Spring soap.  </li>
            <li>The first use had a light pather, but subsequent uses  brought a lots of lather and exfoliation.</li>
            <li>My dry areas are on my legs and a contoured bar would work better in washing those areas.</li>
            <li>As with any Irish Spring product the soap has a fragrance to it, but it doesn&#x27;t appear to be that strong to me.</li>
            <li>pack of three large soap bars which are described as &amp;#34;man sized&amp;#34; - which basically means they are hearty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The size of the bar is awkwardly large.</li>
            <li>Certainly it works well to scrub.</li>
            <li>But as a regular, everyday shower soap, they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, I really like it too.</li>
            <li>Really really like this soap.</li>
            <li>but in a much nicer way.</li>
            <li>However, if you really want exfoliation, find another soap or get a jar of the apricot scrub.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t bring to mind \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; so much as it did \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;outside.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t get the \\&quot;FOR MEN\\&quot; designation.</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t get the \\&quot;FOR MEN\\&quot; designation.</li>
            <li>but don&#x27;t really feel the exfoliating properties of this product.</li>
            <li>This soap has a more delicate scent, a white color, and the trendy milled oats added.</li>
            <li>The soap is advertised as &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34;, and while I have no way of telling if it is, I will say that after using this soap my skin (and therefore myself) feels really refreshed.</li>
            <li>Since it is a soap it does give me the &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling, which I don&#x27;t mind so much.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much in the exfoliating department, in spite of the flakes of oatmeal dispersed throughout.</li>
            <li>They are really in the mid-range size for oat bars.  </li>
            <li>I typically use a body wash, and this is the first time in many years I&#x27;ve used a bar soap exclusively.</li>
            <li>Personally I like the fresh smell that lasts through the first part of my day.</li>
            <li>It  seems to last a reasonable amount of time and smells fresh.</li>
            <li>This Irish Spring soap is a nice product, and offers more benefits than the regular line in that it exfoliates the dead skin cells through exfoliation.</li>
            <li>That version was neon green and its smell was almost overwhelming but the main issue I had was rinsing it off.</li>
            <li>My skin, particularly my face, feels very clean and tight after using this soap.</li>
            <li>and easily dwarf other soaps.</li>
            <li>Stick with the normal sized soap.</li>
            <li>The scent is lighter than that of the green bars, refreshing without overpowering.</li>
            <li>I found the soap ok at doing this, though I would offer a few suggestions.  </li>
            <li>The off white appearance with little bits of natural scrubby husks is very appealing to the eye.</li>
            <li>meaning I dropped the soap more often than I usually do.  </li>
            <li>My hubby normally uses the Jack Black exfoliating soap, so we were familiar with this type of product.</li>
            <li>In the hand, the over-sized bar starts off a little too large for its sharp corners, but after a shower or two the bars fits well in your hand and feels great for longer than other soaps.</li>
            <li>If it is the same, it&#x27;s nicely proportioned and not overwhelming as in the old bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Typically he has preferred Dove for men, with the exfoliating clean, but he prefers the size, lasting power, scent and mild exfoliation of this new IRISH SPRING Signature for Men exfoliating soap over the Dove men&#x27;s brand.</li>
            <li>While it says nothing about having an added lotion or a moisturizing component, my skin felt as if I had applied lotion when I was completely</li>
            <li>While it says nothing about having an added lotion or a moisturizing component, my skin felt as if I had applied lotion when I was completely</li>
            <li>As far as the &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; aspect goes, I just don&#x27;t get why you would want &amp;</li>
            <li>To be honest I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Irish Spring&#x27;s traditional smells, but I can get into this stuff and still feel like a man.</li>
            <li>Then again, it&#x27;s soap, after a few weeks of use it&#x27;ll fit just fine in small hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then again, it&#x27;s soap, after a few weeks of use it&#x27;ll fit just fine in small hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not leave behind a filmy feeling, and washes off clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for low water pressure.  </li>
            <li>The bars are HUGE as well (far larger and heavier than typical cakes of soap)!  </li>
            <li>The soap itself has a very slight exfoliating feel, just a little bit grainy against your skin and what I most like about it, is that it doesn&#x27;t have that strong Irish spring green soap scent from the 70s and 80s.</li>
            <li>I expected something that was a little more coarse.  </li>
            <li>It makes for an unusual texture, and it looks cool to see all of these little spiky bits protruding from the bar, but my skin really doesn&#x27;t feel any different than it does after showering with my usual soap (Dial).</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells, feels on skin, the only complaint is, the bar is &amp;#34;man sized&amp;#34; and that makes it extra drop-able.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is a big, hefty bar of soap, which must be why it&#x27;s billed as for men.</li>
            <li>what differentiates this Irish Spring product from the rest is the &amp;#34;exfoliating scrub&amp;#34; element - oak that gives your skin a light abrasive cleaning and really gets those dead skin cells off and down the drain.</li>
            <li>That was obviously not the old Irish Spring&#x27;s fault, but it didn&#x27;t help my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That had a strong scent, a green and white color, and was typical body soap.</li>

            <li> That product really exfoliates (maybe too much so)!</li>
            <li> it was pretty much unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> The soap does feel more moisturing than the classic Irish Spring soap.  </li>
            <li> The first use had a light pather, but subsequent uses  brought a lots of lather and exfoliation.</li>
            <li> My dry areas are on my legs and a contoured bar would work better in washing those areas.</li>
            <li> As with any Irish Spring product the soap has a fragrance to it, but it doesn&#x27;t appear to be that strong to me.</li>
            <li> pack of three large soap bars which are described as &amp;#34;man sized&amp;#34; - which basically means they are hearty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The size of the bar is awkwardly large.</li>
            <li> Certainly it works well to scrub.</li>
            <li> But as a regular, everyday shower soap, they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I really like it too.</li>
            <li> Really really like this soap.</li>
            <li> but in a much nicer way.</li>
            <li> However, if you really want exfoliation, find another soap or get a jar of the apricot scrub.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bring to mind \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; so much as it did \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;outside.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t get the \\&quot;FOR MEN\\&quot; designation.</li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t get the \\&quot;FOR MEN\\&quot; designation.</li>
            <li> but don&#x27;t really feel the exfoliating properties of this product.</li>
            <li> This soap has a more delicate scent, a white color, and the trendy milled oats added.</li>
            <li> The soap is advertised as &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34;, and while I have no way of telling if it is, I will say that after using this soap my skin (and therefore myself) feels really refreshed.</li>
            <li> Since it is a soap it does give me the &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling, which I don&#x27;t mind so much.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much in the exfoliating department, in spite of the flakes of oatmeal dispersed throughout.</li>
            <li> They are really in the mid-range size for oat bars.  </li>
            <li> I typically use a body wash, and this is the first time in many years I&#x27;ve used a bar soap exclusively.</li>
            <li> Personally I like the fresh smell that lasts through the first part of my day.</li>
            <li> It  seems to last a reasonable amount of time and smells fresh.</li>
            <li> This Irish Spring soap is a nice product, and offers more benefits than the regular line in that it exfoliates the dead skin cells through exfoliation.</li>
            <li> That version was neon green and its smell was almost overwhelming but the main issue I had was rinsing it off.</li>
            <li> My skin, particularly my face, feels very clean and tight after using this soap.</li>
            <li> and easily dwarf other soaps.</li>
            <li> Stick with the normal sized soap.</li>
            <li> The scent is lighter than that of the green bars, refreshing without overpowering.</li>
            <li> I found the soap ok at doing this, though I would offer a few suggestions.  </li>
            <li> The off white appearance with little bits of natural scrubby husks is very appealing to the eye.</li>
            <li> meaning I dropped the soap more often than I usually do.  </li>
            <li> My hubby normally uses the Jack Black exfoliating soap, so we were familiar with this type of product.</li>
            <li> In the hand, the over-sized bar starts off a little too large for its sharp corners, but after a shower or two the bars fits well in your hand and feels great for longer than other soaps.</li>
            <li> If it is the same, it&#x27;s nicely proportioned and not overwhelming as in the old bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Typically he has preferred Dove for men, with the exfoliating clean, but he prefers the size, lasting power, scent and mild exfoliation of this new IRISH SPRING Signature for Men exfoliating soap over the Dove men&#x27;s brand.</li>
            <li> While it says nothing about having an added lotion or a moisturizing component, my skin felt as if I had applied lotion when I was completely</li>
            <li> While it says nothing about having an added lotion or a moisturizing component, my skin felt as if I had applied lotion when I was completely</li>
            <li> As far as the &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; aspect goes, I just don&#x27;t get why you would want &amp;</li>
            <li> To be honest I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Irish Spring&#x27;s traditional smells, but I can get into this stuff and still feel like a man.</li>
            <li> Then again, it&#x27;s soap, after a few weeks of use it&#x27;ll fit just fine in small hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then again, it&#x27;s soap, after a few weeks of use it&#x27;ll fit just fine in small hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not leave behind a filmy feeling, and washes off clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for low water pressure.  </li>
            <li> The bars are HUGE as well (far larger and heavier than typical cakes of soap)!  </li>
            <li> The soap itself has a very slight exfoliating feel, just a little bit grainy against your skin and what I most like about it, is that it doesn&#x27;t have that strong Irish spring green soap scent from the 70s and 80s.</li>
            <li> I expected something that was a little more coarse.  </li>
            <li> It makes for an unusual texture, and it looks cool to see all of these little spiky bits protruding from the bar, but my skin really doesn&#x27;t feel any different than it does after showering with my usual soap (Dial).</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells, feels on skin, the only complaint is, the bar is &amp;#34;man sized&amp;#34; and that makes it extra drop-able.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is a big, hefty bar of soap, which must be why it&#x27;s billed as for men.</li>
            <li> what differentiates this Irish Spring product from the rest is the &amp;#34;exfoliating scrub&amp;#34; element - oak that gives your skin a light abrasive cleaning and really gets those dead skin cells off and down the drain.</li>
            <li> That was obviously not the old Irish Spring&#x27;s fault, but it didn&#x27;t help my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That had a strong scent, a green and white color, and was typical body soap.</li>
            <li> I like Irish Spring and like this new slightly spa like product, especially after a long winter with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Out of its wrapper, it looks \\&quot;artesian,\\&quot; like the upscale small batch specialty brand soaps that can cost three times as much.</li>
            <li> and they should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating wasn&#x27;t as harsh as I expected it to be and was probably a little too mild.  </li>
            <li> Large bars are hard to hold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s designed to exfoliate and scrub the skin, but it&#x27;s hard to tell how much exfoliation it does.</li>
            <li> Using the larger bars was a little more difficult...</li>
            <li> or it didn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> My hand held water spray sluiced through the lather and when I was dry</li>
            <li> These are definitely bigger than the average soap bars.  </li>
            <li> The soap is much bigger than your average bar.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe how it has just a little grit, but it&#x27;s really not that noticeable going on although you certainly feel it in your hands.</li>
            <li> and with a peppery man-scent aftertaste.</li>
            <li> I do agree with another reviewer that there is minimal exfoliating for this exfoliating soap.  </li>
            <li> I expected these &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; bars to have a stronger smell than they did.  </li>
            <li> But seriously, there&#x27;s really no scent like Irish Spring -</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the soap, just my expectations were too much.</li>
            <li> It had this odd curve too.</li>
            <li> Small, even medium size, hands could find this bar uncomfortable to hold, as I did at first.</li>
            <li> It seems slightly milder than the body wash</li>
            <li> It works just as well as the Jack Black brand at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> He likes that it wasn&#x27;t  too harsh for his skin</li>
            <li> For one thing, while it has nothing to do with performance, I like that it doesn&#x27;t have that unnatural green color.</li>
            <li> When wet, if I grabbed it wrong, it would shoot through my hand across the shower like a missile.</li>
            <li> Price isn&#x27;t bad either considering you&#x27;re getting the equivalent of 6 regular sized bars.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t bad, but it doesn&#x27;t match the look of the bar and makes it smell a little less &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34;.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I like the feel of this soap. It has a roughness to it that feels great on the skin. It smells pretty snazzy too. To be honest I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Irish Spring&#x27;s traditional smells, but I can get into this stuff and still feel like a man.</li>
            <li> My brother says he loves this exfoliating soap. He likes that it wasn&#x27;t  too harsh for his skin or it didn&#x27;t dry it out. He likes the smell and wants to see how his skin is after using for a full week.</li>
            <li> Irish Spring exfoliating soap is really quite great: seriously, this is my husband&#x27;s new favorite soap!! Typically he has preferred Dove for men, with the exfoliating clean, but he prefers the size, lasting power, scent and mild exfoliation of this new IRISH SPRING Signature for Men exfoliating soap over the Dove men&#x27;s brand. I have to admit, I really like it too. It&#x27;s a mild, manly scent, is a good sized bar of soap that last longer than other brands, is a good price, and also included exfoliating scrubbing &#x27;bits&#x27; that provide a nice, gentle yet effective exfoliation. Really really like this soap. It does not leave behind a filmy feeling, and washes off clean and fresh. Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked how Irish Spring smells. Fresh, crisp, and clean. You get that signature scent in these exfoliating soap bars geared towards guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bars are 6 oz. and easily dwarf other soaps. So they allow a good grip and last a lot longer. One bar lasted me over three weeks, showering once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On those two notes, I&#x27;d say these are worth trying. The only con I observed was the exfoliating factor. For me, it was unnoticeable. So if you&#x27;re looking for that, they may not be the best choice. But as a regular, everyday shower soap, they&#x27;re great. Price isn&#x27;t bad either considering you&#x27;re getting the equivalent of 6 regular sized bars.</li>
            <li> Freshness abounds in the Irish Spring Signature Exfoliating Bar Soap (try typing that three times fast).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you get?&lt;br /&gt;A pack of three large soap bars which are described as &amp;#34;man sized&amp;#34; - which basically means they are hearty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do they smell like?&lt;br /&gt;Irish Spring.&lt;br /&gt;Yep - the product smells just like the wonderful green version of soap - it&#x27;s a crisp scent that takes you back to the waterfalls of Ireland (are there waterfalls in Ireland?) and with a peppery man-scent aftertaste. But seriously, there&#x27;s really no scent like Irish Spring - it&#x27;s been one of my fav scents of soap since Lava soap of years gone by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And speaking of Lava soap...what differentiates this Irish Spring product from the rest is the &amp;#34;exfoliating scrub&amp;#34; element - oak that gives your skin a light abrasive cleaning and really gets those dead skin cells off and down the drain. It feels good going on and isn&#x27;t rough on the skin - but still feels manly, whatever that means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the soap (if I can get practical for just a moment) I noticed that the pleasing scent lingers for a while after showering. It sort of doubles as body spray / cologne but in a much nicer way. Personally I like the fresh smell that lasts through the first part of my day. It&#x27;s kind of a just-showered smell...and it&#x27;s especially nice to use if you shower just before bed, because you&#x27;re going to crawl under the sheets and drift off into a pleasant waterfall-like dream-state as you&#x27;re transported to the Emerald Isle...I&#x27;m getting carried away here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a solid product from Irish Spring and I will definitely be buying MORE of this great soap. Solid 4 stars!</li>
            <li> The size of the bar is awkwardly large. Stick with the normal sized soap.</li>
            <li> This soap targets men for sure.  There are many mentions of &amp;#34;Man&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;Men&amp;#34; throughout its packaging - too funny.  The bars are HUGE as well (far larger and heavier than typical cakes of soap)!  The packaging and size feels more like an artisanal soap.  My husband likes it and it leaves a pleasant Irish Spring scent.  I do agree with another reviewer that there is minimal exfoliating for this exfoliating soap.  There are just not enough oatmeal bits to do a believable job of exfoliating.  The soap does feel more moisturing than the classic Irish Spring soap.  However, if you really want exfoliation, find another soap or get a jar of the apricot scrub.  That product really exfoliates (maybe too much so)!</li>
            <li> This product is great, as far as bar soaps go. The first use had a light pather, but subsequent uses  brought a lots of lather and exfoliation. The scent is masculine, pleasant and clean. Not overpowering at all. One bar lasts quite a while and the exfoliation lasts throughout. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> We tried Irish Spring one time, decades ago and didn&#x27;t like it. That version was neon green and its smell was almost overwhelming but the main issue I had was rinsing it off. I felt as if it left a film on my body. It had this odd curve too. When wet, if I grabbed it wrong, it would shoot through my hand across the shower like a missile. That was obviously not the old Irish Spring&#x27;s fault, but it didn&#x27;t help my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy that I got to try the Irish Spring Signature For Men Exfoliating Bar Soap and will be buying it again. For one thing, while it has nothing to do with performance, I like that it doesn&#x27;t have that unnatural green color. This bar is more natural in color with visible oatmeal. Out of its wrapper, it looks \\&quot;artesian,\\&quot; like the upscale small batch specialty brand soaps that can cost three times as much. Be warned, these bars are huge, much bigger than most, and the corners aren&#x27;t rounded off. Small, even medium size, hands could find this bar uncomfortable to hold, as I did at first. To use in the shower, I found it easiest to use a combo process involving lathering with the bar and a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather was a pleasant surprise because the bar was labeled as \\&quot;exfoliating.\\&quot; The exfoliating component is oatmeal, a mild scrub when wet and it was pretty much unnoticeable. I expect it will be the same for anyone else that regularly uses rougher exfoliating products. Still, I appreciate I may be getting an in-between exfoliating boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is great. I don&#x27;t see it as the reason for the \\&quot;FOR MEN\\&quot; designation. It didn&#x27;t bring to mind \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; so much as it did \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;outside.\\&quot; I can&#x27;t say if it smells like the Irish Spring from years ago because I don&#x27;t remember. If it is the same, it&#x27;s nicely proportioned and not overwhelming as in the old bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing off was a breeze. My hand held water spray sluiced through the lather and when I was dry I didn&#x27;t feel like I had any residue or film left on me. I actually checked the wrapper to see if I had missed a notation that the bars are moisturizing. Nope. While it says nothing about having an added lotion or a moisturizing component, my skin felt as if I had applied lotion when I was completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t get the \\&quot;FOR MEN\\&quot; designation. Neither the color or the smell of the bar scream a particular gender; I think a good performing soap would be appreciated by anyone. If it&#x27;s just about the size, maybe a better designation would have been \\&quot;FOR BIG HANDS.\\&quot; Then again, it&#x27;s soap, after a few weeks of use it&#x27;ll fit just fine in small hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irish Spring&#x27;s Irish Spring Signature For Men Exfoliating Bar Soap is not just for men. If you&#x27;re looking for a pleasantly scented bar soap that lathers up big and then rinses clean to leave your skin feeling smooth, this might be exactly what you want, regardless of how big your hands are. I love this new bar and put one in each of three showers where they&#x27;ve proved to be a hit with both genders.left on me.

            <li> Fantastic scent.  Love the feel of the lather as I wasusing it.  WIll Shirley buy again.</li>
            <li> These are definitely bigger than the average soap bars.  The exfoliating properties of these are minimum.  I expected something that was a little more coarse.  Using the larger bars was a little more difficult...meaning I dropped the soap more often than I usually do.  I expected these &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; bars to have a stronger smell than they did.  Nothing wrong with the soap, just my expectations were too much.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells, feels on skin, the only complaint is, the bar is &amp;#34;man sized&amp;#34; and that makes it extra drop-able.</li>
            <li> Good deodorant soap with a pleasant sloughing texture and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Not as exfoliating as I had hoped. Smells super strong. Large bars are hard to hold. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but not overly strong.  Rinses off very easily and leaves you feeling &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;.  Highly recommend for low water pressure.  I wouldn&#x27;t call it an &amp;#34;exfoliating scrub&amp;#34; like the packaging suggests, but it&#x27;s a solid bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Probably just me but don&#x27;t really feel the exfoliating properties of this product.</li>
            <li> This 3-pack of individually-wrapped bars of soap is quite good. The soap itself has a very slight exfoliating feel, just a little bit grainy against your skin and what I most like about it, is that it doesn&#x27;t have that strong Irish spring green soap scent from the 70s and 80s. The scent is mild, nice and understated. My skin, particularly my face, feels very clean and tight after using this soap. And the bars are perhaps the thickest bars of soap I&#x27;ve seen and they should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Irish Spring Signature for Men 5/5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and leaves skin feeling fresh and clean. 3 full size bars with an awesome scent that also exfoliates the skin.</li>
            <li> I was impressed by the sheer size of this bar of soap...It truly is &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;. It has a nice scent, but it wore off pretty quickly after a shower, unlike regular Irish Spring soap. As far as the &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; aspect goes, I just don&#x27;t get why you would want &amp;#34;authentic milled oats&amp;#34; in a bar of soap. It makes for an unusual texture, and it looks cool to see all of these little spiky bits protruding from the bar, but my skin really doesn&#x27;t feel any different than it does after showering with my usual soap (Dial). I have no complaints, but I doubt that I would seek this out for purchase, unless there was a really good sale.</li>
            <li> The smell is heavenly.  It seems slightly milder than the body wash and that is a welcomed advantage.  The exfoliating wasn&#x27;t as harsh as I expected it to be and was probably a little too mild.  The soap was slightly drying, but it did clean and leave a nice scent and did, in fact, exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;Fix the drying aspect, and I would be on board.</li>
            <li> My hubby normally uses the Jack Black exfoliating soap, so we were familiar with this type of product. It works just as well as the Jack Black brand at a fraction of the cost. It has a very mild scent and my husband likes it. I will purchase this item in the future.</li>
            <li> The soap is much bigger than your average bar. It  seems to last a reasonable amount of time and smells fresh. The reason I am giving a 3 star review is that the soap dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> This is good soap. I was expecting something more along the lines of the Irish Spring soap I used years ago. That had a strong scent, a green and white color, and was typical body soap. This soap has a more delicate scent, a white color, and the trendy milled oats added. It&#x27;s designed to exfoliate and scrub the skin, but it&#x27;s hard to tell how much exfoliation it does. Certainly it works well to scrub. All in all, this is good soap for all the purposes I use soap for. I like it.</li>
            <li> I typically use a body wash, and this is the first time in many years I&#x27;ve used a bar soap exclusively. This is a pleasure to use. The soap is advertised as &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34;, and while I have no way of telling if it is, I will say that after using this soap my skin (and therefore myself) feels really refreshed. Since it is a soap it does give me the &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling, which I don&#x27;t mind so much. I do not like soaps/detergents with strong fragrances. As with any Irish Spring product the soap has a fragrance to it, but it doesn&#x27;t appear to be that strong to me.</li>
            <li> Do you like Irish Spring? You&#x27;re almost there! This is the classic, pleasant scent that everyone loves with just a little bit of grit in it. It&#x27;s hard to describe how it has just a little grit, but it&#x27;s really not that noticeable going on although you certainly feel it in your hands. For my grip, the larger size is spot-on too. It&#x27;ll get you clean and ready to go. Get some.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is a big, hefty bar of soap, which must be why it&#x27;s billed as for men. But Irish Spring has always been advertised for men (remember the Irish lass saying &amp;#34;But I like it too&amp;#34;?) Well, I like this one too. The scent is lighter than that of the green bars, refreshing without overpowering. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much in the exfoliating department, in spite of the flakes of oatmeal dispersed throughout. But it doesn&#x27;t seem to have a drying affect on skin, whether used on body or face.  At $4.99, these 6 inch blocks are a great bargain; they certainly last a lot longer than standard soaps.</li>
            <li> This exfoliating soap is very close to perfect. The off white appearance with little bits of natural scrubby husks is very appealing to the eye. In the hand, the over-sized bar starts off a little too large for its sharp corners, but after a shower or two the bars fits well in your hand and feels great for longer than other soaps. The soap doesn&#x27;t leave any funky residue and the exfoliating texture feels good. The only thing that I wish was different was the scent. It&#x27;s unmistakably based off of the original Irish Spring scent, which smells clean, spicy and sporty. This isn&#x27;t bad, but it doesn&#x27;t match the look of the bar and makes it smell a little less &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34;. I think I would have preferred a more neutral (like Lever 2000 or Ivory) or an earthy natural scent like Shea butter or sandalwood, but you get used to the scent pretty quickly and it&#x27;s not so strong that it sticks to you. So overall a very nice soap, and if you already love the Irish Spring scent, then I think you may have found the perfect bar.</li>
            <li> First off, this soap has a very pleasant scent, lathers well, and washes away nicely.  I am most interested in the bar for the purposes of exfoliating skin in areas that get dry and itchy.  I found the soap ok at doing this, though I would offer a few suggestions.  The bars are block shaped, I think if they were slightly rounded or contoured, they would be more effective to use.  My dry areas are on my legs and a contoured bar would work better in washing those areas. You have to constantly shift the block to cover the area.  Oats are used to help exfoliate, they milled and smaller than some oats used in such bars. They are really in the mid-range size for oat bars.  I prefer larger oats in the bars than this one. A good product that could use a little improvement.  Marketed to men, but the scent would be ok for most folks.</li>
            <li> This Irish Spring soap is a nice product, and offers more benefits than the regular line in that it exfoliates the dead skin cells through exfoliation. These are substantial, rectangular shaped bars that are comfortable and easy to grip and stay put. It has strong suds, and smells fresh while providing benefits without having to apply any pressure. I like Irish Spring and like this new slightly spa like product, especially after a long winter with dry skin.</li>
