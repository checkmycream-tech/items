            <li>This helps remember designs and to practice new one.  </li>

            <li> Great nail fans!!! They&#x27;re a heavy duty plastic so you don&#x27;t have to be gentle with these. Easy to paint and do your swatches and they look fantastic. I love that it comes with the ring to keep them all together and I easily hung this up next to my polish rack for easy identification of my nail colors. It has 120 nail tips to paint but I have more polishes than I thought, guess I need to buy another one of these, or two.....</li>
            <li> Exactly what was expected, love it, will re-order. Took a loooong time to get here.</li>
            <li> The tips are too small</li>
            <li> love it. i have so many nail polishes so i had to get one of these and it comes in handy. i love the ring they are one. keeps them all together perfectly!</li>
            <li> Love them! So easy to swatch.  Shipping was pretty quick and it&#x27;s a nice quality.</li>
            <li> Very goood product!!!</li>
            <li> Great for practicing designs or seeing if colors go together.</li>
            <li> came on expected delivery date so that&#x27;s good. I like them a lot and they help me decide what nail to do in which pattern!</li>
            <li> Came as expected and on time. I&#x27;m still in school, and all the girls have this pack to display our nail art. The polish and gel stays on the tip just fine.</li>
            <li> Need more.... but love them...thanks</li>
            <li> I love the fact that they are hard plastic and perfect size, just like others have said they look exactly like the picture. I&#x27;d definitely re-order :)</li>
            <li> I am using these to display nail art and price it out. The handle makes it easier to work with and hold onto.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my samples!</li>
            <li> My weekly nail diary, love being able to look back at previous designs I&#x27;ve done. Now I polish 11 nails per week</li>
            <li> Im really happy with these. They have a great color to them and they really sit nicely on top of each other. So glad it came with the ring clip to ! Will probably buy these again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these,  I am very into nail polish.  I have a HUGE collection of nail polish -some of them I&#x27;ve had for 10 years ( bad I know, but I just cant toss them), so I have close to 200 nail polishes at this point.  I ordered several sets of these and I painted each one with a different polish, organized by color. It&#x27;s much easier to know what it will look like once I put it on with this since it never looks like it does in the bottle.  I highly recommend this to anyone who has a HUGE nail polish collection.  Now if I could just find a way to organize them properly...</li>
            <li> Really nice a smooth.  No complaints</li>
            <li> I love my nail fan. Its easy to work with and allows you to organize all your colors and easy to paint</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE! you can break them off and wear them or just practice! I honestly sit and practice on them all day.</li>
            <li> Arrived as stated. It did take a couple weeks for shipping. I didn&#x27;t realize they were coming from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li> Great product but expect a month to receive :)</li>
            <li> These are perfect to pot your colors on. Handy to have.</li>
            <li> I love my nail wheels. These are perfect for keeping track of your polishes when you want to swatch for yourself or for your blog. Perfect for what I need them for. I am going to buy these again and again.</li>
            <li> Love it! but take a long time to delivery.</li>
            <li> Perfect to keep up with polish colors!!!!</li>
            <li> This work! Nothing was broken and it displays wonderfully. This helps remember designs and to practice new one.  I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Works great. Easy to keep with the color of polishes I have. And all clipped together so can hang from ring that it comes with.</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy they look like the photos. The down side was how long it took to come and it&#x27;s a bit of a bummer that the nail tips are so big. I am a &amp;#34;sport length&amp;#34; kind of girl, so it&#x27;s hard to gauge what your painted tips will look like on your own hand since the length of the nails are super long. In the photo I posted, I did paint the tips white and I did a butterfly wing on one of them...but they are already pretty close to that color.</li>
            <li> Excellent it does the job. Big strong &amp; not flimsy. Some of my clients are ruff on my samples this is great &amp; it&#x27;s very affordable!! I WILL buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for swatching my polish. I got all my Sinful Colors polish on these and they look so great and professional. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I love it!. Helps me keep all my designs in one spot!... ^-^</li>
            <li> Great for choosing a nail polish color to wear.</li>
            <li> Amazing price for these. Where I live 10 of these would cost me little over $10.</li>
            <li> I love these for displaying my nail art!! It&#x27;s an easy and great way to show off your art. It&#x27;s also good for color coding your polishes or trying them out. I sometimes practice designs or techniques on these before doing them on myself or others. They are also stronger then some other nail wheels I&#x27;ve purchased and I love how there&#x27;s a ring to keep them on</li>
