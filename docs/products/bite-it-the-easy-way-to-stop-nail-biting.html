    <ol>
            <li>BUT THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s perfect for guys too, and</li>
            <li>The product it great</li>
            <li>This stuff works great</li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say he stopped within days.  </li>
            <li>The product works great</li>
            <li>It is a very effective product.</li>
            <li>So it is very effective.  </li>
            <li>CHEERS and good luck def</li>
            <li>The nice thing about it is that it&#x27;s a matte finish, so</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t even chew your cuticles which is actually nice.</li>
            <li>Honestly find another way to stop biting; the benefits do not outweigh the costs for this.</li>
            <li>IF you&#x27;re doing your own nails at home.</li>
            <li>helped me stop biting my nails, so pretty happy with that.</li>
            <li>ok the price is a rip off...</li>
            <li>but it is not terrible.  </li>
            <li>and i have 9 more words to write and done.</li>
            <li>You MIGHT be able to get it at walmart, but don&#x27;t quote me on that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I got home, I read on the box that it \\&quot;promotes healthy nail</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the finger food problem that others describe, but this could be because I&#x27;m putting it over my nail polish and it sticks better or something.</li>
            <li>I bought this at CVS and was at first delighted to try it since I&#x27;ve been biting for close to fifteen years.</li>
            <li>It also seems to come off kind of quickly</li>
            <li>and you should be fine.</li>
            <li>its available at cvs</li>
            <li>I AM NOW 4 WEEKS FREE OF NAIL</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>worth giving it a shot!</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff at CVS without really knowing too much about it, and fair warning...</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s easy to peel off, it almost gets absorbed into your nails, I&#x27;ve tried, and there&#x27;s way to way to peel it off unless you use nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re suppose to apply twice a week on clean nails OR over nail polish.</li>
            <li>But seriously, it&#x27;s the best polish if you want to stop biting your nails but can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>but I thought I would do a quick one.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother me really, but some people can be particular about that kind of</li>
            <li>First, DO NOT purchase this on amazon!</li>
            <li>Although I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the $20 price tag it has on Amazon, I bought it at CVS for $6.</li>
            <li>: don&#x27;t use this stuff after you goto the salon and get a fresh manicure.</li>
            <li>all along, great product with no side effects other than that it makes you repulsed to the idea of putting your germ filled fingernails any where near your teeth</li>
            <li>But the other reviewers are right, it seems to absorb into your nails so you can&#x27;t pick at your nails (a good thing), or even bite your hangnails and cuticles, because the taste gets all over your fingers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of sad that I am the first person who is writing a review on this product because this stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>you can use it as a top coat for regular nail polish too!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many different times, and in many different ways, to stop biting my nails.  </li>
            <li>I agree with everyone else, this stuff works really well!</li>
            <li>Last week my boyfriend kissed the top of my hand (not my nails) and he could taste it, and he was revolted by the flavor.</li>
            <li>gotta tell you if you&#x27;re interested.</li>
            <li>but after about 3 months (I REALLY missed having this stuff!)</li>
            <li>I personally do not mind not having the shine, but for those of you who do, just add a top coat to finish off your nails ...</li>
            <li>first week I would go to bite my nails</li>
            <li>I applied a mass amount on them and he could not stand them at first.</li>
            <li>I have fragil nails, and when I first started using this product, I started noticing a substantial amount growth within a week or so ... can&#x27;t really remember.</li>
            <li>when your saliva TOUCHES the polish (which of course doesnt appear to be polish, its a kind of clear coat flat color that is unnoticeable)</li>
            <li>Why not pay less for the same great product?</li>
            <li>I really wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
            <li>I am 29 and I have been a nail biter my whole life.</li>
            <li>This stuff will put the mother-freaking kibosh on that, and fast.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t wash off, and it really doesn&#x27;t even come off all that well with nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li>Lasts for days after application, probably 3-4 before you absolutely need to reapply.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>* ONE COAT layer over the polished nail, and after it dries, add a clear top coat for shine; the affect of the \\&quot;bite it\\&quot; taste (and growth) will still be there, but you&#x27;ll have the extra shine appearance.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMEND</li>
            <li>This likely would have worked had it been a slight problem, but won&#x27;t work for the more intense biters.</li>
            <li>First off I want to say I found this product for a way cheaper price at a local drug store.  </li>
            <li>later today I&#x27;m going to corner my husband and paint some on his gnawed-up fingers and make him endure this journey with me, like married couples should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products but never had such luck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this to help my 8 year old stop chewing his nails so much since he was causing damage to the whole nail and not just making it short.</li>
            <li>When it starts to get old, it cracks and turns yellow, which was very unattractive.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never to late to better yourself.</li>
            <li>I have not put my hands near my mouth in three weeks and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 20 year old guy, and the stuff comes in a nail polish bottle.</li>
            <li>The only real issue is sometimes if you&#x27;re eating finger foods the taste can rub off on the food.</li>
            <li>now I dont even try, I have completely gotten over</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper at your local CVS.  </li>
            <li>the taste is bitter and it leaves a matte (if i spelt that right) finish.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s pretty self-explanatory, you paint it on your nails and wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li>And yes, be careful not to apply too many coats because it can make your nails look dry, yellow, and cracked.  </li>
            <li>(Not good if I want to kiss my man:) )</li>
            <li>It does turn my nails slightly yellow, and if you paint over it the product doesn&#x27;t work, but that&#x27;s something I can live with.</li>
            <li>just because, no other reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been putting it on every other day or so because it makes my nails feel stronger as well, but this stuff really makes me hesitant to even put my hands near my mouth</li>
            <li>its white in the bottle but comes on clear.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend this enough, just use utensils when you eat and don&#x27;t be surprised if there aren&#x27;t any instructions on the box.</li>
            <li>I have been biting my nails since I was 8 years old and finally decided enough is enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fourth, it&#x27;s also safe to use on children, so for those parents who have thumb suckers, try putting a little on their nails to see if it helps prevent them from keeping their thumbs out of their mouths.</li>

            <li> I like this product, the only thing I wish is that it would dry shiny.  </li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for as long as I can remember, which isn&#x27;t that long since I&#x27;m only 18.</li>
            <li> I still have a long ways to go since I have long nail beds.</li>
            <li> If you are nail biter as long as I have been give this a try.</li>
            <li> &quot; feeling, its a 5 minute taste in your mouth that is so utterly bitter and gross</li>
            <li> It tastes like earwax mixed with bitter orange peels and it does not fade off.</li>
            <li> I have bitten my nails for a long time (since childhood) and this product helps me stop.</li>
            <li> This has been a life long nervous habit of his.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately when I don&#x27;t apply it I fall into my old habits, but it is worth the $&lt;br /&gt;money to me as I only have to buy it every few months.</li>
            <li> To get the maximum effect, apply daily or every other day.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry shiny</li>
            <li> But what I can do is apply it, let it dry thoroughly, and wear it under polish.</li>
            <li> It would only last a few hours</li>
            <li> The only down side is eating finger foods or if you have a tendency to pick your lip (which is another plus to get you to stop).</li>
            <li> I used a few other things to stop nail biting and this is the only one that has actually done anything.</li>
            <li> Each time was equally as traumatic as the last, which is what you want when you&#x27;re a hard core nail biter like myself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a lifelong nail biter</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful when eating finger foods, peeling oranges etc., but other than that it does the job.  </li>
            <li> Like others have said, the Bite It taste does transfer to finger foods, but it&#x27;s been a small price to pay to finally get on track to end this rancid ol&#x27;</li>
            <li> I saw this in CVS  the other day and decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> it tastes like you JUST OPENED WIDE FOR THE WINTERY FRESHNESS OF MACE!</li>
            <li> there aren&#x27;t any instructions on the box really other than \\&quot;shake before use\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unlike any other polish I&#x27;ve used to stop nail biting.</li>
            <li> I have used other products and those products spread to my finger foods, ruining them, but I&#x27;ve never had that problem with this polish as others have reported.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other review, do NOT buy this on Amazon...</li>
            <li> other than that, I would still give this product 5 stars!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nasty bitter taste and when you first put it on try not to lick your fingers or anything like that because you will certainly taste it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any kids, but I know a few parents who use this method (with other \\&quot;no bite nail polish\\&quot;) and it worked for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from fake nails, to nail polish, creams, to more fake nails.</li>
            <li> , much less chew my nails.</li>
            <li> it feels a little suspect for a man to be found applying nail polish, but i have to reiterate, i gotta tell you this stuff</li>
            <li> I usually do it every day or every other day ...</li>
            <li> I may just be a messy polisher, but my skin around my nails tastes just like it</li>
            <li> I should not bite my nails.&amp;#34; It lingers for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It does have a bad taste at first</li>
            <li> I started biting again, so this might have to be a long term thing until the habit is broken.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>

            <li> I bought this from cvs to help me stop sucking my thumb and I haven&#x27;t since. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it on here. It was only $6 at the cvs I got it from. Wasting your money getting it here. The stuff says on your nail for about a week and then you can just reapply it. It&#x27;s a nasty bitter taste and when you first put it on try not to lick your fingers or anything like that because you will certainly taste it. The product it great and I would recommend it to anyone trying to stop the habit of nail biting or thumb sucking. Oh and I&#x27;m 18 btw. It&#x27;s never to late to better yourself.</li>
            <li> ok the price is a rip off... i got it at rite aid for $6.... BUT THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME. i have been a nail biter for 12 years its painfull i needed to stop. I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT 100%!!! the taste is bitter and it leaves a matte (if i spelt that right) finish. its white in the bottle but comes on clear. you can use it as a top coat for regular nail polish too! the taste lingers in your mouth and makes it so your not even temped to bite the.</li>
            <li> First off I want to say I found this product for a way cheaper price at a local drug store.  I bought this for my 5 year old because she had a terrible nail biting habit.  She would bite to the point that she would have sores.  This polish works alright.  I paired it with Hoof Stop the Bite because the nasty taste didn&#x27;t last long. It would only last a few hours and then she would be back to putting her nails in her mouth.  It does have a bad taste at first but it is not terrible.  It also leaves a very ugly finish to your nails.  I really wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  Paired with Stop the Bite it helped stop her from biting her nails and helped her nails grow.</li>
            <li> It is a very effective product. It serves it&#x27;s purpose completly and because it is opaque it doesn&#x27;t look like you painted your nails.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for 13 years, and it&#x27;s gotten to the point that I don&#x27;t even realize I&#x27;m biting them. This stuff has surpassed my expectations. I just can&#x27;t bite through this taste. Moreover, if I do happen to nibble, this taste lingers on my lips. (Not good if I want to kiss my man:) ) Like others have said, the Bite It taste does transfer to finger foods, but it&#x27;s been a small price to pay to finally get on track to end this rancid ol&#x27; habit.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Although I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the $20 price tag it has on Amazon, I bought it at CVS for $6. Why not pay less for the same great product?</li>
            <li> I am 29 and I have been a nail biter my whole life. I have tried everything from fake nails, to nail polish, creams, to more fake nails. I have not bitten my nails in 3 weeks. I still have a long ways to go since I have long nail beds. I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I thought I would do a quick one. THIS STUFF WORKS!!!  well its works for me. If you are nail biter as long as I have been give this a try. The taste is so awful and even after you wash your hands its still there. I have not put my hands near my mouth in three weeks and when I have I am reminded of how awful the taste is. The taste lingers too so you are reminded of how awful it is.  For all you nail biters give this a try. I discovered nail biting is form of perfectionist so maybe look into your life of what impulse or what makes you bite you nails. CHEERS and good luck def worth giving it a shot!</li>
            <li> Ireally didn&#x27;t know what to do when my son started biting his nails... Bite it worked so well that in 2 weeks his nails grew again!!!</li>
            <li> helped me stop biting my nails, so pretty happy with that. and i have 9 more words to write and done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a lifelong nail biter and I&#x27;ve tried many different times, and in many different ways, to stop biting my nails.  I saw this in CVS  the other day and decided to give it a shot.  Now, I tend to be an absent-minded nail biter in that I bite my nails and don&#x27;t even realize I&#x27;m doing it.  This stuff will put the mother-freaking kibosh on that, and fast.  I accidentally stuck my finger in my mouth to nibble on my cuticles and the taste was so foul I almost threw my arm out pulling my hand away from my face.  I&#x27;ve used this stuff for three days now and I&#x27;ve put my fingers in my mouth maybe four times in three days.  Each time was equally as traumatic as the last, which is what you want when you&#x27;re a hard core nail biter like myself.  It also doesn&#x27;t wash off, and it really doesn&#x27;t even come off all that well with nail polish remover.  The nice thing about it is that it&#x27;s a matte finish, so later today I&#x27;m going to corner my husband and paint some on his gnawed-up fingers and make him endure this journey with me, like married couples should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I give this a five-star, thumbs-up review.  This crap works in spades!</li>
            <li> What a ripoff, I just bought this at CVS for $5.49. It would cost 25.00 here! This stuff works great, I used this 3 years ago.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about three weeks now. So far so good.</li>
            <li> totally recommend this.  have been a nail biter for 50 years, this is the only thing that works.</li>
            <li> I agree with everyone else, this stuff works really well! But unfortunately, the intolerable flavor is too potent. The terrible taste goes everywhere! Even when I wash my hair or face, if any water gets anywhere near my lips, I can taste the nail polish and the flavor is beyond disgusting. Last week my boyfriend kissed the top of my hand (not my nails) and he could taste it, and he was revolted by the flavor. When I wear it I definitely stop biting my nails, but sometimes I don&#x27;t want to put it on because the flavor getting everywhere is such a nuisance … then I end up biting my nails because I&#x27;m not wearing it. It&#x27;s really a tough dilemma. I just wish I could find a product like Bite it, but that stays on my nails so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m being punished when I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that this product may be able to help cure my terrible nail biting habit, AND IT DID! Not only did it stop that but it makes me scared to put my finger in my mouth. It has a terrible taste that tells you when your biting. TOTALLY RECOMEND</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for as long as I can remember, which isn&#x27;t that long since I&#x27;m only 18. I&#x27;ve tried everything from bandaids to gloves to other forms of nasty tasting polishes and this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found to work. It is extremely disgusting and my fingers stay out of my mouth if this stuff is on them. It is truly dreadful tasting, but for once that means that this product gets 5 stars. It does turn my nails slightly yellow, and if you paint over it the product doesn&#x27;t work, but that&#x27;s something I can live with.</li>
            <li> gotta tell you if you&#x27;re interested. its available at cvs but im not sure as to weather this is cheaper because one bottle goes on for years. I&#x27;m a 20 year old guy, and the stuff comes in a nail polish bottle. it feels a little suspect for a man to be found applying nail polish, but i have to reiterate, i gotta tell you this stuff just works wonders. one would ask how it stops the subconscious urge to stop biting and chewing nails, and heres how. when your saliva TOUCHES the polish (which of course doesnt appear to be polish, its a kind of clear coat flat color that is unnoticeable) it tastes like you JUST OPENED WIDE FOR THE WINTERY FRESHNESS OF MACE! and its not a \\&quot;oooh that tastes bad ill stop\\&quot; feeling, its a 5 minute taste in your mouth that is so utterly bitter and gross that you remember next time your hand comes to your mouth. great product. the only downside i found to it is that it MAY spoil finger foods at times, such as wings or chips. all along, great product with no side effects other than that it makes you repulsed to the idea of putting your germ filled fingernails any where near your teeth</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff at CVS without really knowing too much about it, and fair warning...there aren&#x27;t any instructions on the box really other than \\&quot;shake before use\\&quot;. But it&#x27;s pretty self-explanatory, you paint it on your nails and wait for it to dry. It doesn&#x27;t dry shiny so it&#x27;s perfect for guys too, and it&#x27;s unlike any other polish I&#x27;ve used to stop nail biting. Instead of being a shiny layer of polish that&#x27;s easy to peel off, it almost gets absorbed into your nails, I&#x27;ve tried, and there&#x27;s way to way to peel it off unless you use nail polish remover. As for the taste, holy crap it&#x27;s horrible! It tastes like earwax mixed with bitter orange peels and it does not fade off. I&#x27;ve been putting it on every other day or so because it makes my nails feel stronger as well, but this stuff really makes me hesitant to even put my hands near my mouth, much less chew my nails. I may just be a messy polisher, but my skin around my nails tastes just like it so you can&#x27;t even chew your cuticles which is actually nice. The only real issue is sometimes if you&#x27;re eating finger foods the taste can rub off on the food. But seriously, it&#x27;s the best polish if you want to stop biting your nails but can&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t recommend this enough, just use utensils when you eat and don&#x27;t be surprised if there aren&#x27;t any instructions on the box.</li>
            <li> I have bitten my nails for a long time (since childhood) and this product helps me stop. I have tried many other products but never had such luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No Bite It&amp;#34; has a terrible taste as others have mentioned and it also hardens my nails so they don&#x27;t break. I apply this polish once a week and I don&#x27;t bite my nails while it is applied. Unfortunately when I don&#x27;t apply it I fall into my old habits, but it is worth the $&lt;br /&gt;money to me as I only have to buy it every few months. I have used other products and those products spread to my finger foods, ruining them, but I&#x27;ve never had that problem with this polish as others have reported.</li>
            <li> I bought this at CVS and was at first delighted to try it since I&#x27;ve been biting for close to fifteen years. I took the description&#x27;s word that it tasted awful and didn&#x27;t want to put myself through that so I didn&#x27;t taste it. The thing is that I didn&#x27;t have to come close to my nails to taste it! The stuff is invisible and it. gets. everywhere. Example: you&#x27;re texting, fingers touch the screen, you get a phone call, bam, the stuff (and taste!!!) is all over your face and mouth. And it stays there forever! It also gets all over your food, and there goes pizza, hamburgers, chicken strips, any food you don&#x27;t eat with utensils. And the thing is, from the food it goes to your lips, and it stays! Touch a cup the wrong way? Now it&#x27;s on your lips! I have taken it off and used nail polish remover and disinfectant and I have scrubbed my lips with everything imaginable and the taste is still there. Does it work in that I don&#x27;t feel tempted to bite? Yes. Has it made my life miserable? Yes! Honestly find another way to stop biting; the benefits do not outweigh the costs for this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of sad that I am the first person who is writing a review on this product because this stuff is AMAZING! First, DO NOT purchase this on amazon! I would NEVER pay $13+ on nail polish. You can get it at your local CVS (that&#x27;s the only place I know that carries it and it cost $6 &amp; some change (with tax). You MIGHT be able to get it at walmart, but don&#x27;t quote me on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it taste horrible so it&#x27;s actually doing what it&#x27;s suppose to be doing. The only down side is eating finger foods or if you have a tendency to pick your lip (which is another plus to get you to stop). You&#x27;re suppose to apply twice a week on clean nails OR over nail polish. I usually do it every day or every other day ... just because, no other reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, this stuff actual makes the nails grow. I have fragil nails, and when I first started using this product, I started noticing a substantial amount growth within a week or so ... can&#x27;t really remember. CVS ran out for awhile and I was afraid they discontinued it, but after about 3 months (I REALLY missed having this stuff!), I decided to go back to see if they had any in stock, and they did. When I got home, I read on the box that it \\&quot;promotes healthy nail growth,\\&quot;  which made me think, \\&quot;oh, I knew it made my nails grow, but I didn&#x27;t realize it was actual suppose to.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, it&#x27;s also safe to use on children, so for those parents who have thumb suckers, try putting a little on their nails to see if it helps prevent them from keeping their thumbs out of their mouths. I don&#x27;t have any kids, but I know a few parents who use this method (with other \\&quot;no bite nail polish\\&quot;) and it worked for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you put a lot of coats on, the color will turn out to be a yellowish tan. I guess that&#x27;s why they suggest twice a week or maybe that&#x27;s all you need for it to work. It doesn&#x27;t bother me really, but some people can be particular about that kind of stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: don&#x27;t use this stuff after you goto the salon and get a fresh manicure. I would suggest ONLY applying it over polished nails IF you&#x27;re doing your own nails at home. I say this because this product takes away the \\&quot;shine.\\&quot;  I would also suggest putting a *THIN* ONE COAT layer over the polished nail, and after it dries, add a clear top coat for shine; the affect of the \\&quot;bite it\\&quot; taste (and growth) will still be there, but you&#x27;ll have the extra shine appearance. I personally do not mind not having the shine, but for those of you who do, just add a top coat to finish off your nails ... other than that, I would still give this product 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I used a few other things to stop nail biting and this is the only one that has actually done anything.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage son who always bites his nails.  This has been a life long nervous habit of his.  I&#x27;m happy to say he stopped within days.  He did have to use it again after a few months but the nail biting stopped again just as fast.  I bought this at CVS for around $5.</li>
            <li> This is disgusting.  Seriously, putting my hands in my mouth made me nauseous.  So it is very effective.  It. Lasts for days after application, probably 3-4 before you absolutely need to reapply.  To get the maximum effect, apply daily or every other day.  When it starts to get old, it cracks and turns yellow, which was very unattractive.  Came off with nail polish remover.  Once it was gone I started biting again, so this might have to be a long term thing until the habit is broken.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well; it tastes awful and stays on. I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because a) it has a matte finish so I can&#x27;t put it on over painted nails, and b) it will melt the polish beneath anyway (must be the formaldehyde?). But what I can do is apply it, let it dry thoroughly, and wear it under polish. The bad taste just won&#x27;t come through quite as well.</li>
            <li> I like this product, the only thing I wish is that it would dry shiny.  But the other reviewers are right, it seems to absorb into your nails so you can&#x27;t pick at your nails (a good thing), or even bite your hangnails and cuticles, because the taste gets all over your fingers.  Just try not to idly touch your mouth, because the taste will get in your mouth, and it lingers.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails since I was 8 years old and finally decided enough is enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the local pharmacy and bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you this...I AM NOW 4 WEEKS FREE OF NAIL BITING!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never could have imagined life without biting my nails, it was ingrained in my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first week I would go to bite my nails and before I could even put my finger in my mouth I was repulsed by the taste of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second week when I would go to bite my nails I would stop myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now I dont even try, I have completely gotten over it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ecstatic, no more disgusted embarrassing fingers to hide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This tastes bad, but not god awful. (The Mavala stop reviews seem to indicate that it tastes really, really, really bad.) The taste is enough for me to go &amp;#34;ewwwww I should not bite my nails.&amp;#34; It lingers for a few minutes. I haven&#x27;t had the finger food problem that others describe, but this could be because I&#x27;m putting it over my nail polish and it sticks better or something. Along those lines, it looks terrible over nail polish. It gives my polish a matte, streaky look. I&#x27;ve started to just put a dab on each finger to avoid ruining the nail polish. If it weren&#x27;t for that, I&#x27;d give it another star. It also seems to come off kind of quickly (I wash my nails with a nail brush daily).</li>
            <li> Did not work my daughter looked at me like yuck and still kept chewing her nails.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other review, do NOT buy this on Amazon...it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper at your local CVS.  The product works great, it tastes horrible so you won&#x27;t be tempted to bite your nails.  You do have to be careful when eating finger foods, peeling oranges etc., but other than that it does the job.  And yes, be careful not to apply too many coats because it can make your nails look dry, yellow, and cracked.  Just apply as directed and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> I got this to help my 8 year old stop chewing his nails so much since he was causing damage to the whole nail and not just making it short. I applied a mass amount on them and he could not stand them at first. He eventually got used to it and did not care anymore about the taste. This likely would have worked had it been a slight problem, but won&#x27;t work for the more intense biters.</li>
