            <li>This one is my favorite to wear during the daytime under my foundation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give this a  bit more time, can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>Love all Obagi products.  </li>
            <li>I have use this product about a year I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream.  </li>

            <li>It seemed to be fresh not expired.</li>
            <li>if used earlier before wrinkles get to be creases, it will certainly do a nice job of firming and smoothing the eye area.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better results with the retinol cream mixed with the C cream.</li>

            <li>Ready to buy another jar.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much change or help from this</li>
            <li>I like this product because it really nourishes the eye area.  </li>
            <li>Light enough to use under makeup during the day without causing eyeliner to run, and rich enough to use at night so you look rested in the morning.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use only 3 tiny dots under each eye and on the browbone.</li>
            <li>Being newly in Fl, we shall see.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years after first purchasing it from a medical spa and truly seeing its effects.</li>
            <li>I am 49 years old</li>

            <li> it gets dry or burns.  </li>
            <li> The cream has a loose consistency, and doesn&#x27;t feel or look like its moisturizing or improving the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I use the eye cream night and morning carefully patting it around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to Clinique, half the price!</li>
            <li> See my other review on Retinol.</li>
            <li> my crepey eyelids (stupid genetics) are looking MUCH better.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed, worth every dime!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very irritating, making my eyes burn, even though I&#x27;ve never got the cream directly in my eyes.</li>
            <li> It made my under eye extremely dry and wrinkles even worse.</li>
            <li> It will help decrease their small lines under your eyes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to see results for at least a month</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the elastiderm that comes in a pump dispenser which tightens the skin as soon as applied</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks and am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> As an esthetician, I&#x27;m skeptical.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many eye creams and love this one!!! It&#x27;s really light, but very moisturizing without being greasy!!! Won&#x27;t use another one!!!</li>
            <li> I have used the Obagi products for years with phenomenal results. I hadn&#x27;t tried their eye cream because its a bit pricey, but saw a lot of positive reviews.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks and am so disappointed. It&#x27;s very irritating, making my eyes burn, even though I&#x27;ve never got the cream directly in my eyes.

            <li> The shipping was fast. It seemed to be fresh not expired. How ever doesn&#x27;t seen to work as well as it claims in reviews I have read.</li>
            <li> I love Obagi. However, I can&#x27;t say that I am thrilled with this. I&#x27;ve had better results with the retinol cream mixed with the C cream. See my other review on Retinol.</li>
            <li> Obagi products work exceptionally well, I have used them for years and recommend them to everybody ,who wants a flawless complexion.</li>
            <li> Name the eye cream and I&#x27;ve tried it...in every price range. This product actually does what it promises. Within one week of use, the fine lines around my eyes all but disappeared. Light enough to use under makeup during the day without causing eyeliner to run, and rich enough to use at night so you look rested in the morning. I use twice a day and the jar lasted me about 4 months. Be sure to use only 3 tiny dots under each eye and on the browbone. No need to glop it on. This is one product I won&#x27;t do without.</li>
            <li> This product was originally recommended by my dermatologist. It will help decrease their small lines under your eyes. You will not see results immediately, but I would definitely recommend, I&#x27;ve been using for over 6 months.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;ve used it for years after first purchasing it from a medical spa and truly seeing its effects.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the elastiderm that comes in a pump dispenser which tightens the skin as soon as applied</li>
            <li> As an esthetician, I&#x27;m skeptical.  Having used Elastiderm nightly for two weeks, I have to say I&#x27;m actually amazed at the results - my crepey eyelids (stupid genetics) are looking MUCH better.  I wish I could post before and after photos (I did take before pics).  I didn&#x27;t expect to see results for at least a month but, 14 days, in I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes the area around my eyes look younger.  I am 49 years old and I think it improved the look of my eyes by about 5 years.  I will buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Does keep the skin around the eye tightened so reduces look and development of wrinkles, in my opinion.  Make-up easily goes over it.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for three years now, and at 58, I have virtually no wrinkles around my eyes and no crepe-iness on my eyelids.  Anything from Obagi is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and I love the way it does what Obagi claims it will,do, and then more.</li>
            <li> Obagi makes good products.  This one is my favorite to wear during the daytime under my foundation. Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year and it does work for me. Ready to buy another jar.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much change or help from this but it&#x27;s been 6 weeks.  I&#x27;m a skin care junky and try lots of things and give them plenty of time to work.  I&#x27;ll give this a  bit more time, can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Love all Obagi products.  This is supposed to be really good for the eyes.  Being newly in Fl, we shall see.</li>
            <li> Very good product it really help with the wrinkle around the eyes I have use this product about a year I love it.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at all. It made my under eye extremely dry and wrinkles even worse. I will not be using this product again.</li>
            <li> Excellent eye treatment to wear under a moisturizer.  I use it both morning and night and it has made a huge difference. The entire obagi line has some incredible products. You won&#x27;t be disappointed, worth every dime!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it really nourishes the eye area.  I&#x27;ve used thus product for a couple of years now and would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.  It does what it says it will do.  I have used this for over 10 years along with Obagi&#x27;s vitamin C for face. I use the eye cream night and morning carefully patting it around my eyes.  Do not expect miracles if you have lots of wrinkles around eyes.  if used earlier before wrinkles get to be creases, it will certainly do a nice job of firming and smoothing the eye area.  Hope this answers any concerns.</li>
            <li> cream doesn&#x27;t  make anyone look younger but we can dream, wrinkle keep coming whatever u put on ur face !!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year now and love it! I also love the price! Great product! Great price!</li>
            <li> I often have problems with various eye creams on the skin around my eyes - it gets dry or burns.  Have been using Obagi Elastiderm Eye Treatment cream for about a year and have not had any problems</li>
