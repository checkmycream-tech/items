            <li> Ok, I may be a 32 y/o woman and I do not have a daughter, but I needed a change from all the other perfumes so I decided to try it....LOVE IT! It is very pretty, kinda crispy but soft and has a slight watermelon bubblegum after smell that sent my mood soaring like Jacques and Gus when the Fairy Godmother gave her magical wand a twirl and turned them in to horses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although you do need to reapply this fragrance after a few hours it&#x27;s perfectly fine with me. I&#x27;ve been wearing designer perfumes since I was 16 and over the years I have grown tired of smelling the same perfume on myself all day (with the exception of 2 or 3)or even revamping certain fragrances later in the day. The wonderful thing about this perfume is that unlike a body splash (which also needs to be reapplied) it doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;whoa, a lil too bright\\&quot; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also need to mention that it came in way earlier than expected and was packaged very carefully.

            <li> it did not smell good at all, i would not buy this ere again. my baby hated it, i think thats y she broke the bottle.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and pleasant. The glass is sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what parents want to know about this and that&#x27;s all there really is to know. LOL&lt;br /&gt;My daughter LOVES it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and my girlfriend wears it often. It smells kind of fruity but it is not overpowering. Great packaging and container. Looks great.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my 4-year-old, so it&#x27;s more about presentation than the actual smell. Unfortunately, I had the same issue as another reviewer. The bottle looks nothing like the picture: very plain and more grown-up. Please update your picture, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter as a gift. She really likes it. It smells so good.Will definitely buy more when she needs it.</li>
            <li> I have two nieces q are brunettes and they love the Cinderella q I would like to give the option of choosing two scents of the same type</li>
            <li> We got this for our daughter on Valentine&#x27;s Day. She was very excited and felt it was a very &amp;#34;big girl&amp;#34; thing to get. The perfume itself is pretty good, not over whelming and gentle enough. It&#x27;s also a pretty big bottle and it looks very decrotive.</li>
            <li> my daughter &amp; I love this perfume. It is soft enough for a young girl and not strong at all. I totally recommend it</li>
            <li> My daughter was so so happy Santa left this in her stocking!  She even has to wear to school and anywhere we go!  Too cute!</li>
            <li> The little girl I sent this perfume to was so excited it was tremendous.  She puts it on everyday and plays dress up.  Just a great item.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend for Christmas who loves Cinderella.  I really didn&#x27;t expect much other than a pretty bottle, which it is.  However, it actually smells pretty good!</li>
            <li> Got this for my 3-year old niece who loved it!</li>
            <li> 3 yr old daughter loved this for a Christmas present. Not too strong of a smell, just perfect for a little girl.</li>
            <li> The bottle of perfume looks absolutely NOTHING like this cute pink bottle with the crown topper. Neither does the box it came in for that matter. The box we received it blue, no picture of Cinderella on it. The bottle is clear with a very plain clear top. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> nice my daugther love it</li>
