            <li>Great Product for the Money</li>
            <li>I just had a child 4 months ago and my hair dresser said this would work great in helping my hair</li>
            <li>very nice shampoo &amp; affordable.</li>
            <li>Good can see results.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>that was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>makes my hair full &amp; shiny!!</li>
            <li>OMG OMG OMG LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Love the smell if this conditioner</li>
            <li>so hopefully these products will help more the longer</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t shampoo my hair more than once a week/</li>
            <li>So I would notice an improvement much more often using something 4-5 times a week versus once a week</li>
            <li>If u have this available when I need it, I would like 2 reorder from !</li>
            <li>Not horrible, but it could be better.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>but i saw a huge dierence the smell is good and makes feel full stron.</li>
            <li>and it does make my hair feel thicker and more full!</li>
            <li>It cleans and moisturizes perfectly fine, but not substantially more than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>:) The smell is pleasing to me - a light flowery one that I realized reminds me a bit of the cotton candy body sprays I used to use growing up (but not as strong).</li>
            <li>I liked very much.</li>
            <li>The dilemma of growing up with fine hair:&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I loved how this package came much earlier</li>
            <li>/&gt;OGX biotin and collagen works great for me; it adds a lot of body and thickness to my hair without me having to use any other products.</li>
            <li>Overall I am really pleased!</li>
            <li>Then the more styling products I use to add body, the less nice it tends to feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Organix products before with great success, I&#x27;m not completely swearing them off, I just won&#x27;t be continuing the use of this particular product.</li>
            <li>Still a good product, but a little pricy.</li>
            <li>Thank you for bringing me back the healthy hair I used to have.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s my first time</li>
            <li>After the first use there was a noticeable difference in my hair, it felt thicker, it even seemed shinier.</li>
            <li>The third use I made sure to rinse well</li>
            <li>Thank u 4 the fast shipping!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t notice that much after first use</li>
            <li>I use it, I also like the smell since I only wash my hair every other day, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>Really helps strengthen and thicken hair</li>
            <li>At the time of writing Target has much lower prices on these products.</li>
            <li>Check other retailers for better prices.</li>
            <li>It still feels soft and is REALLY shiny, too!</li>
            <li>...left my hair feeling very soft, I have been loosing alot of hair after washing it</li>
            <li>Much cheaper at local retailers.</li>
            <li>I bought this set because I&#x27;m trying to make my hair as thick and full as possible, but this didn&#x27;t really do anything for mine.  </li>
            <li>Such a great product, a month later I&#x27;m noticing a bunch of baby hair growing in like crazy</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair as I am aging.</li>

            <li> The fourth and final time, I decided to use the tiniest amount of shampoo and only conditioned the tips of my hair; when I dried my hair, it was so greasy looking, it appeared wet in some areas, even though it wasn&#x27;t.</li>

            <li> So be careful</li>
            <li> My girlfriend also notice my hair getting thicker.can leave hair a little dry.</li>
            <li> this I use everyday or every other day.</li>
            <li> , I used less conditioner thinking maybe that would help, after drying it, my hair looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in a week, and it felt like it too.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is okay but way too expensive &amp; I was disappointed in how my hair styled after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy it again or recommend it</li>
            <li> I have extremely thin hair, so I thought I&#x27;d try this shampoo out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like I won&#x27;t use it, but when you are out of Shampoo it is a little annoying.</li>

            <li> Thickens your hair. Makes your hair grow. Your nails will grow too! Check other retailers for better prices. At the time of writing Target has much lower prices on these products.</li>
            <li> Love the smell if this conditioner and it does make my hair feel thicker and more full!</li>
            <li> Just used it like 15 min ago and I just have to give a review...left my hair feeling very soft, I have been loosing alot of hair after washing it and I didn&#x27;t notice that much after first use but it&#x27;s my first time so hopefully these products will help more the longer I use it, I also like the smell since I only wash my hair every other day, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Great Product for the Money</li>
            <li> I have extremely thin hair, so I thought I&#x27;d try this shampoo out. After the first use there was a noticeable difference in my hair, it felt thicker, it even seemed shinier. With the second use, my hair had a somewhat greasy feel to it, I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t rinse it well enough. The third use I made sure to rinse well, I used less conditioner thinking maybe that would help, after drying it, my hair looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in a week, and it felt like it too. The fourth and final time, I decided to use the tiniest amount of shampoo and only conditioned the tips of my hair; when I dried my hair, it was so greasy looking, it appeared wet in some areas, even though it wasn&#x27;t. Maybe there was something I could&#x27;ve done differently, I&#x27;ll never find out. I&#x27;ve used Organix products before with great success, I&#x27;m not completely swearing them off, I just won&#x27;t be continuing the use of this particular product.</li>
            <li> OMG OMG OMG LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! I wish it came in a bigger bottle now that I&#x27;ve boughten this I will always buy it!</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my hair is improving at the root since I started using these products but I don&#x27;t shampoo my hair more than once a week/ So I don&#x27;t use this product as often as the OGX Weightless Healing Oil Treatment...this I use everyday or every other day. So I would notice an improvement much more often using something 4-5 times a week versus once a week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, as for the seller! Thank u 4 the fast shipping! If u have this available when I need it, I would like 2 reorder from !</li>
            <li> Great product-love the results,  the cost, and the smell!</li>
            <li> Such a great product, a month later I&#x27;m noticing a bunch of baby hair growing in like crazy</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair as I am aging. My husband has even commented on how my hair feels and looks fuller and healthier. I will continue purchasing!</li>
            <li> Excellent my hair does not fall animore alot still fall but i saw a huge dierence the smell is good and makes feel full stron. I liked very much.</li>
            <li> I received two conditioners rather than a Shampoo/Conditioner Combo. It&#x27;s not like I won&#x27;t use it, but when you are out of Shampoo it is a little annoying.</li>
            <li> The dilemma of growing up with fine hair:&lt;br /&gt;If I don&#x27;t use styling products, my medium length hair just looks flat. Not horrible, but it could be better. Then the more styling products I use to add body, the less nice it tends to feel. This product makes this problem nonexistent for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OGX biotin and collagen works great for me; it adds a lot of body and thickness to my hair without me having to use any other products. It still feels soft and is REALLY shiny, too! I went out and bought the combo pack and have been using it for about  a month with zero complaints. :) The smell is pleasing to me - a light flowery one that I realized reminds me a bit of the cotton candy body sprays I used to use growing up (but not as strong). Overall I am really pleased!</li>
            <li> This product gave me the hives all over my body allergic to the collagen in both. So be careful</li>
            <li> Much cheaper at local retailers. Great product though!</li>
            <li> My hair dresser told me to buy these and I love them. I just had a child 4 months ago and my hair dresser said this would work great in helping my hair</li>
            <li> Like the ay it makes  your hair feels</li>
            <li> Did wonders for my hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this set because I&#x27;m trying to make my hair as thick and full as possible, but this didn&#x27;t really do anything for mine.  It cleans and moisturizes perfectly fine, but not substantially more than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Still a good product, but a little pricy.</li>
