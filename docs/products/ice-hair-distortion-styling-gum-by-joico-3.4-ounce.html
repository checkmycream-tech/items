            <li>This gives it a nice luster</li>
            <li>It does not do a good job on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>but it is very fine.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I also like Tigi Bed Head Manipulator, but I like this Distortion better.</li>

            <li>so glad it&#x27;s still available!</li>
            <li>Works better on shorter hair.</li>
            <li>it was too greasy like Redkin much better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I found Matte Clay from same brand works best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just me and my lack of skill, but I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and will work for the person with the right hair style and thicker hair than I have.  </li>
            <li>Very good product on my short hair!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this, it has a greasy feel after drying, does not allow your hair to move around like advertised, and instead easily breaks hold.</li>
            <li>Holds well and easy to use.</li>
            <li>but, yet smooth, kinda greasy feeling</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, i have been using it for the last 12 years.</li>
            <li>great product for short hair!</li>
            <li>I must say I did too - it didn&#x27;t leave as much of a residue on the brushes and gave his hair a nice, styled look without any 1950&#x27;s greaser after-effects.  </li>
            <li>You only have to use a pinch rubbed on hand and applied to make your hair style be great.</li>
            <li>Have used before good product it makes your hair have lots texture and the wild funky hairstyles will buy again,</li>
            <li>WIll definitely be buying more from Amazon when I run out!!</li>
            <li>what my sample was) and for a price I considered reasonable, so I was able to be the hero girlfriend and keep him in full supply!</li>
            <li>rinses clean w/water.</li>
            <li>old dudes, get sexy!</li>
            <li>I have short hair and it texturizes it and gives a good hold.</li>
            <li>I have used it several times and loved it each time.</li>
            <li>This is great for your hair if you don&#x27;t like the greasy feeling of other hair products.  </li>
            <li>works very well and does not have a strong smell to compete with your perfume</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair and a friend recommended this product.</li>
            <li>It just makes your own hair look a little better?</li>
            <li>Thanks for a fast smooth transaction A++</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very smooth and actually serves as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>but it did absolutely nothing for mine.  </li>
            <li>He has thick hair on the coarse side, so good hair gel has always been important for him to keep it where he wants it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it too much but from what I have used it,  I like it.</li>
            <li>My hair is just so baby fine that anything I use weights it down.  </li>
            <li>It is very soft with a creamy feel and is not intended to provide any hold.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other things similar to this</li>
            <li>Next time I would buy the trial size first.</li>
            <li>Most paste type styling products leave hair looking dull.  </li>
            <li>Use just a dime size and rub into your hands until it is clear, then piece out your hair with your fingers.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s better suited for someone with thick hair.</li>
            <li>I probably works better with thick hair.</li>
            <li>If you have never used a styling gum, start out with a very small amount (pea size), rub it all over the palm of your hand and then add to your hair; add more as you need.  </li>
            <li>It works great on long, thick hair to tame it and keep it from being fly-away.</li>
            <li>You do, however, have to be careful that you don&#x27;t use too much or your hair becomes greasy.</li>
            <li>No different really from other products like it.</li>

            <li> Its pretty expensive and hard to find locally, but love the fact</li>
            <li> so products usually don&#x27;t last the day for me before falling flat.  </li>
            <li> It washes out of my hair easily and it holds without making my hair stiff and hard to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products but always come back to this!</li>

            <li> Not exactly what I wanted, but can use it.</li>
            <li> This product is not that bad to have build up but a little more than I prefer.</li>
            <li> I have short, thick wavy hair and this is one of the few products that does not leave a residue on my hair, it controls my unruly mane all day long.  </li>
            <li> This product is intended to weigh down hair a little bit, hence the name \\&quot;gum\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky or heavy.  </li>
            <li> It is not available at stores anymore, so you have to order online -</li>
            <li> I am a 62 YO man and this helps my grey hair shine like crazy and holds just enough so as not to weigh down the style.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff or sticky, but adds texture and definition.</li>
            <li> It adds some texture to my hair with being stiff, sticky, or oily looking.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy as my Aquage, but does a goood job!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other things similar to this but, none feel or do as good as distortion. This stuff feels kinda waxey but, yet smooth, kinda greasy feeling but, doesn&#x27;t go on greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It washes out of my hair easily and it holds without making my hair stiff and hard to the touch.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This product makes my fine hair look greasy and dirty. Maybe it&#x27;s better suited for someone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this, it has a greasy feel after drying, does not allow your hair to move around like advertised, and instead easily breaks hold.</li>
            <li> Have used before good product it makes your hair have lots texture and the wild funky hairstyles will buy again,</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, i have been using it for the last 12 years. My cousin was a hairdresser and introduced me to it. Its pretty expensive and hard to find locally, but love the fact i can get it here. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Saw it used on You Tube by a stylist for all her short haircuts, so had to find it and order it. I also like Tigi Bed Head Manipulator, but I like this Distortion better. Use just a dime size and rub into your hands until it is clear, then piece out your hair with your fingers. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff or sticky, but adds texture and definition. I can see why this stylist relies on this product! WIll definitely be buying more from Amazon when I run out!!</li>
            <li> I like the way this product allows me to style my hair.  Distortion gives my hair volume.  I have very thick hair so products usually don&#x27;t last the day for me before falling flat.  This product makes my hair look that same at 10:00 PM as it did at 8:00 AM.  It&#x27;s not sticky or heavy.  It just makes your own hair look a little better?</li>
            <li> This is a good product and will work for the person with the right hair style and thicker hair than I have.  I have lots of hair but it is very fine.</li>
            <li> I love styling my hair with this.  It gives the separation, height, and thickness I need no matter how I style it.</li>
            <li> This is great for your hair if you don&#x27;t like the greasy feeling of other hair products.  It is not available at stores anymore, so you have to order online - so glad it&#x27;s still available!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the texture of one&#x27;s hair matters but it did absolutely nothing for mine.  Next time I would buy the trial size first.</li>
            <li> Oh man I love this stuff!  I am a 62 YO man and this helps my grey hair shine like crazy and holds just enough so as not to weigh down the style. Works better on shorter hair. My &amp;#34;man-card&amp;#34; is solidly in my wallet so c&#x27;mon old dudes, get sexy!</li>
            <li> it was too greasy like Redkin much better.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair and a friend recommended this product. It adds some texture to my hair with being stiff, sticky, or oily looking. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks for a fast smooth transaction A++</li>
            <li> Received in timely manner and seems product helps I. Styling my hair.</li>
            <li> I believe this is a great product. I have short, thick wavy hair and this is one of the few products that does not leave a residue on my hair, it controls my unruly mane all day long.  If you have never used a styling gum, start out with a very small amount (pea size), rub it all over the palm of your hand and then add to your hair; add more as you need.  I have tried other products but always come back to this!</li>
            <li> My hair is just so baby fine that anything I use weights it down.  I think my hair needs to be shorter and I know I would love it then!</li>
            <li> Dissapointed..made my hair feel greasy and I only used a dab. I watched a utube illustration si I resesrchrd it ell and resd reviews</li>
            <li> great product for short hair! rinses clean w/water.</li>
            <li> Saw it on Utube and thought I was getting a miracle.  No different really from other products like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s o.k. Not exactly what I wanted, but can use it.</li>
            <li> So I got this brand of gel as a freebie at some point some time ago, and when my boyfriend ran out of his regular hair gel, I went hunting through my stash and found this.  He loved it!  I must say I did too - it didn&#x27;t leave as much of a residue on the brushes and gave his hair a nice, styled look without any 1950&#x27;s greaser after-effects.  He has thick hair on the coarse side, so good hair gel has always been important for him to keep it where he wants it.  Since the container said that it was sold in salons, I went to Amazon to replenish.  I found this 3.4oz size (about twice what my sample was) and for a price I considered reasonable, so I was able to be the hero girlfriend and keep him in full supply!</li>
            <li> This product is intended to weigh down hair a little bit, hence the name \\&quot;gum\\&quot;. It is very soft with a creamy feel and is not intended to provide any hold. It works great on long, thick hair to tame it and keep it from being fly-away. Leaves hair very smooth and actually serves as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Have used it for years.  I have short gray hair. Distortion makes it shiny and darker.</li>
            <li> Holds well and easy to use. Most paste type styling products leave hair looking dull.  This gives it a nice luster</li>
            <li> Very good product on my short hair!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  However, I have dry hair and don&#x27;t shampoo every day.  This product is not that bad to have build up but a little more than I prefer.</li>
            <li> This product does not work for my hair type! I found Matte Clay from same brand works best.</li>
            <li> I have tried over and over again, but no luck with getting a &amp;#34;piecey&amp;#34; look. Instead, I end up with a greasy look. I use the suggested amount, but the out come is not what I&#x27;m looking for. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just me and my lack of skill, but I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is a really good molding gum. I have short hair and it texturizes it and gives a good hold. You do, however, have to be careful that you don&#x27;t use too much or your hair becomes greasy.</li>
            <li> Is one of the best products that I have found.  You only have to use a pinch rubbed on hand and applied to make your hair style be great.</li>
            <li> Ordered this after seeing in on YouTube.  Didn&#x27;t know if I would like it or not.  I have used it several times and loved it each time.</li>
            <li> I could not get my &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; paste and this was recommended to me. Not as heavy as my Aquage, but does a goood job!</li>
            <li> works very well and does not have a strong smell to compete with your perfume</li>
            <li> I ordered for a friend and she loves Joico products.</li>
            <li> Just like what you buy at the Salon, but a lot cheaper!</li>
            <li> i like it.  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it too much but from what I have used it,  I like it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have very short hair and it gives me just what I need to keep it spiky but with tons of volume!  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I have already given a view earlier.</li>
            <li> I probably works better with thick hair. It does not do a good job on my fine hair.</li>
