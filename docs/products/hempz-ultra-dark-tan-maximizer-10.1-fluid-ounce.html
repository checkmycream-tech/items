            <li>have always loved ANY Hempz product I have purchased...... but DONT be fooled by</li>
            <li>I used it in Florida its good for tanning.</li>
            <li>It works to help tan keep its good looks.</li>
            <li>The lotion smells good but as for helping me tan faster and darker.</li>
            <li>smell great and tans u nicely.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I came on Amazon because I knew I could get it for a fair price here.</li>
            <li>Works well and keeps you fairly moisturized.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>This product smells sooo good.</li>
            <li>It even smells good after you get out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>Being fair skinned</li>
            <li>Even after I tan it still smells good, which isn&#x27;t always the case.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a lotion with a good smell and without a bronzer...</li>
            <li>Smells good and works.</li>
            <li>This product has a good smell to it.</li>
            <li>and she said that it&#x27;s actually a good thing.  </li>
            <li>Good quality tanning lotion, it smells good, has a tropical fruity smell, and has good coverage.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing, good price and shipping</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a month, and I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>On top of the quality of this lotion the smell is great.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, I have been using this for about two weeks and man am I happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>

            <li>i love this lotion!  </li>
            <li>love the smell!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li>I plan to order more!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Favorite maximizer!</li>
            <li>I love This Tan Maximizer and the girls that work at the salon wanted it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I got amazing results and my tan has lasted quite a while now.  </li>
            <li>The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>very happy to find a level 2 lotion, you really need to switch up your lotions to get a deeper darker tan.</li>
            <li>I guess I cannot complain because it does give me a nice brown color</li>
            <li>Really liked this product... not oily.</li>
            <li>Smells kind of like apricot.</li>
            <li>Good for people who tan easily</li>
            <li>Has a very strong mango scent.</li>
            <li>I got many, many compliments when I got out of the tanning bed because of the smell and because you can automatically see a difference in your tan!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m from a generation of fair light skin color family so to achieve any color</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to my friends, also, it&#x27;s much more affordable than the kind they sell at the tanning salon for $60.</li>
            <li>The smell is awesome and it makes you really soft.</li>
            <li>I am more of a musky kind of person myself</li>
            <li>It has a great fresh peachy smell.  </li>
            <li>this goes on easy and really smells great!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sooo happy that I found it here for such a great price.</li>
            <li>Another thing I like about this lotion is that the scent is very light, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>The smell is a grape/berry smell that smells very cheap and gag inducing.</li>
            <li>but the packaging is very cheap.</li>
            <li>Smells great, no nasty ingredients, and very hydrating without being greasy!  </li>
            <li>I have used hempz for years and love it.</li>
            <li>Love the moisturizer in it.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would have more of a bronzer in it, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin feel healthy and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to keep increasing the duration of tanning without burning by using this product.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and love it..</li>
            <li>Have let the girls at my store use it and they love it too.</li>
            <li>LOVE this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Very impressed, and I will definitely keep  purchasing it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I have been more than satisfied.</li>
            <li>I think this lotion is more of a moisturizer than anything.</li>
            <li>Better than the Designer skin version</li>
            <li>My skin complexion is more like a Mario Lopez color</li>
            <li>a couple more beach trips will do the trick.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product...</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it would be like the Hempz I used to know and love 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>and I love that it doesnt have any bronzers.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell and my tan looks great.</li>
            <li>its a great product plus its way much cheaper here then at the tanning salons.</li>
            <li>THE WIFE LOVES IT, AND I LOVE THE PRICE</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>i love all hempz produces.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say that is has maximized my tan, but it does work, and better than most products that cost 2-3 times</li>
            <li>The smell is great and it applyed very well</li>
            <li>and i will buy more.</li>
            <li>so we&#x27;ll see :)</li>
            <li>I tan easily on my own, but my skin is so sensitive and breaks out easily with most lotions, but this worked great and didn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction at all.</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast and the lotion is amazing!</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have pretty fair skin</li>
            <li>Not as good as the original but not bad.</li>
            <li>Only con is it doesn&#x27;t smell very good</li>
            <li>it smells great and gave me a Natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>I want a maximizer that is very hydrating, won&#x27;t stain my clothes, and smells good.  </li>
            <li>and it works very well on my fair</li>
            <li>Great Deal and Super Fast Shipping</li>
            <li>Great, good quality and so much less</li>
            <li>This was the first time that I used the product and absolutely LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t make me burn easily.</li>
            <li>but it has a strong mango/fruity smell too it.</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my skin feeling amazingly soft, while creating a very nice, deep tan.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be working just fine.</li>
            <li>and I never got tanned this quickly!</li>
            <li>and since I have very sensitive and fair skin I always use the Hempz products.  </li>
            <li>Works awesome  to get a naturally dark tan!</li>
            <li>My skin always feels nourished and smooth with this product.</li>
            <li>Does not rub on smoothly or hydrate well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what its primary function is, a moisturizer, perhaps.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and made me instantly darker!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;the original Hempz products</li>
            <li>Bottom line; the Hempz Ultra Dark tanning lotion is great especially if you don&#x27;t want a bronzing formula and this seller is amazing!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the lotion :)</li>
            <li>Just because it doesn&#x27;t have a bronzer in it, that is not a bad thing.  </li>
            <li>The smell of this lotion was pleasant, it didn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel, left my skin feeling fairly well moisturized, and gave me great color without being stupidly expensive.</li>
            <li>was quick.</li>
            <li>and this is mild.</li>
            <li>Works quickly.  </li>
            <li>I think I will continue to use this product because it works, smells lovely (like some sort of tropical fresh fruit) and is much cheaper than what it sold in salons.</li>
            <li>it does not absorb quickly into your skin.  </li>
            <li>After tanning, my skin is left very moisturized and soft, with a wonderful glow.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and gets me dark</li>
            <li>This is the first Tanning Lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and it works!</li>
            <li>Buy it online and save yourself $20 this stuff is legit and I compared it to the in store bottle exact match!</li>
            <li>my skin is super sensitive and reacts to most things.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin soft and smooth- not sticky!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this tan maximizer -- I was reluctant to purchase it because sometimes products that are natural or vegan do not seem to work as well as chemical products</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin to most lotions</li>
            <li>Better than the green bottle and the blue; smell not my favorite; ingredients are good.</li>
            <li>This lotion has helped me not only recieve a nice tan but has prevented me from burning.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This will leave you with a natural tan :).</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>Feels great, and I&#x27;m not sure, but it seems to have a mild bronzer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any with a bronzer, I start getting tanned with this right away</li>
            <li>I used this Hempz Ultra Dark Tanning lotion years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get you dark spell really good tho</li>
            <li>I used this outside as well *over a little sunscreen and it worked great!</li>
            <li>Smells great and achieve a great natural tan quickly-without ever looking fake or orange!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried tanning with it once so far, but it works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Worked well and appeared to assist with tanning process ... but the peach smell (at least on me/to me) was VERY strong and potent.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues with this lotion!!!  </li>
            <li>I used it tonight for the first time</li>
            <li>Used it for the first tan of the season in a stand up-</li>
            <li>This is the second Hempz product I have purchased and I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the future</li>
            <li>I have used higher cost tanning lotions and none work as well as this product.</li>
            <li>It has a light, nearly fruity scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than regular body lotion.</li>
            <li>My first application I applied liberally to my legs and my arms leaving out my torso.</li>
            <li>Love it overall.</li>
            <li>It shipped extremely fast too!</li>
            <li>I love that it is made out of safe and natural hemp seed making it relied on the toxins other lotions/tanning lotions may have.</li>
            <li>It was a good tanning lotion for me when I was just starting out, but I found myself not getting any tanner until I switched to a different tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>It works fast and I will definitely be purchasing this product again once I run out of it :)</li>
            <li>Okay, this is not SUPER maximizing, but I am not looking for super maximizing.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The nice thing about this is that its half the price</li>
            <li>It really helped me develop a nice, dark tan.</li>
            <li>Smells good, not sure if it really helps my tan.</li>
            <li>After trying the single use tan maximizer, I fell in love.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, feels healthy on your skin, definitely helps you tan (not just burn like other tanning lotions!), and I will probably order these products again next Spring.</li>
            <li>Very high quality</li>
            <li>Thanks to Prime.</li>
            <li>No way was I going to pay that much for lotion.</li>
            <li>Beach Bum wants 51 with tax included.</li>
            <li>.........keeps your skin very moist.</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s very hydrating and also tans my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m unsure if this product is really legit -</li>
            <li>and i do 20mins in the fast bed.</li>
            <li>and i Really see a change in my color.</li>
            <li>But I really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product earlier this week (SUPER fast delivery - thank you!).</li>
            <li>could smell a little better but makes my skin super soft...</li>
            <li>I used to use Snooki&#x27;s ultra dark tanning maximizer, which is not vegan and contains way more chemicals</li>
            <li>I love all of the other Hempz products, so it looks like I&#x27;ve found a brand I&#x27;ll be sticking with!</li>
            <li>This maximizer smells good before you get into the tanning bed but smells a little different once you tan.</li>
            <li>This is a decent tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>It is very thick and when I&#x27;m done tanning I feel extremely sticky all over, but besides that I think it does give a great color!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li>There was almost no color change after tanning in a high power bed</li>
            <li>Omg it smells so good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>You can definitely tell a difference when using this product though, Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use it a few more times, but my gut is telling me to toss it.</li>
            <li>Found it here more than half the price off!</li>
            <li>If anyone is new to tanning and worried about burning try this product.</li>
            <li>before i got this lottion i was using the playboy live</li>
            <li>I spent $50ish on that Snooki lotion only for it to cause an allergic reaction, and it can&#x27;t be returned, so I bought this lotion and love it.</li>
            <li>they sent me a free sample of a different lotion and a 5% off my next order...</li>
            <li>This product is very soft and creates color overnight as you sleep and throughout the day.</li>
            <li>First,  it smells like a mixture of fructise shampoo and paint remover, second</li>
            <li>so this is the first and only lotion I&#x27;ve used for my body.</li>
            <li>This tanner is natural and VEGAN!  </li>
            <li>It also leaves your skin feeling so soft!</li>
            <li>I have to be super careful about what I put on my body and always read ingredients on everything</li>
            <li>and I told the girl at the salon that my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>Its not sticky like some lotions are and made my skin soft.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m not seeing that this product is helping me tan...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend especially especially if you want to save money.</li>
            <li>This new lotion takes some getting use to especially the smell.</li>
            <li>Not only did I NOT burn, this lotion didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and trust me</li>
            <li>It left my skin soo soft</li>
            <li>This smells like fresh cut fruit with a green back note.  </li>
            <li>I have blue eyes, dirty blonde hair and have a fair complexion with freckles and moles.</li>
            <li>However, this one is super thick.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> have always loved ANY Hempz product I have purchased...... but DONT be fooled by</li>
            <li> I used it in Florida its good for tanning.</li>
            <li> It works to help tan keep its good looks.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells good but as for helping me tan faster and darker.</li>
            <li> smell great and tans u nicely.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I came on Amazon because I knew I could get it for a fair price here.</li>
            <li> Works well and keeps you fairly moisturized.</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> This product smells sooo good.</li>
            <li> It even smells good after you get out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Being fair skinned</li>
            <li> Even after I tan it still smells good, which isn&#x27;t always the case.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lotion with a good smell and without a bronzer...</li>
            <li> Smells good and works.</li>
            <li> This product has a good smell to it.</li>
            <li> and she said that it&#x27;s actually a good thing.  </li>
            <li> Good quality tanning lotion, it smells good, has a tropical fruity smell, and has good coverage.  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing, good price and shipping</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month, and I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> On top of the quality of this lotion the smell is great.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I have been using this for about two weeks and man am I happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> and like good, nice smelling tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> i love this lotion!  </li>
            <li> love the smell!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li> I plan to order more!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Favorite maximizer!</li>
            <li> I love This Tan Maximizer and the girls that work at the salon wanted it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I got amazing results and my tan has lasted quite a while now.  </li>
            <li> The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> very happy to find a level 2 lotion, you really need to switch up your lotions to get a deeper darker tan.</li>
            <li> I guess I cannot complain because it does give me a nice brown color</li>
            <li> Really liked this product... not oily.</li>
            <li> Smells kind of like apricot.</li>
            <li> Good for people who tan easily</li>
            <li> Has a very strong mango scent.</li>
            <li> I got many, many compliments when I got out of the tanning bed because of the smell and because you can automatically see a difference in your tan!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m from a generation of fair light skin color family so to achieve any color</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to my friends, also, it&#x27;s much more affordable than the kind they sell at the tanning salon for $60.</li>
            <li> The smell is awesome and it makes you really soft.</li>
            <li> I am more of a musky kind of person myself</li>
            <li> It has a great fresh peachy smell.  </li>
            <li> this goes on easy and really smells great!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sooo happy that I found it here for such a great price.</li>
            <li> Another thing I like about this lotion is that the scent is very light, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> The smell is a grape/berry smell that smells very cheap and gag inducing.</li>
            <li> but the packaging is very cheap.</li>
            <li> Smells great, no nasty ingredients, and very hydrating without being greasy!  </li>
            <li> I have used hempz for years and love it.</li>
            <li> Love the moisturizer in it.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would have more of a bronzer in it, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells</li>
            <li> and it makes my skin feel healthy and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I have been able to keep increasing the duration of tanning without burning by using this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and love it..</li>
            <li> Have let the girls at my store use it and they love it too.</li>
            <li> LOVE this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Very impressed, and I will definitely keep  purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I have been more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> I think this lotion is more of a moisturizer than anything.</li>
            <li> Better than the Designer skin version</li>
            <li> My skin complexion is more like a Mario Lopez color</li>
            <li> a couple more beach trips will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product...</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would be like the Hempz I used to know and love 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> and I love that it doesnt have any bronzers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell and my tan looks great.</li>
            <li> its a great product plus its way much cheaper here then at the tanning salons.</li>
            <li> THE WIFE LOVES IT, AND I LOVE THE PRICE</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> i love all hempz produces.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say that is has maximized my tan, but it does work, and better than most products that cost 2-3 times</li>
            <li> The smell is great and it applyed very well</li>
            <li> and i will buy more.</li>
            <li> so we&#x27;ll see :)</li>
            <li> I tan easily on my own, but my skin is so sensitive and breaks out easily with most lotions, but this worked great and didn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction at all.</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast and the lotion is amazing!</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have pretty fair skin</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original but not bad.</li>
            <li> Only con is it doesn&#x27;t smell very good</li>
            <li> it smells great and gave me a Natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> I want a maximizer that is very hydrating, won&#x27;t stain my clothes, and smells good.  </li>
            <li> and it works very well on my fair</li>
            <li> Great Deal and Super Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> Great, good quality and so much less</li>
            <li> This was the first time that I used the product and absolutely LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make me burn easily.</li>
            <li> but it has a strong mango/fruity smell too it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my skin feeling amazingly soft, while creating a very nice, deep tan.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be working just fine.</li>
            <li> and I never got tanned this quickly!</li>
            <li> and since I have very sensitive and fair skin I always use the Hempz products.  </li>
            <li> Works awesome  to get a naturally dark tan!</li>
            <li> My skin always feels nourished and smooth with this product.</li>
            <li> Does not rub on smoothly or hydrate well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what its primary function is, a moisturizer, perhaps.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and made me instantly darker!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the original Hempz products</li>
            <li> Bottom line; the Hempz Ultra Dark tanning lotion is great especially if you don&#x27;t want a bronzing formula and this seller is amazing!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the lotion :)</li>
            <li> Just because it doesn&#x27;t have a bronzer in it, that is not a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion was pleasant, it didn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel, left my skin feeling fairly well moisturized, and gave me great color without being stupidly expensive.</li>
            <li> was quick.</li>
            <li> and this is mild.</li>
            <li> Works quickly.  </li>
            <li> I think I will continue to use this product because it works, smells lovely (like some sort of tropical fresh fruit) and is much cheaper than what it sold in salons.</li>
            <li> it does not absorb quickly into your skin.  </li>
            <li> After tanning, my skin is left very moisturized and soft, with a wonderful glow.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and gets me dark</li>
            <li> This is the first Tanning Lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and it works!</li>
            <li> Buy it online and save yourself $20 this stuff is legit and I compared it to the in store bottle exact match!</li>
            <li> my skin is super sensitive and reacts to most things.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin soft and smooth- not sticky!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this tan maximizer -- I was reluctant to purchase it because sometimes products that are natural or vegan do not seem to work as well as chemical products</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin to most lotions</li>
            <li> Better than the green bottle and the blue; smell not my favorite; ingredients are good.</li>
            <li> This lotion has helped me not only recieve a nice tan but has prevented me from burning.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This will leave you with a natural tan :).</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> Feels great, and I&#x27;m not sure, but it seems to have a mild bronzer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any with a bronzer, I start getting tanned with this right away</li>
            <li> I used this Hempz Ultra Dark Tanning lotion years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get you dark spell really good tho</li>
            <li> I used this outside as well *over a little sunscreen and it worked great!</li>
            <li> Smells great and achieve a great natural tan quickly-without ever looking fake or orange!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried tanning with it once so far, but it works pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Worked well and appeared to assist with tanning process ... but the peach smell (at least on me/to me) was VERY strong and potent.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues with this lotion!!!  </li>
            <li> I used it tonight for the first time</li>
            <li> Used it for the first tan of the season in a stand up-</li>
            <li> This is the second Hempz product I have purchased and I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more in the future</li>
            <li> I have used higher cost tanning lotions and none work as well as this product.</li>
            <li> It has a light, nearly fruity scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than regular body lotion.</li>
            <li> My first application I applied liberally to my legs and my arms leaving out my torso.</li>
            <li> Love it overall.</li>
            <li> It shipped extremely fast too!</li>
            <li> I love that it is made out of safe and natural hemp seed making it relied on the toxins other lotions/tanning lotions may have.</li>
            <li> It was a good tanning lotion for me when I was just starting out, but I found myself not getting any tanner until I switched to a different tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> It works fast and I will definitely be purchasing this product again once I run out of it :)</li>
            <li> Okay, this is not SUPER maximizing, but I am not looking for super maximizing.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The nice thing about this is that its half the price</li>
            <li> It really helped me develop a nice, dark tan.</li>
            <li> Smells good, not sure if it really helps my tan.</li>
            <li> After trying the single use tan maximizer, I fell in love.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, feels healthy on your skin, definitely helps you tan (not just burn like other tanning lotions!), and I will probably order these products again next Spring.</li>
            <li> Very high quality</li>
            <li> Thanks to Prime.</li>
            <li> No way was I going to pay that much for lotion.</li>
            <li> Beach Bum wants 51 with tax included.</li>
            <li> .........keeps your skin very moist.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s very hydrating and also tans my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure if this product is really legit -</li>
            <li> and i do 20mins in the fast bed.</li>
            <li> and i Really see a change in my color.</li>
            <li> But I really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product earlier this week (SUPER fast delivery - thank you!).</li>
            <li> could smell a little better but makes my skin super soft...</li>
            <li> I used to use Snooki&#x27;s ultra dark tanning maximizer, which is not vegan and contains way more chemicals</li>
            <li> I love all of the other Hempz products, so it looks like I&#x27;ve found a brand I&#x27;ll be sticking with!</li>
            <li> This maximizer smells good before you get into the tanning bed but smells a little different once you tan.</li>
            <li> This is a decent tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and when I&#x27;m done tanning I feel extremely sticky all over, but besides that I think it does give a great color!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> There was almost no color change after tanning in a high power bed</li>
            <li> Omg it smells so good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You can definitely tell a difference when using this product though, Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it a few more times, but my gut is telling me to toss it.</li>
            <li> Found it here more than half the price off!</li>
            <li> If anyone is new to tanning and worried about burning try this product.</li>
            <li> before i got this lottion i was using the playboy live</li>
            <li> I spent $50ish on that Snooki lotion only for it to cause an allergic reaction, and it can&#x27;t be returned, so I bought this lotion and love it.</li>
            <li> they sent me a free sample of a different lotion and a 5% off my next order...</li>
            <li> This product is very soft and creates color overnight as you sleep and throughout the day.</li>
            <li> First,  it smells like a mixture of fructise shampoo and paint remover, second</li>
            <li> so this is the first and only lotion I&#x27;ve used for my body.</li>
            <li> This tanner is natural and VEGAN!  </li>
            <li> It also leaves your skin feeling so soft!</li>
            <li> I have to be super careful about what I put on my body and always read ingredients on everything</li>
            <li> and I told the girl at the salon that my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> Its not sticky like some lotions are and made my skin soft.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m not seeing that this product is helping me tan...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend especially especially if you want to save money.</li>
            <li> This new lotion takes some getting use to especially the smell.</li>
            <li> Not only did I NOT burn, this lotion didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and trust me</li>
            <li> It left my skin soo soft</li>
            <li> This smells like fresh cut fruit with a green back note.  </li>
            <li> I have blue eyes, dirty blonde hair and have a fair complexion with freckles and moles.</li>
            <li> However, this one is super thick.  </li>
            <li> that I usually see quick results from with other lotions.</li>
            <li> I like to start with the Hempz Natural Bronzer Tan Maximizer and after a couple weeks I switch to the Ultra Dark Tan Maximizer.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little longer to rub in, but I think that is from the natural ingredients vs the chemicals from the others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I have started working really hard at getting and maintaining a tan, i used this from the very beginning  and it helps a lot.</li>
            <li> and I have a very noticeably dark tan!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new at tanning and usually burn...</li>
            <li> it worked well but left little white spots on my legs!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something that won&#x27;t dry out your skin, this is it!  </li>
            <li> Gives a really dark, good, natural looking tan and doesn&#x27;t have an awful smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and have already noticed darker results, and then there&#x27;s the price...great buy and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 times already - not really what I expected.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves my tan, and tries to copy it.</li>
            <li> I like that it will help you achieve a nice base tan.</li>
            <li> so I got this one because it has never bothered me in the past and worked decently, but this particular bottle is fake.</li>
            <li> I was a little leary of purchasing this online because I&#x27;ve read so many reviews, on other sellers, of people being sold fake and expired lotions!</li>
            <li> I had ordered from this seller before and got a single use packet of Hempz Ultra Dark Tan Maximer included with my order.  </li>
            <li> This lotion made my skin extremely itchy.</li>
            <li> Other lotions I have used often leave me with a burnt flesh funk smell, but this one does not at all.  </li>
            <li> Due the price I&#x27;ve found here</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re out in the summer sun, the tanner does not sweat off well and works extremely well, and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> only complaint is, in shipping, the bottle came open slightly, which was a bit of a mess.</li>
            <li> I know tanning in general makes your skin dry and itchy but this lotion made it 10 times worse.</li>
            <li> (I expected quality from HEMPZ, even down to the packaging!)</li>
            <li> , just haven&#x27;t gotten too dark yet</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that if it was an ultra dark maximizer, there would be bronzer&#x27;s in it.  </li>
            <li> When they say it&#x27;s an ultra dark tan maximizer, they aren&#x27;t kidding.  </li>
            <li> and my tan is just as dark today as the day I laid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the container is awkward to use because the cream doesn&#x27;t flow out easily when you squeeze the relatively hard tube.  </li>
            <li> Went on amazon found identical for almost half the price.</li>
            <li> The scent it odd, kinda like fruit punch or something.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells like it is very old and just has a bad odor, especially when you have been laying in the tanning bed and it gets heated up.</li>
            <li> I bought because of natural ingredients , sadly I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again .</li>
            <li> It gives you a nice color but smells terrible.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money like I just did.</li>
            <li> By that evening I begin have whelps on my upper arms within 24 hours Both legs and arms were aggressively getting worse.</li>
            <li> After a few times in the tanning bed using this lotion, white spots began to appear on my face and became worse as I continued to use the lotion.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell, but it does enhance the &amp;#34;tanning&amp;#34; not the bronzing if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to write a bad product review if it&#x27;s indeed the real product...</li>
            <li> First time a tanning lotion from Amazon didn&#x27;t do what it said it would. :(</li>
            <li> not sure why</li>
            <li> This product is making I mean I got color in as little as 2-3 days of tanning</li>
            <li> I usually like the Hempz stuff.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the glowing reviews, I purchased  and anxiously awaited for the lotion to arrive for me to use.  </li>
            <li> was extremely hard.</li>
            <li> resultsI try to tan at least 3 times per week.</li>
            <li> It is thick if you like that.</li>
            <li> the lotion is thick and takes time to rub in.</li>
            <li> Clumpy and thick.</li>
            <li> The results I got from this lotion after just one use is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> the one I used five years ago which was a little disappointing but</li>
            <li> Not happy with the tan</li>
            <li> I decided to look on Amazon for tanning lotion as I was tired of paying over $50 at the saloon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a regular tanner, but my family needed to establish base tans before going to Aruba for a vacation.</li>
            <li> I was actually tired by the time I finished trying to rub this into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes from this after reading results but was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> natural and doesn&#x27;t stain your skin like nasty bronzers.</li>
            <li> They are not nearly as AWESOME as</li>
            <li> Fake.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell DISGUSTING</li>
            <li> I was told not to buy online because of the risk of getting a fake one.</li>
            <li> Not a sugary fake peach smell.  </li>
            <li> I am always afraid my skin will turn orange.</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> the peach smell isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> , it makes my skin itch :(</li>
            <li> -- boy was I wrong!!</li>
            <li> I was VERY disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all extremely disappointed !!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all extremely disappointed !!</li>
            <li> Works As Advertised! Great Deal and Super Fast Shipping Thanks to Prime.</li>
            <li> I recently started tanning and I told the girl at the salon that my skin is sensitive so she recommended I try a sample size of this lotion. I noticed a big difference after only one tan. I asked about the price and said it was $50 ... No way was I going to pay that much for lotion. Went on amazon found identical for almost half the price. Very happy with this purchase. Smells amazing, good price and shipping was quick. Highly recommend especially especially if you want to save money.</li>
            <li> I have used hempz for years and love it. I don&#x27;t use any with a bronzer, I start getting tanned with this right away</li>
            <li> I have used Hempz before.  Love the moisturizer in it.  I thought this would have more of a bronzer in it, but it doesn&#x27;t. It does accelerate the tanning process.</li>
            <li> Smells good after tanning.</li>
            <li> this goes on easy and really smells great!  i love this lotion!  it is a thicker lotion, which is nice!  very happy to find a level 2 lotion, you really need to switch up your lotions to get a deeper darker tan.</li>
            <li> Worked great!  No bronzers</li>
            <li> love the smell! leaves my skin soft and smooth- not sticky!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this tan maximizer -- I was reluctant to purchase it because sometimes products that are natural or vegan do not seem to work as well as chemical products -- boy was I wrong!! I used it tonight for the first time and I have a very noticeably dark tan!!! I used to use Snooki&#x27;s ultra dark tanning maximizer, which is not vegan and contains way more chemicals and I never got tanned this quickly! Another thing I like about this lotion is that the scent is very light, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. I am very impressed and will stick with this lotion from now on!</li>
            <li> This lotion made my skin extremely itchy. I know tanning in general makes your skin dry and itchy but this lotion made it 10 times worse. The scent it odd, kinda like fruit punch or something. I will be returning this item.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I have super sensitive skin and this is mild. Also it keeps my skin hydrated. I have a great afterglow too!</li>
            <li> I guess I cannot complain because it does give me a nice brown color BUT it wasn&#x27;t what I expected as far as when I put it on my skin. It is very thick and when I&#x27;m done tanning I feel extremely sticky all over, but besides that I think it does give a great color!</li>
            <li> Beach Bum wants 51 with tax included. Found it here more than half the price off! Great product. Used it for the first tan of the season in a stand up- no burn.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! My tan is darker and lasted longer too. Great product in my book.</li>
            <li> Really liked this product... not oily. Smells great! Achieved darker tanning results!&lt;br /&gt;I have always loved ANY Hempz product I have purchased...... but DONT be fooled by&lt;br /&gt;other products containing or featuring Hemp! They are not nearly as AWESOME as&lt;br /&gt;the original Hempz products</li>
            <li> Very nice product, smells good, works good. I used it in Florida its good for tanning. Just do not go into water without reappling it. Love the way it smells</li>
            <li> Okay, this is not SUPER maximizing, but I am not looking for super maximizing.  I want a maximizer that is very hydrating, won&#x27;t stain my clothes, and smells good.  This Hempz product is all those things.  I actually like the smell and it makes my skin feel healthy and hydrated.  This lotion is not tinted, it is NOT a bronzer.</li>
            <li> It works to help tan keep its good looks.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves your skin silky</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Very high quality and it works very well on my fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use it before and after sunning.</li>
            <li> Omg it smells so good and a little goes a long way. This is the second Hempz product I have purchased and I am extremely satisfied. I will be buying more in the future</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good. It doesn&#x27;t take &amp;#34;tanning smell&amp;#34; away. I&#x27;ve never gotten acne from all the various tanning lotions I&#x27;ve tried and this gave me body and face acne. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with acne until trying this. It is thick if you like that. I bought because of natural ingredients , sadly I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again .</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month, and I am very pleased with it.  Other lotions I have used often leave me with a burnt flesh funk smell, but this one does not at all.  The smell is pleasing, and the lotion does not stain clothing.  After tanning, my skin is left very moisturized and soft, with a wonderful glow.  I can&#x27;t recommend this lotion enough!</li>
            <li> The lotion smells good but as for helping me tan faster and darker. Just not seeing it. Not happy with the tan resultsI try to tan at least 3 times per week. First time a tanning lotion from Amazon didn&#x27;t do what it said it would. :(</li>
            <li> Fake. I have sensitive skin to most lotions so I got this one because it has never bothered me in the past and worked decently, but this particular bottle is fake. First,  it smells like a mixture of fructise shampoo and paint remover, second, it makes my skin itch :(</li>
            <li> The color I get from this is wonderful. I don&#x27;t have to worry about turning into an oompa loompa (orange person for those that don&#x27;t get the reference).</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion from Amazon because of the low price compared to tanning salons. After a few times in the tanning bed using this lotion, white spots began to appear on my face and became worse as I continued to use the lotion. I finally decided to stop using it and replaced it with a different brand, and after a couple months the white spots went away.</li>
            <li> Great price!! Lotion has a nice peachy scent to it,  that helps cover up the tanning bed smell we all get!  I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues with this lotion!!!  I plan to order more!</li>
            <li> This product is very amazing. I have used higher cost tanning lotions and none work as well as this product. I have been able to keep increasing the duration of tanning without burning by using this product. My skin always feels nourished and smooth with this product. If anyone is new to tanning and worried about burning try this product. On top of the quality of this lotion the smell is great.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and love it..</li>
            <li> Smells great and gets me dark</li>
            <li> Excellent.........keeps your skin very moist.</li>
            <li> Gives a really dark, good, natural looking tan and doesn&#x27;t have an awful smell.  Works quickly.  Haven&#x27;t used in a tanning bed; used in sun by pool and while walking.  Resluts were great. Would highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> smell great and tans u nicely. Will order this product again in the future. Have let the girls at my store use it and they love it too.</li>
            <li> I decided to look on Amazon for tanning lotion as I was tired of paying over $50 at the saloon. I spent $50ish on that Snooki lotion only for it to cause an allergic reaction, and it can&#x27;t be returned, so I bought this lotion and love it. It smells great so I can tan and still run errands and not be self-conscious of how I smell. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and have already noticed darker results, and then there&#x27;s the price...great buy and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Worked well and appeared to assist with tanning process ... but the peach smell (at least on me/to me) was VERY strong and potent.  Obviously, you sweat in a tanning bed so when you got out you literally smelled like a sweat with a peach scent until you could shower.  Will continue to use until the bottle is gone, but likely that I won&#x27;t reorder this type in the future.  Sorry!</li>
            <li> LOVE this tanning lotion. If you are seeking for a tanning lotion, this is the answer. it gives darker sun tanning in just one day under the sun. It works on me on my sister on my male friend...They also bought this after I gave them try.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells like it is very old and just has a bad odor, especially when you have been laying in the tanning bed and it gets heated up.</li>
            <li> I have continued to use this product for a while.  I will buy again, and recommend it to others. Thank you</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my skin feeling amazingly soft, while creating a very nice, deep tan.  Very impressed, and I will definitely keep  purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I have been using this for about two weeks and man am I happy with the results. I use this in both a tanning bed and outside as well.</li>
            <li> it smells amazing! it worked well but left little white spots on my legs! not sure why but i still like it!</li>
            <li> This product is making I mean I got color in as little as 2-3 days of tanning and I&#x27;m from a generation of fair light skin color family so to achieve any color was extremely hard. This product is very soft and creates color overnight as you sleep and throughout the day. I love that it is made out of safe and natural hemp seed making it relied on the toxins other lotions/tanning lotions may have.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It doesn&#x27;t leave the putrid &#x27;just tanned&#x27; scent on your skin. It has a light, nearly fruity scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is, in shipping, the bottle came open slightly, which was a bit of a mess. Otherwise, I have been more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a decent tanning lotion. It&#x27;s moisturizing and smells like peaches. It was a good tanning lotion for me when I was just starting out, but I found myself not getting any tanner until I switched to a different tanning lotion. I think this lotion is more of a moisturizer than anything. It does have a greasy feeling when you&#x27;re done tanning, however I have yet to find a tanning lotion that didn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a regular tanner, but my family needed to establish base tans before going to Aruba for a vacation. The smell of this lotion was pleasant, it didn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel, left my skin feeling fairly well moisturized, and gave me great color without being stupidly expensive.</li>
            <li> Better than the green bottle and the blue; smell not my favorite; ingredients are good. Tried all three and this is the one I would purhase again. Better than the Designer skin version</li>
            <li> It gives you a nice color but smells terrible.  It smells like chemicals. I don&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations And smells awesome!! Would recommend this for my friends! Thank you so much for the lotion :)</li>
            <li> This is the first Tanning Lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and it works! My skin complexion is more like a Mario Lopez color but I had a farmers tan. I&#x27;ve used this 3 times at the beach and I can see the color evening out well. I don&#x27;t go to tanning places but a couple more beach trips will do the trick. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I feel it&#x27;s very hydrating and also tans my skin well. Good for people who tan easily and like good, nice smelling tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> This product not only moisturizes, but enhances tanning indoors and out!  This was the first time that I used the product and absolutely LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newcomer to tanning beds so this is the first and only lotion I&#x27;ve used for my body. I have blue eyes, dirty blonde hair and have a fair complexion with freckles and moles. This lotion has helped me not only recieve a nice tan but has prevented me from burning. Due the price I&#x27;ve found here I think I will continue to use this product because it works, smells lovely (like some sort of tropical fresh fruit) and is much cheaper than what it sold in salons.</li>
            <li> Used this a handful of times and it hasn&#x27;t done a thing for me! I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money like I just did.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product... could smell a little better but makes my skin super soft...</li>
            <li> I had high hopes from this after reading results but was very disappointed. There was almost no color change after tanning in a high power bed that I usually see quick results from with other lotions. I won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than regular body lotion.</li>
            <li> This maximizer smells good before you get into the tanning bed but smells a little different once you tan. You can definitely tell a difference when using this product though, Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> Favorite maximizer! Smells great and achieve a great natural tan quickly-without ever looking fake or orange!</li>
            <li> Great, good quality and so much less then the tanning places charge!</li>
            <li> Smells good, not sure if it really helps my tan. it blew up in my package so lotion was everywhere!</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Beach Bum Tanning Salon - they charged me $51 for this bottle!!!! That&#x27;s why I came on Amazon because I knew I could get it for a fair price here. I have never gone to a tanning salon before and was worried about burning. Well, this product is great! Not only did I NOT burn, this lotion didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and trust me my skin is super sensitive and reacts to most things. I have to be super careful about what I put on my body and always read ingredients on everything but I had NO reaction whatsoever to this product. I will be ordering this from Amazon going forward. I&#x27;m sooo happy that I found it here for such a great price.</li>
            <li> I love This Tan Maximizer and the girls that work at the salon wanted it! it smells great and gave me a Natural looking tan. Its not sticky like some lotions are and made my skin soft. I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Love it! Works awesome  to get a naturally dark tan!</li>
            <li> The best suntan lotion I have ever bought</li>
            <li> I usually like the Hempz stuff.  However, this one is super thick.  I like the thinner stuff that actually rubs in.  For someone who likes this type it would be great, it just is not my preference.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would be like the Hempz I used to know and love 10 years ago.  I was VERY disappointed.  Not only does it smell DISGUSTING it does not absorb quickly into your skin.  I was actually tired by the time I finished trying to rub this into my skin.  The smell is a grape/berry smell that smells very cheap and gag inducing.</li>
            <li> Good quality tanning lotion, it smells good, has a tropical fruity smell, and has good coverage.  I would recommend this to my friends, also, it&#x27;s much more affordable than the kind they sell at the tanning salon for $60.</li>
            <li> Buy it online and save yourself $20 this stuff is legit and I compared it to the in store bottle exact match!</li>
            <li> I used this Hempz Ultra Dark Tanning lotion years ago and loved it. So when I started tanning again this year I began searching the Internet for the same one. I was a little leary of purchasing this online because I&#x27;ve read so many reviews, on other sellers, of people being sold fake and expired lotions! Well, NW Distributors is not one of them! I am so impressed with this seller. Shipping was extremely fast and the lotion is amazing! The lotion smells different then the one I used five years ago which was a little disappointing but the peach smell isn&#x27;t bad. The results I got from this lotion after just one use is unbelievable! I am about two shades darker after one use!? I was using an Australian Gold Bronzer lotion before I got this with no lasting results. Bottom line; the Hempz Ultra Dark tanning lotion is great especially if you don&#x27;t want a bronzing formula and this seller is amazing!</li>
            <li> This smells awesome.  I&#x27;ve only tried tanning with it once so far, but it works pretty good.  I&#x27;m new at tanning and usually burn... With this I didn&#x27;t, but that could be coincidence.  The smell is awesome and it makes you really soft.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Item as described.</li>
            <li> I usually only tan 1-2 per year and since I have very sensitive and fair skin I always use the Hempz products.  I like to start with the Hempz Natural Bronzer Tan Maximizer and after a couple weeks I switch to the Ultra Dark Tan Maximizer.  Smells good, feels healthy on your skin, definitely helps you tan (not just burn like other tanning lotions!), and I will probably order these products again next Spring.</li>
            <li> Works well and keeps you fairly moisturized. Smells good. Not as good as the original but not bad. I would buy it again</li>
            <li> This lotion is fantastic!  Smells great, no nasty ingredients, and very hydrating without being greasy!  My skin is bronze and looks very healthy!  I love all of the other Hempz products, so it looks like I&#x27;ve found a brand I&#x27;ll be sticking with!</li>
            <li> This product smells sooo good. It even smells good after you get out of the tanning bed. It left my skin soo soft and I love that it doesnt have any bronzers. I will be buying this product again. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This new lotion takes some getting use to especially the smell. Even though the container has changed the end results are still the same.</li>
            <li> If you go to any tanning salon they charge anywhere from $50 to $100 for tanning lotion. I was told not to buy online because of the risk of getting a fake one. Thank God the one I received wasn&#x27;t! The nice thing about this is that its half the price and it works well. I have pretty fair skin and I am hesitant to buy some lotions because of the additional bronzers they add to the lotion. Being fair skinned I am always afraid my skin will turn orange. My overall review of the product is that the lotion works well but it has a strong mango/fruity smell too it. I am more of a musky kind of person myself so I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell, but it does enhance the &amp;#34;tanning&amp;#34; not the bronzing if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> this is a great product, it smells awesome and its not over priced. i seen results after only 1 use. i will definately continue use and recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> After reading all the glowing reviews, I purchased  and anxiously awaited for the lotion to arrive for me to use.  My first application I applied liberally to my legs and my arms leaving out my torso. By that evening I begin have whelps on my upper arms within 24 hours Both legs and arms were aggressively getting worse. Try Benadryl, Zyrtec, anti-itch lotion, but nothing worked. saw the doctor today, four days after the incident, and am now on a regiment of prednisone to beat this.  I can&#x27;t recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion that does not have any bronzer in it. This will leave you with a natural tan :). I used this outside as well *over a little sunscreen and it worked great! Also, the smell is fruity and is great. There is no funky tanning lotion scent! Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!!! I use Hempz products all the time (lotions, soaps, etc) and they never disappoint. I used to work at a tanning salon and we sold this product. The lotion smells wonderful! Even after I tan it still smells good, which isn&#x27;t always the case. The color that comes from the lotion is great, it doesn&#x27;t give off an orange color. I&#x27;ve been tanning for a month and I&#x27;m still not through the bottle. Not to be used outside but it&#x27;s perfect for a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion and bought it at a tanning salon for years.  Can&#x27;t beat this price. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love it overall. It really helped me develop a nice, dark tan. Only con is it doesn&#x27;t smell very good and you get stinky after tanning. I love that it&#x27;s all natural and it doesn&#x27;t make me burn easily.</li>
            <li> This tanner is natural and VEGAN!  If you are looking for something that won&#x27;t dry out your skin, this is it!  When you&#x27;re out in the summer sun, the tanner does not sweat off well and works extremely well, and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> Finally!  I have been looking for a NON bronzer lotion.  I don&#x27;t know what it is about my skin type, but it reacts dramatically to bronzers.  Bronzers make me change race, not get tan.  The price of this lotion makes it a great value.  I tried the Snooki brand and it made me break out in minihives multiple times.  No reaction with this.  It has a great fresh peachy smell.  Not a sugary fake peach smell.  This smells like fresh cut fruit with a green back note.  The lotion is thicker than some of the others I&#x27;ve tried.  Takes a little longer to rub in, but I think that is from the natural ingredients vs the chemicals from the others I&#x27;ve tried.  I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lotion with a good smell and without a bronzer...this was perfect. It smells like white peaches and doesn&#x27;t change after tanning. No bronzer in it.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working just fine. It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell and my tan looks great. I&#x27;m using the Hempz body wash and moisturizer also</li>
            <li> its a great product plus its way much cheaper here then at the tanning salons. Get it from here , you will save  good money!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells incredible! It also leaves your skin feeling so soft! I got many, many compliments when I got out of the tanning bed because of the smell and because you can automatically see a difference in your tan! It works fast and I will definitely be purchasing this product again once I run out of it :)</li>
            <li> THE WIFE LOVES IT, AND I LOVE THE PRICE</li>
            <li> I ordered this product earlier this week (SUPER fast delivery - thank you!). I&#x27;ve used it 3 times already - not really what I expected. The packaging was almost generic - the logo and verbiage is fuzzy. (I expected quality from HEMPZ, even down to the packaging!) I&#x27;m unsure if this product is really legit - I don&#x27;t want to write a bad product review if it&#x27;s indeed the real product...but the packaging is very cheap. The lotion itself smells like peaches, but once you get out of the tanning bed, it&#x27;s got a not-so-great smell. So far, I&#x27;m not seeing that this product is helping me tan...but I&#x27;m not burning. I&#x27;ll use it a few more times, but my gut is telling me to toss it.</li>
            <li> it helps so you&#x27;re not a likely to burn, but tan instead.  Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tan very good.  I like the  medium tanning but I don&#x27;t see it on the  order  form. (Web site)</li>
            <li> Smells kind of like apricot. I chose this one after reading comparison reviews of this line of product. Feels great, and I&#x27;m not sure, but it seems to have a mild bronzer.</li>
            <li> smells and works great ! i love all hempz produces. the lotion is thick and takes time to rub in.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get you dark spell really good tho</li>
            <li> Smells good and works. Doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that is has maximized my tan, but it does work, and better than most products that cost 2-3 times it&#x27;s cost.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t stain your skin like nasty bronzers.</li>
            <li> Clumpy and thick. Does not rub on smoothly or hydrate well. Has a very strong mango scent.</li>
            <li> I have started working really hard at getting and maintaining a tan, i used this from the very beginning  and it helps a lot. Everyone loves my tan, and tries to copy it.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to take the time to let everyone know that this lottion is a very good buy. I just got it today and went to the tanning bed and i do 20mins in the fast bed. before i got this lottion i was using the playboy live fab and i Really see a change in my color. But when i used this today i could feel it working and when i got out of the bed. I was 2x darker then i was when i got in. The smell is great and it applyed very well and i will buy more. This lottion is gods gift to all women.</li>
            <li> The description indicated it was a self tanning cream .  It&#x27;s not.  I don&#x27;t know what its primary function is, a moisturizer, perhaps.  Also, the container is awkward to use because the cream doesn&#x27;t flow out easily when you squeeze the relatively hard tube.  The fragrance is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Smells great and made me instantly darker! I tan easily on my own, but my skin is so sensitive and breaks out easily with most lotions, but this worked great and didn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction at all. It shipped extremely fast too! Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> This product has a good smell to it. I have only used it twice now and I like it, just haven&#x27;t gotten too dark yet so we&#x27;ll see :) I like the company though....they sent me a free sample of a different lotion and a 5% off my next order... great incentive to get me to buy from them again! :)</li>
            <li> I thought with me being Tan already I would see a difference. But I really don&#x27;t. I use this lotion only when I use upgraded beds. I found that I would not recommend use on face.</li>
            <li> I had ordered from this seller before and got a single use packet of Hempz Ultra Dark Tan Maximer included with my order.  After trying the single use tan maximizer, I fell in love.  It smells AMAZING!  I was under the impression that if it was an ultra dark maximizer, there would be bronzer&#x27;s in it.  When I received the 10 ounce bottle, I realized there weren&#x27;t any bronzer&#x27;s in it. Just because it doesn&#x27;t have a bronzer in it, that is not a bad thing.  I asked the customer service rep at Palm Beach Tan and she said that it&#x27;s actually a good thing.  Without the bronzer in it, you will see your actual tan results, not the results of the bronzer.  When they say it&#x27;s an ultra dark tan maximizer, they aren&#x27;t kidding.  I got amazing results and my tan has lasted quite a while now.  It&#x27;s been a week since I&#x27;ve gone to the tanning bed and my tan is just as dark today as the day I laid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if you can see on the front of the bottle, but it states that there is no THC in the tanning bed product.  Like I said, the smell is amazing and my tan results were incredible.  I am a believer in this product and will definitely be buying it again in the future.</li>
            <li> This product smell good and works great!  I use it on a regular basis.  Will definately buy again and again!</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing. I like that it will help you achieve a nice base tan. Super fast shipping.</li>
