            <li>it does not burn the eyes, It smells very nice.</li>
            <li>ShiKai Yuzu also has a pleasant lemon scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>A good product.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin feeling refreshed and presents a very enjoyable aroma.</li>
            <li>A nice product but not as good as my Olay Bath Wash.</li>
            <li>Love everything about this product!</li>
            <li>Was so glad it showed up on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Has a nice fragrance that is not too over powering.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot, feels clean on your skin and smells good, will buy it again, this is a good deal.</li>
            <li>This is a great value, plus it&#x27;s very gentle</li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite shower gel.</li>
            <li>Try it and you willl be glad you did.</li>
            <li>I love the Yuzu blend....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using ShiKai for years, it&#x27;s my favorite shower gel.</li>
            <li>Refreshing smell and makes your skin feel</li>
            <li>Shikai shower gel is just as good to use and more fun.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to fragrance and this one is very light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I love the light fragrance too.</li>
            <li>I love that it is soap free</li>
            <li>Happy with the product in our dry climate (kind to allergenic skin).</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and allergic reactions to strong fragrance, so the mild citrus scent is ideal for me.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and rinses off easily.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, this bath gel is very gentle, has a nice aroma, and does not leave me feeling itchy after I bathe.</li>
            <li>a mild fragrance(which makes it ideal for the entire family), multi use...can use in place of shaving cream or bubble bath and the price cannot be beat for a product of this type.</li>
            <li>However, if you find after checking the ingredients that the ingredients will work for you, this shower gel is great especially when your skin needs moisture.  </li>
            <li>Shower Gel Yuzu scent is light yet moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>For my original view (proving I&#x27;ve been purchasing the product), see this link: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XB9NM6DVMAQT/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B001ET7EAU&amp;linkCode&#x3D;&amp;nodeID&#x3D;&amp;tag&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Originally I purchased this to use after swimming to prevent drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind having to order a minimum of 3 bottles as I am sure my guests will enjoy the Shower Gel as much as I have.</li>
            <li>i am thrilled to be able to buy in bulk as well, since it is more pricey than the average store-bought brands, but is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>i love this product - it does exactly what it claims to do - clean gently and thoroughly and moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>There are a large variety of shower gels to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;The product is lightly scented, creamy and leaves you feeling&lt;</li>
            <li>and I love the scent which smells natural and not artificial.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and does not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and lathers up to a nice white foam on a washcloth.</li>
            <li>Love Shikai; it&#x27;s only body wash</li>
            <li>I consistently like.</li>
            <li>I put a little on a shower puff and it lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Generally, I&#x27;m skeptical when I see reviews talking about the toxicity of products, but I&#x27;ve just experienced the problem first</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin on my face, and I have used ShiKai for a dozen years as my shaving gel!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin that is easy to become dry, but with&lt;br</li>
            <li>oh so soft!  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, these products are great for dry skin with little irritation due to the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I also love the delicate, natural smelling scent.</li>
            <li>If you are overly sensitive to xenoestrogens, this shower gel is not for you.</li>
            <li>i have tried many moisturizing shower gels, even rinsing with baby oil, but this \\&quot;organic\\&quot; shikai shower gel beats them all by far: the scents are subtle, you need very little/ shower, and finally my back is not dry and itchy!  </li>
            <li>Have bought it for the last several years and buy it in large quantities (six or nine bottles at a time).  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and smooth and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>This product contains Coconut diethanolamide, which has been declared by multiple international entities as a carcinogen, and can cause dermatitis for patients with sensitive</li>
            <li>I like the thick texture and the fragrance, and it really does keep my sensitive skin soft and soothed.</li>
            <li>I love the slightly citrus smell, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My dry, sensitive skin no longer bothers me.  </li>
            <li>I have very, very dry skin, as does my husband - probably &#x27;cause we are OLD.  </li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin either.</li>
            <li> bought this soap because I have dry skin (and it claims to be a moisturizing product).</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> read about it for yourself, and skip this one until the manufacturer uses some other type of surfactant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have had messy liquid soap shipments from other vendors.  </li>
            <li> It was tough to tell if this soap was the cause because the symptoms didn&#x27;t disappear quickly / seem to line up with my usage, but after finally going cold turkey a month or two ago the dermatitis has not returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> After using a very small amount of the product on my face over the past few YEARS, I recently (past ~6 months) developed severe dermatitis around my eyelid and scalp.</li>

            <li> When my husband&#x27;s doctor suggested he switch to an oatmeal based shower gel, he began to use this to reduce itching caused by winter cold dry skin.</li>
            <li> Too bad that this bottle only comes in a 12oz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a terrible time with dry skin this year and had resorted to oil cleaning products such as Aveeno and Eucerin.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the dermatitis always returned and yet I didn&#x27;t want to believe this was linked to some product I was using because I hadn&#x27;t changed anything in years.</li>

            <li> ShiKai Shower Gel beats all the grocery store brands, and by buying the 3-pack, it is cheaper. I love the slightly citrus smell, and a little bit goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin either. This is definitely my favorite shower gel.</li>
            <li> Makes great bubbles for the bath.  Soothing</li>
            <li> The aloe in this product is very nice for your skin and I love the scent which smells natural and not artificial. I put a little on a shower puff and it lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> Hi everybody! I just recieved this product today on 2/22/11. I ordered it on 2/13/11. Can&#x27;t wait to try it. Will give my testimony soon. Too bad that this bottle only comes in a 12oz. Will like to see and the rest of the bottles in a 32oz. I haven&#x27;t tried the product, but, based on the testimonies, I&#x27;m Giving this product a perfect 5 star. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Try this shower gel and you will never use anything else.  Our entire family uses it exclusively. Our daughter who has sensitive skin in the past could only use baby soap although she was 10 years old.  We tried  the Shikai Shower Gel on her and it was great.  We no longer have to use baby soap on her.  Thank you Shikai shower gel.  Highly recommend this product.  Try it and you willl be glad you did.</li>

            <li> Love everything about this product! It cleans and moisturizes, has a mild fragrance(which makes it ideal for the entire family), multi use...can use in place of shaving cream or bubble bath and the price cannot be beat for a product of this type. I have sensitive skin and allergic reactions to strong fragrance, so the mild citrus scent is ideal for me. Have used ShiKai gel for ten years and have not found another product like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cross posting my review to all variants of this Shikai shower gel. For my original view (proving I&#x27;ve been purchasing the product), see this link: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XB9NM6DVMAQT/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B001ET7EAU&amp;linkCode&#x3D;&amp;nodeID&#x3D;&amp;tag&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, I&#x27;m skeptical when I see reviews talking about the toxicity of products, but I&#x27;ve just experienced the problem first hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this soap because I have dry skin (and it claims to be a moisturizing product). After using a very small amount of the product on my face over the past few YEARS, I recently (past ~6 months) developed severe dermatitis around my eyelid and scalp. The itchiness and redness were unbearable, and my dermatologist prescribed a topical steroid that helped somewhat. Unfortunately, the dermatitis always returned and yet I didn&#x27;t want to believe this was linked to some product I was using because I hadn&#x27;t changed anything in years. It was tough to tell if this soap was the cause because the symptoms didn&#x27;t disappear quickly / seem to line up with my usage, but after finally going cold turkey a month or two ago the dermatitis has not returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to this week, when I decided to do some research (why I didn&#x27;t do this sooner, I don&#x27;t know). This product contains Coconut diethanolamide, which has been declared by multiple international entities as a carcinogen, and can cause dermatitis for patients with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just read about it for yourself, and skip this one until the manufacturer uses some other type of surfactant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sources:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my face, and I have used ShiKai for a dozen years as my shaving gel!  It beats anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and it is a great body gel too!</li>
            <li> There are a large variety of shower gels to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;The product is lightly scented, creamy and leaves you feeling&lt;br /&gt;moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin that is easy to become dry, but with&lt;br /&gt;this product, I could almost go without applying an after shower moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the price has you thinking twice, try out their trial size offerings first.&lt;br /&gt;By trying those you&#x27;ll get some insight without having to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> i love this product - it does exactly what it claims to do - clean gently and thoroughly and moisturizes.  i will continue to purchase this product</li>
            <li> I like the product as I&#x27;ve used the Vanilla for years.  I wanted to try another scent but it doesn&#x27;t agree with me.  I recommend you smell in a store before you buy.  Otherwise, these products are great for dry skin with little irritation due to the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have used ShiKai Yuzu Shower Gel for a number of years on and off. I do not use it on a regular basis because I am sensitive to xenoestrogens such as aloe vera which is an active ingredient in this shower gel.  If you are overly sensitive to xenoestrogens, this shower gel is not for you. However, if you find after checking the ingredients that the ingredients will work for you, this shower gel is great especially when your skin needs moisture.  ShiKai Yuzu also has a pleasant lemon scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and does not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shower gel for years and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  My dry, sensitive skin no longer bothers me.  This gel keeps my skin moist and supple.  It lathers well and rinses off easily.  I love the Yuzu blend....it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have very, very dry skin, as does my husband - probably &#x27;cause we are OLD.  Anyway, this bath gel is very gentle, has a nice aroma, and does not leave me feeling itchy after I bathe.</li>
            <li> A nice product but not as good as my Olay Bath Wash.</li>
            <li> My daughter, grandaughter and I are all hooked on this shower gel.  Have bought it for the last several years and buy it in large quantities (six or nine bottles at a time).  Leaves skin soft and smooth and a little goes a long way.  Has a nice fragrance that is not too over powering.</li>
            <li> The ShiKai Shower Gel Yuzu scent is light yet moisturizing.  You might want to pair it with the ShiKai Body Lotion of the same scent ~ delightful. I didn&#x27;t mind having to order a minimum of 3 bottles as I am sure my guests will enjoy the Shower Gel as much as I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash for several years. I introduced it to my Mother, who has very dry skin and was buying expensive washes. She loves this wash and has also used it for several years. I love the light fragrance too. I am sensitive to fragrance and this one is very light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> This is a great value, plus it&#x27;s very gentle it does not burn the eyes, It smells very nice. I will reorder this product.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and lathers up to a nice white foam on a washcloth. Leaves the skin feeling refreshed and presents a very enjoyable aroma. A good product.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product in our dry climate (kind to allergenic skin). Have had messy liquid soap shipments from other vendors.  No problems with this one.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, feels clean on your skin and smells good, will buy it again, this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using ShiKai for years, it&#x27;s my favorite shower gel. I like the thick texture and the fragrance, and it really does keep my sensitive skin soft and soothed.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. Was so glad it showed up on Amazon! Your skin is the largest organ of your body.....treat it well, and it will treat you well!</li>
            <li> Originally I purchased this to use after swimming to prevent drying out my skin. When my husband&#x27;s doctor suggested he switch to an oatmeal based shower gel, he began to use this to reduce itching caused by winter cold dry skin. He reports a great improvement. I also love the delicate, natural smelling scent.</li>
            <li> Love Shikai; it&#x27;s only body wash I consistently like.</li>
            <li> Refreshing smell and makes your skin feel oh so soft!  I love that it is soap free but you would never know it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a terrible time with dry skin this year and had resorted to oil cleaning products such as Aveeno and Eucerin.  I&#x27;ve found Shikai shower gel is just as good to use and more fun.</li>
            <li> I love it it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. I highly recommend it. I have the citrus scent that might be perfect for man. Wakes me up mornings.</li>
