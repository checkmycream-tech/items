            <li> I still have very dry cuticles, but they&#x27;re much smaller.  </li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Then I dry them and apply this cream.  </li>

            <li> I moisturize a lot but still had thick, dry cuticles.  </li>
            <li> it is a blessing is a small tube, and it takes a small dot on each finger nail, rub it in just before going to bed.</li>
            <li> After using this a few times a day for a week, my cuticles decreased in size by about half.  </li>
            <li> I get terribly jagged, torn skin below my cuticles and my cuticles grow over my nails very quickly.</li>
            <li> and  your cuticles, no matter how thick or unhealthy, will become things of beauty</li>

            <li> This is not a cuticle remover, but a conditioner. I get terribly jagged, torn skin below my cuticles and my cuticles grow over my nails very quickly. When I use Cuticle Eraser 4-6 times a week, my cuticles stay moisturized and snag-free. My cuticles still grow over my nail some, but not nearly as fast as without it. Cuticle Eraser has been a wonderful tool for keeping my cuticles in great shape.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and it is the best cuticle cream I have ever used.  My cuticles look great, they are so soft.  You only have to use a small amount so it lasts a long time.  Also, it has a very nice scent.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, just as described.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have rough cuticles.  I moisturize a lot but still had thick, dry cuticles.  After using this a few times a day for a week, my cuticles decreased in size by about half.  I still have very dry cuticles, but they&#x27;re much smaller.  It does work.  You&#x27;ll still need to moisturize though!</li>

            <li> This is the best Cuticle Eraser on the market...baring non. It does exactly what it&#x27;s name implies....ERASES CUTICLES. Awesome product!!!</li>
            <li> If you use this you will not get hangnails. The creme is gentle and moisturizes nails and cuticles. Cuticles are conditioned. A miracle.</li>
            <li> I went to a spa for a manicure and pedicure and they were using this product.  I purchased it for myself and I love it.  I use it when I take a bath and have my and soaking.  Then I dry them and apply this cream.  It helps to reduce the cuticles and makes it easy to push them back.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This cuticle eraser is amazing!! Best product I have ever used for my cuticles and I&#x27;ve tried them all! Worth every penny in my opinion.  This is a must have product if you want beautiful cuticles! You can see the difference after just one use.</li>

            <li> This is the best cuticle cream ever and I&#x27;ve tried at least ten.  However, it smells like soap from a public bathroom.  Come on now, surely those scent guys in New Jersey can help you out.</li>
            <li> Feels pleasant on the cuticle area.  Awaiting results (want softer, less obvious, cuticles).  Don&#x27;t care for the fragrance - best to use before going to bed so I won&#x27;t smell my fingers.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, pleasant scent, nice applicator (it&#x27;s a very tapered tip) and best of all, this cream works!  Shrinks cuticles and repairs raggedy appearance.</li>
