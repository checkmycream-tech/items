            <li>Didn&#x27;t make much difference to me</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Ya don&#x27;t need much because a lil goes a loooooooong way.</li>
            <li>This stuff holds my hair all day, better than any other of the hundreds of products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Normally $15 for one 5.1 ounce tube.</li>
            <li>it will leave my hair stiff and still wet looking, but once you figure out how much to use, it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>It is a really strong hold that last all day long.</li>
            <li>but this gives me all day preformance (and heck, even when waking up the next day it may not look pretty</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>It is a strong gel that will hold a choppy style.</li>
            <li>If you use too much your hair will be dark and as hard as concrete but a small dab does a great job!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get two of them for just a little more than I usually pay for one at the store.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine getting two of the large tubes, they would last for years, literally.</li>
            <li>It is near glue quality and does the job.</li>
            <li>One of my coworkers used this to give me a &#x27;faux-hawk&#x27; and my spikes stayed straight up for our entire 8-hour shift!  </li>
            <li>If you want soft, touchable hair that you  (or someone else) can run your fingers through, this is not for you.  </li>
            <li>Hair stays soft but in place.  </li>
            <li>A bit pricey compared to other products but some worth it as well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to making more subtle looks with it, too.  </li>
            <li>We combed the sides of my hair flat and used the gel to smooth them down.  </li>
            <li>Not short sexy hair hard up like the picture and description states.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not particularly cheap, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the money if you want to keep your hair in place.</li>

            <li> Having tried countless other &#x27;strong&#x27;, &#x27;hard&#x27;, &#x27;extreme&#x27;, etc, etc, hold gels this is far and away the ONLY one that can hold that title.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got fine, somewhat thin hair that&#x27;s about 4\\&quot; long across the crown.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only found one other product that was similar.  </li>
            <li> As long as they make this gel I will buy it from wherever and whomever I can.  </li>
            <li> Should have used this a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I like the finished look, and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;t dry out my hair .  </li>
            <li> I do nothing too extreme, spike up 1 inch long hair or so</li>
            <li> If you put it in wet hair, it will keep that wet look, even with only a few pea size bits.</li>
            <li> A small dab (smaller than a dime size) applied to water covered, damp, palms</li>
            <li> I prefer this one to any other brand.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the pump bottle but bought the smaller tube because I was traveling.  </li>
            <li> If you usually get what is shown in the picture ( yellow and black lettering )</li>
            <li> I keep my hair near shoulder length and it is very thick.</li>
            <li> Even the small tube-1.7 oz. goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> Just a little brush up</li>
            <li> Sometimes I like it spiky, sometimes messy.  </li>
            <li> and since it&#x27;s so thick a small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This product makes hair very hard so as long as thats what you want</li>
            <li> I have tried switching to a less expensive gel, however they just don&#x27;t work the same anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past</li>
            <li> I have been using Hard Up gel for over 8 years now.</li>
            <li> Hard Up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years but have a hard time finding it in retail stores.</li>
            <li> hard.  </li>
            <li> Being over 40 now and still all my hair, which by the way is frizzy and untamed to say the least.</li>
            <li> This is not what you will get or at least not what I received.</li>
            <li> and I have been addicted since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tired about 10 other hair gels all of which they hate.  </li>
            <li> yes its expensive</li>
            <li> Just want to let you know to be wary of this.</li>
            <li> This stuff holds like crazy.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This stuff is awesome; gives me the volume &amp; hold I need...just a dab is all it takes.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> The product I expected, and delivered at a good time</li>
            <li> This product is the best gel for my type of hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hard Up gel for over 8 years now. I have tried almost every gel out there and this product is by far the best for those of us with uncontrollable hair. I am male and I was blessed with great but shaggy hair. Being over 40 now and still all my hair, which by the way is frizzy and untamed to say the least. I keep my hair near shoulder length and it is very thick. I could give Snoop Dogg a run for his money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said if you are looking for a \\&quot;light\\&quot; gel, this product is not for you. It is near glue quality and does the job. If you want to lessen the hardness I would recommend a frizz controller liquid to mix with this as I sometimes do depending on the length of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5.1 ounce are great for travel but highly recommend the large pump for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.</li>

We combed the sides of my hair flat and used the gel to smooth them down.  I&#x27;m looking forward to making more subtle looks with it, too.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t flake and isn&#x27;t sticky. My only concern is how to get it out of my hair...I&#x27;m sure it will wash out, but...it might take a while.</li>
            <li> Been using this gel for years.  When it first came out it wasn&#x27;t so pricey.  As people caught on the price went up.  It&#x27;s a great gel and since it&#x27;s so thick a small amount goes a long way.  It also last all day and doesn&#x27;t flake which is the best part.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got short, fine hair.  Sometimes I like it spiky, sometimes messy.  This stuff holds like crazy.  As if your hair has been frozen in place.  If you want soft, touchable hair that you  (or someone else) can run your fingers through, this is not for you.  If you want to know that your hair is going to stay right where you put it, no matter what you do, all day or all night, this is the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only found one other product that was similar.  Creative Genius by Bed Head.  But that has a stronger smell like a tropical drink with a tiny umbrella in it.  I don&#x27;t want to smell like that all day.  Hard Up gel stuff smells okay coming out of the tube, and I don&#x27;t notice any smell after it is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a lot of gels seem to run in your face at the gym, or make your forehead greasy.  Not this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the best gel I&#x27;ve ever used. If you put it in wet hair, it will keep that wet look, even with only a few pea size bits. It&#x27;s not particularly cheap, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the money if you want to keep your hair in place.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS GEL!!!...Why my local Wal-Mart stopped selling it is beyong me...This GEL holds and holds and holds...My hair is a weapon it is so strong and no flakes.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Holds and washes off easily with shampoo or whatever you use. There, this should make it fifteen words.</li>
            <li> Goes fast but I&#x27;m impressed with the product.</li>
            <li> Used this for a while, then wanted to try and find something else but eventually found my way back to this product.  This product makes hair very hard so as long as thats what you want then I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Having tried countless other &#x27;strong&#x27;, &#x27;hard&#x27;, &#x27;extreme&#x27;, etc, etc, hold gels this is far and away the ONLY one that can hold that title. I do nothing too extreme, spike up 1 inch long hair or so but this gives me all day preformance (and heck, even when waking up the next day it may not look pretty but it is still standing up!) Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Product received as intended</li>
            <li> Bought this for my picky boys.  I&#x27;ve tired about 10 other hair gels all of which they hate.  This is the only kind they both love.  It is a really strong hold that last all day long.</li>
            <li> best product I have found and I have tried a lot of them.  Hair stays soft but in place.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought his product and when I received it, the product was style sexy hair. Not short sexy hair hard up like the picture and description states. I returned the item,</li>
            <li> This really holds your hair.</li>
            <li> I do not have short hair, but I do have curly hair and this works great.  My hair is so much curlier when I use this.  I can&#x27;t use too much b/c it will leave my hair stiff and still wet looking, but once you figure out how much to use, it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> If you use this gel, your hair WILL stay the way you want it!  You can rewet the next day to reactivate the gel.  Great for short hair!</li>
            <li> used numerous different brands of hair gel and always go back to this product.  yes its expensive but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Great to keep the hair in place</li>
            <li> As long as they make this gel I will buy it from wherever and whomever I can.  It is the only thing that holds together if you&#x27;re boating, wearing hats, swimming.  Just a little brush up and it takes place again.  Packaging changed recently as did the rating (9 to 10).  Can&#x27;t imagine a stronger version.  This stuff could be used as glue.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair gel I have ever used. I will continue using this for good now! I highly recommend it. Even the small tube-1.7 oz. goes a LONG way. I can&#x27;t imagine getting two of the large tubes, they would last for years, literally. A small dab (smaller than a dime size) applied to water covered, damp, palms and you&#x27;re good to go. If you use too much your hair will be dark and as hard as concrete but a small dab does a great job! Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> best gel period. you get what you pay for. and this proves it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I was really excited to get two of them for just a little more than I usually pay for one at the store.  I already liked the product, but I loved the good deal!</li>
            <li> It does wonders for my short hair. Should have used this a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;But I didn&#x27;t know about until a friend told me about it.</li>
            <li> I bought this by mistake and now I have used this for many years and always gives me the same results. Nice strong hold without flakes.</li>
            <li> Best Hair Gel Ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel is the most effective, and best smelling gel I have ever used. My hair dresser used this in my hair after I received a haircut one day and I have been addicted since. I have tried switching to a less expensive gel, however they just don&#x27;t work the same anymore. I prefer this one to any other brand.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff plus Shipping was super Fast, if anything i need more !! if you need a Really good gel get this, it holds all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years but have a hard time finding it in retail stores. So glad to find it on line. Great for short hair. Asome for styling and hold.</li>
            <li> Works well for short spiky hair.  I usually buy the pump bottle but bought the smaller tube because I was traveling.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it helps to keep my spike hair style just the way I like it.  A great product for those of us who don&#x27;t want to have to bother with hair all day.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Have used this product before - and will continue to do so ---  it is great to provide lift for slightly-spoked hair styles.</li>
            <li> I love this product as it definitely holds my spiky hair look.  I wanted the two pack to keep my supply up and paid for that.  Almost immediately I was informed the seller had only one and that it would be sent and my credit card credited.  Happened so quick - I was truly impressed.  I would positively purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Wow!  Great price on Amazon!  I got 2 for the price I paid at a salon for 1.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Salon product at a great price.</li>
            <li> If you usually get what is shown in the picture ( yellow and black lettering ) This is not what you will get or at least not what I received. I got the next step up ( not 9/9 but a 9/10 formula) Didn&#x27;t make much difference to me but others it may be a problem. Just want to let you know to be wary of this.</li>
            <li> Works well, I will always buy it from this site as it is the best value and I can buy several at a time and not have to again for a while.</li>
            <li> Incredibly effective product .  I like the finished look, and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;t dry out my hair .  Good buy , good product !</li>
            <li> Great  price! Normally $15 for one 5.1 ounce tube.</li>
            <li> only gel my husband will use and has used it for years.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for someone that has straight, course, thick hair. A bit pricey compared to other products but some worth it as well</li>
            <li> for one bottle at walmart or anywhere else is 18.00 for 1 tube. this is 2 for 20.00 way better deal buy it</li>
            <li> With this, you could shape you hair in your desired one :) The best gel I have ever had. This product is very good for those who have short hair as its name is ;)</li>
            <li> Not as advertised - is not a &amp;#34;super&amp;#34;product.  Has shine, gives body but does not &amp;#34;spike&amp;#34; hair</li>
            <li> easier to handle, looks fuller, and style stays in place in all kinds of weather no matter how windy. thanks</li>
            <li> Great hair gel, holds a curl, no frizz.  It is a strong gel that will hold a choppy style.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd time I have bought this product...and it works great! My short hair stays in place rain or shine or in gale force winds. Well maybe not gale force but windy days! I bought the squeeze tube this time instead of the pump for portability and for not dealing with a clogging pump.</li>
            <li> hard.  spiky.  awesome.</li>
            <li> If ya wanna keep the hair in place without the flakes or oily feeling.. this is the best stuff on earth. Ya don&#x27;t need much because a lil goes a loooooooong way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and I love it.  The only problem I have is I was suppose to get a Pack of 2 which would equal 6 tubes and I only rec&#x27;d 3.  Need an e-mail back to let me know how to handle this situation.  Thank you.</li>
