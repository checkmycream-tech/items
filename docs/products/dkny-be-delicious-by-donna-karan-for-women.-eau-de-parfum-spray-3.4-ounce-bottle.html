            <li>quick shipment and could not be more excited about getting more from dkny</li>
            <li>Kind of fruity, and very sensual, can wear day or night!</li>
            <li>Both perfumes have green apple, rose, lily-of-the-valley, and woodsy notes, but Be Delicious has grapefruit, tuberose, magnolia, amber, and sandalwood included while Ming Shu Fleur Rare has peach, water lily, jasmine, musk, and cedar.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice clean fresh smelling perfume.. stays with you</li>
            <li>product is fine.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and smells yummy:)</li>
            <li>Smells great nice for a slightly cheaper fragrance.</li>
            <li>She love it because the powerful scent smells fresh and delicious and she can smell it on her clothes for a long time.</li>
            <li>It smells great, not sure if its the original as I have never bought it before however I had used it before, I loved the smell .</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be happier and super excited to give it to my sister!</li>
            <li>Light and airy.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>It is almost double at department stores so this was a great buy.</li>
            <li>I got this for my girlfrend Christmas gift, and she is very happy with it, and it smails like green apple.</li>
            <li>I can wear this every day and enjoy the light scent without any problems.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite perfume so to get it at such a good price was fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perfect for summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The line of DKNY are great the have a red sweeter scent!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light, airy scent that stays on you well during the day.  </li>
            <li>Be Delicious makes a slightly more aggressive impression though, has stronger sillage, and much longer staying power due to it being an Eau De Parfum.</li>
            <li>(I love both) and the price is right . . .</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li>From now on, Im gonna purchase.all my perfume thru Amazon instead, so much cheaper.and easier, thank u Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>I very rarely buy myself perfume because I am so picky.</li>
            <li>this is my absolute favorite perfume so light, crisp and smells amazing, I always get compliments on it every time I wear it..</li>
            <li>, it is light, clean and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day long and it is very refreshing!</li>
            <li>My new favorite perfume!</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>It was definitely out of her comfort zone, but she was wanting a new scent, and this one is excellent.  </li>
            <li>100% original and recommended</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a product 100 % original.</li>
            <li>exactly was i was expecting for a more affordable price.</li>
            <li>I trust that amazon will uphold their reputation and I hope its the original.</li>
            <li>Love this scent, so crisp and fresh!&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is the first perfume I get compliments :)</li>
            <li>If you like fruity, clean smells, you should try this</li>
            <li>Strong fresh apple smell.</li>
            <li>because Ming Shu Fleur Rare is/was indeed a floral aquatic whereas Be Delicious is not, and a blessing in disguise because Ming Shu Fleur Rare is nearly impossible to find these days under $150 whereas Be Delicious is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean, feminine and lightly floral.</li>
            <li>Smells light, sweet, clean, fresh...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is true DKNY perfume.</li>
            <li>We both love it so much that I had to get myself a bottle.</li>
            <li>i really love it so much</li>
            <li>I discovered this last year and loved it</li>
            <li>It has a very &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; smell to it that I love.</li>
            <li>refreshing and very yummy smell.</li>
            <li>love the smell fast delivery</li>
            <li>Not too sweet, not musky.  </li>
            <li>I contacted this seller and was told I would get a full refund</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think it smells &amp;#34;delicious&amp;#34; in any way, more like water lilies and ozone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think it smells &amp;#34;delicious&amp;#34; in any way, more like water lilies and ozone.  </li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly and packaging was exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Slightly sweet and very crisp.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so fresh and clean smelling</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t fade away quickly.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume, and was able to find it a lot cheaper than I did at a local store.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend is very satisfied with present.</li>
            <li>I assume this package was kept in very hot temperatures for an extended period of time and the fragrance evaporated and discolored the box.  </li>
            <li>Great as a stand alone or mixed with spicy and earthy fragrances to create fresh lively scents for summer.</li>
            <li>This is a great classic scent that I am constantly complimented on but if you are just trying it out I would go to a department store first and smell it to see if its for you.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and accurate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s floral and fruity and fresh and crisp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Notes&lt;br /&gt;Apple, Tuberose, White Muguet, Rose,</li>
            <li>I actually bought this one for my sister, as she liked mine so well.</li>
            <li>Fresh, staying power, gets compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ming Shu Fleur Rare</li>
            <li>Fleru Rare by Yves Rocher, a floral aquatic that has been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fleru Rare by Yves Rocher, a floral aquatic that has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>It is very fresh and good for everyday - you can feel it</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and product exactly as described!!</li>
            <li>Got the perfume right as scheduled.</li>
            <li>Just right.  </li>
            <li>I got this item right in time and as decribed.</li>
            <li>You just gotta talk to the right person</li>
            <li>Nice modern style bottle and larger size</li>
            <li>I had always loved perfume, not so much cologne or toilet water...but the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li>They shipped it super fast</li>
            <li>I am a regular user of this amazing perfume, although the one I received was real it has EXPIRED.</li>
            <li>and when I had a smaller size before i thought it was more misty because there is no way i could spray this on my close right now</li>
            <li>It is very much a women&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my daughter wanted.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i was expecting.</li>
            <li>At first I went to a department store, and then shoppers drug mart.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing DKNY since it first came out and would always buy it at the mall.</li>
            <li>It makes me smell so fresh and it lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely not fake.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very feminine scent, and fresh</li>
            <li>This scent is my one and only favorite that I go to just about every day....</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this scent since it was first introduced, and I receive nothing but compliments on my perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing is this time the spray part of the perfume bottle squirts out more then mists out.</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments with this perfume over the last 10 years of wearing this every day.</li>
            <li>My favorite an only perfume I&#x27;ll wear.</li>
            <li>fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of my perfumes at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>cos 99.9% of the time, they&#x27;re willing to work with you.</li>
            <li>absolutely none!</li>
            <li>This is my second favorite go to perfume, first being DREAMS unlimited by The Body Shop.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the second bottle now :)</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>/&gt;You would think with that many notes differing that the end result would be two entirely different fragrances, but not so.</li>
            <li>* Smells almost exactly like Ming Shu</li>
            <li>Smells almost exactly like Ming Shu</li>
            <li>Ive been wearing this perfume for the last 8yrs, I absolutely love the smell of this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this fragrance many times and the smell last all day.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my mom for Christmas, and it is exactly what you get for $70+ at Sephora.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, fresh and pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very stylish and the fragance subtle and rich.</li>
            <li>It is packaged just adorably in its little brown box and unique apple bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since then they came out with the Red Apple, Golden Apple and Pink Apple version that I&#x27;ve tried but the original Green Apple version works the best.</li>
            <li>I do not get all these positive reviews.</li>
            <li>absolutely nothing like the real thing, and the item is non-returnable!</li>
            <li>I like this better than the red DKNY, though only recently I&#x27;ve found that I like the PURE vanilla scented DKNY the best, but it is a little pricier.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too strong and it last all day!</li>
            <li>This perfume smells almost exactly like my old signature scent from years ago - Ming Shu Fleur Rare Eau de Toilette by Yves Rocher - which is both disconcerting for me and a blessing in disguise.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came in a rather large box</li>
            <li>I love the round bottle too, it&#x27;s kind of hard to break and easy to take with</li>
            <li>On a very good day, I can get a faint scent of it</li>
            <li>You only need a little bit and it doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming aroma like I find most perfumes do.</li>
            <li>and it went over very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very well packaged.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and well packaged.  </li>
            <li>I get so much compliments wearing this perfume.</li>
            <li>Got here in time, the box that contained the perfume was very well protected inside another box.</li>
            <li>seems to spray really well</li>
            <li>I really like how this perfume smells</li>
            <li>and she loves it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Received it in a very timely manner as well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Makes your blow up doll smell real.</li>
            <li>my wife really likes the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li>This item arrived exactly as expected and it is one of my favorite scents for the summer.</li>
            <li>3.4 ounces, free shipping and only $37.00!</li>
            <li>This is the real thing, not a knock-off</li>
            <li>It shipped fast</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This was not a knock off either, it was the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and you absolutely can not beat this price for this sized bottle.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend buying this!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much and the scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li>, witch is very coviniant for me.</li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift, the recipient greatly appreciated the size and shape of the bottle and the way it was packaged...</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.  </li>
            <li>The real deal.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this shipper!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Even though I ordered  this perfume for my mom,&lt;br /&gt;she didnt really like the smell......</li>
            <li>Fast shipping product as described</li>
            <li>* Reasonably priced.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recomend it!</li>
            <li>Very Happy&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging was very  well</li>
            <li>Just buy the real thing.</li>
            <li>I really like perfumes that aren&#x27;t cloying, or heavy, and this one is really nice.</li>
            <li>scents are soft, refreshing aquatic florals that remind me of how my skin smells after a fun day spent swimming and sunbathing by the pool.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other scents, but I have never seemed to change my mind about this one.  </li>
            <li>I originally found this when I was 14 and finally saved up $40 when I was 16 to buy it.</li>
            <li>I have other perfumes but this one is top</li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t smell like the original one this has to be generic!!!</li>
            <li>very nice scent, but a little weak :)</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re not big fans of sweet and/or fruity.  </li>
            <li>Hands down one of my favorite scents, it goes so well with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>This package came brand new!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only my favorite cologne, it is the ONLY one I wear!!  </li>
            <li>Same product as the local store for a better price.</li>
            <li>The outside of the perfume container felt mildly sticky.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this scent in a department store after a few sprays.</li>
            <li>Before, I used it during summers only; now, since the temperature in South Florida rarely goes below 80 degrees, I use it all year around.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I have ordered my cologne, the price you can&#x27;t beat and it seems to ship right away.</li>
            <li>This is a nice clean scent with a slight (but not overwhelming) fruity/floral undertone.</li>
            <li>It was a new bottle but the fragrance smelled like it had been sitting around awhile.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife to try something new</li>
            <li>little bit of powder and a little bit of paint may make a woman just what she aint, but good perfume will fill the room and really attract a groom.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and lingers even softer...very feminine and not over powering he says.</li>
            <li>It is a powerful scent at first, but it is EXTREMELY long lasting.</li>
            <li>Both smelt exactly the same.</li>
            <li>yes, but due to several setbacks, I lost most of my sense of smell...</li>
            <li>The item arrived early also!</li>
            <li>times!&lt;br /&gt;Likes: not watered down or cheap.</li>
            <li>It is light, inviting, and long lasting.</li>
            <li>was happy to recieve product earlier than expected and it wasnt a bunk one like in my past orders from \\&quot;other\\&quot; companies, so</li>
            <li>A lady wears it at work, and I naturally had to investigate and find out the name of it.  </li>
            <li>I really hope the stores just got lemons and that is not how it actually smells!</li>
            <li>It will definitely last much longer.</li>
            <li>Love the larger size bottle at a price I used to pay locally at retail center for smallest bottle.</li>
            <li>This was by far cheaper than I could have bought it at Nordstrom&#x27;s, Dillards or Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>But my bottle was defective and only sprays in a straight line which of course stains your clothes.</li>
            <li>I blind bought this perfume based on the glowing recommendation of a close friend expecting a delicious blast of green apple saturating my skin and senses.</li>
            <li>I liked the product but the shipping was a little delayed and kinda unclear when the payment actually hit my account, seemed kinda strange but eventually made it to the destination I had ordered it to be sent.</li>
            <li>I have checked many local stores and this perfume is usually twice the amount that it is on amazon.</li>
            <li>The box I received with this purchase looked completely intact and normal on the outside.</li>
            <li>like that it smells sweet and not floral but the only thing is it does not last long</li>
            <li>This product normally costs around $80 in stores such as Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>The smell is really wonderfull and quite possible in the future I will buy for me also.</li>
            <li>Amazon sells it for more or less half the price</li>
            <li>Smelled very much of alcohol and not fresh.</li>
            <li>so far i can only wear paris hilton, romance, lady gaga, fendi</li>
            <li>and I still can barely tell the difference...</li>
            <li>but apparently you can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money to save a few bucks, because in the end you will end up wasting more money than just buying directly from the dept store.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on this Parfum and never get tired of it myself.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this online t sephora as a gift for my aunt, and went to 2 different stores to smell it to make sure I wasn&#x27;t crazy the first time I smelt it...</li>
            <li>It is a very liquidy, as some other commenters said, but I had noticed that 28th the full-price department store version as well.</li>
            <li>It arrived earlier than the original expected delivery date even though the package was delayed due to weather conditions.  </li>
            <li>Although I felt the smell dissipated after a few hours, I think that was just me getting used to the smell because if I went out at night after spraying it on during the day a few hours prior, other people still commented on how good I smelled</li>
            <li>I wear it pretty much everyday, just a spritz on the neck and wrist if i&#x27;m going to work or something and an all over spritzing on the clothes and hair if I want it to be a bit stronger.</li>
            <li>SHE loves it, and having bought it before at a department store, confirmed that the bottle from Amazon is indeed real not counterfeit (for all the scent resellers who can&#x27;t compete with Amazon&#x27;s prices and thus love to come post fake reviews complaining about fake perfumes sold here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had to jump thru some hoops to get it here, but the secondary vendor helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>It does seem to be a bit more subtle than other perfumes which my husband likes because he doesn&#x27;t like to be assaulted by my perfume every time I walk by.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It lasts a pretty long time and usually due to my body chemistry perfumes don&#x27;t last too long on me.</li>

            <li> Well worth it!!</li>
            <li> OK for winter and not to strong for summer.</li>
            <li> The process of ordering my DKNY Be Delicious on line (and with free shipping), was so simple and affordable!  </li>
            <li> Light, refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good deal if this is the product that your wife wants.  </li>
            <li> this perfume really smells good.  </li>
            <li> I get so many complements every time I wear this scent - very fresh.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when I purchased Be Delicious Eau de Parfum by DKNY that it was more of a floral aquatic and less of a fruity gourmand.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pretty nice to my nose, and am especially happy that I didn&#x27;t have to pay full local retail prices for this stuff...</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find it at such a good deal on Amazon and purchased immeditaely.</li>
            <li> I love this perfum, since I can&#x27;t stand the strong or sweet ones</li>
            <li> quick shipment and could not be more excited about getting more from dkny</li>
            <li> Kind of fruity, and very sensual, can wear day or night!</li>
            <li> Both perfumes have green apple, rose, lily-of-the-valley, and woodsy notes, but Be Delicious has grapefruit, tuberose, magnolia, amber, and sandalwood included while Ming Shu Fleur Rare has peach, water lily, jasmine, musk, and cedar.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice clean fresh smelling perfume.. stays with you</li>
            <li> product is fine.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and smells yummy:)</li>
            <li> Smells great nice for a slightly cheaper fragrance.</li>
            <li> She love it because the powerful scent smells fresh and delicious and she can smell it on her clothes for a long time.</li>
            <li> It smells great, not sure if its the original as I have never bought it before however I had used it before, I loved the smell .</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier and super excited to give it to my sister!</li>
            <li> Light and airy.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> It is almost double at department stores so this was a great buy.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfrend Christmas gift, and she is very happy with it, and it smails like green apple.</li>
            <li> I can wear this every day and enjoy the light scent without any problems.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite perfume so to get it at such a good price was fantastic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perfect for summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The line of DKNY are great the have a red sweeter scent!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light, airy scent that stays on you well during the day.  </li>
            <li> Be Delicious makes a slightly more aggressive impression though, has stronger sillage, and much longer staying power due to it being an Eau De Parfum.</li>

            <li> From now on, Im gonna purchase.all my perfume thru Amazon instead, so much cheaper.and easier, thank u Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> I very rarely buy myself perfume because I am so picky.</li>
            <li> this is my absolute favorite perfume so light, crisp and smells amazing, I always get compliments on it every time I wear it..</li>
            <li> , it is light, clean and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long and it is very refreshing!</li>
            <li> My new favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> It smells so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> It was definitely out of her comfort zone, but she was wanting a new scent, and this one is excellent.  </li>
            <li> 100% original and recommended</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a product 100 % original.</li>
            <li> exactly was i was expecting for a more affordable price.</li>
            <li> I trust that amazon will uphold their reputation and I hope its the original.</li>
            <li> Love this scent, so crisp and fresh!&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is the first perfume I get compliments :)</li>
            <li> If you like fruity, clean smells, you should try this</li>
            <li> Strong fresh apple smell.</li>
            <li> because Ming Shu Fleur Rare is/was indeed a floral aquatic whereas Be Delicious is not, and a blessing in disguise because Ming Shu Fleur Rare is nearly impossible to find these days under $150 whereas Be Delicious is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean, feminine and lightly floral.</li>
            <li> Smells light, sweet, clean, fresh...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is true DKNY perfume.</li>
            <li> We both love it so much that I had to get myself a bottle.</li>
            <li> i really love it so much</li>
            <li> I discovered this last year and loved it</li>
            <li> It has a very &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; smell to it that I love.</li>
            <li> refreshing and very yummy smell.</li>
            <li> love the smell fast delivery</li>
            <li> Not too sweet, not musky.  </li>
            <li> I contacted this seller and was told I would get a full refund</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think it smells &amp;#34;delicious&amp;#34; in any way, more like water lilies and ozone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think it smells &amp;#34;delicious&amp;#34; in any way, more like water lilies and ozone.  </li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly and packaging was exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Slightly sweet and very crisp.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so fresh and clean smelling</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t fade away quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, and was able to find it a lot cheaper than I did at a local store.</li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is very satisfied with present.</li>
            <li> I assume this package was kept in very hot temperatures for an extended period of time and the fragrance evaporated and discolored the box.  </li>
            <li> Great as a stand alone or mixed with spicy and earthy fragrances to create fresh lively scents for summer.</li>
            <li> This is a great classic scent that I am constantly complimented on but if you are just trying it out I would go to a department store first and smell it to see if its for you.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and accurate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s floral and fruity and fresh and crisp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Notes&lt;br /&gt;Apple, Tuberose, White Muguet, Rose,</li>
            <li> I actually bought this one for my sister, as she liked mine so well.</li>
            <li> Fresh, staying power, gets compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Fleru Rare by Yves Rocher, a floral aquatic that has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li> It is very fresh and good for everyday - you can feel it</li>

            <li> Just right.  </li>
            <li> I got this item right in time and as decribed.</li>
            <li> You just gotta talk to the right person</li>
            <li> Nice modern style bottle and larger size</li>
            <li> I had always loved perfume, not so much cologne or toilet water...but the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li> They shipped it super fast</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of this amazing perfume, although the one I received was real it has EXPIRED.</li>
            <li> and when I had a smaller size before i thought it was more misty because there is no way i could spray this on my close right now</li>
            <li> It is very much a women&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my daughter wanted.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i was expecting.</li>
            <li> At first I went to a department store, and then shoppers drug mart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing DKNY since it first came out and would always buy it at the mall.</li>
            <li> It makes me smell so fresh and it lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely not fake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very feminine scent, and fresh</li>
            <li> This scent is my one and only favorite that I go to just about every day....</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this scent since it was first introduced, and I receive nothing but compliments on my perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing is this time the spray part of the perfume bottle squirts out more then mists out.</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments with this perfume over the last 10 years of wearing this every day.</li>
            <li> My favorite an only perfume I&#x27;ll wear.</li>
            <li> fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more of my perfumes at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> cos 99.9% of the time, they&#x27;re willing to work with you.</li>
            <li> absolutely none!</li>
            <li> This is my second favorite go to perfume, first being DREAMS unlimited by The Body Shop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the second bottle now :)</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You would think with that many notes differing that the end result would be two entirely different fragrances, but not so.</li>
            <li> * Smells almost exactly like Ming Shu</li>
            <li> Smells almost exactly like Ming Shu</li>
            <li> Ive been wearing this perfume for the last 8yrs, I absolutely love the smell of this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this fragrance many times and the smell last all day.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my mom for Christmas, and it is exactly what you get for $70+ at Sephora.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, fresh and pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very stylish and the fragance subtle and rich.</li>
            <li> It is packaged just adorably in its little brown box and unique apple bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since then they came out with the Red Apple, Golden Apple and Pink Apple version that I&#x27;ve tried but the original Green Apple version works the best.</li>
            <li> I do not get all these positive reviews.</li>
            <li> absolutely nothing like the real thing, and the item is non-returnable!</li>
            <li> I like this better than the red DKNY, though only recently I&#x27;ve found that I like the PURE vanilla scented DKNY the best, but it is a little pricier.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too strong and it last all day!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells almost exactly like my old signature scent from years ago - Ming Shu Fleur Rare Eau de Toilette by Yves Rocher - which is both disconcerting for me and a blessing in disguise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Came in a rather large box</li>
            <li> I love the round bottle too, it&#x27;s kind of hard to break and easy to take with</li>
            <li> On a very good day, I can get a faint scent of it</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit and it doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming aroma like I find most perfumes do.</li>
            <li> and it went over very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very well packaged.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and well packaged.  </li>
            <li> I get so much compliments wearing this perfume.</li>
            <li> Got here in time, the box that contained the perfume was very well protected inside another box.</li>
            <li> seems to spray really well</li>
            <li> I really like how this perfume smells</li>
            <li> and she loves it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Received it in a very timely manner as well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Makes your blow up doll smell real.</li>
            <li> my wife really likes the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li> This item arrived exactly as expected and it is one of my favorite scents for the summer.</li>
            <li> 3.4 ounces, free shipping and only $37.00!</li>
            <li> This is the real thing, not a knock-off</li>
            <li> It shipped fast</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This was not a knock off either, it was the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and you absolutely can not beat this price for this sized bottle.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend buying this!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much and the scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li> , witch is very coviniant for me.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift, the recipient greatly appreciated the size and shape of the bottle and the way it was packaged...</li>
            <li> I really recommend it.  </li>
            <li> The real deal.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this shipper!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Even though I ordered  this perfume for my mom,&lt;br /&gt;she didnt really like the smell......</li>
            <li> Fast shipping product as described</li>
            <li> * Reasonably priced.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recomend it!</li>
            <li> Very Happy&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging was very  well</li>
            <li> Just buy the real thing.</li>
            <li> I really like perfumes that aren&#x27;t cloying, or heavy, and this one is really nice.</li>
            <li> scents are soft, refreshing aquatic florals that remind me of how my skin smells after a fun day spent swimming and sunbathing by the pool.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other scents, but I have never seemed to change my mind about this one.  </li>
            <li> I originally found this when I was 14 and finally saved up $40 when I was 16 to buy it.</li>
            <li> I have other perfumes but this one is top</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t smell like the original one this has to be generic!!!</li>
            <li> very nice scent, but a little weak :)</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re not big fans of sweet and/or fruity.  </li>
            <li> Hands down one of my favorite scents, it goes so well with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> This package came brand new!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only my favorite cologne, it is the ONLY one I wear!!  </li>
            <li> Same product as the local store for a better price.</li>
            <li> The outside of the perfume container felt mildly sticky.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with this scent in a department store after a few sprays.</li>
            <li> Before, I used it during summers only; now, since the temperature in South Florida rarely goes below 80 degrees, I use it all year around.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered my cologne, the price you can&#x27;t beat and it seems to ship right away.</li>
            <li> This is a nice clean scent with a slight (but not overwhelming) fruity/floral undertone.</li>
            <li> It was a new bottle but the fragrance smelled like it had been sitting around awhile.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife to try something new</li>
            <li> little bit of powder and a little bit of paint may make a woman just what she aint, but good perfume will fill the room and really attract a groom.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and lingers even softer...very feminine and not over powering he says.</li>
            <li> It is a powerful scent at first, but it is EXTREMELY long lasting.</li>
            <li> Both smelt exactly the same.</li>
            <li> yes, but due to several setbacks, I lost most of my sense of smell...</li>
            <li> The item arrived early also!</li>
            <li> times!&lt;br /&gt;Likes: not watered down or cheap.</li>
            <li> It is light, inviting, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> was happy to recieve product earlier than expected and it wasnt a bunk one like in my past orders from \\&quot;other\\&quot; companies, so</li>
            <li> A lady wears it at work, and I naturally had to investigate and find out the name of it.  </li>
            <li> I really hope the stores just got lemons and that is not how it actually smells!</li>
            <li> It will definitely last much longer.</li>
            <li> Love the larger size bottle at a price I used to pay locally at retail center for smallest bottle.</li>
            <li> This was by far cheaper than I could have bought it at Nordstrom&#x27;s, Dillards or Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> But my bottle was defective and only sprays in a straight line which of course stains your clothes.</li>
            <li> I blind bought this perfume based on the glowing recommendation of a close friend expecting a delicious blast of green apple saturating my skin and senses.</li>
            <li> I liked the product but the shipping was a little delayed and kinda unclear when the payment actually hit my account, seemed kinda strange but eventually made it to the destination I had ordered it to be sent.</li>
            <li> I have checked many local stores and this perfume is usually twice the amount that it is on amazon.</li>
            <li> The box I received with this purchase looked completely intact and normal on the outside.</li>
            <li> like that it smells sweet and not floral but the only thing is it does not last long</li>
            <li> This product normally costs around $80 in stores such as Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> The smell is really wonderfull and quite possible in the future I will buy for me also.</li>
            <li> Amazon sells it for more or less half the price</li>
            <li> Smelled very much of alcohol and not fresh.</li>
            <li> so far i can only wear paris hilton, romance, lady gaga, fendi</li>
            <li> and I still can barely tell the difference...</li>
            <li> but apparently you can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money to save a few bucks, because in the end you will end up wasting more money than just buying directly from the dept store.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this Parfum and never get tired of it myself.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this online t sephora as a gift for my aunt, and went to 2 different stores to smell it to make sure I wasn&#x27;t crazy the first time I smelt it...</li>
            <li> It is a very liquidy, as some other commenters said, but I had noticed that 28th the full-price department store version as well.</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than the original expected delivery date even though the package was delayed due to weather conditions.  </li>
            <li> Although I felt the smell dissipated after a few hours, I think that was just me getting used to the smell because if I went out at night after spraying it on during the day a few hours prior, other people still commented on how good I smelled</li>
            <li> I wear it pretty much everyday, just a spritz on the neck and wrist if i&#x27;m going to work or something and an all over spritzing on the clothes and hair if I want it to be a bit stronger.</li>
            <li> SHE loves it, and having bought it before at a department store, confirmed that the bottle from Amazon is indeed real not counterfeit (for all the scent resellers who can&#x27;t compete with Amazon&#x27;s prices and thus love to come post fake reviews complaining about fake perfumes sold here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had to jump thru some hoops to get it here, but the secondary vendor helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> It does seem to be a bit more subtle than other perfumes which my husband likes because he doesn&#x27;t like to be assaulted by my perfume every time I walk by.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts a pretty long time and usually due to my body chemistry perfumes don&#x27;t last too long on me.</li>
            <li> However, I thought it was worth mentioning my observations, just in case there are any other disappointed long-term Ming Shu fans out there looking for a suitable replacement.easonably priced.</li>
            <li> However, I thought it was worth mentioning my observations, just in case there are any other disappointed long-term Ming Shu fans out there looking for a suitable replacement.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s see how long the fragrant last.</li>
            <li> * Long lasting.</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume before and have the old bottle with a little left at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Took me a few weeks to decide because it was just so new.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was a tad skeptical because it was such a nice deal, but it&#x27;s MY DKNY GREEN APPLE!  </li>
            <li> fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long!!</li>
            <li> I have very bad allergies and many perfumes seem to be nice initially but end up irritating my nose and eyes as I wear it through the day.  </li>
            <li> A little goes softly with the wearer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very delicate yet powerful</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical that it was genuine.</li>
            <li> To me it smells like light apples, honey suckle, and something faintly floral.</li>
            <li> It will take me a long time to use all of it.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s after a long day of work.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of this perfume</li>
            <li> Smell lasts so long.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered it a few months ago, and have barely made a dent in it, so this will last me a long time!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this one I received is old or expired, but the smell is different and only last a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I can barely smell the green apple.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I can barely smell the green apple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very strong, it lasts ALL DAY, and I get the occasional &amp;#34;you always smell so good&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and it was about half the price of the same thing at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> same stuff as Macys but half the price</li>
            <li> Very disappointed I bought a lovely perfume that I can exchange for a new one that actually works.</li>
            <li> a great scent, horrible quality.</li>
            <li> All as expected and well done.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no problems with this product, its packaging, or delivery.  </li>
            <li> I was in the mood for a juicy gourmand when I purchased this fragrance and am not really enamored with it like I should be.</li>
            <li> I was in the mood for a juicy gourmand when I purchased this fragrance and am not really enamored with it like I should be.</li>
            <li> My fave perfume and for only half the price!</li>
            <li> So I was not certain about even buying perfume and stopped.</li>
            <li> one spray gives just enough scent to last through the day but still be subtle.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected though!</li>
            <li> I have bought other perfumes by other cosmetic lines for half the price that in one spray did what takes 4 or 5 sprays of this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also long lasting and smells very delicate on me.</li>
            <li> the price, it is not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> It smells like mid or late summer when some flowers are still in bloom, there is a woodsy smell to everything and fruits</li>
            <li> like a really luxurious expensive apple-ly bathroom cleaner.  </li>
            <li> It has a fruity, green appley, flowery smell as the top notes that dries down to a warmer, muskier base.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t find it for less anywhere else.</li>
            <li> You can tell it is half water.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed: smells like cheap cheap fake perfume....</li>
            <li> A little overpriced for what it is and the customer service line to find out information on it was no help.</li>
            <li> If you want to know what a little dab will do for you, go for this imported product from France.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, my taste for floral aquatics has all but dried up after 20 years of wearing one of them.</li>
            <li> everyday scent.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.</li>
            <li> Less than 1/2 price is what we like!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost half price!</li>
            <li> that over 60 one loses half their sense of smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the past for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was just the samples or what.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this perfume, about 1 bottle a year for the past 6 years.</li>
            <li> I can still smell it now, faintly lingering on my skin, despite it being three days since my last application.</li>
            <li> At least, not to my nose.</li>
            <li> Sucks because I do like to save money, but</li>
            <li> The label was wrong, the little nozzle thing wasn&#x27;t working...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my taste for floral aquatics has all but dried up after 20 years of wearing one of them.</li>
            <li> I am NOT a happy camper.</li>
            <li> I think this is fake...</li>
            <li> But it has been while since I have used DKNY so my memory could be wrong.</li>
            <li> Clearly fake.....</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong with Be</li>
            <li> I hope I didn&#x27;t get the fake one.</li>
            <li> A scent that has, unfortunately, been discontinued.</li>
            <li> but the prices in the stores are crazy.</li>
            <li> Disappointing</li>
            <li> It is fake!</li>
            <li> so I know it&#x27;s very expensive</li>
            <li> (some perfumes have really bad pumps/sprays)</li>
            <li> Duped! :(</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be disappointed at all with this one!</li>
            <li> It was awful!</li>

            <li> My girlfriend is very satisfied with present. Thank you .</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this perfume.  A lady wears it at work, and I naturally had to investigate and find out the name of it.  It is so light and appealing - great product.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my wife. As I am working in Canada and have not smelled it yet but my wife loves it, all that matters. This must be a good product. She recommends</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my wife for Christmas.  It was definitely out of her comfort zone, but she was wanting a new scent, and this one is excellent.  She immediately loved it and has been wearing it ever since.  Would highly recommend it.  It is light, inviting, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> the oils in my skin do not make this perfume smell very good on me. so far i can only wear paris hilton, romance, lady gaga, fendi</li>
            <li> My Husband bought this perfume for me and we both absolutely love it. It has a lovely clean sent with great longevity.</li>
            <li> Its perfume, it smells good, what else can be said....someone please invent smellovision, or smelloputer....</li>
            <li> As described. Quick delivery :) my all time fav scent!  Light and airy.</li>
            <li> It is very fresh and good for everyday - you can feel it but it&#x27;s not \\&quot;too much\\&quot;. OK for winter and not to strong for summer. Will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> My wife loved this perfume. Very well packaged. Great price</li>
            <li> She enjoyed her valentinegift</li>
            <li> I have been wearing DKNY Be Delicious for about three years. It smells so fresh and clean! It is a powerful scent at first, but it is EXTREMELY long lasting. I can smell it on my clothes for weeks. If you like fruity, clean smells, you should try this perfume-- you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My favorite with a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Very nice product worked as intended good price love it, that is all that I have to say about this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good deal if this is the product that your wife wants.  Shipped fast and well packaged.  She uses it along with several others.</li>
            <li> Love this smell and so does my husband! It is his favorite. Nice modern style bottle and larger size then I remember. It will take me a long time to use all of it. Very happy with my purchase and it was about half the price of the same thing at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Smelled very much of alcohol and not fresh. It was a new bottle but the fragrance smelled like it had been sitting around awhile.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i was expecting. Best perfume for a lasting impression</li>
            <li> This was a present for my son&#x27;s girlfriend.  She loves it!!</li>
            <li> got a great deal on this.  Daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> I do not get all these positive reviews. I purchased this online t sephora as a gift for my aunt, and went to 2 different stores to smell it to make sure I wasn&#x27;t crazy the first time I smelt it... It smells like very strong alcohol and honey. At first I went to a department store, and then shoppers drug mart. Both smelt exactly the same. It was awful! Not sure if it was just the samples or what. But it will be returned, I purchased a nice set of earrings instead. I really hope the stores just got lemons and that is not how it actually smells!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I liked the product but the shipping was a little delayed and kinda unclear when the payment actually hit my account, seemed kinda strange but eventually made it to the destination I had ordered it to be sent. A little overpriced for what it is and the customer service line to find out information on it was no help. The lady sounded like I WAS a bother to her. Overall, I&#x27;d buy the product again but not from here. product is fine. service sucked.</li>
            <li> I WILL BUY THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN!LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I love this purfume. It is my all time favorite. Trust me it is perfect for any occasion and smells great :)</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is excellent</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE perfume. Smells light, sweet, clean, fresh...I Love it!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only my favorite cologne, it is the ONLY one I wear!!  I get so many compliments about it!  And purchasing it from Amazon is about $30 cheaper than the department stores!!!  I love Be Delicious and I love Amazon!!!  :)</li>
            <li> After I had sinus surgery three years ago, I didn&#x27;t get the outcome I wanted...I got the sinus&#x27;s cleared yes, but due to several setbacks, I lost most of my sense of smell...couple that with the report that over 60 one loses half their sense of smell. So I was not certain about even buying perfume and stopped. I had always loved perfume, not so much cologne or toilet water...but the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;Before I purchased this I did what any woman would do...not take your bff...but see what men thought of this on their ladies. I checked Amazon ratings and looked only for what men said about it....that sold me on it. My husband loves it on me and that is what matters. Very soft and lingers even softer...very feminine and not over powering he says. I spray it over my head and let the scent fall over me. On a very good day, I can get a faint scent of it and I love it. A little goes softly with the wearer.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely. It is a very liquidy, as some other commenters said, but I had noticed that 28th the full-price department store version as well. The scent was sufficiently strong and pleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing DKNY since it first came out and would always buy it at the mall. I get so much compliments wearing this perfume. It makes me smell so fresh and it lasts the whole day. Amazon sells it for more or less half the price and I was skeptical that it was genuine. I compared it with my store bought perfume and it&#x27;s definitely not fake. I will never buy DKNY from the store again!</li>
            <li> Got here in time, the box that contained the perfume was very well protected inside another box.</li>
            <li> amazing, it comes on the time and look very nice and no scratch. i really love it so much and I will get more</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Will definitely order this again! Fast shipping!!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Came quick and smells great :)</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t find it for less anywhere else. my girlfriend loves it. seems to spray really well (some perfumes have really bad pumps/sprays)</li>
            <li> what a great deal!!! Love this and will buy again!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance.  Very light . . summary, so different from the Cashmere  (I love both) and the price is right . . . what more can you say.</li>
            <li> GOOD SELLER, GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Hands down one of my favorite scents, it goes so well with my body chemistry. It&#x27;s also long lasting and smells very delicate on me. I always get compliments when I wear it! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I think this is fake...fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift  for my daughter and she is enjoying it. The bottle is very stylish and the fragance subtle and rich. The shipping experience was excellent.</li>
            <li> Of course this scent is perfectly heavenly.  It has ultimate staying power and does not change as time goes by.  It is very much a women&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. Great buy</li>
            <li> This smells amazing.  I always get compliments every time I wear it.  Now I&#x27;m buying it for my mother, who took my bottle.</li>
            <li> This smells like the one that I purchased at the store. However, the top which allows the fragrance to spray out broke after using the product twice and I have not been able to use it since. I am going to try e-mail the seller to see if I can get a replacement.</li>
            <li> I really like how this perfume smells, it&#x27;s like a refreshing scent, like just gotten out from a lake of roses and flowers. Bought for my girlfriend since she&#x27;s been eyeing it and she loves it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! I very rarely buy myself perfume because I am so picky. I discovered this last year and loved it but the prices in the stores are crazy. This is a fantastic price for the amount you get. It is almost double the amount that I paid the same price for in the store for only 1 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend it. Received it in a very timely manner as well.</li>
            <li> I love this perfum, since I can&#x27;t stand the strong or sweet ones I think this is perfect, is soft and fresh, with a touch of citrus, a very nice</li>
            <li> The perfume was great exactly what my girlfriend wanted. I bought it as a gift, she actually had the 1oz before, this size is way bigger. It will definitely last much longer.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume!  The only one I wear.  I like the spritzer - one spray gives just enough scent to last through the day but still be subtle.</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing! we love the smell of it and the price can&#x27;t be beat :) Less than 1/2 price is what we like!</li>
            <li> I got it on time, perfect packing and excellent fragrance quality it doesn&#x27;t fade away quickly. 100% original and recommended</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! I always get complimented on it!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! I receive lots of compliments when I wear it. Even at the end of the day, I receive compliments on how nice it smells and that&#x27;s after a long day of work.</li>
            <li> It smells how it suppose. I recommend it 100 %. I love it. It&#x27;s a product 100 % original. Thanks</li>
            <li> Same product as the local store for a better price. Makes your blow up doll smell real. Get it. Get it now!</li>
            <li> The girl I bought it for loved it</li>
            <li> same stuff as Macys but half the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this perfume, about 1 bottle a year for the past 6 years. I wear it pretty much everyday, just a spritz on the neck and wrist if i&#x27;m going to work or something and an all over spritzing on the clothes and hair if I want it to be a bit stronger. To me it smells like light apples, honey suckle, and something faintly floral. It&#x27;s not very strong, it lasts ALL DAY, and I get the occasional &amp;#34;you always smell so good&amp;#34; comment. It&#x27;s a very feminine scent, and fresh but if your going to a bar or somewhere where there is tons of people, you&#x27;ll need something stronger. Also don&#x27;t wear it on a hike or walk in the woods, it seems to attract bees (or maybe that&#x27;s just me? :-)</li>
            <li> hello I recommend this product, excellent product on time and with good packaging, works without any problems I recommend to all</li>
            <li> my wife really likes the smell of this perfume. no complaints here either.</li>
            <li> arrived in good condition</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume as a gift. It is packaged just adorably in its little brown box and unique apple bottle. It is great and I recommend it</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, smells great</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! I&#x27;m always getting compliments whenever I wear it. It isn&#x27;t too strong and it last all day!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed: smells like cheap cheap fake perfume....absolutely nothing like the real thing, and the item is non-returnable! Duped! :(</li>
            <li> Took me a few weeks to decide because it was just so new.  Bought this for my wife to try something new (she&#x27;s been wearing the same perfume for 15 years).  We&#x27;re not big fans of sweet and/or fruity.  This is a nice clean scent with a slight (but not overwhelming) fruity/floral undertone.</li>
            <li> very pleased with product, will be getting more. quick shipment and could not be more excited about getting more from dkny</li>
            <li> My husband and I both like this perfume!  It is a fresh smelling, pleasant scent and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> My title should say it all. This item arrived exactly as expected and it is one of my favorite scents for the summer.</li>
            <li> This scent is my one and only favorite that I go to just about every day....it&#x27;s so fresh and clean smelling and I get nothing but compliments no matter where I am.  People ask me even at the supermarket, &amp;#34;oh, you smell so good&amp;#34;, what is that scent?  It&#x27;s my signature &#x27;go to&#x27; and I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be disappointed at all with this one!</li>
            <li> Strong fresh apple smell. Love it</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this scent since it was first introduced, and I receive nothing but compliments on my perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent is so unique!  It&#x27;s floral and fruity and fresh and crisp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the men that I worked with would always say that I smelled amazing, and that&#x27;s not a bad thing to hear from time to time.</li>
            <li> I buy this item all the time. It has a very &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; smell to it that I love. And this is the best price I have found anywhere for this item.</li>
            <li> love it!!! favorite perfume!!!  The only thing is this time the spray part of the perfume bottle squirts out more then mists out. and when I had a smaller size before i thought it was more misty because there is no way i could spray this on my close right now it would definitely stain. But it has been while since I have used DKNY so my memory could be wrong. either way though I love it. and still always get complements whenever i wear it and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I had bought this scent in store, and was happy to find it for such a good price. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is my go to perfume and you can&#x27;t beat the price. It is almost double at department stores so this was a great buy. I have received many compliments with this perfume over the last 10 years of wearing this every day.</li>
            <li> Got the perfume right as scheduled. Love it, grat deal too. 3.4 ounces, free shipping and only $37.00!</li>
            <li> This will forever be my favorite perfume. You only need a little bit and it doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming aroma like I find most perfumes do. I like this better than the red DKNY, though only recently I&#x27;ve found that I like the PURE vanilla scented DKNY the best, but it is a little pricier.</li>
            <li> Smells great nice for a slightly cheaper fragrance.</li>
            <li> This was an awesome buy. Its the only perfume that my wife currently uses and she totally loves it. I will certainly recommend this perfume for the perfect gift for that special someone.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this scent in a department store after a few sprays. Of course, I sought it out on Amazon since I have the \\&quot;Prime\\&quot; and knew it would be cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it is not worth it at all. I have bought other perfumes by other cosmetic lines for half the price that in one spray did what takes 4 or 5 sprays of this scent.&lt;br /&gt;DKNY is, after use of this product, just another label.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be going back to my \\&quot;Happy\\&quot; after I&#x27;m done with this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;What a great scent, horrible quality.</li>
            <li> I get so many complements every time I wear this scent - very fresh.  Not too floral or fruity.  Just right.  My &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; scent for warm days and nights.</li>
            <li> Favorite perfume.  Love the larger size bottle at a price I used to pay locally at retail center for smallest bottle.</li>
            <li> Just as I remembered... :)</li>
            <li> My favorite an only perfume I&#x27;ll wear. Good price too!</li>
            <li> Best price on my favorite perfume.  Years of using this perfume I still get compliments on how it smells.  I have checked many local stores and this perfume is usually twice the amount that it is on amazon.</li>
            <li> Totally as advertised. I love this product.</li>
            <li> exactly was i was expecting for a more affordable price.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfrend Christmas gift, and she is very happy with it, and it smails like green apple.</li>
            <li> This package came brand new! I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for about 6 years now! It last a&lt;br /&gt;L day and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This has been a great smelling perfume ever since I started buying it 5 years ago. The wife loves it and enjoys it whenever it comes in the mail. Always a favorite!</li>
            <li> The DKY fragrance is just what I was looking for the fall. It&#x27;s not too over bearing, but lingers for quit a while, therefor, eliminating the need to reapply.</li>
            <li> My Wife and I love the scent. It is 100% authentic at a wonderful price.</li>
            <li> Love it! This is the real thing, not a knock-off and it&#x27;s a great smelling perfume. Although I felt the smell dissipated after a few hours, I think that was just me getting used to the smell because if I went out at night after spraying it on during the day a few hours prior, other people still commented on how good I smelled so I think my nose just became desensitized to it. Great buy!</li>
            <li> this is my absolute favorite perfume so light, crisp and smells amazing, I always get compliments on it every time I wear it.. and you can&#x27;t beat the price it&#x27;s about 20 cheaper than retail for this size &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Had bought before and knew what I was getting!</li>
            <li> Yummy!  It shipped fast and I was so very happy to get it.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Nice clean fresh smelling perfume.. stays with you and I always get compliments when wearing it.  Nice and light smell!</li>
            <li> Thank you! Love this product. I could not get it locally in that size.</li>
            <li> Dkny Be Delicious By Donna Karan For Women, bought as a surprise gift for my wife, she is happy! That&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li> Smells like Dubai and apples. Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been trying on Be Delicious every time I walked through the makeup section of stores for years and always loved it!  I finally splurged and bought some.  I have tried many other scents, but I have never seemed to change my mind about this one.  YUM!</li>
            <li> Love!love!love! My favorite smelling perfume!</li>
            <li> Love this scent. I get compliments all the time. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I got this item right in time and as decribed.</li>
            <li> Got here on time, and smells great!  It was rapped nicely too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume solely based off of the reviews without having smelled it before.  It did not disappoint!  It is a wonderful, crisp scent.  Don&#x27;t feel like it could be overpowering.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and get so many compliments!!!  It is just so different than what&lt;br /&gt;everybody else wears.</li>
            <li> Love it and the best price for the size.</li>
            <li> Smells great, I always get compliments when I wear it</li>
            <li> Great product, delivered on time</li>
            <li> My all time favorite cologne....and a fabulous price!!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time as promised. Was a big hit with my Girlfriend.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> smells really good. fast shipping! Just in time for my mom&#x27;s birthday!</li>
            <li> This perfume has endured over the last 10 years. I am on my 4th bottle of the 3.4 EDP. I love this in the Spring and Summer as it smells like summer to me. It has a fruity, green appley, flowery smell as the top notes that dries down to a warmer, muskier base. It smells like mid or late summer when some flowers are still in bloom, there is a woodsy smell to everything and fruits are starting to ripen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a pretty long time and usually due to my body chemistry perfumes don&#x27;t last too long on me. When I&#x27;ve worn this perfume I&#x27;ve had cabbies, doormen, and of course friends ask me what I was wearing so that they can get it for themselves or girlfriends/wives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then they came out with the Red Apple, Golden Apple and Pink Apple version that I&#x27;ve tried but the original Green Apple version works the best. I love the round bottle too, it&#x27;s kind of hard to break and easy to take with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;Top Notes&lt;br /&gt;Grapefruit, Cucumber, Magnolia&lt;br /&gt;Middle Notes&lt;br /&gt;Apple, Tuberose, White Muguet, Rose, Violet&lt;br /&gt;Base Notes&lt;br /&gt;White Amber, Woods&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be Delicious is such an apt name for this fragrance, it really makes you smell delicious.</li>
            <li> My woman loves it..what more do I need to say</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, and was able to find it a lot cheaper than I did at a local store. Well worth it!!</li>
            <li> This was one of the best purchases I have made in quite some time.  I love DKNY Be Delicious and have been wearing it for many years.  This was by far cheaper than I could have bought it at Nordstrom&#x27;s, Dillards or Macy&#x27;s.  I will definitely be purchasing more of my perfumes at Amazon.  This was not a knock off either, it was the real deal.  I am so happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes</li>
            <li> Its ok.... Not what I expected though!</li>
            <li> very nice scent, but a little weak :)</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite perfume.  I have very bad allergies and many perfumes seem to be nice initially but end up irritating my nose and eyes as I wear it through the day.  I can wear this every day and enjoy the light scent without any problems.  It does seem to be a bit more subtle than other perfumes which my husband likes because he doesn&#x27;t like to be assaulted by my perfume every time I walk by.  This was available at a great price too!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this, and it&#x27;s my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite.  I ordered it a few months ago, and have barely made a dent in it, so this will last me a long time!  I only use one spray and it lasts me all day.  It&#x27;s especially great for the spring and summer.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product exactly as described!! I have been a long time user of this perfume and you absolutely can not beat this price for this sized bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume but hadn&#x27;t purchased it in a while because it&#x27;s so expensive. I was thrilled to find it at such a good deal on Amazon and purchased immeditaely. This is a great classic scent that I am constantly complimented on but if you are just trying it out I would go to a department store first and smell it to see if its for you. Then purchase on Amazon for the much better price!</li>
            <li> Excelente marca. Recibi en muy buen estado. Estoy conforme con el mismo, y por tanto, he recomendado a mis amigos.</li>
            <li> Light, refreshing scent. Have received MANY compliments on how good I smell!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, she loves it.  Quickly shipped and good price.  I will do business with again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this perfume. This is the 4th bottle I&#x27;ve bought in the last 5 years</li>
            <li> This product I bought for my son&#x27;s girlfriend, because he asked me to. The smell is really wonderfull and quite possible in the future I will buy for me also.</li>
            <li> SO I ordered this product on amazon because I&#x27;d smelt it at sephora and it smelt like H.E.A.V.E.N hunti !!!!  It came in the mail, I semi-attacked the mailman, ripped it open, sprayed it....... no, just No.  It smelt like bathroom cleaner....like a really luxurious expensive apple-ly bathroom cleaner.  The label was wrong, the little nozzle thing wasn&#x27;t working...Clearly fake.....BUT......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called amazon and their customer service is out of this world, honestly.  You just gotta talk to the right person cos 99.9% of the time, they&#x27;re willing to work with you.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and smells yummy:)</li>
            <li> Received my cologne on time it came in a sealed  plastic wrap. It smells great, not sure if its the original as I have never bought it before however I had used it before, I loved the smell . I trust that amazon will uphold their reputation and I hope its the original. I love the smell</li>
            <li> I have this perfume for almost a year probably and I still have some even though sometimes I spray 3 times!&lt;br /&gt;Likes: not watered down or cheap. I love the smell and receive many compliments on it&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes: absolutely none!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite perfume so to get it at such a good price was fantastic.</li>
            <li> my favorite fragrance! awesome.</li>
            <li> This is my second favorite go to perfume, first being DREAMS unlimited by The Body Shop.</li>
            <li> refreshing and very yummy smell. You just can&#x27;t go wrong with Be Delicious.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of my all time favorites. I&#x27;m on the second bottle now :)</li>
            <li> This arrived before the date scheduled which was nice. I love the scent, it is light, clean and not overpowering. This is a great price for a really nice scent.</li>
            <li> Very good perfume. Original packing and very good price. Smell lasts so long. Very pleased with my purchase. Highly recommend buying this!</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift knowing it was her favorite perfume.  I wasn&#x27;t able to experience it myself but reading the description - it sounds wonderful.  The gift receiver loved it!</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume, smells great, really fresh but also femenine.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered my cologne, the price you can&#x27;t beat and it seems to ship right away.</li>
            <li> love the smell fast delivery</li>
            <li> I loved it and I am planning to purchase more perfumes...&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s see how long the fragrant last. I am still experimenting.</li>
            <li> My sisters favorite perfume  so I know it&#x27;s very expensive so I do a lot of shopping on amazon and stumbled upon it. I couldn&#x27;t believe the price for the size it was so I ordered it and it seemed like it shipped overnight. I had it within 2 days</li>
            <li> The process of ordering my DKNY Be Delicious on line (and with free shipping), was so simple and affordable!  And...I had it delivered within about 4 days of ordering it!  I was 100% satisfied with the process and the product!  I get so many compliments on this Parfum and never get tired of it myself.  Thank you for an enjoyable experience that lasts and lasts (until I have to order more, that is)!</li>
            <li> I really like perfumes that aren&#x27;t cloying, or heavy, and this one is really nice. I actually bought this one for my sister, as she liked mine so well.</li>
            <li> I always get complimented when I wear this scent! Its universal, my bf loves it, my grandma loves it, and so do I! It doesn&#x27;t take much and the scent lasts all day. I originally found this when I was 14 and finally saved up $40 when I was 16 to buy it. I rationed it and it lasted me until this year...I am 22. I just bought another one and will continue to buy until I find a match. I have other perfumes but this one is top dog!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is perfectly shaped and I love the lid in that I can throw it in my overnight bag or purse and not have to worry about it spraying or leaking in my bag.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift. It smells really good. I hope I didn&#x27;t get the fake one. Coz it would be embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Slightly sweet and very crisp. Great as a stand alone or mixed with spicy and earthy fragrances to create fresh lively scents for summer.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume of all time...but the one I just ordered from Amazon had no scent. I am sending it back.</li>
            <li> All as expected and well done.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift and my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. It&#x27;s my favorite. It last and I it arrived to my house, witch is very coviniant for me.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume and Amazon never disappoints in price, thank you!</li>
            <li> Excellent product quality</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance it&#x27;s very delicate yet powerful and I always feel good when I wear it.  Love it!</li>
            <li> like that it smells sweet and not floral but the only thing is it does not last long so I have to reapply which is no problem. I would order again .</li>
            <li> Before, I used it during summers only; now, since the temperature in South Florida rarely goes below 80 degrees, I use it all year around. It is the best and lightest summer fragrance ever!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance best price around too!!!!And Product came in 1 week early to top off !!!! 10 stars!!!!</li>
            <li> nice product and came as desribed in ad - would buy again.</li>
            <li> It Arrived on time, but i put it 4 because the price was up while i decide to buy (four days)</li>
            <li> This perfume is absolutely delicious smelling. I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> On to my second bottle.  Fresh, staying power, gets compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have turned to using two different perfumes at the same time so that I don&#x27;t get used to it and can smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternating with Dior, Addict.  The word says it all!</li>
            <li> I purchased this pricy perfume as a gift for my wonderful wife of 47 years because it&#x27;s her favorite and she&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit of powder and a little bit of paint may make a woman just what she aint, but good perfume will fill the room and really attract a groom.  If you want to know what a little dab will do for you, go for this imported product from France. It&#x27;s tres bien !</li>
            <li> I get this every year for my wife and she loves the scent (so do I). She has others but this is her favorite.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend had gotten this perfume a couple years ago from macys for close to $80! used it for well over a year until it ran out but she couldn&#x27;t justify spending that kind of money again on a smell. well i bought it from amazon for under $50 as a christmas present and she couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no problems with this product, its packaging, or delivery.  It arrived earlier than the original expected delivery date even though the package was delayed due to weather conditions.  I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister; she loves it.  This product normally costs around $80 in stores such as Macy&#x27;s.  This is the best price I could find for this product amongst the well-rated, trusted sellers.  I definitely recommend this specific perfume as well.  It is a good &amp;#34;every day&amp;#34; scent and it is also a scent anyone would love.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful fragrance. Had to jump thru some hoops to get it here, but the secondary vendor helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift, the recipient greatly appreciated the size and shape of the bottle and the way it was packaged...</li>
            <li> My wife uses this and it is a great scent.  I really recommend it.  Long lasting, fresh and pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Was nervous when ordering online, however, I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li> Merchandise was just what the description explain.  and it smells very nice. It arrive within a week in great condition</li>
            <li> This has been my staple perfume for several years.  It really does smell delicious.  I have received many compliments on this fragrance over the years and was very happy to find it available for a reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually a review writer, but I am extremely disappoint that this product is not allowed to be returned and/or exchanged. I love this perfume and delivery time was good. But my bottle was defective and only sprays in a straight line which of course stains your clothes. Very disappointed I bought a lovely perfume that I can exchange for a new one that actually works.</li>
            <li> The real deal.  I have to admit that I was a tad skeptical because it was such a nice deal, but it&#x27;s MY DKNY GREEN APPLE!  Love this scent.  I get so many compliments.  Not overbearing.  Not too sweet, not musky.  Very clean.</li>
            <li> The box I received with this purchase looked completely intact and normal on the outside. When I opened the package the box was discolored as if it had been Water damaged.  The outside of the perfume container felt mildly sticky. I used the perfume anyway and to my dismay the scent was that of very cheap perfume that has been diluted with water. I assume this package was kept in very hot temperatures for an extended period of time and the fragrance evaporated and discolored the box.  I contacted this seller and was told I would get a full refund but I have yet to receive the return information in the mail as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Dissapointed!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cologne, smells so nice and absolutely love it!!!! Kind of fruity, and very sensual, can wear day or night!</li>
            <li> I have always loved this scent. Ordered for my sister&#x27;s birthday and she loves it as well!! Shipping was fast and accurate.</li>
            <li> Fantastic item with a great price! The item arrived early also! I highly recommend using this shipper!</li>
            <li> Love this scent. Fresh and clean, feminine and lightly floral. This was the best deal!</li>
            <li> It came right when it said and my gf thinks it smells great :D! I would recommend for any girl.</li>
            <li> Loved this perfume! Came quickly. Good purchase!</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t smell like the original one this has to be generic!!!</li>
            <li> I love the scent and everything about the packaging!</li>
            <li> Love this scent, so crisp and fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The line of DKNY are great the have a red sweeter scent!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite (at the moment) and a good price.  What else is there to say.</li>
            <li> i love this smell. It is amazing any where..</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my sister for Christmas this year. They shipped it super fast and it came in perfect condition! Couldn&#x27;t be happier and super excited to give it to my sister! Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Was a Christmas present. She loved it. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume, for a very reasonable price here.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent women are always to me gee you smell delicious</li>
            <li> I love this scent and get alot of complements</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great  and smells just like the one in Macy&#x27;s......I would but it again</li>
            <li> Even though I ordered  this perfume for my mom,&lt;br /&gt;she didnt really like the smell......I think its the best perfume ever! Its more spring time scent.</li>
            <li> Sampled this at Macy&#x27;s and decided I wanted it...so of course I went to Amazon to purchase. The product came quickly and I absolutely love it!  I feel good wearing this fragrance. I&#x27;m picky on fragrance but this met my tastes!  Delightful!</li>
            <li> this perfume really smells good.  It&#x27;s a light, airy scent that stays on you well during the day.  This price is much better than dept. stores.  Came in a rather large box lol  and was wrapped well.</li>
            <li> Is fresh i love it, good price</li>
            <li> I love the smell and at the office I work I been getting good compliments that what perfume I wear that it smells so good so once my bottle is finish im buying more this is the first perfume I get compliments :)</li>
            <li> gracias buen producto me gusta la calidad y las cosas buenas se puede confiar en ellos recomendados a toda la comuinidad</li>
            <li> very clean smell. i love it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping product as described</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. The only reason I gave it three stars is because the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work properly!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when I purchased Be Delicious Eau de Parfum by DKNY that it was more of a floral aquatic and less of a fruity gourmand. I blind bought this perfume based on the glowing recommendation of a close friend expecting a delicious blast of green apple saturating my skin and senses. Instead, I ended up surrounded by water lilies and ozone. This perfume smells almost exactly like my old signature scent from years ago - Ming Shu Fleur Rare Eau de Toilette by Yves Rocher - which is both disconcerting for me and a blessing in disguise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s disconcerting because Ming Shu Fleur Rare is/was indeed a floral aquatic whereas Be Delicious is not, and a blessing in disguise because Ming Shu Fleur Rare is nearly impossible to find these days under $150 whereas Be Delicious is very reasonably priced. Both perfumes have green apple, rose, lily-of-the-valley, and woodsy notes, but Be Delicious has grapefruit, tuberose, magnolia, amber, and sandalwood included while Ming Shu Fleur Rare has peach, water lily, jasmine, musk, and cedar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would think with that many notes differing that the end result would be two entirely different fragrances, but not so. At least, not to my nose. In fact, I was so intrigued with how similar the two perfumes smelled that I decided to do a side-by-side wrist sniff test. Two hours later and I still can barely tell the difference...and this is after 20 years of wearing the same scent! A scent that has, unfortunately, been discontinued. I&#x27;m talking about Ming Shu Fleur Rare now, not Be Delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both scents are soft, refreshing aquatic florals that remind me of how my skin smells after a fun day spent swimming and sunbathing by the pool. Be Delicious makes a slightly more aggressive impression though, has stronger sillage, and much longer staying power due to it being an Eau De Parfum. I can still smell it now, faintly lingering on my skin, despite it being three days since my last application. What a wonderful, unexpected find!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;* Good sillage.&lt;br /&gt;* Long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;* Smells almost exactly like Ming Shu Fleru Rare by Yves Rocher, a floral aquatic that has been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s a floral aquatic, NOT a fruity gourmand.&lt;br /&gt;* I can barely smell the green apple.&lt;br /&gt;* I don&#x27;t really think it smells &amp;#34;delicious&amp;#34; in any way, more like water lilies and ozone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my taste for floral aquatics has all but dried up after 20 years of wearing one of them. I was in the mood for a juicy gourmand when I purchased this fragrance and am not really enamored with it like I should be. I&#x27;m still deciding if I want to keep it in my collection, which consists mostly of vanilla orientals and bittersweet gourmands now, or gift it to a friend. However, I thought it was worth mentioning my observations, just in case there are any other disappointed long-term Ming Shu fans out there looking for a suitable replacement.easonably priced. * Good sillage. * Long lasting. * Smells almost exactly like Ming Shu Fleru Rare by Yves Rocher, a floral aquatic that has been discontinued.

            <li> Love the scent  Will buy again!!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my daughter. It is her favorite perfume. She loves it and so do I. I have one for myself. Awsome smell.</li>
            <li> bought as a gift. she loved it</li>
            <li> Ive been wearing this perfume for the last 8yrs, I absolutely love the smell of this, I get so many compliments all the time too. Amazon has this for $20 cheaper then in stores too, I got this 2.days after ordering , so happy!! From now on, Im gonna purchase.all my perfume thru Amazon instead, so much cheaper.and easier, thank u Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this fragrance many times and the smell last all day.  I&#x27;m not sure if this one I received is old or expired, but the smell is different and only last a few minutes.  Disappointing</li>
            <li> fell in love with it had to have it</li>
            <li> My new favorite perfume! I smelled this on a co-worker and had to have it. I got it at Macy&#x27;s a few months ago and paid almost 3 times as much. I will be buying it from Amazon from now on.</li>
            <li> Great price and it made a great gift.</li>
            <li> SHE loves it, and having bought it before at a department store, confirmed that the bottle from Amazon is indeed real not counterfeit (for all the scent resellers who can&#x27;t compete with Amazon&#x27;s prices and thus love to come post fake reviews complaining about fake perfumes sold here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me, it&#x27;s pretty nice to my nose, and am especially happy that I didn&#x27;t have to pay full local retail prices for this stuff...it&#x27;s almost half price!</li>
            <li> My fave perfume and for only half the price! Love it!</li>
            <li> *BEWARE* I am a regular user of this amazing perfume, although the one I received was real it has EXPIRED. I checked the batch code for this product it was made April 16, 2011. Perfumes have a shelf life of 36 months. There was an off kinda Smell for all I know it can be diluted as well. I am NOT a happy camper. I don&#x27;t even write reviews either. I HAD to let y&#x27;all know please beware. Don&#x27;t waste your money to save a few bucks, because in the end you will end up wasting more money than just buying directly from the dept store. Sucks because I do like to save money, but I guess I learned my lesson. :[</li>
            <li> It is my wife&#x27;s favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to wear anything else ever since I found this. I get many compliments. It lasts all day long and it is very refreshing! Highly recomend it!</li>
            <li> Having a wishlist definitely makes getting the gifts you want a lot easier for the people shopping for you. I received this for Christmas!  It has a beautiful clean crisp scent.  It makes a great...everyday scent. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> What a GREAT price for the size . Paid way more than that at a retail store.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my daughter bewcause it is her favorite, and I thought she needed some cheering up.&lt;br /&gt;I am delighted that it was a success.  The company worked with me to make sure it was delivered to her.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom for Christmas, and it is exactly what you get for $70+ at Sephora.</li>
            <li> Excellent. . Very Happy&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was very  well</li>
            <li> This product does not smell on my shirt longer than 5 minutes. You can tell it is half water. Do not buy.. It is fake!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend after I hear her say she like it in the store.  I find it very nice.  Good buy and price.</li>
            <li> My daugther (21 years old) has been wearing DKNY Be Delicious for almost six years. She love it because the powerful scent smells fresh and delicious and she can smell it on her clothes for a long time. This parfum is her signature!</li>
            <li> This is bulls***. I have worn this perfume before and have the old bottle with a little left at the bottom. When I received this package I noticed it had some Arabic looking writing on the side. After I opened it and compared I noticed this \\&quot;new\\&quot; bottle smelt like it was diluted with alcohol or something. I wanted to return it but apparently you can&#x27;t. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. Just buy the real thing.</li>
            <li> I just love this perfume. I get so many complements.</li>
