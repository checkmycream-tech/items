            <li> Great fresh, clean fragrance - especially good in summertime.</li>
            <li> Love Cashmere Bouquet. Can&#x27;t believe they discontinued it but I called the company and was told there are no plans to bring it back :(</li>
            <li> I used to buy this soap in stores often.  Then I had trouble finding it.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon and I have ordered multiple bars on 2 occasions.  Although I must say that the scent seems considerably milder than I recalled.  I wondered if that meant C-P discontinued it and that these are the last ones that were stored in a warehouse somewhere... I was still happy to find it.</li>
            <li> This soap, even though it says Original Scent....isn&#x27;t.  I have a couple of bars left from a long time ago and I was hoping to replenish my supply.  Fragrance is NOT the same.  The vendor was awesome.  Arrived when promised.  Not his fault the company changed.&lt;br /&gt;Will use the vendor again with appreciation.</li>

            <li> Very disappointed.  Not only does it not smell at all like it used to, but it smells bad. I use and love the Cashmere Bouquet powder.&lt;br /&gt;But this soap ... Can&#x27;t use. Wish I knew how to get refund.</li>
