            <li>Joy</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this lotion.</li>
            <li>I have been using this lotion for years and have loved it because it&#x27;s a non-greasy, effective moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>They always feel better after putting this lotion on so</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and will purchase it after my bottle is gone.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lightly scented would have been a more accurate description.</li>
            <li>It is non scented and is great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been absolutely fine.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li>I got it free to try from Influenster.  </li>
            <li>I received this lotion to try free from Influenster.....</li>
            <li>bottle the price is right!</li>
            <li>Really wish it was better.</li>
            <li>This product is my new favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>Since I go through it so quickly, I thought Subscribe and Save would be the perfect solution...however, as other reviewers mentioned, the lotion I received was about twice as watery as the lotion I buy at my local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this complimentary for testing purposes from influenster</li>
            <li>very runny lotion and so goey feeling.</li>
            <li>We live in a very arid climate (NM).</li>
            <li>I took the 5 day challenge and was pleasantly surprised by the intense moisture my skin received.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not hard to please when it comes to lotion.  </li>
            <li>I got this thinking it would provide decent hydration for my 6 year old.</li>
            <li>When I first tried it, my mom and I broke out in itchy, red dots on our forearms.  </li>
            <li>is the first time I&#x27;ve had such an issue with Vaseline lotion and will be shopping for it at my grocer instead.</li>
            <li>I purchased this smaller size for portability, but after the first application, I noticed a rancid smell from the lotion.</li>
            <li>probably would have used this Vaseline Intensive Rescue \\&quot;moisture locking\\&quot; lotion, but it does have a fragrance although the bottle is marked \\&quot;unfragranced.\\&quot; For those sensitive people with sensitivity to perfumes, even the smallest amount - I would say don&#x27;t buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the fact that is was not too thick but not too liquidy.  </li>
            <li>I naturally have dry skin, especially around this tune of year and this stuff really helped.</li>
            <li>Arrived runny, it&#x27;s a &#x27;thin&#x27; lotion and does not moisturizer but sits on top of skin.</li>
            <li>The lotion was extremely liquidy and did not spread on my skin very well.</li>
            <li>and I find it to be slightly greasy however it is very moisturizing</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have very dry skin on my arms and hands</li>
            <li> not what I expected from Vaseline.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this complimentary for testing purposes from influenster and I find it to be slightly greasy however it is very moisturizing and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin within 3-5 days. It is also scent less as promised and written on the packaging</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the price.  I&#x27;m not hard to please when it comes to lotion.  However, this lotion was greasy.  I used it once and threw it away.  You pay little and get even less.</li>
            <li> This product did not work! I got it free to try from Influenster.  When I first tried it, my mom and I broke out in itchy, red dots on our forearms.  We had to wash it off. I kept using it on my feet with no more breakouts.  It goes on thin and as it sinks in with a powdery finish. I did not feel/see any difference to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Company sent the wrong product.  Charged a fortune for shipping then sent the same thing I could have purchased in my local drugstore.  Not what I ordered.  Would not answer my calls or emails.  I will never order from them again and because of this I probably will not be likely to order from Amazon as I had the mistaken impression that ordering through Amazon - that Amazon stood behind what you ordered.  Not true.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this purchase. The lotion was extremely liquidy and did not spread on my skin very well. I think it&#x27;s an Amazon thing because I&#x27;ve used this lotion before (I got it from the grocery store) and it worked great. Next time I need this lotion, I&#x27;ll be going to the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Compare to the vaseline cream that I purchased locally, this seems fake. I do not recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for years and have loved it because it&#x27;s a non-greasy, effective moisturizer.  Since I go through it so quickly, I thought Subscribe and Save would be the perfect solution...however, as other reviewers mentioned, the lotion I received was about twice as watery as the lotion I buy at my local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve had such an issue with Vaseline lotion and will be shopping for it at my grocer instead.</li>
            <li> Helps dry skin problems and used correctly, it isn&#x27;t greasy feeling. There is no odor or stickiness that is noticeable.</li>
            <li> This lotion is like water, and i mean quite literally water. It does not hydrate or moisturize your skin. Really wish it was better.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this lotion. My hands are so dry in the winter, i bought this lotion to see if it would help. They always feel better after putting this lotion on so I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is actually really even Vaseline Intensive Care, or a fake product, but it is runny!  I would not buy again.  I&#x27;ve purchased this in the store and it&#x27;s been absolutely fine.  This is not store quality.  Me giving it two stars is generous and has to do with the on time shipping.  Save your money or trek into a store.  Yuck.</li>
            <li> I normally love this lotion and usually buy it from a drugstore, however this bottle was really watery and weird. I had to throw it out. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old or bootleg or what, but it was unusable.</li>
            <li> this is the greasy and stickiest lotion I have ever used. not what I expected from Vaseline. will not buy again, cancelled the auto ship, and going for different product. very runny lotion and so goey feeling. not what you would expect from the brand.</li>
            <li> this lotion is far too thin, it is almost like runny pancake batter. the smell is very unpleasant, almost musty.</li>
            <li> Arrived runny, it&#x27;s a &#x27;thin&#x27; lotion and does not moisturizer but sits on top of skin. Unfragranced has a slight odor. Not a great product.</li>
            <li> I have used Vaseline Intensive Rescue \\&quot;Repairing Moisture\\&quot; body lotion and thought that I had ordered that. Turned out the product I ordered had a photo of the \\&quot;repairing moisture\\&quot; body lotion, that is not the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably would have used this Vaseline Intensive Rescue \\&quot;moisture locking\\&quot; lotion, but it does have a fragrance although the bottle is marked \\&quot;unfragranced.\\&quot; For those sensitive people with sensitivity to perfumes, even the smallest amount - I would say don&#x27;t buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightly scented would have been a more accurate description. For the 10 oz. bottle the price is right! Hope that Amazon will put the correct photo of this product.</li>
            <li> I received this lotion to try free from Influenster.....I love the fact that is was not too thick but not too liquidy.  I have very dry skin on my arms and hands so I used this non greasy lotion for 5 days and I noticed a HUGE difference.  It is non scented and is great for sensitive skin.  I love this lotion and will purchase it after my bottle is gone.  Well done Vaseline!!!</li>
            <li> I received this product for testing purposes from influenster and I absolutely love it. I took the 5 day challenge and was pleasantly surprised by the intense moisture my skin received. I naturally have dry skin, especially around this tune of year and this stuff really helped. This product is my new favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> I got this thinking it would provide decent hydration for my 6 year old. We live in a very arid climate (NM). This stuff is like water. Super thin. I ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> I purchased this smaller size for portability, but after the first application, I noticed a rancid smell from the lotion. Almost fishy smelling. I should note that my husband and I both have used this same lotion for over 10 years and this is the first bottle that we have received that smelled bad. With the outdated packaging, it must have expired. I tried to save the lotion by adding some essential oils to it, but the fish smell still came through and we had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> I have tried all products on the shelf&#x27;s in my town. My Dr.suggested this product and it works to keep my skin moist in  MN winter. My skin when rubbed looked like snow falling off my legs. Egads not pretty! Now with Vaseline Intensive Rescue Moisture Lotion I can show off my legs . Thank you Vaseline Company.Joy</li>
