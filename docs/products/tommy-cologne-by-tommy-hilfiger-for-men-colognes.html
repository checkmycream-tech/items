            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>This was a great deal and fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>Its one of my favorite...</li>
            <li>Tommy is one of his favorite colognes.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, smells great.  </li>
            <li>I was given this cologne as a gift and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I would say it reminds me of most of Tommy Hilfiger&#x27;s line of cologne, but between the two brands, I get more compliments on this one.</li>
            <li>i love it too</li>
            <li>Going forward, I&#x27;ll use this company more often when ordering.</li>
            <li>They love it</li>
            <li>Tommy to me(everyone&#x27;s opinions are different)is a fragrance that is very clean and refined.</li>
            <li>Light, clean and warm fragrance.</li>
            <li>Good purchase came fast</li>
            <li>I feel that it is appropriate for well dressed, clean cut men.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the price was right!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, and it has a pleasant citrus scent.</li>
            <li>Love this product it brought back some good memories</li>
            <li>This one is very light in color compared to one purchased from macys, this is clear while macys has a very light honeyish color to it.  </li>
            <li>(no dirty thoughts people!)   </li>
            <li>Amazon price was just right!</li>
            <li>I totally love this cologne for one main reason it goes well with my chemistry!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon   :-)</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper and you get a lot more.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately itÂ´s going to run out some day, but is one of the most delicious perfumes i ever had.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>Smells good just not for so long.</li>
            <li>I actually like it BETTER!</li>
            <li>The smell is close but a lot lighter in essence, it seems watered down, the original used to be a very  strong one pump and good for the whole day type smell, this one from amazon needs to reaplied constantly throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly as usual for a great price.</li>
            <li>very very very very diluted.</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like the one my nephew had.</li>
            <li>Thanks much!</li>
            <li>Classic Tommy!</li>
            <li>As much as I like Tommy Girl, it is a bit heavy-scented, and often now gives me headaches.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Not much to say, it smells fantastic and the wife likes it!</li>
            <li>but doesnt really have a floral scent either.</li>
            <li>But very suspicious, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying here, I believe it was discontinued</li>
            <li>buy one at CVS and is really different.&lt;br /&gt;Please return the money.</li>
            <li>i really regret it</li>
            <li>I was running low of original</li>
            <li>I was looking for Tommy Freedom originally and finally ending with this one.</li>
            <li>I feel more weak, the arome its nice, the same but no too stroong</li>
            <li>Now I am a married father of two and 35 years old....</li>
            <li>I like this because after spray smell will be with you all day long and gives us fresh feeling through out the day, My wife like this smell very much from me.</li>
            <li>but they still pop up sometimes at marshall s, Ross, perfumanias, tjmax from time to time and those are still in the older looking box I trust.</li>
            <li>I started using this cologne when I was in Junior High.  </li>
            <li>And I have had more than a few come up to me and stick there</li>
            <li>However this is the LARGE size and seems as if it will last forever.</li>
            <li>But even though this smells totally different from Tommy Jeans, I really like this as well.  </li>
            <li>I bought direct from Amazon, they had it in stock.</li>
            <li>I recommend this scent to anybody that loves the old school colognes.</li>
            <li>I usually wear Tommy (for men) for daytime, and Tommy Girl for special evenings out.</li>

            <li> This product is not genuine, not original, not the original smell.</li>
            <li> Hard to beat a classic especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Typical Tommy Cologne with big bottle which can last a long time.</li>
            <li> Very weak staying power compared to original.</li>
            <li> and I wish I would&#x27;ve bought it a long time ago!</li>
            <li> Glass bottle looks the same, stickers on bottom of bottles completely different , the box is different, but could just be for updated look not sure.  </li>
            <li> The descriptions given in the webpage fits as its expected.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money at a local department store.  </li>
            <li> Just fyi for other AP accts.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried it wouldn&#x27;t get to house  by Christmas, but it was at our door in 3 days.  </li>
            <li> A little disapointed because it does say its a Cologne Spray even though I know it pics a toilette spray</li>
            <li> and I wear it almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne expecting the typical small or medium size bottle for the money.</li>
            <li> I usually wear Tommy Girl spray cologne.</li>
            <li> It brings back that nostalgic feel from the 90&#x27;s which just happens to be the era I come from.</li>
            <li> I would drink this stuff if I wasnt afraid of it poisoning me.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Tommy!</li>
            <li> this is the worst Tommy Hilfiger that i have ever used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Like the Smell, will buy it again for sure</li>
            <li> bought this for a Christmas present and it was just what the receiver wanted. Smells great.</li>
            <li> Brand new, packaged, in box :) and smells delicious!</li>
            <li> Amazon price was just right!</li>
            <li> Product as described,fast shipper!!</li>
            <li> I usually wear Tommy Girl spray cologne. I accidentally picked up Tommy in a store (it was mixed with women&#x27;s cologne), thinking I was buying Tommy Girl. I actually like it BETTER! I think it can be a non-gender specific cologne. It&#x27;s not heavy, and it has a pleasant citrus scent. Very refreshing and light.  It&#x27;s now my cologne of choice. As much as I like Tommy Girl, it is a bit heavy-scented, and often now gives me headaches. Tommy (for men) doesn&#x27;t. I usually wear Tommy (for men) for daytime, and Tommy Girl for special evenings out.</li>
            <li> I order this every year at Christmas for my brother and nephew. They both love it.</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like the one my nephew had. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. This was a great deal and fast shipping as well. Thanks Amazon   :-)</li>
            <li> great product.  comes sealed in a box, just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the price was right!</li>
            <li> Wife loves this stinky stuff.  Great value.</li>
            <li> Classic Tommy! Lasts forever it seems...</li>
            <li> I meant to order Tommy \\&quot;Jeans\\&quot; cologne.  Accidentally ordered the regular Tommy.  I was upset when I recieved it in the mail.  But even though this smells totally different from Tommy Jeans, I really like this as well.  Its one of my favorite... so I&#x27;m glad now that I bought it accidentally!</li>
            <li> This gift was a last minute decision for Christmas for my husband.  Tommy is one of his favorite colognes.  When he mentioned that he wanted some, I had already finished shopping.  So I quickly got on-line and found the best price on Amazon!  I was a little worried it wouldn&#x27;t get to house  by Christmas, but it was at our door in 3 days.  Couldn&#x27;t have asked for better service!  Thanks Amazon!![[ASIN:B0012RR2DS Tommy Bahama By Tommy Bahama For Men. Aftershave 3.4-Ounces]]</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Tommy! Great price and love the smell on my husband!</li>
            <li> The price was great, but the smell is not as good as the retail store... I feel more weak, the arome its nice, the same but no too stroong</li>
            <li> QuizÃ¡s quisiste decir: buen producto y llegÃ³ al tiempo estimado&lt;br /&gt;good products and arrive at the estimated time</li>
            <li> I like this because after spray smell will be with you all day long and gives us fresh feeling through out the day, My wife like this smell very much from me.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, it smells fantastic and the wife likes it! I&#x27;ll give the product 5 stars.  One last thing, I purchased it under my Amazon Prime acct but the seller didn&#x27;t ship it two day air. Just fyi for other AP accts.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband as a Christmas gift and I absolutely love it.  Very light and sexy scent</li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne expecting the typical small or medium size bottle for the money. However this is the LARGE size and seems as if it will last forever. I bought direct from Amazon, they had it in stock. Delivered quickly as usual for a great price. Perfect!</li>

            <li> Hubby loves it! Me too!</li>

            <li> The descriptions given in the webpage fits as its expected. The case and the product came good, no damage presented at all.</li>
            <li> A little disapointed because it does say its a Cologne Spray even though I know it pics a toilette spray but reviews say its a cologne spray ...there&#x27;s a diff. Smells good just not for so long. It&#x27;s legit but not cologne spray.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money at a local department store.  Buy it here and save.  It is much cheaper and you get a lot more.  I wont say anything about the scent because that is all a matter of opinion.</li>
            <li> Good purchase came fast</li>
            <li> Great daily colonel, great sent yet not over powering .</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, smells great.  My son loves it.</li>
            <li> I was given this cologne as a gift and fell in love with it. I would drink this stuff if I wasnt afraid of it poisoning me. Tommy to me(everyone&#x27;s opinions are different)is a fragrance that is very clean and refined. I feel that it is appropriate for well dressed, clean cut men. It doesnt have a musky smell to it such as English Leather (shuttering at the thought wearing that...) but doesnt really have a floral scent either. I would say it reminds me of most of Tommy Hilfiger&#x27;s line of cologne, but between the two brands, I get more compliments on this one. And I have had more than a few come up to me and stick there faces to wherever I put my cologne (no dirty thoughts people!)   I dont know how anyone can not like the smell, but maybe its just me...</li>
            <li> Well i bought this cologne for my bf for christmas...it costed me 40.00$ for the 3.4 ounce bottle...and he loved it....it smells wonderful ...i love it too</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well packaged. This smells great on my husband. Light, clean and warm fragrance. Hope they don&#x27;t stop making it like Goodlife.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift - he loved it, but I already knew he would as it was a request.</li>
            <li> this cologne smell so good girls love if you want a good cologne for a good price buy this cologne</li>
            <li> me encanta este perfume, y ahora lo tengo como uno de mis favoritos para ocasiones especiales, llego en muy buen estado y rapido</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years.  This is the third or fourth bottle that I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon.  You can&#x27;t beat their prices compared to a department store.  This is the only fragrance I wear.</li>
            <li> Great price..see you soon</li>
            <li> I totally love this cologne for one main reason it goes well with my chemistry! It brings back that nostalgic feel from the 90&#x27;s which just happens to be the era I come from. I had this cologne back in the day and didn&#x27;t purchase again until recently and I wish I would&#x27;ve bought it a long time ago! Just today got multiple compliments. I had a coworker of mine tell me not to get to close that she might eat me lol I recommend this scent to anybody that loves the old school colognes.</li>
            <li> i bought it for my brother, he like it ^_~</li>
            <li> Excelente compra, no tengo nada que decir con respecto al producto y el manejo del mismo dentro de USA, en cambio por parte del despacho dentro de Venezuela pÃ©simo, tarda mucho tiempo en llegar y esto por culpa del sistema de aduana de nuestro paÃ­s.</li>
            <li> This cologne is great, smells great, last all day, very happy with this buy.</li>
            <li> Great price for a large amount. So happy with this product and it&#x27;s delivery</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it was not included in my &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; account but got here in two days. Tommy is my go to product and I wear it almost everyday.  Going forward, I&#x27;ll use this company more often when ordering.</li>
            <li> NIce Fragance.. Loved it</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s Great! I Liked</li>
            <li> The price was good and the delivery was even better.  Thanks much!</li>
            <li> Love this product it brought back some good memories</li>
            <li> This is a great product and a great price!  I was happy that I received my shipment well before Christmas!  I</li>
            <li> Bought this cause I was running low of original I had bought and stored away from macys a while ago.  This one is very light in color compared to one purchased from macys, this is clear while macys has a very light honeyish color to it.  The smell is close but a lot lighter in essence, it seems watered down, the original used to be a very  strong one pump and good for the whole day type smell, this one from amazon needs to reaplied constantly throughout the day. Very weak staying power compared to original. Glass bottle looks the same, stickers on bottom of bottles completely different , the box is different, but could just be for updated look not sure.  But very suspicious, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying here, I believe it was discontinued but they still pop up sometimes at marshall s, Ross, perfumanias, tjmax from time to time and those are still in the older looking box I trust.</li>
            <li> I started using this cologne when I was in Junior High.  The ladies loved it :) Now I am a married father of two and 35 years old....my wife and boys still buy this for me.  They love it and I do too!  Hard to beat a classic especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I was looking for Tommy Freedom originally and finally ending with this one. Typical Tommy Cologne with big bottle which can last a long time. Considering the price this is a good pick.</li>
            <li> This product is not genuine, not original, not the original smell. Please return the money.&lt;br /&gt;I buy one at CVS and is really different.&lt;br /&gt;Please return the money. asp</li>
            <li> this is the worst Tommy Hilfiger that i have ever used. have been using this product for years but this one is nothing like the Tommy hilfiger that i use. very very very very diluted. i really regret it</li>
            <li> Made a great gift, fast shipping! Happy!</li>
            <li> I had this cologne over ten years ago; Tommy smelled good then and it stil smells wonderful now! I will definitely use this come spring and summer!</li>
            <li> muy buen producto. el perfume es exactamente lo que describe la publicacion. la entrega fue inmediata. sin tantas palabras, cubrio las espectativas</li>
