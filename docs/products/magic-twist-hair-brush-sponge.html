            <li>The more you do it the better the results, as with most things in life</li>

            <li>actually more than half.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In the morning I am in a hurry and Using this will take more time than with My sponge.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>also be sure to wash it before using it</li>
            <li>Okay product.</li>
            <li>and I love the curls that it gives my hair.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to hold curls the way I want to.</li>
            <li>Does more of a twist look then curls.</li>
            <li>Magic Twist Hair Brush Sponge was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>so he didn&#x27;t have to continue to put s curl products in his hair and the Magic</li>
            <li>Would have been better if i give it to charity instead of thoa</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>The sponge will start to break off after so many uses but its a sponge so what do you expect.</li>
            <li>With the affordable price I will just buy a couple more when I can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>

            <li>Saw the barber use this on my daughter and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s hsrd to manage but the sponge makes my hair appear more volumous and gives it character.</li>
            <li>Ok product, will need more rolls to get the dreads</li>
            <li>I suppose, maybe this is better suited for those with shorter hair.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have received more compliments since I start using it.</li>

            <li>This is the exact same brush that my barber uses &amp; it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cool with that.</li>
            <li>My nephew has a tighter curl pattern and ends with really cool twists.</li>
            <li>like this product but just not as good as the method I&#x27;m currently using.http://imagecdn-1.findnsave.com/199/6947393-420</li>
            <li>Quality is nice, and it held up well so far.</li>
            <li>but I do get a head full of curls because of my hair grade I think</li>
            <li>It really makes the hair look better</li>
            <li>OK,First this is not a bad product.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Magic Twist Hair Sponge Brush is more durable and low costing compared to its competitors.</li>
            <li>super nice,met all my needs</li>
            <li>but it tore up to quick.</li>
            <li>Got it quicker than expected, works amazing will probably purchase a couple more</li>
            <li>Decent of brand product but the nudred is definitely better.</li>
            <li>I will use super glue to just attach it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty good sponge, I like better then the other ones , I have the south of France haircut</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing , I have nappy hair and when I use curl moisturizer I barely get curls</li>
            <li>Really good for hair that&#x27;s not too long.</li>
            <li>my son love his new brush</li>
            <li>Love my curls new</li>
            <li>Thanks Bee Sales!!</li>
            <li>This brush really works!!</li>
            <li>I was going to return it but thought it wasn&#x27;t worth the time for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>Had it for a lil over two months rarely used</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is more natural</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised and helps me get a pretty good curl going with only this and Cantu Twist and Loc gel.</li>
            <li>Worked just as I had intended and was delivered super fast!</li>
            <li>, durability wise the thing is almost falling apart from use of 8 time Other than that.</li>
            <li>This product does just the trick with the right amount of spritz applied beforehand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, and I&#x27;ve received multiple compliments on my hair &amp; asked where I got it from.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t speak on product longevity since I have used only a couple of days,  but for such great results, it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my son since his hair is cut kind of like in a thick Mohawk with the faded sides and he wanted his hair on top to be curly instead of just in an afro-like style.  </li>
            <li>i love this product .it creates instant coils and curls when u use it with cream</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>hmm NOT SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to start getting dreads</li>
            <li>love this sponge, i definitely will be ordering again</li>
            <li>Item worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li>product did exactly what i ordered it for.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon !&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m am extremely satisfied with this product, and would definitely order again.</li>
            <li>It worked well at first but after using it 3 or 4 times it started coming apart and the sponge started flaking off into my hair and onto NY shoulders and now has spots of sponge ripped off.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>*)</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>I ordered it for my son after I took him to get his hair shaped and tapered and his barber surprised us with the new style:)</li>
            <li>still works for the purpose i intended, however, I expected for it to be more durable &amp; not wear/tear as quickly.</li>
            <li>The twists look real crisp and professional.</li>
            <li>The product does exactly what you expect it to do very well.</li>
            <li>This was a gift, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s was a good buy.....</li>
            <li>Hair has to be a certain length to use.</li>
            <li>I like the new look that it adds to my Mohawk!!</li>
            <li>Amazing how such a simple idea could simplify my styling routine.</li>
            <li>Worked very well curly &amp; a design.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy another one very soon</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It works well and works fast.</li>
            <li>This item is very durable.</li>
            <li>They work very well, and came as announced .</li>
            <li>The product worked really well.</li>
            <li>But the way this has my hair looking when my taper is on point, I have to say, it is the real MVP.</li>
            <li>and then in a fast twirl the twists/curl come in.  </li>
            <li>It worked really well.</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>Bought this for my son he really likes it.</li>
            <li>Works very well on TWA&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>delivery came fast.</li>
            <li>It works very well on kinky hair</li>
            <li>DO NOT Brush it too Fast if do any of these</li>
            <li>boyfriend liked it, only last about 2 months</li>
            <li>My Opinion over all this is a good concept and idea however if you are a guy and have a hair style medium length hair where its faded or low tapered on the side similar to Usher old cut</li>
            <li>The Magic Twist Brush Sponge not only came a day early, but it does the trick.</li>
            <li>It came early and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>This really works, definitely would recommend it more than the larger ones sold online.</li>
            <li>They look more like curls or twists but with beeswax I will go back and twist them individually.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended 😌👌🏾</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for anyone who&#x27;s trying to achieve the spiked/dreaded look.</li>
            <li>I have really high hair</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and not very dense..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for natural beauties!!</li>
            <li>Great value over the expensive Nudreds product.</li>
            <li>So I have been using a lot of products by Shea Moisture and Dark and Lovely (natural products).</li>
            <li>Its worth it because all sponges will do the same no matter the brand.</li>
            <li>Brush it in a circular normal motion 4th.</li>
            <li>Right now, you can buy a similar product for up to 30 dollars.</li>
            <li>You definitely want damp hair, but if twist is what you&#x27;re looking for, you&#x27;re in the right place.</li>
            <li>So here is what I did first of all if you have extremely soft, straight, low, bald headed, chemically permed, and</li>
            <li>The key is to get your hair moisturized properly and use light pressure with your circular motion.</li>
            <li>I had to wash it first though because it was leaving white stuff (pieces of sponge I don&#x27;t know) on my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick with a loose curl pattern, so I end up with more defined curls instead of true twists.</li>
            <li>I am a male w/ 4c natural hair &amp; have searched for years to find a product that produces curls in a certain style (even a texturizer -_-) .</li>
            <li>So far is holding up well</li>
            <li>However, I prefer a natural curl to a twirl.</li>
            <li>Very god on short hair</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do the job, although my hair is short and not that much</li>
            <li>Just started wearing my hair natural.</li>
            <li>natural curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It actually works very well.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks and the top piece with the logo that is connected to the sponge has started to separate.</li>
            <li>The sponge twists his hair nicely, without looking sloppy.</li>
            <li>My hair is afro with a little white mixed in, but mostly afro.</li>
            <li>worked exactly how i expected.</li>
            <li>It does coils my hair but it is much loser than with the sponge going in the same direction for the same amount of time.</li>
            <li>I just use a spray bottle of water and apply a small amount of gel to my son&#x27;s hair and it makes nice little curls in his hair.</li>
            <li>Gave it to my friend with a short natural cut.  </li>
            <li>and it will still work just as fine as the other expensive special creams.</li>
            <li>had this product a few weeks and so far it is holding up very well with no signs of coming apart.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a way to curl your without spending major money and using lots of product , then this is definitely the product for you !</li>
            <li>This is one of the few hair brush sponges I saw that has a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>African American with short natural kinky hair.  </li>
            <li>Started falling apart after first few uses.</li>
            <li>It did its job in curling my natural hair but it also caused me to get single strand knots.</li>
            <li>this could be normal due to the amount of time Ive had the sponge, but I&#x27;m unsure.</li>
            <li>Do not get this sponge, pure waste of money.</li>

            <li> My nephew has a tighter curl pattern and ends with really cool twists.</li>
            <li> like this product but just not as good as the method I&#x27;m currently using.http://imagecdn-1.findnsave.com/199/6947393-420</li>
            <li> Quality is nice, and it held up well so far.</li>
            <li> but I do get a head full of curls because of my hair grade I think</li>
            <li> It really makes the hair look better</li>
            <li> OK,First this is not a bad product.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will do and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Magic Twist Hair Sponge Brush is more durable and low costing compared to its competitors.</li>
            <li> super nice,met all my needs</li>
            <li> but it tore up to quick.</li>
            <li> Got it quicker than expected, works amazing will probably purchase a couple more</li>
            <li> Decent of brand product but the nudred is definitely better.</li>
            <li> I will use super glue to just attach it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty good sponge, I like better then the other ones , I have the south of France haircut</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing , I have nappy hair and when I use curl moisturizer I barely get curls</li>
            <li> Really good for hair that&#x27;s not too long.</li>
            <li> my son love his new brush</li>
            <li> Love my curls new</li>
            <li> Thanks Bee Sales!!</li>
            <li> This brush really works!!</li>
            <li> I was going to return it but thought it wasn&#x27;t worth the time for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Had it for a lil over two months rarely used</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is more natural</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised and helps me get a pretty good curl going with only this and Cantu Twist and Loc gel.</li>
            <li> Worked just as I had intended and was delivered super fast!</li>
            <li> , durability wise the thing is almost falling apart from use of 8 time Other than that.</li>
            <li> This product does just the trick with the right amount of spritz applied beforehand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, and I&#x27;ve received multiple compliments on my hair &amp; asked where I got it from.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t speak on product longevity since I have used only a couple of days,  but for such great results, it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my son since his hair is cut kind of like in a thick Mohawk with the faded sides and he wanted his hair on top to be curly instead of just in an afro-like style.  </li>
            <li> i love this product .it creates instant coils and curls when u use it with cream</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> hmm NOT SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to start getting dreads</li>
            <li> love this sponge, i definitely will be ordering again</li>
            <li> Item worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li> product did exactly what i ordered it for.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon !&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am extremely satisfied with this product, and would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> It worked well at first but after using it 3 or 4 times it started coming apart and the sponge started flaking off into my hair and onto NY shoulders and now has spots of sponge ripped off.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> *)</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my son after I took him to get his hair shaped and tapered and his barber surprised us with the new style:)</li>
            <li> still works for the purpose i intended, however, I expected for it to be more durable &amp; not wear/tear as quickly.</li>
            <li> The twists look real crisp and professional.</li>
            <li> The product does exactly what you expect it to do very well.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s was a good buy.....</li>
            <li> Hair has to be a certain length to use.</li>
            <li> I like the new look that it adds to my Mohawk!!</li>
            <li> Amazing how such a simple idea could simplify my styling routine.</li>
            <li> Worked very well curly &amp; a design.</li>

            <li> They work very well, and came as announced .</li>
            <li> The product worked really well.</li>
            <li> But the way this has my hair looking when my taper is on point, I have to say, it is the real MVP.</li>
            <li> and then in a fast twirl the twists/curl come in.  </li>
            <li> It worked really well.</li>
            <li> Works really well</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son he really likes it.</li>

            <li> delivery came fast.</li>
            <li> It works very well on kinky hair</li>
            <li> DO NOT Brush it too Fast if do any of these</li>
            <li> boyfriend liked it, only last about 2 months</li>
            <li> My Opinion over all this is a good concept and idea however if you are a guy and have a hair style medium length hair where its faded or low tapered on the side similar to Usher old cut</li>
            <li> The Magic Twist Brush Sponge not only came a day early, but it does the trick.</li>
            <li> It came early and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> This really works, definitely would recommend it more than the larger ones sold online.</li>
            <li> They look more like curls or twists but with beeswax I will go back and twist them individually.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended 😌👌🏾</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for anyone who&#x27;s trying to achieve the spiked/dreaded look.</li>
            <li> I have really high hair</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and not very dense..</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for natural beauties!!</li>
            <li> Great value over the expensive Nudreds product.</li>
            <li> So I have been using a lot of products by Shea Moisture and Dark and Lovely (natural products).</li>
            <li> Its worth it because all sponges will do the same no matter the brand.</li>
            <li> Brush it in a circular normal motion 4th.</li>
            <li> Right now, you can buy a similar product for up to 30 dollars.</li>
            <li> You definitely want damp hair, but if twist is what you&#x27;re looking for, you&#x27;re in the right place.</li>
            <li> So here is what I did first of all if you have extremely soft, straight, low, bald headed, chemically permed, and</li>
            <li> The key is to get your hair moisturized properly and use light pressure with your circular motion.</li>
            <li> I had to wash it first though because it was leaving white stuff (pieces of sponge I don&#x27;t know) on my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick with a loose curl pattern, so I end up with more defined curls instead of true twists.</li>
            <li> I am a male w/ 4c natural hair &amp; have searched for years to find a product that produces curls in a certain style (even a texturizer -_-) .</li>
            <li> So far is holding up well</li>
            <li> However, I prefer a natural curl to a twirl.</li>
            <li> Very god on short hair</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do the job, although my hair is short and not that much</li>
            <li> Just started wearing my hair natural.</li>
            <li> natural curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It actually works very well.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks and the top piece with the logo that is connected to the sponge has started to separate.</li>
            <li> The sponge twists his hair nicely, without looking sloppy.</li>
            <li> My hair is afro with a little white mixed in, but mostly afro.</li>
            <li> worked exactly how i expected.</li>
            <li> It does coils my hair but it is much loser than with the sponge going in the same direction for the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> I just use a spray bottle of water and apply a small amount of gel to my son&#x27;s hair and it makes nice little curls in his hair.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my friend with a short natural cut.  </li>
            <li> and it will still work just as fine as the other expensive special creams.</li>
            <li> had this product a few weeks and so far it is holding up very well with no signs of coming apart.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a way to curl your without spending major money and using lots of product , then this is definitely the product for you !</li>
            <li> This is one of the few hair brush sponges I saw that has a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> African American with short natural kinky hair.  </li>
            <li> Started falling apart after first few uses.</li>
            <li> It did its job in curling my natural hair but it also caused me to get single strand knots.</li>
            <li> this could be normal due to the amount of time Ive had the sponge, but I&#x27;m unsure.</li>
            <li> Do not get this sponge, pure waste of money.</li>
            <li> My son loves this doesn&#x27;t take long for results</li>
            <li> Definitely works as expected.  </li>
            <li> but i think my hair is too long.</li>
            <li> Other hair products can be combined with this product to help the process, but they are not necessary.</li>
            <li> It even came earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> Compared to other more expensive hair sponges on the market this one does the job extremely well and for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> He start out by washing his hair, letting it completely dry then used a sheen on it</li>
            <li> This item is low cost compared to half of its competitors.  </li>
            <li> It actually does work was skeptical at first but</li>
            <li> It sis the same concept as NuDread but half the price</li>
            <li> I tore half of it off while trying to put it back into the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen products similar to this one online, but it seems to work just as well as the competitors, for less than 1/2 the price</li>
            <li> With a little moisturizer,  his curls are extremely defined and long lasting.</li>
            <li> He has typical African American hair- thick and coarse.</li>
            <li> I am a black male with extremely curly hair</li>
            <li> Delivered a day earlier than expected and costs less than some other brands.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected</li>
            <li> Results as expected.</li>
            <li> Not very durable but gets the job done</li>
            <li> Performs as expected.  </li>
            <li> Does not seem like it would hold up to constant heavy duty usage.</li>
            <li> Item worked as expected.</li>
            <li> Not a very durable product.</li>
            <li> Took a little too long to arrive</li>
            <li> I have bought other hair sponge brushes, but they all have torn or fell apart in some way or form.</li>
            <li> other products are needed in combination&lt;</li>
            <li> other products are needed in combination&lt;</li>
            <li> He has very low porosity thick hair that is about half an inch long.</li>
            <li> I just add a little pink hair lotion to my hair and pick it out before twisting.</li>
            <li> Brush your hair in a circular motion for 15 minutes for your twist to appear, DO NOT brush the sponge in a circular opposite direction, DO NOT brush it too hard.</li>
            <li> This product was a game changer for me as far as styling wis concerned.</li>
            <li> The material is alright wearing down.</li>
            <li> Just think to yourself, would you rather buy this and have it break down in a couple of months?</li>
            <li> Received items on time, with no fuss but it presses your hair down and coils, instead of curls.</li>
            <li> The hair sponge twists and curls your hair in less than 5</li>
            <li> Twists were formed in less than 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm on my black hair.</li>
            <li> When my son used it on his hair it  instantly made little curly twist!!!</li>
            <li> Broke in half after a few days.</li>
            <li> Gives little curl dreads just like I wanted.  </li>
            <li> and my boys use it everyday..</li>
            <li> I used the cantu twist and and curl product with water, to make the curls defined, but that product dried up my hair.</li>
            <li> and I dont need harsh chemicals like</li>
            <li> I bought the sponge so that my son could twist his hair of I&#x27;m not available to do it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your  money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked how well and fast</li>
            <li> This was the most terrible gadget I ever invested in.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the durability of this product.</li>
            <li> The holes were too small.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable works great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it would work with all grains of hair</li>
            <li> Too small &amp; don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Bought to replace the Curlsponge and it is not only less expensive but holds up way longer!</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing :(</li>
            <li> Add cold water to your palm and rub it on the sponge brush 3rd.</li>
            <li> The hair sponge brush is used to curl and style thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic difference in creating twists with this brush vs. doing it by hand.  </li>
            <li> I have to tell you I was so skeptical about this</li>
            <li> Gives my hair a curly twisted look that people compliment.</li>
            <li> Repeat the same process until your hair is fully twisted all up!!!!!</li>
            <li> works just like the expensive one !</li>
            <li> but the pictures doesn&#x27;t do any justice) and the sponge brush is atrocious man</li>
            <li> #34;Don&#x27;t be disappointed when this does not work&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> ... WRONG!!</li>
            <li> and I notice were the sponge part tore away from the base</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> Terrible...just terrible.  </li>

            <li> This is amazing!!! My hairdresser used something similar when I cut my hair off. I immediately had to find it . Glad I did! My  twist are on point!!!</li>
            <li> EVERY BODY LOVES THIS</li>
            <li> worked exactly how i expected. I had to wash it first though because it was leaving white stuff (pieces of sponge I don&#x27;t know) on my hair. After I washed it, it worked like a charm!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Awesome product delivered as promised.</li>

            <li> a must have product. I&#x27;ll buy another one very soon</li>
            <li> The product works perfectly. I bought this item for my son and he loves it! Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave any &amp;#34;spongy&amp;#34; product as some others do (per comments I&#x27;ve read).</li>
            <li> This was the most terrible gadget I ever invested in. I looked like I was caught in a windstorm. I was going to return it but thought it wasn&#x27;t worth the time for the price I paid. Hope I never fall for a product like this again.</li>
            <li> My son loves this sponge</li>
            <li> This product was a game changer for me as far as styling wis concerned. It worked so easily. The key is to get your hair moisturized properly and use light pressure with your circular motion. The product itself is of great quality.  I have had it only a couple of days but it seems sturdy.  Great value over the expensive Nudreds product. Im very happy to have this as a quick styling option.</li>
            <li> does exactly what it says its going to do love it</li>
            <li> It works very well.  However, I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks and the top piece with the logo that is connected to the sponge has started to separate. Not sure about the durability of this product.</li>
            <li> This sponge brush creates twists in your hair just as advertised. Actually better than I thought. I was a bit skeptical because I didn&#x27;t know how rubbing/rotating a sponge on your hair creates curls and twists, but I&#x27;m glad that it works so well. Depending on your type of hair, it can create curls even without the use of hair products.&lt;br /&gt;I had this product a few weeks and so far it is holding up very well with no signs of coming apart. This is one of the few hair brush sponges I saw that has a very reasonable price. I bought one for my nephew also. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> it works and it is great for my natural hair</li>
            <li> Great did exactly what I wanted to do.</li>
            <li> excellent product - arrived on time and makes my haor look fabulous!! Thanks Bee Sales!!</li>

            <li> Brush is Great i use it all the time!!!</li>
            <li> Only takes 5 min. each morning to twist your hair with this. I just add a little pink hair lotion to my hair and pick it out before twisting.</li>
            <li> This product is good😄</li>
            <li> Worked perfect for my 2 sons!!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Took a little too long to arrive but it&#x27;s just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It works well and works fast.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT &amp; FAST SHIPPING!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and Service</li>
            <li> Not seeing the perfect twist as advertised. My hair is afro with a little white mixed in, but mostly afro. The sponge does make the hair curly, curlier than if I used my hand to prep it. Overall, happier with the curlier hair, but not with the perfect twist claim.</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my son after I took him to get his hair shaped and tapered and his barber surprised us with the new style:) I LOVE IT:)! But I went an even cheaper route to. I bought a car sponge from Walmart for $1.76 and put some holes in it and it turned out WONDERFUL:)!</li>
            <li> I brought this for my wife and she loves it.  This is the easiest way to twist your hair</li>
            <li> I wrote this review to show how effective and useful the Magic Twist Hair Sponge Brush. This item is low cost compared to half of its competitors.  This item is very durable. I’ve had mine for 3 months and it has not came apart at all. The hair sponge brush is used to curl and style thick curly hair. This item defines the curves and makes them thicker and more visible. Other hair products can be combined with this product to help the process, but they are not necessary. This product, the Magic Twist Hair Sponge Brush, is used by brushing your hair with the hair sponge in a circular motion until all of the desired parts of your hair has curled. The hair sponge twists and curls your hair in less than 5 minutes!!&lt;br /&gt;The Magic Twist Hair Sponge Brush  can be also be looked up on You Tube were customers of this product have posted videos of how to use the hair sponge brush. There are before and after videos as well. Many of the YouTube videos are easy to follow and show how to use the Magic Twist Hair Sponge effectively. Here is a link that will show you vides of customers who have used the Magic Twist Hair Sponge Brush: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query&#x3D;magic+twist+hair+sponge+brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Magic Twist Hair Sponge Brush is more durable and low costing compared to its competitors. I have bought other hair sponge brushes, but they all have torn or fell apart in some way or form. This product is still as good as new after 3 months of use. Also, this brand of product is cheaper than all of its competitors. Right now, you can buy a similar product for up to 30 dollars. This product on Amazon is listed for 6 dollars. This is a huge price difference.&lt;br /&gt;In Conclusion, I believe anyone who purchases this product will be satisfied. If you are looking for a way to curl your without spending major money and using lots of product , then this is definitely the product for you ! I would recommend this brand and this specific product to everyone looking to accomplish the curl hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive-&lt;br /&gt;Small/compact&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than the competitors&lt;br /&gt;Durable&lt;br /&gt;No other products are needed in combination&lt;br /&gt;Quality Product&lt;br /&gt;Fast working product&lt;br /&gt;Fast shippingmplish the curl hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive-&lt;br /&gt;Small/compact&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than the competitors&lt;br /&gt;Durable&lt;br /&gt;No other products are needed in combination&lt;br /&gt;Quality Product&lt;br /&gt;Fast working product&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping</li>
            <li> So far is holding up well and my boys use it everyday.. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> It came early and was exactly what I ordered. When my son used it on his hair it  instantly made little curly twist!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected</li>
            <li> I like these sponges very much, and I&#x27;m glad I purchased them . They work very well, and came as announced .</li>
            <li> This product was Amazing. I noticed defined curls as soon as I used it. I used the cantu twist and and curl product with water, to make the curls defined, but that product dried up my hair. So I have been using a lot of products by Shea Moisture and Dark and Lovely (natural products). But this  is a great product and I would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> It does everything it is advertised as doing. I have noticed the type of twists also depends on your hair texture. My hair is thick with a loose curl pattern, so I end up with more defined curls instead of true twists. I&#x27;m cool with that. My nephew has a tighter curl pattern and ends with really cool twists. I&#x27;ve also found that my hair works better with the sponge if I don&#x27;t use any products or a dime size of curling products or oils.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s was a good buy.....but this is what the person requested, so I would assume it&#x27;s working out well for the user...</li>
            <li> Great item at a great price.  Works just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great product--it does a wonderful job!!!</li>
            <li> Quick and easy. Results as expected. P</li>
            <li> It actually does work was skeptical at first but glad I purchased</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing , I have nappy hair and when I use curl moisturizer I barely get curls or if I do they are frizzy. All I did was spray my hair with some conditioner and use this and boom instant curls bruh .</li>
            <li> My son loves this doesn&#x27;t take long for results</li>
            <li> This brush really works!! I bought this for my son and he LOVES it, goes everywhere with it ... LOL and it WORKS ... did I already say that??!! I have to tell you I was so skeptical about this and I told my son; &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t be disappointed when this does not work&amp;#34; ... WRONG!! works great on his hair.  Great product!! Will definitely buy again since he has just about worn this one out.</li>
            <li> boyfriend liked it, only last about 2 months</li>
            <li> Not very durable but gets the job done</li>
            <li> This product works great. I just use a spray bottle of water and apply a small amount of gel to my son&#x27;s hair and it makes nice little curls in his hair.</li>
            <li> The holes were too small.</li>
            <li> super nice,met all my needs</li>
            <li> Nice Brush but it tore up to quick. Had it for a lil over two months rarely used and I notice were the sponge part tore away from the base</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended 😌👌🏾</li>
            <li> The product worked really well. Twists were formed in less than 30 seconds. I&lt;br /&gt;definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> perfect! Gives little curl dreads just like I wanted.  I use this with a little hold product and vwala perfect curls.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my son...he loves it. The sponge twists his hair nicely, without looking sloppy.</li>
            <li> Love this for my son&#x27;s hair! His curl pattern is defined with the magic sponge! Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product and amazing results.  Very pleased and will order again.</li>
            <li> Really great product. The more you do it the better the results, as with most things in life lol. But the way this has my hair looking when my taper is on point, I have to say, it is the real MVP.</li>
            <li> Perfect and arrive real quick</li>
            <li> Did the sponge brush work....hmm NOT SO MUCH! Would not Recommend it.</li>
            <li> Terrible...just terrible.  Doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> It works but it was coming apart on one side when we opened it.. Quality not what I thought but son did not want to wait for another.. Ordered a different one.. Guess the price on this one was a red flag..</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Great product I would recommend it to anybody who&#x27;s interested.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son.  Works great!  He loves it!</li>
            <li> African American with short natural kinky hair.  Great for adding texture.  Highly recommend for natural beauties!!</li>
            <li> Best thing since sliced bread it&#x27;s AMAZING</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be a gimmick, but after looking at several YouTube videos I bought this for my son to use because he was looking for something to keep his hair curled once it dries. This does it for him! He has very low porosity thick hair that is about half an inch long. This holds the curls once you use it, whether you use some type of holding spray/cream or not.I can see that it would not work for all hair types, but for my son&#x27;s needs it was perfect!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my son....he doesn&#x27;t leave home without it!  Swirling and Twisting his hair.</li>
            <li> Got it quicker than expected, works amazing will probably purchase a couple more</li>
            <li> Works well. I don&#x27;t that it will last. The material is alright wearing down.</li>
            <li> This sponge works great. It does exactly what it says it will do and is easy to use.  Delivered a day earlier than expected and costs less than some other brands. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great. However the longer your hair gets the more difficult it is.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for my son.  He loves it.  He start out by washing his hair, letting it completely dry then used a sheen on it and then in a fast twirl the twists/curl come in.  This is amazing.  I plan on ordering another one!</li>
            <li> Tends to not work properly after a two weeks or so the sponge itself begins to wear off</li>
            <li> My son loves the sponge and it works great on his hair. The sponge does what it says. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Timely shipping.  Performs as expected.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Works great on my son&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> Definitely works as expected.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great buying more next week</li>
            <li> My son is 6. I let his hair grow a couple months and he wanted dreads. I ordered this and some locking cream. It worked really well. I did a clockwise motion for about twenty minutes. They look more like curls or twists but with beeswax I will go back and twist them individually. But the sponge did it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Very useful the sponge works for exactly what is says I really love it</li>
            <li> My son loves this sponge.</li>
            <li> Smaller than i thought it would be. Works really well but i think my hair is too long. Makes perfect twist</li>
            <li> Worked just as I had intended and was delivered super fast! Great product and seller, will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on mixed race hair. Did absolutely nothing :(</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it said it would Good Product!</li>
            <li> It did its job in curling my natural hair but it also caused me to get single strand knots. I have stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Came on time and does what it says.</li>
            <li> Great product!!  Works beautifully!!!  Good quality, performs well.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! It effortlessly twist hair</li>
            <li> First time I tried it, it was great, then after the first couple weeks, it started to break apart, but it&#x27;s still usable. If I was looking for a sponge for culrs, I would highly recommend, Premium Hair Sponge / Brush For Dreads &amp; Afros, Coils &amp; Magic Twists by cherir, great product, and 5.0 out of 5.0 rating by 141 people counting. Just think to yourself, would you rather buy this and have it break down in a couple of months? Or buy cherir, and have it last years? I know if I had the choice, I would&#x27;ve bought Cherir instead of this product.</li>
            <li> Works great. Instant mini-twists.</li>
            <li> Decent of brand product but the nudred is definitely better.</li>
            <li> It works well! It even came earlier than expected! Great product.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son becuase he had to have it, now several weeks later it sits on his dresser......  But it works well on his hair when used.</li>
            <li> it does the job no complaints</li>
            <li> The barber told my son about this item so I found and ordered it.  He loves it.  Works great for him.</li>
            <li> Fabulous and so easy to do</li>
            <li> Great product. Looks just like how its described in the picture.</li>
            <li> totally transformed my son&#x27;s hair - great price and a great hair tool!</li>
            <li> Love this thing!!!!  Quick and easy to use.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Great!!!!! Exactly what I needed to start getting dreads</li>
            <li> Works as described, great product.</li>
            <li> This brush worked wonders for my Son&#x27;s hair.  I would highly recommend it for anyone who&#x27;s trying to achieve the spiked/dreaded look.</li>
            <li> The sponge had a funky scent upon opening the case, also It&#x27;s not twisting properly..</li>
            <li> Got the job done. Does not seem like it would hold up to constant heavy duty usage. However, I prefer a natural curl to a twirl.</li>
            <li> I love it !!! It came in 2 days with my amazon prime, I used it with Hollywood olive cream and Eco styler I then rubbed for about 30 seconds for the look I wanted</li>
            <li> Works like a charm on my black hair. Thank you</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son he really likes it.</li>
            <li> Works great,  saves me a lot of time in the mornings.</li>
            <li> My son absolutely loves this sponge!!! His friends have purchased their own since they&#x27;ve seen the results of his.</li>
            <li> It worked my son loved it</li>
            <li> works on smaller curls</li>
            <li> This really works, definitely would recommend it more than the larger ones sold online.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my son.  Couldn&#x27;t believe it when I saw it but it gives him the curls and definition that he is looking for!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable works great!&lt;br /&gt;I love this sponge, i definitely will be ordering again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok product my curls pop more when I wash my hair and shake it.</li>
            <li> OK,First this is not a bad product. It sis the same concept as NuDread but half the price actually more than half.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a bath sponge witht he holes in them to get the coils and twist in my Faux Hawk/Mo Hawk/South of France hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;It is more natural and I dont need harsh chemicals like s-curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something that would give coils/twist easier than the sponge so, I tried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I am not satisfied with this product. It does coils my hair but it is much loser than with the sponge going in the same direction for the same amount of time. In the morning I am in a hurry and Using this will take more time than with My sponge.&lt;br /&gt;Also it is made of good material however the plastic back part where you hold with you hand isn&#x27;t attached to well. I tore half of it off while trying to put it back into the box. I was in a  hurry and just shoved it in but I did not aspect it to just come off so easily. I will use super glue to just attach it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In My Opinion over all this is a good concept and idea however if you are a guy and have a hair style medium length hair where its faded or low tapered on the side similar to Usher old cut then a simple bath sponge from Walmart for $2.50 will work fine,you will have to replace it maybe every 2-3month and also be sure to wash it before using it so pieces of sponge wont get in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product but just not as good as the method I&#x27;m currently using.http://imagecdn-1.findnsave.com/199/6947393-420</li>
            <li> Great product. Wirks with water and oil. Simple</li>
            <li> Item worked as expected.</li>
            <li> Works very well on TWA&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Very god on short hair</li>
            <li> Great product. Quality is nice, and it held up well so far. Works exactly as advertised and helps me get a pretty good curl going with only this and Cantu Twist and Loc gel.</li>
            <li> Works wonders with my twa...</li>
            <li> The best ever love it</li>
            <li> Does the job but it tore up in just a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> does a great job of giving hair a textured look.</li>
            <li> Item worked exactly as described. Will definitely be purchasing another one when needed!</li>
            <li> Okay product. Hair has to be a certain length to use.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, for sure! I&#x27;ve used it for about 6 weeks now as my hair has grown out and it keeps working great!</li>
            <li> Good product does what it is intended for. You definitely want damp hair, but if twist is what you&#x27;re looking for, you&#x27;re in the right place.</li>
            <li> The product does exactly what you expect it to do very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this sponge for my son. He absolutely loves it. It does exactly what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li> I bought the sponge so that my son could twist his hair of I&#x27;m not available to do it.  He loves it.  I still twist his hair but the sponge is perfect for those in between fixes.</li>
            <li> Love it , exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Its very easy to use and I love the curls that it gives my hair.</li>
            <li> product did exactly what i ordered it for. delivery came fast.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and not very dense.. I have never been able to hold curls the way I want to. The Magic Twist Brush Sponge not only came a day early, but it does the trick. Curls started forming instantly and they have lasted all day. I&#x27;ve seen products similar to this one online, but it seems to work just as well as the competitors, for less than 1/2 the price</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my son since his hair is cut kind of like in a thick Mohawk with the faded sides and he wanted his hair on top to be curly instead of just in an afro-like style.  This product does just the trick with the right amount of spritz applied beforehand.</li>
            <li> Does more of a twist look then curls. Not sure if it would work with all grains of hair</li>
            <li> Works well but after a while the pieces of sponge be fallin off</li>
            <li> i normally don&#x27;t write reviews for products, but I am VERY satisfied w/ this sponge ! I am a male w/ 4c natural hair &amp; have searched for years to find a product that produces curls in a certain style (even a texturizer -_-) . It&#x27;s very easy to use, and I&#x27;ve received multiple compliments on my hair &amp; asked where I got it from. Thanks Amazon !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*06/12/15 UPDATE* - i purchased this sponge in mid-March, it is now mid-June &amp; my sponge is gradually tearing apart. still works for the purpose i intended, however, I expected for it to be more durable &amp; not wear/tear as quickly. this could be normal due to the amount of time Ive had the sponge, but I&#x27;m unsure. still a fairly good product, but ive found a two-sided, cheaper sponge that I plan on replacing it w/ soon.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Gives my hair a curly twisted look that people compliment.</li>
            <li> Magic Twist Hair Brush Sponge was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> My son likes it a lot. Make his curly</li>
            <li> works well for the price</li>
            <li> Easy to use ...works like magic</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic difference in creating twists with this brush vs. doing it by hand.  Nice idea, but the jury is still out on this one.</li>
            <li> It does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> Just received and tested it out...I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this thing! I have a twa and 4b/c hair. I do wash and go&#x27;s regularly. Amazing how such a simple idea could simplify my styling routine. I will be using this daily from here on out!</li>
            <li> This  product is great. It works very well on kinky hair all you have to do is move in a circular motion and coils/twist are formed. Compared to other more expensive hair sponges on the market this one does the job extremely well and for a fraction of the price. I highly recommend this product I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace the Curlsponge and it is not only less expensive but holds up way longer!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband so he didn&#x27;t have to continue to put s curl products in his hair and the Magic twist hair brush sponge turned out to be the perfect replacement. He has typical African American hair- thick and coarse. With a little moisturizer,  his curls are extremely defined and long lasting. Wonderful product at an even better price.</li>
            <li> I dont get twist but I do get a head full of curls because of my hair grade I think</li>
            <li> Really good for hair that&#x27;s not too long.</li>
            <li> The barber shop not me into these. I like em.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it made my hair look. The curls were unbelievably nice. I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> Would have been better if i give it to charity instead of thoa</li>
            <li> Great product and it works wonderfully. Now I don&#x27;t have to watch t for my hair pattern to grow, I just use the sponge and my pattern is set</li>
            <li> Sponge does just what it promises to do.  I am really pleased with the results.  I wish I had come up with this invention.</li>
            <li> Love! Bring out the coils definitely recommended</li>
            <li> This was not the one my son wanted.  He doesn&#x27;t like it...  I don&#x27;t know the difference so I don&#x27;t know..</li>
            <li> This did not work AT ALL.  very disappointed. Will now use it as a bathroom sponge. Don&#x27;t waste your  money. Just take your hand  and rub it in a circular motion to get curls.  Do not get this sponge, pure waste of money.</li>
            <li> My son loves this brush. Curls his hair the way he likes!!</li>
            <li> Came already disconnected.</li>
            <li> Worked great and holds up...</li>
            <li> Great sponge and does the job, very fast shipping. The sponge will start to break off after so many uses but its a sponge so what do you expect. With the affordable price I will just buy a couple more when I can&#x27;t use it anymore. Its worth it because all sponges will do the same no matter the brand.</li>
            <li> It was great I love it</li>
            <li> works just like the expensive one !</li>
            <li> Love this sponge  Received a compliment from a stranger the first time out after use.  Can&#x27;t speak on product longevity since I have used only a couple of days,  but for such great results, it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Too small &amp; don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Works as described,good product. I bought this for my son and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. Whenever I want afro to twist I just use this &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> with a lil styling gel or softner(depends on your hair type) to help, this thing works wonders..if only i could give it 6 stars lol</li>
            <li> just the right size for my hand and hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked how well and fast this works to twist your hair! The twists look real crisp and professional. This item does work best on course hair and I would recommend the use of gel, but not necessary. I&#x27;m am extremely satisfied with this product, and would definitely order again. If you&#x27;re hesitant about ordering, just search YouTube and you&#x27;ll see that this works great.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Met all expectations</li>
            <li> Great tool to help facilitate curls.</li>
            <li> Absolutely FAST!!! I love this, what a transformation.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do the job, although my hair is short and not that much</li>
            <li> my son love his new brush</li>
            <li> Pretty good sponge, I like better then the other ones , I have the south of France haircut</li>
            <li> No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> It worked well at first but after using it 3 or 4 times it started coming apart and the sponge started flaking off into my hair and onto NY shoulders and now has spots of sponge ripped off. Not a very durable product.</li>
            <li> As Described. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Just started wearing my hair natural. Saw the barber use this on my daughter and fell in love with it. Had to have one. Love love love!!!</li>
            <li> This Twist Sponge Brush product is absolutely amazing you&#x27;d can see the results on my before &amp; after pictures(I added a variety of photos of different angles but the pictures doesn&#x27;t do any justice) and the sponge brush is atrocious man, durability wise the thing is almost falling apart from use of 8 time Other than that. If your not getting any result you&#x27;re not doing it correctly you heard? So here is what I did first of all if you have extremely soft, straight, low, bald headed, chemically permed, and damaged hair this is not going to work for you. 1st. You need some type of moisturizer for your hair I recommend cantu Shea butter twists &amp; lock 2nd. Add cold water to your palm and rub it on the sponge brush 3rd. Brush your hair in a circular motion for 15 minutes for your twist to appear, DO NOT brush the sponge in a circular opposite direction, DO NOT brush it too hard. DO NOT Brush it too Fast if do any of these Do Nots your twist will be diminished. Brush it in a circular normal motion 4th. Repeat the same process until your hair is fully twisted all up!!!!! &amp; I was getting compliments every where I go!</li>
            <li> This is the exact same brush that my barber uses &amp; it&#x27;s great. I like the new look that it adds to my Mohawk!! Great product.</li>
            <li> Yes it works. I am a black male with extremely curly hair that&#x27;s hsrd to manage but the sponge makes my hair appear more volumous and gives it character. Thanks! Will be ordering again</li>
            <li> Ok product, will need more rolls to get the dreads</li>
            <li> This product is great if u have about 1 inch of hair..it does not work well on anything longer and course hair</li>
            <li> Gave it to my friend with a short natural cut.  She really worked it like magic!!!!  AMAZING!!!  It helps to add generous amounts of slippery stuff to hair, like oil or olive oil gel</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Broke in half after a few days.</li>
            <li> I have really high hair I suppose, maybe this is better suited for those with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> This works great! I love it.</li>
            <li> Works Wonderful &amp; is cheaper compared to other Brands:*)</li>
            <li> Works great! Like the definition it gives to my hair. I have received more compliments since I start using it.</li>
            <li> It really makes the hair look better</li>
            <li> The product is perfect! This is exactly what I have been looking for. Love my curls new natural curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the shipping and packaging arrived early in great condition.</li>
            <li> It actually works very well. It had my hair in my desired style in no time.</li>
            <li> Received items on time, with no fuss but it presses your hair down and coils, instead of curls.</li>
            <li> excellent product, works exactly as described</li>
            <li> Happy with product. Received as scheduled.</li>
            <li> This product is great. You don&#x27;t need any special cream all you will need is some type of hairspray any kind and it will still work just as fine as the other expensive special creams.</li>
