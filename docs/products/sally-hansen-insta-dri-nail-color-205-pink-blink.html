            <li>This is my favorite nail polish color.</li>

            <li>It wears well, altho, I do try to not do dishes or anything for a couple hours at leaset {honestly more like the first day} to make sure everythings nice and tight.</li>
            <li>It dries so quickly.  </li>
            <li>The color is great, the polish dried quickly and stayed in tact for a reasonable time even though I did not use a top coat.</li>
            <li>just not what I was thinking in my head, I love my new color though</li>
            <li>but in the sunlight I noticed it&#x27;s more of interesting shade of brown and purple maybe grey.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and a I still love it!</li>
            <li>this is a very nice color!&lt;br /&gt;fast dry, easy , only one time on the nail is enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Two coats of this, and a good coat of Insta-Dri clear takes about 5 minutes total.  </li>
            <li>I love the shade, its a great neutral-- and different than the usual pinks and mauves that used to be a go to for a neutral nail.  </li>
            <li>The only thing was, I was expecting more of a coffee brown color.</li>
            <li>I love the insta dri line by Sally Hansen but this particular color chips easily in comparison to the other colors.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and looks pretty</li>
            <li>I use this color nail polish the most and add a clear coat in the same product line as a top coat for extra protection and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>Dries fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i really recommend it</li>
            <li>Dries fast.</li>
            <li>Went ahead and bought 4 of them, now my wife will have her new favorite color for a long time.</li>
            <li>It does look like a grey purple in some light</li>
            <li>Was working on second hand and smudged the polish on first hand</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how fast it dries and that you really do only need one coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be getting a few more of this brand in the future.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say I have a single complaint besides my own idea of what it was suppose to look like.</li>
            <li>I am not a patient person waiting for polish to dry so this really does the trick.</li>
            <li>Dry fast is a plus.</li>

            <li> Not this one, it takes 45secs to dry</li>

            <li> She told me that it was broken upon arrival.</li>
            <li> I normally hate painting my nails because polish takes forever to dry.</li>

            <li> This sure didn&#x27;t work for me.  Was working on second hand and smudged the polish on first hand, what a mess &amp;#34;dries in 60 seconds&amp;#34; wrong.  One coat coverage, I&#x27;ll give them that but after 2 days it is chipped off just about every nail and now will have to remove it.  A real disappointment for Sally Hansen.  I do love the colors bright and vibrant but junky polish.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like this color.</li>
            <li> did not like the color. Although trendy, it was not for me. I gave it four because I like Sally Hansen products and I have always been pleased with them.......</li>
            <li> I sent this to my Mom as a gift.  She told me that it was broken upon arrival.</li>
            <li> Love this polish, the brush is amazing</li>
            <li> I was super excited to use this color, and very happy that it came so fast. The only thing was, I was expecting more of a coffee brown color. It dries fast and looks pretty but in the sunlight I noticed it&#x27;s more of interesting shade of brown and purple maybe grey. Either way it looks like the picture just not what I was thinking in my head, I love my new color though and I can&#x27;t say I have a single complaint besides my own idea of what it was suppose to look like.</li>
            <li> Love the color. Dries fast.</li>
            <li> This product is really great, and it ;does what it says.  It dries so quickly.  I polish my nails more now than I ever have because of this product!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d end up writing a review for this but as nail polishes go this one is fantastic! I was pleasantly surprised at how fast it dries and that you really do only need one coat. The brush itself is also really cool - it&#x27;s a different shape and thickness to any other polish I have. I&#x27;ll be getting a few more of this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> I am not a patient person waiting for polish to dry so this really does the trick. I hope they come up with more colons. It&#x27;s a good durable product. The color is a little lighter than the picture.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color! Perfect!</li>
            <li> This color is like no other. It&#x27;s perfect especially with formal wear.</li>
            <li> Love it, already had one bottle, bought this one for my sister, she loves it!</li>
            <li> I normally hate painting my nails because polish takes forever to dry. Not this one, it takes 45secs to dry (yes, I&#x27;ve timed it). So, painting my nails is no longer a chore. However, it doesn&#x27;t have the longest wear. So, I do touch it up everyday, but to me that&#x27;s no biggie since it takes hardly anytime @ all. I highly suggest this if you hate waiting for your nails to dry!!!</li>
            <li> In the past, whenever I tried to do my nails myself there were always problems.  Something would occur between applying the nail polish and waiting for it to dry since I always ended up with smears, lines and other blemishes.  Before I actually went out to buy a nail drying machine, I decided to follow a friend&#x27;s advice and use this nail polish.  I was told it was a miracle worker but I had my doubts.  Consider me converted!  This nail polish is the best stuff ever!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One coat works for a lighter  version that appears almost see through but two coats makes it a solid color as displayed.  I ADORE this color and it&#x27;s very popular in the NYC area.  It applies evenly and dries within a minute (I give it two to be extra sure) and you are good to go.  I can pick up keys from inside my purse, change clothes and even style my hair without any fear of blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This nail polish is worth every cent!  I use this color nail polish the most and add a clear coat in the same product line as a top coat for extra protection and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> The color is great, the polish dried quickly and stayed in tact for a reasonable time even though I did not use a top coat.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick shipping. Item as described. Picture as described. Great product! Would purchase from again!</li>
            <li> I wore this nailpolish a lot throughout the fall. Its a very nice earthy tone, i have darker skin so this compemented my skin tone perfectly.Dry fast is a plus.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color.  I have about 15 of the sally hansen insta-dri polishes, and this is most definitely my favorite!  Two coats of this, and a good coat of Insta-Dri clear takes about 5 minutes total.  I love the shade, its a great neutral-- and different than the usual pinks and mauves that used to be a go to for a neutral nail.  It wears well, altho, I do try to not do dishes or anything for a couple hours at leaset {honestly more like the first day} to make sure everythings nice and tight. Great Great product!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it yet but color is awesome</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and a I still love it!</li>
            <li> this is a very nice color!&lt;br /&gt;fast dry, easy , only one time on the nail is enough.&lt;br /&gt;i really recommend it</li>
            <li> My wife bought one of these in-store and loved it. Soon after the store stopped carrying it (or simply run out??). Glad to see Amazon had some. Went ahead and bought 4 of them, now my wife will have her new favorite color for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love the insta dri line by Sally Hansen but this particular color chips easily in comparison to the other colors. I&#x27;ve noticed the non-metallic/glittery colors tend to chip off quicker. This color is amazing. Great for Fall and Winter. It&#x27;s got a slight purple hue to it when it dries, so it is not a pure gray shade. Since it dries quick it is easy to touch up.</li>
            <li> Great color! It does look like a grey purple in some light but I love it. Dries in about 3 to 5 mins with two think coats but that&#x27;s still faster than regular polish.</li>
            <li> This Sally Hansen product -as all Sally Hansen- is excellente. The color is more brown than it appears in the photo.</li>
            <li> Great color. Dries fast. This is my favorite nail polish color. Matches everything. I get tons of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Looks great once applied</li>
