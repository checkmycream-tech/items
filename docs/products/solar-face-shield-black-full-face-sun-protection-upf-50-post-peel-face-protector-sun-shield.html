            <li>I seen someone wearing one of these, and I thought it would be perfect for my Mom.  </li>
            <li>This face shield is excellent for blocking the damaging rays of the sun.  </li>
            <li>Solar Face Shield:  Very Good for aquatic jogging in the pool.  </li>
            <li>it was good until the headband snapped and now i cant wear it.</li>
            <li>This face shield, while very stylish, offered no protection whatsoever from fireworks.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Good quality product (make sure you remove protective films before putting it on).</li>
            <li>She has light sensitivity problems in bright sun</li>
            <li>I also bought another product (figured I&#x27;d return whichever one she didn&#x27;t like) that I thought looked allot more stylish then these face shields.</li>
            <li>Although the box containing the product was perfectly intact, the product itself had multiple scratches, dents, pings, etc.  </li>
            <li>I have better uses for $27.00 and am returning this item.</li>
            <li>Two cancer surgeons told me I must stay out of the sun that is a factor in my two Basel Cell Carcinoma surgeries and that I sure don&#x27;t want to get a Melanoma skin cancer that can be fatal and is proven to be caused by Agent Orange exposure and exposure to the sun.  </li>
            <li>V. Stiviano made these famous, and I had to get mine.  </li>
            <li>I WISH THE PLASTIC IS MADE WITH UV PROTECTION AND IS A BETTER MATERIAL-</li>
            <li>I spend most of the day in the sun.  </li>
            <li>This mask is ideal for those brief exposures when I am not wearing sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It covers the whole face which is good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a *problem* just a very mild flaw in the product.</li>
            <li>you use for a vacation, this is fine.</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s a HUGE bonus for me</li>
            <li>it seems huge</li>
            <li>A bizarre fashion accessory.  </li>
            <li>It came in pristine condition and fit well.  </li>
            <li>This shield allows me to breathe freely.  </li>
            <li>The mask was tenderly treated, not exposed to any heat or weather elements - it simply is a cheaply made item.</li>
            <li>the headband is made of cheap plastic</li>
            <li>IT SHOULD BE A SMOOTH MATERIAL.</li>
            <li>Great choice to wear outside when doing yard work .  </li>
            <li>My sister originally had another brand of sun shield just like this by Sovis that she wears while in the garden.</li>
            <li>she likes a whole lot better the face masks.</li>
            <li>The Digi has the flexible sun shield which attaches to an adjustable visor and comes at an angle to give full eye protection even from the sides or underneath which she likes since the rays reflecting off the pool water doesnt bother her</li>
            <li>I previously purchased one that fit great.</li>
            <li>(and they&#x27;re super mild)&lt;br /&gt;asymmetry</li>
            <li>This is a great product but it&#x27;s very delicate and can be damage very easily.</li>
            <li>waves.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t submerge though.&lt;br /&gt;Great for wading or swimming so long as you keep your head above water.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product!!!</li>
            <li>The band was cheaply  made Very dissatisfied  with product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely covered, more than I realize.  </li>
            <li>The item sort of reminded me of the welders face mask but had to tease my sister when the Clippers owner&#x27;s &amp;#34;personal assistant&amp;#34; (yeah right) was wearing it to hide from the paparazzi.</li>
            <li>I might insert my own soft panel and sew it directly to the mesh.  </li>
            <li>I might insert my own soft panel and sew it directly to the mesh.  </li>
            <li>never had the chance to try or enjoyed it&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately, product arrived already broken, not in good condition&lt;br /&gt;try to have a feedback, but seems like , it going to be really comlicated</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m constantly aware of and bugged by any asymmetry or imbalance.  </li>
            <li>Not a big deal on headbands worn on top of hair, but worn across your skin</li>
            <li>I WILL likely buy another one soon to be sure I don&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well constructed and looks exactly as advertised and a blessing for me where I am.often see on running shoe trim.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s well constructed and looks exactly as advertised and a blessing for me where I am.</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;It was just the right size and the head band was strong enough to hold it on in the wind and</li>
            <li>Anyway, just a suggestion, if you need or want to cover your entire face then the shield s probably the way to go but if your looking for more stylish option that covers sun from all angles and doesn&#x27;t look like your hiding from paparazzi or maybe just had plastic surgery and trying to hide it, then check out other options.</li>
            <li>a certain Darth Vader look to it.  </li>
            <li>The item works as advertised, but my mom doesn&#x27;t really wear it to cover her face instead using it like a cap.  </li>
            <li>so she likes the visor since it blocks out much of the sun.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really 50 spf</li>
            <li>and I just push the shield up, I push the whole thing off my head.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like is the inside of the head band (see pic).  </li>
            <li>Additionally, it was much more flimsy than I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li>The unusual sight might alarm another driver and cause an accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>There was so much glare through the face</li>
            <li>I really need this.  </li>
            <li>sure you remove the protective clear film on the inside and outside of the mask.</li>
            <li>So even though the Sovis visor cost $3 more than the Solar Face Shield - 7 in Black Full Face Sun Visor from SunGrubbies.com, it was well worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the Sovis face shield cost about three dollars more but was packaged in a box to accommodate the dimensions of the product.  </li>
            <li>The Digi visor she constantly wears out in public where she wasn&#x27;t comfortable wearing the full face shield anywhere except for the garden because everyone kept staring at her.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great concept but a poorly made product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted SunGrubbies when I received the product as a warning sticker placed directly on the inside of the shade.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this gadget.</li>
            <li>Not very strong broke easily at the beginning.</li>
            <li>The shield fits comfortably and can be lifted to wear as a visor, or down to cover the face.  </li>
            <li>If you really are concerned about your appearance you should not be wearing this in public.</li>
            <li>When I asked the paramedics why my hand was burned, they informed me that this product offers no protection for your hands.</li>
            <li>Like the Solar Face Shield, she can wear her regular eyeglasses with but the sun shield does not cover her whole face.</li>
            <li>I guess I assumed it would be soft flannel</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s an issue because of sensitive skin condition.  </li>
            <li>There needs to be either a soft padding under the mesh, or a padding covered by felt instead of mesh.  </li>

            <li>There needs to be either a soft padding under the mesh, or a padding covered by felt instead of mesh.  </li>
            <li>I use this face shield most when I need to go outside for a few minutes and haven&#x27;t applied sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I would have rated this five (5) stars because this is for sure only made for a small head</li>
            <li>I was riding my vespa up and down the street shooting bottle rockets at the children for an afternoon of saturday fun.</li>
            <li>it virtually exactly what it looks like and decently sturdy without being heavy.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I notice or am bothered is because I&#x27;m highly sensitive in general (and also am a Chiropractor)</li>
            <li>Not UV protective, barely used it once and the tacky film is already peeling off.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s virtually impossible to guarantee that the plastic shield and head band will be perfectly in line, and with boxing and shipping things skew a little.  </li>
            <li>and I often wish it were lower curved below my chin somewhat to cut down on hot air/breeze, but when I look at myself in it</li>
            <li>Also because they&#x27;re not parallel, I always feel like my head is tilted because when I look down the bottom edge of the shield isn&#x27;t level, right to left.  </li>
            <li>I lay part of the blame on the packers because it came in the same box as a very large, heavy book I ordered.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far enough from my face for comfort, but maybe a little too far at the chin to block wind</li>

            <li> But if you want to use for daily exercise, do not buy because it will not last long.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and my face is so sensitive, I can&#x27;t be in the sun for even a few minutes without having a reaction.  </li>
            <li> Four days ago I had my second cancer surgery due to being exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam.  </li>
            <li> This one last only a few month</li>
            <li> The band was broken when I first removed it from the box.  </li>
            <li> (I have rosacea and work in Saudi Arabia - two polar opposites) and</li>
            <li> paid three dollars extra and got the black carrying bag.  </li>
            <li> although I feel a bit too tight for my head, I have a big head).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just that it&#x27;s dark, it&#x27;s not clear.</li>
            <li> If I try to use it, since it isn’t closed all the way I get glare and reflections off the shield.</li>
            <li> It has that rough synthetic mesh you often see on running shoe trim.  </li>
            <li> For the the price I paid, I would of expected longer use out of them.  </li>
            <li> For the price we paid, we expect the product can last a few years.</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot though.  </li>
            <li> They shipped this item to me with a sticker on the tinted visor and when I carefully pulled the sticker it scratched the tinted coat a bit.</li>
            <li> , My hat size is 6 7/8 and this shield is tight on my head, I just say this as a caution for other buyers so you are not surprised and have to return the product.</li>
            <li> The other item which I got her is the Digi Sportslens with visor which turns out</li>
            <li> so when moving it up/down the two pieces bump against each other and</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it is very difficult to clean without the risk of scratching it.</li>

            <li> A bizarre fashion accessory.  If you really are concerned about your appearance you should not be wearing this in public.</li>
            <li> Good quality product (make sure you remove protective films before putting it on). It stays on my head firmly (although I feel a bit too tight for my head, I have a big head). I plan to wear it while driving.[[ASIN:B0049H2KCG Solar Face Shield]]</li>
            <li> Bloody Scam! I Want a refund. Not UV protective, barely used it once and the tacky film is already peeling off. I WANT a refund or you&#x27;d never sell on Amazon again! I&#x27;m not the 1st one complaining but you still keep selling. Obviously you know what you&#x27;re doing. I want my money PRONTO!</li>
            <li> Solar Face Shield:  Very Good for aquatic jogging in the pool.  The shield reflects the sunlight from the water&#x27;s surface. The shield is protecting my skin from damage. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my Mom, who was diagnosed with skin cancer.  I seen someone wearing one of these, and I thought it would be perfect for my Mom.  The item works as advertised, but my mom doesn&#x27;t really wear it to cover her face instead using it like a cap.  She thinks it makes her look scary, and to tell you the truth it does have a certain Darth Vader look to it.  Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I ordered this solar face shield and an identical one with the brand name of Sovis.  This Solar Face Shield arrived packed in a box that was too small to accommodate the band that holds it in place on your head.  The band was broken when I first removed it from the box.  The brim looked like it had been used and marred up.  I lay part of the blame on the packers because it came in the same box as a very large, heavy book I ordered.  The padding was insufficient to keep the items from being tossed around inside.  Of the rectangular bubble wrap only two sections were inflated.  It also arrived with no paperwork inside the box.  I returned it immediately.  On the other hand, the Sovis face shield cost about three dollars more but was packaged in a box to accommodate the dimensions of the product.  It came in pristine condition and fit well.  It also came with an invoice with directions on how to return it.  It had a UV-Vis Test Report from the University of California, Riverside with test results of it&#x27;s ability to provide UV protection.  The samples of the Sovis visors showed absorbance beyond the spectrophotometer&#x27;s detection limits.  Additionally,the Sovis visor came with a copy of a letter from Dr. T. Minsue Chen, MD and board certified dermatologist , on the photoprotection and the filtering of UV radiation of the shield, measuring 99% filtering.  There was also a flyer showing in color the 5 different styles the Sovis solar visor shield comes in.  So even though the Sovis visor cost $3 more than the Solar Face Shield - 7 in Black Full Face Sun Visor from SunGrubbies.com, it was well worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased one that fit great. This one is so tight its unbearable, and it says &amp;#34;SPORT&amp;#34; on the front. NOT AS PICTURED.</li>
            <li> Please be advised. This face shield, while very stylish, offered no protection whatsoever from fireworks. I was riding my vespa up and down the street shooting bottle rockets at the children for an afternoon of saturday fun. One of the bottle rockets went off prematurely and burnt my hand. When I asked the paramedics why my hand was burned, they informed me that this product offers no protection for your hands. I believe that there should be a warning label indicating that the shield only covers your face and not your entire person as I had assumed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did recieve several compliments regarding how fashionable I looked and I didn&#x27;t have a sunburn so I&#x27;ll rate this as a 5 out of 5 since it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Due to my sun allergy I usually use a mask that rubs on my skin irritating it as well.  This shield allows me to breathe freely.  The only negative is that it is very difficult to clean without the risk of scratching it.</li>
            <li> I got this to protect my face from sun damage, but I can&#x27;t see out of this at all. It felt dangerous to simply walk wearing it. It&#x27;s not just that it&#x27;s dark, it&#x27;s not clear. Ended up giving this to donations. Threw away my money.</li>
            <li> I thought the shield has a bunch of scratches on it as I read in another review, but that was the protective coating which does peel off. The problem is that I cant close the thing with my glasses on, and I have to wear my glasses. If I try to use it, since it isn’t closed all the way I get glare and reflections off the shield. Rats. I had high hopes for this gadget.</li>
            <li> My sister originally had another brand of sun shield just like this by Sovis that she wears while in the garden. She asked for me to locate another one for her after her puppy used it as a chew toy. She has light sensitivity problems in bright sun so she likes the visor since it blocks out much of the sun. While looking for the Sovis I came across different ones and decided to get her the Solar Face Shield since the lens was darker then the Sovis shield. I also bought another product (figured I&#x27;d return whichever one she didn&#x27;t like) that I thought looked allot more stylish then these face shields. The item sort of reminded me of the welders face mask but had to tease my sister when the Clippers owner&#x27;s &amp;#34;personal assistant&amp;#34; (yeah right) was wearing it to hide from the paparazzi. The other item which I got her is the Digi Sportslens with visor which turns out she likes a whole lot better the face masks. Like the Solar Face Shield, she can wear her regular eyeglasses with but the sun shield does not cover her whole face. The Digi has the flexible sun shield which attaches to an adjustable visor and comes at an angle to give full eye protection even from the sides or underneath which she likes since the rays reflecting off the pool water doesnt bother her but yet people don&#x27;t look at her like she&#x27;s covering up her entire face for whatever reason. The Digi visor she constantly wears out in public where she wasn&#x27;t comfortable wearing the full face shield anywhere except for the garden because everyone kept staring at her. Anyway, just a suggestion, if you need or want to cover your entire face then the shield s probably the way to go but if your looking for more stylish option that covers sun from all angles and doesn&#x27;t look like your hiding from paparazzi or maybe just had plastic surgery and trying to hide it, then check out other options.</li>
            <li> With thinning hair , I need a hat. This shield prevents me from using a hat, therefore I may never use it.</li>
            <li> never had the chance to try or enjoyed it&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately, product arrived already broken, not in good condition&lt;br /&gt;try to have a feedback, but seems like , it going to be really comlicated</li>
            <li> It has a hole and covered by a sticker not fair</li>
            <li> Broke with in 5 wears....not made well...stick with other brands!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend and I took this out to the ocean on a windy day.&lt;br /&gt;It was just the right size and the head band was strong enough to hold it on in the wind and waves.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t submerge though.&lt;br /&gt;Great for wading or swimming so long as you keep your head above water.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product!!!</li>
            <li> Not very strong broke easily at the beginning. It covers the whole face which is good. May consider another one next time.</li>
            <li> The shield fits comfortably and can be lifted to wear as a visor, or down to cover the face.  My only complaint is that the shield, made of plastic, can cause small viewing distortion.  I found it a little difficult to drive with it down.  I was having laser on my face and needed to protect it from the sun.  This served the purpose well.</li>
            <li> Positives and Negatives -&lt;br /&gt;I posted 3 pics on the product page - (updated - no I didn&#x27;t because for some reason the link to add images isn&#x27;t there anymore...) hmmm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s really 50 spf then it&#x27;s a HUGE bonus for me (I have rosacea and work in Saudi Arabia - two polar opposites) and it virtually exactly what it looks like and decently sturdy without being heavy.  The plastic coating peeled off front and back as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From inside (wearing it) it seems huge and I often wish it were lower curved below my chin somewhat to cut down on hot air/breeze, but when I look at myself in it I&#x27;m completely covered, more than I realize.  It&#x27;s far enough from my face for comfort, but maybe a little too far at the chin to block wind (one thing I wanted but that&#x27;s just me....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;negatives (and they&#x27;re super mild)&lt;br /&gt;asymmetry (see pic) it&#x27;s virtually impossible to guarantee that the plastic shield and head band will be perfectly in line, and with boxing and shipping things skew a little.  The only reason I notice or am bothered is because I&#x27;m highly sensitive in general (and also am a Chiropractor) so I&#x27;m constantly aware of and bugged by any asymmetry or imbalance.  Anyway - the shield is slightly *off* from the headband (I think the frame of the headband isn&#x27;t plumb) so when moving it up/down the two pieces bump against each other and I have to use both hands to slide the shield over the edge of the band.  If I don&#x27;t and I just push the shield up, I push the whole thing off my head.  I&#x27;ve had it three days and it&#x27;s loosened up a bit and is not easier to move.  Also because they&#x27;re not parallel, I always feel like my head is tilted because when I look down the bottom edge of the shield isn&#x27;t level, right to left.  Again...it&#x27;s not a *problem* just a very mild flaw in the product. If you&#x27;re OCD, it&#x27;ll make you crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one negative I really don&#x27;t like is the inside of the head band (see pic).  It has that rough synthetic mesh you often see on running shoe trim.  I think they used mesh maybe for \\&quot;cooling\\&quot;, but because the frame of the band is either metal or hard plastic, and there&#x27;s no cushioning, all I feel on my face is hard frame and rough mesh.  I guess I assumed it would be soft flannel/felt.  For me it&#x27;s an issue because of sensitive skin condition.  I get bad breakouts on my forehead even with wiping sweat during running, so to have something rubbing up there is a big problem for me.  I might insert my own soft panel and sew it directly to the mesh.  There needs to be either a soft padding under the mesh, or a padding covered by felt instead of mesh.  Otherwise it&#x27;s just a bit hard to be on your face.  Not a big deal on headbands worn on top of hair, but worn across your skin it&#x27;s quite scratchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very wordy, but just being thorough.  I WILL likely buy another one soon to be sure I don&#x27;t run out.  It&#x27;s not flimsy or breakable.  It&#x27;s well constructed and looks exactly as advertised and a blessing for me where I am.often see on running shoe trim.

            <li> It fell apart within a week.  I got another one but it too fell apart within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Although the box containing the product was perfectly intact, the product itself had multiple scratches, dents, pings, etc.  Additionally, it was much more flimsy than I expected it to be.  There was a sticker on it stating that it might melt if left in a car, and  it was not recommended for use while driving.  Hmmm...an item for use for sun protection that melts in the sun.  I have better uses for $27.00 and am returning this item.</li>
            <li> Skin is sun damaged when we take a two minute walk to the mailbox or clothes line. The cumulative effect of brief times in the sun takes a toll.  This mask is ideal for those brief exposures when I am not wearing sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not wear it while driving.  The unusual sight might alarm another driver and cause an accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid three dollars extra and got the black carrying bag.  I hang it by the door and when I have to step outside briefly I put the mask on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you mow your back yard and no one sees you this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you remove the protective clear film on the inside and outside of the mask.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Four days ago I had my second cancer surgery due to being exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam.  Two cancer surgeons told me I must stay out of the sun that is a factor in my two Basel Cell Carcinoma surgeries and that I sure don&#x27;t want to get a Melanoma skin cancer that can be fatal and is proven to be caused by Agent Orange exposure and exposure to the sun.  I can&#x27;t be putting on SPF50 sun protection cream just to go out to the mail box to get the mail, etc. etc. so I bought this and it works well for short trips to the mail box taking in/out the trash can, etc.  My last cancer on my face was so bad that I need to have reconstruction surgery because the cancer doctor had to cut out so much of my face and I don&#x27;t want that again.  I would have rated this five (5) stars because this is for sure only made for a small head, My hat size is 6 7/8 and this shield is tight on my head, I just say this as a caution for other buyers so you are not surprised and have to return the product.</li>
            <li> The headband on this product snapped within a few weeks of use.  For the the price I paid, I would of expected longer use out of them.  Definitely would not recommend!</li>
            <li> It broke 7days after buying it...The band was cheaply  made Very dissatisfied  with product</li>
            <li> This face shield is excellent for blocking the damaging rays of the sun.  I have rosacea and my face is so sensitive, I can&#x27;t be in the sun for even a few minutes without having a reaction.  I use this face shield most when I need to go outside for a few minutes and haven&#x27;t applied sunscreen.  I can just pop this face shield on and it protects my face.</li>
            <li> Gives a mirror image underneath visor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great concept but a poorly made product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted SunGrubbies when I received the product as a warning sticker placed directly on the inside of the shade. When removed, the film bubbled a bit. I didn&#x27;t receive a response. Within 2 weeks the inside film completely pulled off of the plastic frame making it impossible to see through. The mask was tenderly treated, not exposed to any heat or weather elements - it simply is a cheaply made item.</li>
            <li> But it failed to protect my face from a nuclear blast I was looking at.&lt;br /&gt;  Also, it&#x27;s annoying how often I was mistaken for V Stiviano, before this visor melted to my face in the aforementioned incident.</li>
            <li> For the price we paid, we expect the product can last a few years. This one last only a few month and it has already had two places broken, cannot wear anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use for a vacation, this is fine. But if you want to use for daily exercise, do not buy because it will not last long.</li>
            <li> it was good until the headband snapped and now i cant wear it. the headband is made of cheap plastic dont bother buying this it will snap.</li>
            <li> V. Stiviano made these famous, and I had to get mine.  WORTHHHH IT!</li>
            <li> I WISH THE PLASTIC IS MADE WITH UV PROTECTION AND IS A BETTER MATERIAL- THE PART THAT COVERS THE FOREHEAD IS MADE OF A MATERIAL LEAVES A MARKING ON YOUR FOREHEAD WHEN YOU TAKE IT OFF. IT SHOULD BE A SMOOTH MATERIAL.</li>
            <li> It wobbles around a lot in the wind making it not feasible to wear when windy.  I had to return it.</li>
            <li> If I could give it a zero I would.  There was so much glare through the face shied that I could not wear it.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> As usual it is a little bit big.  Not a whole lot though.  I like it because it covers my face.  I spend most of the day in the sun.  I really need this.  I would also like to have one which covers my neck and back.</li>
            <li> Great choice to wear outside when doing yard work .  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product but it&#x27;s very delicate and can be damage very easily. They shipped this item to me with a sticker on the tinted visor and when I carefully pulled the sticker it scratched the tinted coat a bit. Bummer</li>
