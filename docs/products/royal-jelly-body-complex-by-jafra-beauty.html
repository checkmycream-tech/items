            <li>I have been a jafra user for many years, and will be for years yet to come!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to find it again.</li>
            <li>I used to pay over $75 through Jaffra and was thrilled to see I could purchase it for 1/3 the cost through Amazon.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent but is yet very effective in moisturizing the skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>It is a superior product as I have tried many others that do not make the skin feel as smooth as this one.  </li>
            <li>and I fell in love with the creaminess of the lotion and the pleasant mild aroma.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of it and it is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>My favorite of a lifetime.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work any better than a bottle of lotion you can buy from the drug store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every night before bed and my skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li>This is a really unique body lotion.  </li>
            <li>My mom was so excited when she opened her Royal Jelly product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 4 starts instead of 5 only because it isn&#x27;t quite as good as the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; Royal Jelly, and it has a perfumey smell to it.  </li>
            <li>I give this product full credit for keeping wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li>I began using this when I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>A very light and clean almost soap smellng Fragrance, that will blend well with an other desired fragrances worn(perfume).</li>
            <li>This was first given to me as a gift</li>
            <li>I must admit that this is not the Royal Jelly that I remember from all those years ago, and I was a bit skeptical, but it works great!  </li>
            <li>My skin drinks this up and feels soft a full day after applying.  </li>
            <li>Very creamy and hydrating, gives a buttery cream affect towards the skin.</li>
            <li>and it really did the job</li>
            <li>I am 87 years old and tried many creams for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Beiing a Jafra customer for years, this was a new product for me.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream, it is luscious, especially for a person that can actually have dry skin in New Orleans.</li>
            <li>and I now have a glow to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I even put this on my 5 year old daughter for her eczema and her skin is like butter after use.</li>
            <li>I am 63 years old and have virtually no wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I get asked all of the time how I stay looking so young.  </li>
            <li>Most lotions and body creams I put on either leave me feeling greasy or you can&#x27;t tell I put it on just a few short hours later.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Body Complex is nothing more than extremely over-priced, plain old ordinary body cream.</li>
            <li> Long ago I used Jafra products.</li>
            <li> , I opted to use other less expensive products that didn&#x27;t work quite as well, but did an okay job.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time (only use a little at a time)</li>
            <li> I have rough knees (who doesn&#x27;t?)</li>
            <li> that respond well to this cream, and I also had some rough scarring on my legs from a fall years ago that gradually disappeared after using this cream.  </li>
            <li> You will never want to use any other body cream!</li>
            <li> I jumped on Amazon and here it was for less than half the price.</li>
            <li> I apply it everyday to my face</li>
            <li> Oh, I should also mention that the price is a lot less than what I was expecting and for that I&#x27;m thankful!</li>
            <li> This winter being exceptionally cold had me itching all over with very dry skin patches.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is especially vulnerable in the cold of winter.  </li>
            <li> but it was so expensive</li>
    </ol>

I have rough knees (who doesn&#x27;t?) that respond well to this cream, and I also had some rough scarring on my legs from a fall years ago that gradually disappeared after using this cream.  Buy this and your skin will thank you!  If you&#x27;re still on the fence, purchase one of the sampler sets, which has this in it, and try it for a week.  You will never want to use any other body cream!</li>
            <li> excellent cream.  I am 87 years old and tried many creams for dry skin.  This is the best by far.  My favorite of a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Long ago I used Jafra products. When I saw it on Amazon I wondered why I ever stopped using them. Now I remember...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Body Complex is nothing more than extremely over-priced, plain old ordinary body cream. It didn&#x27;t work any better than a bottle of lotion you can buy from the drug store.</li>
            <li> This was first given to me as a gift and I fell in love with the creaminess of the lotion and the pleasant mild aroma.  It is a superior product as I have tried many others that do not make the skin feel as smooth as this one.  It lasts a long time (only use a little at a time) but I will order again when out.  Love it!  It is my daily cream now.</li>
            <li> BEST BODY CREAM IN THE ENTIRE WORLD ..NON GREASY, SMELLS HEAVENLY,  AWESOME .. MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE ROYALTY, AND GREAT VALUE.</li>
            <li> I began using this when I was pregnant. Hydrates skin beautifully  and has a wonderful scent.  Leaves skin hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have this product. I know someone who was selling it and i couldn&#x27;t afford the price. I jumped on Amazon and here it was for less than half the price. It smells amazing and it&#x27;s so good for your skin. I apply it everyday to my face and I now have a glow to my sensitive skin. I even put this on my 5 year old daughter for her eczema and her skin is like butter after use.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, rich, creamy Body Lotion! The scent is very fresh &amp; pleasant ! One of Jafra&#x27;s best product!</li>
            <li> Jafra is a great product. Happy it is still around. Great body cream.</li>
            <li> I started using Jafra 39 years ago. I even sold it ay those home parties for a while. I lost contact with people selling Jafra and had to do without for way to log. I am thrilled to find it again. I love this cream, it is luscious, especially for a person that can actually have dry skin in New Orleans.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and hydrating, gives a buttery cream affect towards the skin. A very light and clean almost soap smellng Fragrance, that will blend well with an other desired fragrances worn(perfume).</li>
            <li> My mom was so excited when she opened her Royal Jelly product.  We would both recommend any Royal Jelly product from Jafra.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is especially vulnerable in the cold of winter.  This winter being exceptionally cold had me itching all over with very dry skin patches.  I remembered being introducted to Jafra&#x27;s Royal Jelly about 25 years ago and it really did the job but it was so expensive, I opted to use other less expensive products that didn&#x27;t work quite as well, but did an okay job. This winter being what it is, I decided to try Jafra&#x27;s Royal Jelly.  I must admit that this is not the Royal Jelly that I remember from all those years ago, and I was a bit skeptical, but it works great!  I&#x27;ve been using it every night before bed and my skin has never looked or felt better. I&#x27;m giving it 4 starts instead of 5 only because it isn&#x27;t quite as good as the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; Royal Jelly, and it has a perfumey smell to it.  Oh, I should also mention that the price is a lot less than what I was expecting and for that I&#x27;m thankful!</li>
            <li> this is the most amazing body butter for your skin and smells great.  I recommend it for any skin type</li>
            <li> I have been a jafra user for many years, and will be for years yet to come!</li>
            <li> I have used this for over 15 years as a night cream. I am 63 years old and have virtually no wrinkles. I get asked all of the time how I stay looking so young.  I give this product full credit for keeping wrinkles at bay. I used to pay over $75 through Jaffra and was thrilled to see I could purchase it for 1/3 the cost through Amazon.</li>
            <li> product is great for one&#x27;s skin and has a delightful light perfumed scent; the creamy texture goes on smoothe and my skin feels silky when i use it.....</li>
