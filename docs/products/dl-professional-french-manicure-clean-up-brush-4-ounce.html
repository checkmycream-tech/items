            <li>I wont remove a star for that because it&#x27;s my own fault because I rush and don&#x27;t watch what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li>Been doing my own pedicures---this brush makes it look like I was in the salon.  </li>

            <li>but I find that it is not that great to make the smile lines.</li>

            <li>The brush gave great smile lines.</li>

            <li>Your better of using one of  your makeup brushes, even the cheapest ones, don&#x27;t look like that.</li>
            <li>should have known better the price seemed like a steal</li>
            <li>look though because the bristles on the brush separate so you wouldn&#x27;t be able to make the &amp;#34;half moon&amp;#34; correctly.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this to anyone who wants a great brush.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use it with acetone.</li>
            <li>you are better off using a q-tip.</li>
            <li>, I feel  I could do a better job with firmer tighter</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I noticed that many nail salons use brushes like this.</li>

            <li>I love this brush</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t use it well, but that&#x27;s the user&#x27;s fault :)</li>
            <li>it seems as if it needs some more bristles</li>
            <li>I love it</li>

            <li>In my opinion, this brush was awesome for a french manicure.  </li>
            <li>So much better this way.</li>

            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It is excellent for doing french manicures.</li>
            <li>I needed this so that I could perfect my French tip manicures.</li>

            <li>nails.not that satisfied.</li>
            <li>If you need a clean up brush this is cheap and does the trick!!</li>
            <li>Originally I had purchased substitute brushes from craft stores trying to find the right brush to create the perfect smile line</li>
            <li>The brush works great and was a decent price.  </li>
            <li>Very cheap and very good quality especially for the price!!</li>
            <li>brush works pretty good.</li>
            <li>So if your in need of a decent, useful, nice looking manicure brush then this may be the one for you!!</li>
            <li>this brush cleans up better and quicker than a Q tip and more precisely.</li>
            <li>Absolutely great when it comes to doing your own french tips!</li>
            <li>nice brush works great for french</li>
            <li>I am so happy with my professional manicure brush!  </li>
            <li>Holds a lot of remover so dab on a cloth before doing your clean up!  </li>
            <li>this brush perfect for french manicure smile lines!</li>
            <li>great and really helps clean up nail polish mistakes</li>
            <li>I am going to invest in a nicer brush since I use this for french tips; and cleaning up nail polish around the cuticle for perfect, clean lines.</li>
            <li>Love that this was available as an Add On Item.</li>
            <li>The bristles could be more secure and evenly trimmed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had much better luck with a cheap plastic brush that probably came in something I bought at the dollar store.</li>
            <li>although I ordered 3 1 tech did like using it, I found it took to much time and did not give me good results.</li>
            <li>it gives a much cleaner manicure and the shorter handle gives good control.</li>
            <li>When I used it, it fit perfectly in my hand, not too long like some brushes, which made it easier to hold.</li>
            <li>The quality is good, and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This brush is perfect for making the smile line for a french manicure.</li>
            <li>Clean top coat and your done.</li>
            <li>This brush is well made and and easy weight in the hand.  </li>
            <li>but I removed one star because the bristles don&#x27;t always stick together like they should to get a perfect smile line on my French manicure</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Debra Lynn french manicure brush helps to create the perfect smile line every time.</li>
            <li>Make sure you rinse it off well after using it to clean up any areas so that the bristles do not stick together.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it was incredibly easy using the brush.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush to finally teach myself how to do a perfect smile line.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to control</li>
            <li>Takes a few times to get perfect but really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Great brush for doing gel nails, and nails with nail polish remover in general.</li>
            <li>but otherwise, the brush is fine.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to work fine</li>
            <li>I use this to perfect my smile line on my French manicures and to clean up around my cuticle.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I neede to make the perfect french manicure on myself.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly!</li>

            <li>The brush is well constructed: the ferrule is securely attached to the plastic handle, the bristles are perfectly aligned in a half circle and they don&#x27;t fan out or clump together when saturated with acetone.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft, and works great for those precise strokes you need when doing your nails.</li>
            <li>this little brush is perfect.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re someone who just wants to enjoy a nice polish on your nails without going to the salon, I would recommend this brush.</li>

            <li>The shape is great for cleanup around the cuticle and french manicures.</li>
            <li>I bought this to help remove any polish and gel around my cuticle when putting my gel polish on before curing under the LED light.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>but it is cheap.</li>
            <li>Also, dip the brush in rubbing alcohol when touching up/making your smile lines.  </li>
            <li>it helps making clean up around nail bed so easy</li>
            <li>This brush is great for French manicures.</li>
            <li>Easy to control and clean.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know if this is a nice brush or not, I am not a licensed nail tech...</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This is a great brush for French tips.  </li>
            <li>easy to clean and durable.</li>
            <li>but the brush itself is kinda cheap</li>
            <li>It did not work great for a french manicure line.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and supple, it works like magic for making almost perfect french tips with any color I choose to use to fit my mood.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Just Right and works for many things when your doing nails.</li>
            <li>This brush was very useful when I used it and it stands up well to the acetone, I like it.</li>
            <li>Such a great clean up brush.  </li>
            <li>Great for French manicures and for polish clean up around nails.</li>
            <li>Great product, I really recommend all the things I rate highly</li>
            <li>It super easy to use</li>
            <li>This is a good quality brush to clean up side some mess when you put nail polish on or to make perfect french manicure lines.</li>
            <li>I love it thanks!</li>
            <li>The bristles are the right length and stay together nicely to make a nice line for french manicures.  </li>
            <li>Perfect brush for professional looking french manicured nails that I do from home</li>
            <li>This product is just what I have been looking for since the beauty supply stores around here don&#x27;t carry the correct brushes to clean up nail polish that is accidentally put on the skin.</li>
            <li>This brush works well to clean up your manicure</li>
            <li>Notice this is called a clean up brush.  </li>
            <li>It works very well and creates a nice, clean smile line.</li>
            <li>this is great for cleaning up smile lines on french tips when painted on...</li>
            <li>and I use it to clean up my edges.  </li>
            <li>I also use it for clean up around my cuticles.</li>
            <li>Served my purpose to clean up misses on my gel manicure.</li>
            <li>Now I can clean up my nails just like the salon.</li>
            <li>My purpose in purchasing this brush was to clean up my mistakes around my nails when I was polishing them and this does the trick.</li>
            <li>I use it with acetone to clean up my cuticles after my home polish/manicure.</li>
            <li>I no longer need to go to the salon for manicures--this tool lets me clean up my errors with acetone, giving me salon-quality manicures at home.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t get a clean line.  </li>
            <li>this doesn&#x27;t work well for clean up</li>
            <li>Just clean it off with alcohol.</li>
            <li>As soon as i got it i had to use it right away its so tiny and it works great.</li>
            <li>It was great at first but only lasted about 10 manicures.  </li>
            <li>even though i haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use my brush multiple times i know a good thing when i see it..</li>
            <li>The brush is nice and soft (but not too soft) for this purpose and it cleans up nicely with acetone without damaging the brush.</li>
            <li>It works good, but was too big.  </li>
            <li>I do my own nails but want professional results.  </li>
            <li>this is a good nail brush to use for French manicures.  </li>
            <li>Thought it was going to be a full size..</li>
            <li>Nice soft bristles.</li>
            <li>overall is a good quality product for the price.  </li>
            <li>, I love it, for French manicure, to clean around your fingers, it have a lots of use, really good quality, I highly recommended..</li>
            <li>As soon as I went to clean up my smile line</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how quickly this product came from the time I ordered it to arrival at my home.  </li>
            <li>but I got the hang of it quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a good brush for $5.00, but I will probably buy another one soon - one that is a bit more firm.</li>
            <li>Quick to ship, would purchase again.</li>
            <li>I feel more confident doing french manicures now that i have this product!</li>
            <li>My dog ate it before I got the chance to actually use it, but it&#x27;s the perfect size brush to fix french manis with.</li>
            <li>Very short, but perfect for fixing up paint when doing French tip.</li>
            <li>Plus it was pretty cheap, maybe a couple dollars.</li>
            <li>good brush but harder to clean</li>
            <li>am new at this and hope with practise it will get better</li>
            <li>I went to use it last night and it doesn&#x27;t make a nice, clean smile line.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>Great little brush.  </li>
            <li>Its small but does great clean up, frwnch mani &amp; I use it to press glitter on the nails.</li>
            <li>I was able to find one of the little glass cups they use in the salons when they do your nails and that was really handy.</li>
            <li>Very good for the price, in town is more expensive</li>
            <li>Really creates a smooth line and leaves no brush strokes visible.</li>
            <li>However, with all the difficulties, I succumb to getting this brush, and it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>Comes in handy if you want to do a french manicure, get excess nail polish off, or even apply acrylic.</li>
            <li>Really nice brush for French manicures.</li>
            <li>in all well worth it.</li>
            <li>Instead I had to resort to just a regular nail brush so that I could hopefully get a nice smile line.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to try to do a french tip on my nails, and I&#x27;ve tried many times and the brush just doesn&#x27;t seem to work smoothly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend to anyone doing their own french manicures.</li>
            <li>Does nice smiley french</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too soft and ends up messing up my polish more than fixing it.  </li>
            <li>Has held up through many uses so far, no shedding of the bristles, no issues.</li>
            <li>it does the trick, its perfect because its dense but not too dense so its movable but still has force behind it if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush to do my own french menicure.  </li>
            <li>Also, the bristles kept separating (in a V-shape), leaving a gap in my smile lines while I worked.  </li>
            <li>it didnt make the smile line.</li>
            <li>I recently started doing my own nails, and apart from apply nailpolish</li>
            <li>I have been wanting to get one to do my own french manicures and</li>
            <li>When doing the smile line, the brissels clump together no matter what I try.</li>
            <li>I read that a filbert brush works well to create smile lines</li>
            <li>So, I started doing my own French using OPI products</li>
            <li>I needed a brush where the bristles would not spread when I was creating my smile or curve on my nails.</li>
            <li>an experiment, I thought this might be useful.</li>
            <li>It is not a cheap brush at all, very nice.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you only clean the brush head</li>
            <li>The price was right.  </li>
            <li>Price is right too.</li>
            <li>when it came, I tried it out right away.  </li>
            <li>Puts paint right where I need it.</li>
            <li>Besides that minor inconvenience I do recommend this brush because the bristles are sturdy and don&#x27;t fall out of the brush like many cheap brushes do.</li>
            <li>I can easily draw a good French using only the brush of the nail polish I choose.</li>
            <li>It will even up your French manicure very easily.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love this perfectly shaped brush, but I found it to be very thin and soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only brush I use for French manicures and I get compliments on how great my nails look all of the time.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s such a great way to get the look of a French Manicure without having to shell out $$$.</li>
            <li>I use this for my french manicures I do for myself and it makes it so much easier to get the lines looking nice.</li>
            <li>This product was easy to use and provides just what is needed to get the job done in a professional at home manner.</li>
            <li>It is great for cleaning up a french manicure line, or just the edges of a regular manicure.</li>
            <li>But you can easily avoid this by watching how far you dip it.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I would have liked it to be full size like other brushes I own but other than that</li>
            <li>I just used this brush last night when I did my own French Manicure and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>Just what I wanted; thanks!</li>
            <li>I dipped the brush in rubbing alcohol and it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first brush I&#x27;ve ever bought or used for my nails.</li>
            <li>This is the first nail brush I have ever purchased and it does what it suppose to.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly like the ones they use in the nail salons.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I used it to do my first manicure on my nails.</li>
            <li>Oh, it works really well with the Gelish products, too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this brush for several months and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Love the shiny short handle.</li>
            <li>Elegant and simple design.</li>
            <li>For the price you really can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a french manicure brush before, so maybe there are better ones out there, but for the price can you REALLY complain?!?</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of these in the future.</li>
            <li>not much to go wrong here</li>
            <li>Overall its ok</li>
            <li>I am sure this would not be the same for others that are not a novice with an at home manicure!</li>
            <li>Which causes it to be not as exact and leaves pointy parts.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>broke metal first use.</li>
            <li>Essie&#x27;s Madmoselle is a great pink for french.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a precise dense, more stiff synthetic brush to dip into polish remover for cleaning the skin and cuticle around the nail after applying polish.</li>
            <li>The brush is small but it does it job, the bristles seem to be of good quality.</li>
            <li>and I just dip the brush in that when I want to clean up the white smile on my nails.  </li>
            <li>Is very important that it doesn&#x27;t loose its bristles.</li>
            <li>The other reviews are right on and I am glad I took the chance.</li>
            <li>Make each of your passes on that nail from left to right and clean the brush after each swipe.  </li>
            <li>It makes it easy to do the french polish.  </li>
            <li>I have never done a French manicure, but this brush made it easy.  </li>
            <li>I like the size and shape for easy french manicure.  </li>
            <li>Used to use QTips to clean the white line of my french manicures, this is much better and fits the bill.</li>
            <li>This one did not, the bristles were super soft like an eyeshadow brush.  </li>
            <li>I might buy pure acetone to try.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I used pure acetone</li>
            <li>Fine,  solid bristles.  </li>
            <li>glued it back together, brush works fine now</li>
            <li>Nice little brush, but the edges are not even.</li>
            <li>One thing I had problems with the first time I used the brush was I used regular nail polish to clean the brush in between nails.</li>
            <li>Works great for doing a french manicure and cleaning up a little mistake here and there.</li>
            <li>Over all its a great little brush just not for french manicure</li>
            <li>I will probably spend a little more money and get a better quality brush for French manicures.</li>
            <li>It does appear larger/longer in the photo than in real life.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Actually thinking of ordering a second one since its such a great price.</li>
            <li>Very thing.</li>
            <li>I really like that</li>
            <li>, this makes it so much</li>
            <li>I really like this brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done French several times using this brush, and it makes it so much easier than using a q-tip or your own fingernail.</li>
            <li>These brushes are usualky very exspensive.</li>
            <li>so much I bought another as a backup.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li>The shorter handle on it makes it much easier to use and control.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use the hair is cheap and not working for French manicure lines</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much skill.</li>
            <li>walmart had them cheaper if you really want one.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>but I really doesn&#x27;t do what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li>Since I got it I have already given myself a french mani, and loving the fact I wont have to spend $20 to get a french mani anymore!</li>
            <li>Does the Job and its nice and sturdy and not cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The brush is of a cheap quality, the bristtles separate when you try to clean up the nail enamel, sometimes making a mess.</li>
            <li>Since I use the brush for clean up of mistakes and not for actually doing french manicures it works out just fine.</li>
            <li>It does fantastic with French mani clean ups or massive slip errors on the side of your fingers.</li>
            <li>It looks like a expensive high end brush and it has been the best I have found so far.</li>
            <li>The brush is OK, but I have found the Osaka French brushes to be way better for me - as an amateur.</li>
            <li>I used this brush to clean up my French tips on my Gelish nail polish.</li>
            <li>It helps create clean &amp;#34;smile&amp;#34; lines, so it is a must have for DIY french manicures.  </li>
            <li>This brush wont leave a clean french nail look.</li>
            <li>This was my first time giving myself a French manicure and the smile lines</li>
            <li>thing I did notice is that you do have to swipe the brush in the same direction each time and clean the brush in acetone after each swipe.</li>
            <li>I bought this to clean up my french manicure.  </li>
            <li>I use this for french manicure clean ups...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only purpose is to clean excess polish off.</li>
            <li>I never thought it would be that easy to have french tip nails that look like a professional did it.  </li>
            <li>It is advertised for French Manicures and it is true to it&#x27;s word.  </li>
            <li>Especially for the price and lack of alternatives, this is not a bad brush.</li>
            <li>so I had to super glue back together...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also thick and compact which gives you more control over your smile line.</li>
            <li>The metal part came away from the handle and unless I wanted to super glue it back, it wouldn&#x27;t work anymore.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>This brush makes nice sharp lines for a French manicure.</li>
            <li>I love this little brush.</li>
            <li>I ordered this brush for french tip clean up I found the brush to soft to do the job,</li>
            <li>A nail polish clean up brush is supposed to have stiff bristles that don&#x27;t flare out when you put it in acetone to clean up the nail edges &amp; cuticle to give you a professional look.  </li>
            <li>This brush hasn&#x27;t been used much because I&#x27;m still using my old brushes for now</li>
            <li>I paid 5 dollars and that was far too much.</li>
            <li>I have learned how to make the smile line for French manicure with this brush.  </li>
            <li>If you are a nail tech, I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a waste of money, but you&#x27;ve probably had better brushes before.</li>
            <li>I tryed using the brush to make the smile line for the french manicure I was doing, the bristles kept going all over the place.  </li>
            <li>I use regular kolinksy brushes to fix my smile line</li>
            <li>You just dip the brush in nail polish remover to make the smile line in the white polish tip.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t normally have when doing this type manicure.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of compliments on my french manicures, though and that right there always buys itself.</li>
            <li>For instance, if you are sweeping the brush from left to right on the nail, do not try to change the direction.  </li>
            <li>and I find this brush pretty decent to arch French designs or for clean-ups.</li>
            <li>Its small, but overall its a great brush for doing french mani&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Brand new and unopened as stated..</li>
            <li>I am looking for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very careful with it because I dip this brush in non-acetone remover and use it to clean up the white tip</li>
            <li>The secret to a great French manicure is the brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried paint brushes and other types earlier, because this brush&#x27;s shipping costs more than the brush itself.  </li>
            <li>b/c when wet the ends kind of look like the end of a saw blade, so that when trying to do french manicure, it does not &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; all the white polish in one swoop</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can be used to clean up the white on a French manicure and to remove any polish from your cuticles or sides of your nails.  </li>
            <li>I use this brush to clean up the white nail polish when doing french manicures.</li>
            <li>Will use also for other gel nail colors for clean up on sides, etc.  </li>
            <li>Small and light, this brush isn&#x27;t bulky like some I have used and doesn&#x27;t take up much space at all.</li>
            <li>I thought this is thick enough to clean the edge or clean the sides of my finger</li>
            <li>I first paint the white, which can be a little messy, then clean up the smile with the brush dipped in pure acetone.</li>
            <li>I like this brush to just clean up around my cuticles and anywhere I was sloppy with my polish when doing a manicure, I did try to use it to clean up polish for a french manicure but it seems to absorb way too much pure acetone even after I blotted on my paper towel.</li>
            <li>Is ok for the price but a little too big for my finger nails.</li>
            <li>Just as the other reviews say, this brush is soft and easy to manage in making french manicure smiles.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying one in the store, especially if it&#x27;s an add on item!!</li>
            <li>the brush so far seems to hold its shape.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no where near a &amp;</li>
            <li>Just like the professional..</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t work for manicuring natural nails</li>
            <li>Works very well for detailing a do-it-yourself French manicure.</li>
            <li>The bristles are sturdy, flexible, and soft.</li>
            <li>Must have tool for professional manicure at home.</li>
            <li>wish the bristles were not so soft</li>
            <li>so far work</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft.</li>
            <li>Soft and versatile.  </li>
            <li>and it is still soft.  </li>
            <li>The brush is made well and has lasted thus far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just caked with old polish.</li>
            <li>I really like it and would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li>I first would like to say I am not a professional nail tech.</li>
            <li>I have tried about 7 or 8 brushes and the DL Professional is one I tried.</li>
            <li>also, the bristles end up holding the white polish, so when you try to straighten the smile line, the white spreads across the rest of the nail bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to glue it back together, but other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li>The only way to get a professional look French manicure is by using a brush to clean up white tip.</li>
            <li>White first, clean the line with the brush, clear base coat, then light pink on top.</li>
            <li>The handle is too short and sometimes hard to maneuver, especially when you are doing your own manicure.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a little bigger, but it does fine.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>the bristles are not cut appropriately and therefore make it very difficult to leave a clean edge.  </li>
            <li>The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream and gave my nails an even cleaner french tip!</li>
            <li>It is still usable, but for the price I would have expected it to be a little more sturdy.</li>
            <li>It came well packaged and did not arrive with the bristles bent in half like many of my other brushes have arrived.</li>
            <li>Is solid enough to really help detail.  </li>
            <li>My reason for the 3 stars is that several of the bristles are either loose or cut longer than the rest so this also makes it difficult to have a nice clean line with only a couple swipes.</li>
            <li>my French pedicures look professional!</li>
            <li>The bristles are compact and just firm enough to clean up the lines.</li>
            <li>The pure acetone wasn&#x27;t any more expensive than regular, so that is a plus.</li>
            <li>i recently used it once so far</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and it came quicker than expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no big surprised (nail polish remover taking off paint), but it did make me wish the handle had been made of plastic, rather than painted wood.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taken a bit of practice, but I can now give myself a professional looking, inexpensive French Manicure.</li>
            <li>but it is also soft enough for movement.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are stiff enough that they pretty much do all the work when doing a French manicure.</li>
            <li>A little large for some purposes, but just right for other things.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own french manicures for a long time with various brushes since actual manicure specific brushes are not available at my local beauty stores.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit hard to clean out before it hardens up, but it can still be done.</li>
            <li>I might need to buy a second one in the near future anyway.</li>
            <li>if I have to replace it in a few months for $4 opposed to $20 for manis and $25 for french pedis, it is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>its smaller and easier to control, many know when you&#x27;re trying to paint the opposite hand that is not your main writing hand, it can be difficult</li>
            <li>, it applies them well, not very good as a clean up brush for the french manicure.</li>
            <li>The brush could be a little more firm, but I am also still perfecting my French manicure technique.</li>
            <li>not sure worth the price.</li>
            <li>Just way to small for a smile line.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that nail polish remover very easily takes off the black paint on the brush handle.  </li>
            <li>The bristles flare out and make it impossible to create a smooth smile line.</li>
            <li>This little brush gave me professional looking nails with ease!!!</li>

            <li> the end. :)</li>
            <li> Your better of using one of  your makeup brushes, even the cheapest ones, don&#x27;t look like that.</li>
            <li> should have known better the price seemed like a steal</li>
            <li> look though because the bristles on the brush separate so you wouldn&#x27;t be able to make the &amp;#34;half moon&amp;#34; correctly.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to anyone who wants a great brush.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use it with acetone.</li>
            <li> you are better off using a q-tip.</li>
            <li> , I feel  I could do a better job with firmer tighter</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>

            <li> If you need a clean up brush this is cheap and does the trick!!</li>
            <li> Originally I had purchased substitute brushes from craft stores trying to find the right brush to create the perfect smile line</li>

            <li> Very cheap and very good quality especially for the price!!</li>

            <li> this brush perfect for french manicure smile lines!</li>
            <li> great and really helps clean up nail polish mistakes</li>
            <li> I am going to invest in a nicer brush since I use this for french tips; and cleaning up nail polish around the cuticle for perfect, clean lines.</li>
            <li> Love that this was available as an Add On Item.</li>
            <li> The bristles could be more secure and evenly trimmed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had much better luck with a cheap plastic brush that probably came in something I bought at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> although I ordered 3 1 tech did like using it, I found it took to much time and did not give me good results.</li>
            <li> it gives a much cleaner manicure and the shorter handle gives good control.</li>
            <li> When I used it, it fit perfectly in my hand, not too long like some brushes, which made it easier to hold.</li>
            <li> The quality is good, and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for making the smile line for a french manicure.</li>
            <li> Clean top coat and your done.</li>
            <li> This brush is well made and and easy weight in the hand.  </li>
            <li> but I removed one star because the bristles don&#x27;t always stick together like they should to get a perfect smile line on my French manicure</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Debra Lynn french manicure brush helps to create the perfect smile line every time.</li>
            <li> Make sure you rinse it off well after using it to clean up any areas so that the bristles do not stick together.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it was incredibly easy using the brush.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to finally teach myself how to do a perfect smile line.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to control</li>
            <li> Takes a few times to get perfect but really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Great brush for doing gel nails, and nails with nail polish remover in general.</li>
            <li> but otherwise, the brush is fine.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to work fine</li>
            <li> I use this to perfect my smile line on my French manicures and to clean up around my cuticle.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I neede to make the perfect french manicure on myself.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> This tool is a must have, you can clean up polish around the cuticle, you can apply cuticle oil, and you can clean the top of the nail.  </li>
            <li> The brush is well constructed: the ferrule is securely attached to the plastic handle, the bristles are perfectly aligned in a half circle and they don&#x27;t fan out or clump together when saturated with acetone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft, and works great for those precise strokes you need when doing your nails.</li>
            <li> this little brush is perfect.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re someone who just wants to enjoy a nice polish on your nails without going to the salon, I would recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> May be better for creating the smile line on&lt;br /&gt;French mani.</li>
            <li> The shape is great for cleanup around the cuticle and french manicures.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help remove any polish and gel around my cuticle when putting my gel polish on before curing under the LED light.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> but it is cheap.</li>
            <li> Also, dip the brush in rubbing alcohol when touching up/making your smile lines.  </li>
            <li> it helps making clean up around nail bed so easy</li>
            <li> This brush is great for French manicures.</li>
            <li> Easy to control and clean.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if this is a nice brush or not, I am not a licensed nail tech...</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> This is a great brush for French tips.  </li>
            <li> easy to clean and durable.</li>
            <li> but the brush itself is kinda cheap</li>
            <li> It did not work great for a french manicure line.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and supple, it works like magic for making almost perfect french tips with any color I choose to use to fit my mood.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> Just Right and works for many things when your doing nails.</li>
            <li> This brush was very useful when I used it and it stands up well to the acetone, I like it.</li>
            <li> Such a great clean up brush.  </li>
            <li> Great for French manicures and for polish clean up around nails.</li>
            <li> Great product, I really recommend all the things I rate highly</li>
            <li> It super easy to use</li>
            <li> This is a good quality brush to clean up side some mess when you put nail polish on or to make perfect french manicure lines.</li>
            <li> I love it thanks!</li>
            <li> The bristles are the right length and stay together nicely to make a nice line for french manicures.  </li>
            <li> Perfect brush for professional looking french manicured nails that I do from home</li>
            <li> This product is just what I have been looking for since the beauty supply stores around here don&#x27;t carry the correct brushes to clean up nail polish that is accidentally put on the skin.</li>
            <li> This brush works well to clean up your manicure</li>
            <li> Notice this is called a clean up brush.  </li>
            <li> It works very well and creates a nice, clean smile line.</li>
            <li> this is great for cleaning up smile lines on french tips when painted on...</li>
            <li> and I use it to clean up my edges.  </li>
            <li> I also use it for clean up around my cuticles.</li>
            <li> Served my purpose to clean up misses on my gel manicure.</li>
            <li> Now I can clean up my nails just like the salon.</li>
            <li> My purpose in purchasing this brush was to clean up my mistakes around my nails when I was polishing them and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> I use it with acetone to clean up my cuticles after my home polish/manicure.</li>
            <li> I no longer need to go to the salon for manicures--this tool lets me clean up my errors with acetone, giving me salon-quality manicures at home.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get a clean line.  </li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t work well for clean up</li>
            <li> Just clean it off with alcohol.</li>
            <li> As soon as i got it i had to use it right away its so tiny and it works great.</li>
            <li> It was great at first but only lasted about 10 manicures.  </li>
            <li> even though i haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use my brush multiple times i know a good thing when i see it..</li>
            <li> The brush is nice and soft (but not too soft) for this purpose and it cleans up nicely with acetone without damaging the brush.</li>
            <li> It works good, but was too big.  </li>
            <li> I do my own nails but want professional results.  </li>
            <li> this is a good nail brush to use for French manicures.  </li>
            <li> Thought it was going to be a full size..</li>
            <li> Nice soft bristles.</li>
            <li> overall is a good quality product for the price.  </li>
            <li> , I love it, for French manicure, to clean around your fingers, it have a lots of use, really good quality, I highly recommended..</li>
            <li> As soon as I went to clean up my smile line</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how quickly this product came from the time I ordered it to arrival at my home.  </li>
            <li> but I got the hang of it quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush for $5.00, but I will probably buy another one soon - one that is a bit more firm.</li>
            <li> Quick to ship, would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I feel more confident doing french manicures now that i have this product!</li>
            <li> My dog ate it before I got the chance to actually use it, but it&#x27;s the perfect size brush to fix french manis with.</li>
            <li> Very short, but perfect for fixing up paint when doing French tip.</li>
            <li> Plus it was pretty cheap, maybe a couple dollars.</li>
            <li> good brush but harder to clean</li>
            <li> am new at this and hope with practise it will get better</li>
            <li> I went to use it last night and it doesn&#x27;t make a nice, clean smile line.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Great little brush.  </li>
            <li> Its small but does great clean up, frwnch mani &amp; I use it to press glitter on the nails.</li>
            <li> I was able to find one of the little glass cups they use in the salons when they do your nails and that was really handy.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price, in town is more expensive</li>
            <li> Really creates a smooth line and leaves no brush strokes visible.</li>
            <li> However, with all the difficulties, I succumb to getting this brush, and it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> Comes in handy if you want to do a french manicure, get excess nail polish off, or even apply acrylic.</li>
            <li> Really nice brush for French manicures.</li>
            <li> in all well worth it.</li>
            <li> Instead I had to resort to just a regular nail brush so that I could hopefully get a nice smile line.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to try to do a french tip on my nails, and I&#x27;ve tried many times and the brush just doesn&#x27;t seem to work smoothly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend to anyone doing their own french manicures.</li>
            <li> Does nice smiley french</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soft and ends up messing up my polish more than fixing it.  </li>
            <li> Has held up through many uses so far, no shedding of the bristles, no issues.</li>
            <li> it does the trick, its perfect because its dense but not too dense so its movable but still has force behind it if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to do my own french menicure.  </li>
            <li> Also, the bristles kept separating (in a V-shape), leaving a gap in my smile lines while I worked.  </li>
            <li> it didnt make the smile line.</li>
            <li> I recently started doing my own nails, and apart from apply nailpolish</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get one to do my own french manicures and</li>
            <li> When doing the smile line, the brissels clump together no matter what I try.</li>
            <li> I read that a filbert brush works well to create smile lines</li>
            <li> So, I started doing my own French using OPI products</li>
            <li> I needed a brush where the bristles would not spread when I was creating my smile or curve on my nails.</li>
            <li> an experiment, I thought this might be useful.</li>
            <li> It is not a cheap brush at all, very nice.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you only clean the brush head</li>
            <li> The price was right.  </li>
            <li> Price is right too.</li>
            <li> when it came, I tried it out right away.  </li>
            <li> Puts paint right where I need it.</li>
            <li> Besides that minor inconvenience I do recommend this brush because the bristles are sturdy and don&#x27;t fall out of the brush like many cheap brushes do.</li>
            <li> I can easily draw a good French using only the brush of the nail polish I choose.</li>
            <li> It will even up your French manicure very easily.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to love this perfectly shaped brush, but I found it to be very thin and soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only brush I use for French manicures and I get compliments on how great my nails look all of the time.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s such a great way to get the look of a French Manicure without having to shell out $$$.</li>
            <li> I use this for my french manicures I do for myself and it makes it so much easier to get the lines looking nice.</li>
            <li> This product was easy to use and provides just what is needed to get the job done in a professional at home manner.</li>
            <li> It is great for cleaning up a french manicure line, or just the edges of a regular manicure.</li>
            <li> But you can easily avoid this by watching how far you dip it.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I would have liked it to be full size like other brushes I own but other than that</li>
            <li> I just used this brush last night when I did my own French Manicure and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> Just what I wanted; thanks!</li>
            <li> I dipped the brush in rubbing alcohol and it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first brush I&#x27;ve ever bought or used for my nails.</li>
            <li> This is the first nail brush I have ever purchased and it does what it suppose to.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly like the ones they use in the nail salons.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I used it to do my first manicure on my nails.</li>
            <li> Oh, it works really well with the Gelish products, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for several months and LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Love the shiny short handle.</li>
            <li> Elegant and simple design.</li>
            <li> For the price you really can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a french manicure brush before, so maybe there are better ones out there, but for the price can you REALLY complain?!?</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> not much to go wrong here</li>
            <li> Overall its ok</li>
            <li> I am sure this would not be the same for others that are not a novice with an at home manicure!</li>
            <li> Which causes it to be not as exact and leaves pointy parts.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> broke metal first use.</li>
            <li> Essie&#x27;s Madmoselle is a great pink for french.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a precise dense, more stiff synthetic brush to dip into polish remover for cleaning the skin and cuticle around the nail after applying polish.</li>
            <li> The brush is small but it does it job, the bristles seem to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> and I just dip the brush in that when I want to clean up the white smile on my nails.  </li>
            <li> Is very important that it doesn&#x27;t loose its bristles.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are right on and I am glad I took the chance.</li>
            <li> Make each of your passes on that nail from left to right and clean the brush after each swipe.  </li>
            <li> It makes it easy to do the french polish.  </li>
            <li> I have never done a French manicure, but this brush made it easy.  </li>
            <li> I like the size and shape for easy french manicure.  </li>
            <li> Used to use QTips to clean the white line of my french manicures, this is much better and fits the bill.</li>
            <li> This one did not, the bristles were super soft like an eyeshadow brush.  </li>
            <li> I might buy pure acetone to try.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I used pure acetone</li>
            <li> Fine,  solid bristles.  </li>
            <li> glued it back together, brush works fine now</li>
            <li> Nice little brush, but the edges are not even.</li>
            <li> One thing I had problems with the first time I used the brush was I used regular nail polish to clean the brush in between nails.</li>
            <li> Works great for doing a french manicure and cleaning up a little mistake here and there.</li>
            <li> Over all its a great little brush just not for french manicure</li>
            <li> I will probably spend a little more money and get a better quality brush for French manicures.</li>
            <li> It does appear larger/longer in the photo than in real life.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Actually thinking of ordering a second one since its such a great price.</li>
            <li> Very thing.</li>
            <li> I really like that</li>
            <li> , this makes it so much</li>
            <li> I really like this brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done French several times using this brush, and it makes it so much easier than using a q-tip or your own fingernail.</li>
            <li> These brushes are usualky very exspensive.</li>
            <li> so much I bought another as a backup.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> The shorter handle on it makes it much easier to use and control.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use the hair is cheap and not working for French manicure lines</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much skill.</li>
            <li> walmart had them cheaper if you really want one.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> but I really doesn&#x27;t do what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> Since I got it I have already given myself a french mani, and loving the fact I wont have to spend $20 to get a french mani anymore!</li>
            <li> Does the Job and its nice and sturdy and not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The brush is of a cheap quality, the bristtles separate when you try to clean up the nail enamel, sometimes making a mess.</li>
            <li> Since I use the brush for clean up of mistakes and not for actually doing french manicures it works out just fine.</li>
            <li> It does fantastic with French mani clean ups or massive slip errors on the side of your fingers.</li>
            <li> It looks like a expensive high end brush and it has been the best I have found so far.</li>
            <li> The brush is OK, but I have found the Osaka French brushes to be way better for me - as an amateur.</li>
            <li> I used this brush to clean up my French tips on my Gelish nail polish.</li>
            <li> It helps create clean &amp;#34;smile&amp;#34; lines, so it is a must have for DIY french manicures.  </li>
            <li> This brush wont leave a clean french nail look.</li>
            <li> This was my first time giving myself a French manicure and the smile lines</li>
            <li> thing I did notice is that you do have to swipe the brush in the same direction each time and clean the brush in acetone after each swipe.</li>
            <li> I bought this to clean up my french manicure.  </li>
            <li> I use this for french manicure clean ups...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only purpose is to clean excess polish off.</li>
            <li> I never thought it would be that easy to have french tip nails that look like a professional did it.  </li>
            <li> It is advertised for French Manicures and it is true to it&#x27;s word.  </li>
            <li> Especially for the price and lack of alternatives, this is not a bad brush.</li>
            <li> so I had to super glue back together...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also thick and compact which gives you more control over your smile line.</li>
            <li> The metal part came away from the handle and unless I wanted to super glue it back, it wouldn&#x27;t work anymore.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This brush makes nice sharp lines for a French manicure.</li>
            <li> I love this little brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush for french tip clean up I found the brush to soft to do the job,</li>
            <li> A nail polish clean up brush is supposed to have stiff bristles that don&#x27;t flare out when you put it in acetone to clean up the nail edges &amp; cuticle to give you a professional look.  </li>
            <li> This brush hasn&#x27;t been used much because I&#x27;m still using my old brushes for now</li>
            <li> I paid 5 dollars and that was far too much.</li>
            <li> I have learned how to make the smile line for French manicure with this brush.  </li>
            <li> If you are a nail tech, I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a waste of money, but you&#x27;ve probably had better brushes before.</li>
            <li> I tryed using the brush to make the smile line for the french manicure I was doing, the bristles kept going all over the place.  </li>
            <li> I use regular kolinksy brushes to fix my smile line</li>
            <li> You just dip the brush in nail polish remover to make the smile line in the white polish tip.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t normally have when doing this type manicure.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on my french manicures, though and that right there always buys itself.</li>
            <li> For instance, if you are sweeping the brush from left to right on the nail, do not try to change the direction.  </li>
            <li> and I find this brush pretty decent to arch French designs or for clean-ups.</li>
            <li> Its small, but overall its a great brush for doing french mani&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Brand new and unopened as stated..</li>
            <li> I am looking for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very careful with it because I dip this brush in non-acetone remover and use it to clean up the white tip</li>
            <li> The secret to a great French manicure is the brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried paint brushes and other types earlier, because this brush&#x27;s shipping costs more than the brush itself.  </li>
            <li> b/c when wet the ends kind of look like the end of a saw blade, so that when trying to do french manicure, it does not &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; all the white polish in one swoop</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be used to clean up the white on a French manicure and to remove any polish from your cuticles or sides of your nails.  </li>
            <li> I use this brush to clean up the white nail polish when doing french manicures.</li>
            <li> Will use also for other gel nail colors for clean up on sides, etc.  </li>
            <li> Small and light, this brush isn&#x27;t bulky like some I have used and doesn&#x27;t take up much space at all.</li>
            <li> I thought this is thick enough to clean the edge or clean the sides of my finger</li>
            <li> I first paint the white, which can be a little messy, then clean up the smile with the brush dipped in pure acetone.</li>
            <li> I like this brush to just clean up around my cuticles and anywhere I was sloppy with my polish when doing a manicure, I did try to use it to clean up polish for a french manicure but it seems to absorb way too much pure acetone even after I blotted on my paper towel.</li>
            <li> Is ok for the price but a little too big for my finger nails.</li>
            <li> Just as the other reviews say, this brush is soft and easy to manage in making french manicure smiles.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying one in the store, especially if it&#x27;s an add on item!!</li>
            <li> the brush so far seems to hold its shape.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no where near a &amp;</li>
            <li> Just like the professional..</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work for manicuring natural nails</li>
            <li> Works very well for detailing a do-it-yourself French manicure.</li>
            <li> The bristles are sturdy, flexible, and soft.</li>
            <li> Must have tool for professional manicure at home.</li>
            <li> wish the bristles were not so soft</li>
            <li> so far work</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> Soft and versatile.  </li>
            <li> and it is still soft.  </li>
            <li> The brush is made well and has lasted thus far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just caked with old polish.</li>
            <li> I really like it and would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I first would like to say I am not a professional nail tech.</li>
            <li> I have tried about 7 or 8 brushes and the DL Professional is one I tried.</li>
            <li> also, the bristles end up holding the white polish, so when you try to straighten the smile line, the white spreads across the rest of the nail bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to glue it back together, but other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li> The only way to get a professional look French manicure is by using a brush to clean up white tip.</li>
            <li> White first, clean the line with the brush, clear base coat, then light pink on top.</li>
            <li> The handle is too short and sometimes hard to maneuver, especially when you are doing your own manicure.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little bigger, but it does fine.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> the bristles are not cut appropriately and therefore make it very difficult to leave a clean edge.  </li>
            <li> The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream and gave my nails an even cleaner french tip!</li>
            <li> It is still usable, but for the price I would have expected it to be a little more sturdy.</li>
            <li> It came well packaged and did not arrive with the bristles bent in half like many of my other brushes have arrived.</li>
            <li> Is solid enough to really help detail.  </li>
            <li> My reason for the 3 stars is that several of the bristles are either loose or cut longer than the rest so this also makes it difficult to have a nice clean line with only a couple swipes.</li>
            <li> my French pedicures look professional!</li>
            <li> The bristles are compact and just firm enough to clean up the lines.</li>
            <li> The pure acetone wasn&#x27;t any more expensive than regular, so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> i recently used it once so far</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and it came quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no big surprised (nail polish remover taking off paint), but it did make me wish the handle had been made of plastic, rather than painted wood.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken a bit of practice, but I can now give myself a professional looking, inexpensive French Manicure.</li>
            <li> but it is also soft enough for movement.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff enough that they pretty much do all the work when doing a French manicure.</li>
            <li> A little large for some purposes, but just right for other things.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own french manicures for a long time with various brushes since actual manicure specific brushes are not available at my local beauty stores.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to clean out before it hardens up, but it can still be done.</li>
            <li> I might need to buy a second one in the near future anyway.</li>
            <li> if I have to replace it in a few months for $4 opposed to $20 for manis and $25 for french pedis, it is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> its smaller and easier to control, many know when you&#x27;re trying to paint the opposite hand that is not your main writing hand, it can be difficult</li>
            <li> , it applies them well, not very good as a clean up brush for the french manicure.</li>
            <li> The brush could be a little more firm, but I am also still perfecting my French manicure technique.</li>
            <li> not sure worth the price.</li>
            <li> Just way to small for a smile line.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that nail polish remover very easily takes off the black paint on the brush handle.  </li>
            <li> The bristles flare out and make it impossible to create a smooth smile line.</li>
            <li> This little brush gave me professional looking nails with ease!!!</li>
            <li> It is thin enough to get in the cracks of your nails and clean up that unwanted nail polish.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the edges are not sharp so it doesn&#x27;t create a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li> The price was a little high with shipping, but I couldn&#x27;t find this size in the beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> Only problem I&#x27;ve encountered is when I dip the brush too far in the acetone, it instantly eats away the black paint</li>
            <li> I buy new ones when my last one gets a little too bushy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tends to loose its cleaning edge as the brush puffs when used, but you can get the edge back by dipping back in the nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> Its a little too small to load enough fluid and draw enough powder for a large enough ball in one application.</li>
            <li> As far as doing french tips, this brush was a waste and does not get the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different and some of the brushes have bristles that are too soft.  </li>
            <li> I expected the brush to be much bigger.</li>
            <li> I even received it earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are starting to separate, but that might be expected.</li>
            <li> Not to long.</li>
            <li> I personally dont like extremely soft brushes because i dont feel that there thick enough.</li>
            <li> it is soft but stiff.  </li>
            <li> The one thing is it&#x27;s really hard to get the brush completely clean of polish, thats with ordinary acetone polish remover though.</li>
            <li> but my pinkies a little more difficult.</li>
            <li> do suggest to be very careful because if you get acetone on the actual handle itself, it will eat the paint off.</li>
            <li> The first is that the nail polish cakes onto the edge of the brush pretty badly.</li>
            <li> Dont let it get too dry</li>
            <li> My french manicures turned out great, and I&#x27;m horrible at doing nails.</li>
            <li> immediately harden after a single dip.</li>
            <li> I work at a nail salon, and I spill acetone all the time, so that&#x27;s probably why it broke apart, because I&#x27;m using it every single day.</li>
            <li> Not only is it stiff enough for application</li>
            <li> This brush made even this amateur try look professional.  </li>
            <li> From the bottom of the handle to the end of the ferrule, it is about 4 inches long and the bristles are about 1/4&amp;#34; wide and 3/8&amp;#34; in height.</li>
            <li> No bristles were loose nor have any fallen out.  </li>
            <li> The only slight drawback is that I thought the handle would be longer.  </li>
            <li> There were a few loose hairs, but overall, it does the job quite well.</li>
            <li> This little brush is a miracle worker for doing french nails.  </li>
            <li> the brush bristles went in all little jagged different directions.</li>
            <li> However this is probably because the bristles are simply a little longer than necessary.  </li>
            <li> Then I got my nails done a few times and all the nail techs used a similar brush.</li>
            <li> I use this one for my french manicures, and the softness and round tip make it a bit tricky at the edges of the nail bed.</li>
            <li> Works just as I expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing that would drag your performance.</li>
            <li> Took a lot longer to get than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> like I expected</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get acetone on the handle.</li>
            <li> This brush is not as wide as I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> Steady hand though, the thick bristles will mess ur polish up</li>
            <li> It is just stiff enough to remove the excess without smearing it all over the place.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are stiff enough to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> For the UV gel nails that I do on myself, it&#x27;s not easy finding a brush that makes smiles without fraying threads of white polish.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to other people.</li>
            <li> I was careless the first time but haven&#x27;t had a problem since.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works like a pro.</li>
            <li> If you use any of the other nail polish removers it tends to clump up and makes everything a lot messier.</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a short brush, but not too short at all that it&#x27;s tough to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can still get the job done but very carefully.  </li>
            <li> but since I use a light color as the back base it wouldn&#x27;t work as well for me</li>
            <li> My biggest problem was the white polish wrinkling because I couldn&#x27;t get it on thin enough but that was not the brushes fault.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> and it was really getting expensive going to the salon.</li>
            <li> It could actually be a little longer on the handle but other than that it works, well.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to get any polish remover on the handle---also remember to get brush cleaner to keep brush in shape!!</li>
            <li> The brush is very small, looks bigger than it is.</li>
            <li> I did have some acetone take off a bit of the black color on the handle, which is a bit odd.  </li>
            <li> The brush broke apart from the metal part and the black part.</li>
            <li> the black paint will stick to your fingertips and make a gooey mess.</li>
            <li> Even with the cost of the brush, the little cup and nail polish and nail polish remover, it cost less than the cost of a trip to the salon.</li>
            <li> Does tight (does not fray).  </li>
            <li> The brushes bristles clump together (in about 3-4 little groups)</li>
            <li> I have a little shot glass that I put rubbing alcohol in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a little over a year.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would point out to users is that I tried (stupidly) to wipe the whole brush off with nail polish remover because I got some nail polish on it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shed bristles and the silver part has stayed firmly attached to the metal, which can be a problem with things like this.  </li>
            <li> friends think I spend $$$ to have a French mani every week, but this is my secret weapon.</li>
            <li> I wish I had seen/ known this before I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> For me its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> - now I don&#x27;t waste anything in the process.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint with it is the separation of the bristles when wet at the tip.  </li>
            <li> When I use it, I don&#x27;t even get smudges or need to re-do those nails that I messed up while trying to remove the polish from my skin previously with a Q-tip!</li>
            <li> I prefer an angled eyeliner brush for a clean up brush, but I use this for dry-brushing my gel nail polish base coat.</li>
            <li> Besides the fact I can do this at home while my little one sleeps (no more will he sit there going \\&quot;eeewwwww\\&quot; while I get my nails done</li>
            <li> How can a silly little brush make such a difference?  </li>
            <li> After using it a few times it gets hard to use.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this brush as I had a hard time creating smile lines.  </li>
            <li> It is a small brush,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!</li>
            <li> It is rather small which makes it easier to handle.  </li>
            <li> Not to small.</li>
            <li> Small</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine that it is so small.</li>
            <li> Too hard to use...didn&#x27;t like it and already stopped using it.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was slow</li>
            <li> I use it with Gelish polishes, so once I get the base put down and zapped with UV, then I paint white on the tips.  </li>
            <li> Not a good a brush.</li>
            <li> If you are using a gel polish, it helps to put the bottle is warm/hot water to thin it out.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are Too thin.</li>
            <li> the tip is trimmed extremely sloppy..</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s not perfect, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the quality of the work at all.</li>
            <li> When you add in the shipping costs, this brush is just silly.</li>
            <li> Those serum&#x27;s for our faces are so expensive</li>
            <li> Instead, the bristles clump together - leaving me unable to get the line that I want.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed by the quality of this brush.</li>
            <li> I must admit it was not great for me!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality brush.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid I&#x27;d ruined it.</li>
            <li> I researched like crazy before purchasing this brush.</li>
            <li> piece of crap.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this brush..</li>

            <li> piece of garbage cannot handle nail acrylic like it should. immediately harden after a single dip.</li>
            <li> This is a gem of a nail brush. I use it to eliminate nail polish while I design my own tips for nails and toe nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only brush I use for French manicures and I get compliments on how great my nails look all of the time.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how quickly this product came from the time I ordered it to arrival at my home.  It is shorter than I imagined it to be but otherwise, the brush is fine.  I would have liked it to be full size like other brushes I own but other than that, I am pleased with this purchase.  I would use the seller again.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush! I use it to give myself as well as others a French manicure! Works amazing!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH! It works great, great size, came fast!  It&#x27;s a bit hard to clean out before it hardens up, but it can still be done.</li>
            <li> great product, applies well</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly! Really easy to use!</li>
            <li> Just as the other reviews say, this brush is soft and easy to manage in making french manicure smiles.  I&#x27;ve tried paint brushes and other types earlier, because this brush&#x27;s shipping costs more than the brush itself.  However, with all the difficulties, I succumb to getting this brush, and it was worth it.  For the UV gel nails that I do on myself, it&#x27;s not easy finding a brush that makes smiles without fraying threads of white polish.  They should sell these brushes in Sally Beauty stores, etc.  so shipping wouldn&#x27;t be the limiting factor.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Comes in handy if you want to do a french manicure, get excess nail polish off, or even apply acrylic.</li>
            <li> Received this brush today. Works well, wish the bristles stayed together better but since I paint with acrylics I understand that it happens.  Since I got it I have already given myself a french mani, and loving the fact I wont have to spend $20 to get a french mani anymore! Besides the fact I can do this at home while my little one sleeps (no more will he sit there going \\&quot;eeewwwww\\&quot; while I get my nails done --he doesnt like things on his skin so when its going on mine he thinks he is supposed to say it)!&lt;br /&gt;Even if I have to replace it in a few months for $4 opposed to $20 for manis and $25 for french pedis, it is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also loaded a picture of my nails that I did today to show it does work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> I expected the brush to be much bigger. It is a small brush, I have&#x27;t tried it yet, but it seems like it will work.</li>
            <li> This brush is a great helper to finish off a perfect french manicure.  Easy to use.  It does appear larger/longer in the photo than in real life.</li>
            <li> Works great for doing a french manicure and cleaning up a little mistake here and there.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured,  works great</li>
            <li> Not so good for cuticle cleanup. May be better for creating the smile line on&lt;br /&gt;French mani.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for making the smile line for a french manicure. So glad I purchased it. The handle is a great length,and the bristles are the right stiffness for perfect clean up.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for professional looking french manicured nails that I do from home</li>
            <li> I purchased this iteam on Nov.28.2011 and received it 3 days later.. Brand new and unopened as stated.. i recently used it once so far and i would have to say i&#x27;m very impressed.. i purchased a similar brush at the beauty supply store and the brush fell off the stick the same day i brought it.. this is a wonderful item and i would recommend this product to anybody. even though i haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use my brush multiple times i know a good thing when i see it..</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  It works great for removing polish.</li>
            <li> Really nice brush for French manicures.</li>
            <li> No complaints, item as described.  Priced lower than what I can find it for locally at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted; thanks!</li>
            <li> Good quality.... Should have bought 3! Currently using it for gel application.</li>
            <li> This brush is really great!! The price was a little high with shipping, but I couldn&#x27;t find this size in the beauty supply stores. I was able to find one of the little glass cups they use in the salons when they do your nails and that was really handy. Plus it was pretty cheap, maybe a couple dollars. One thing I had problems with the first time I used the brush was I used regular nail polish to clean the brush in between nails. The nail polish gunked up on the brush and I was afraid I&#x27;d ruined it. The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream and gave my nails an even cleaner french tip! The pure acetone wasn&#x27;t any more expensive than regular, so that is a plus. The only thing I would point out to users is that I tried (stupidly) to wipe the whole brush off with nail polish remover because I got some nail polish on it. That took some of the vanish off the handle and now it&#x27;s not perfect, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the quality of the work at all. This was a great purchase and I would recommend it. Plus, it&#x27;s such a great way to get the look of a French Manicure without having to shell out $$$. Even with the cost of the brush, the little cup and nail polish and nail polish remover, it cost less than the cost of a trip to the salon. I love this brush! Everyone always thinks that I&#x27;ve gone to the salon!!</li>
            <li> This is a brush for making the smiley on a french manicure.  It works well I love my manicure when I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> This product is just what I have been looking for since the beauty supply stores around here don&#x27;t carry the correct brushes to clean up nail polish that is accidentally put on the skin. The product feels sturdy and the brush I love it is soft but stiff.  This is my second time buying from this buyer. And there products are great. I would recommend this product to other people.</li>
            <li> perfect.. gets the job done.. comes very handy..</li>
            <li> perfect brush exactly what i needed and it works perfect. was looking for the perfect nail brush glad i found one</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush for french tip clean up I found the brush to soft to do the job, although I ordered 3 1 tech did like using it, I found it took to much time and did not give me good results.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a precise dense, more stiff synthetic brush to dip into polish remover for cleaning the skin and cuticle around the nail after applying polish. this brush cleans up better and quicker than a Q tip and more precisely. it gives a much cleaner manicure and the shorter handle gives good control.</li>
            <li> I used this brush to clean up my French tips on my Gelish nail polish. I dipped the brush in rubbing alcohol and it works pretty well.  The brush could be a little more firm, but I am also still perfecting my French manicure technique. Overall I recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Its small but does great clean up, frwnch mani &amp; I use it to press glitter on the nails. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I got along without this.</li>
            <li> Its small, but overall its a great brush for doing french mani&#x27;s. It cleans up the line really nicely when dipped in acetone. White first, clean the line with the brush, clear base coat, then light pink on top. Essie&#x27;s Madmoselle is a great pink for french. or if you like beige..futures French also from Essie. Clean top coat and your done.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price, in town is more expensive</li>
            <li> good brush but harder to clean</li>
            <li> i needed a brush and it was a good value and convenient as an add on to my items already being mailed to me</li>
            <li> I like to paint my nails in between fills. It took my a bit to get used to using the brush for french manicure but I got the hang of it quickly. Brush doesnt a nice job just like the professionals...</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected. The bristles are just the right consistency and it works great. Actually thinking of ordering a second one since its such a great price.</li>
            <li> I use this brush on my toenails.  It makes it easy to do the french polish.  You are able to dip the brush in the nail polish remover and wipe across your toenail with out messing up the tip.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my professional manicure brush!  Thank you so much!  I even received it earlier than expected.  Great!  :)</li>
            <li> Very cheap and very good quality especially for the price!! Arrived on time and in perfect condition. Im very pleased and works great for the &#x27;smile line&#x27; perfection on your nails.</li>
            <li> This brush works well to clean up your manicure but I find that it is not that great to make the smile lines. The bristles are not compact enough for that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first brush I&#x27;ve ever bought or used for my nails. I get a lot of compliments on my french manicures, though and that right there always buys itself. : )&lt;br /&gt;I do suggest to be very careful because if you get acetone on the actual handle itself, it will eat the paint off. I was careless the first time but haven&#x27;t had a problem since.</li>
            <li> I like a french manicure but could never do one myself. Then I got my nails done a few times and all the nail techs used a similar brush. I decided to try myself and voila... I can do it myself, amd it looks good. Takes a bit of practice but one girl thought they were gels. The one thing is it&#x27;s really hard to get the brush completely clean of polish, thats with ordinary acetone polish remover though. I might buy pure acetone to try.&lt;br /&gt;All in all well worth it. Nice quality. I did my toes and it lasted longer than my salon french pedicure.</li>
            <li> I prefer an angled eyeliner brush for a clean up brush, but I use this for dry-brushing my gel nail polish base coat. The brush is nice and soft (but not too soft) for this purpose and it cleans up nicely with acetone without damaging the brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this brush at all!  I went to use it last night and it doesn&#x27;t make a nice, clean smile line.  The brushes bristles clump together (in about 3-4 little groups) once the brush is dipped in nail polish remover.  Instead I had to resort to just a regular nail brush so that I could hopefully get a nice smile line.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!</li>
            <li> Notice this is called a clean up brush.  That is what it does.  It will even up your French manicure very easily.  Don&#x27;t know how anyone can do a French manicure without one.  I wanted to try the French tip look with the CND Shellac process I do at home and purchased this brush for that specific purpose.  This brush made even this amateur try look professional.  This brush is well made and and easy weight in the hand.  No bristles were loose nor have any fallen out.  Would recommend highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the first nail brush I have ever purchased and it does what it suppose to.  The price was right.  The only thing I would alert you to is that I ordered several items and they were all shipped in the same box.  This was taped to the box on the bottom.  It is very tiny and if I hadn&#x27;t have caught sight of it, I would have thrown it away.</li>
            <li> It works very well and creates a nice, clean smile line. Much cheaper than buying one in the store, especially if it&#x27;s an add on item!!</li>
            <li> I love this little brush. It is all I had hoped for!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re doing your own gel nails or shellac nails, you need this!</li>
            <li> I used this to make the French tips for my nails. After using it a few times it gets hard to use. I would rather buy q tips</li>
            <li> This is a good brush for $5.00, but I will probably buy another one soon - one that is a bit more firm. I use this one for my french manicures, and the softness and round tip make it a bit tricky at the edges of the nail bed.</li>
            <li> I received my nail brush today.  It arrived days before the estimated arrival date.  Now my daughter and I can start doing our own gelish nails.  Yeaaa!!!</li>
            <li> Everyone in school is buying one, my advice is not to get acetone pass the metal the black paint will stick to your fingertips and make a gooey mess. Other than that, it works like a pro.</li>
            <li> This tool is a must have, you can clean up polish around the cuticle, you can apply cuticle oil, and you can clean the top of the nail.  I love this brush.  I suggest this tool to all nail technicians to have in their toolbox.  One thing I will say though, keep your eye on it, because once you loan it out, people get attached to it.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!  I have been using this for over two months now and it is great.  I use it for french manicures as well as cleaning excess nail polish around the nail.  the brush so far seems to hold its shape.</li>
            <li> this is great for cleaning up smile lines on french tips when painted on... great for cleaning up polish on cuticle or side nails</li>
            <li> Very thing. Great for gel. Not so much regular polish.</li>
            <li> Love that this was available as an Add On Item. Good Quality, Can be used with polish or gel, but I would buy 2 then, one for each system.</li>
            <li> Loved this!!! I can finally do a french tip! The only reason I give dive stars is because it broke so I had to super glue back together...that didn&#x27;t affect performance though!!!</li>
            <li> I researched like crazy before purchasing this brush. I wanted the best quality for the lowest price (who doesn&#x27;t?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this brush is excellent quality. It gives you the PERFECT line when doing cleanup on a french manicure. It cleans easily and fits in your hand really nicely. It&#x27;s a short brush, but not too short at all that it&#x27;s tough to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try to do a french tip on my nails, and I&#x27;ve tried many times and the brush just doesn&#x27;t seem to work smoothly. The brush had some separation of the bristles.</li>
            <li> Nice little brush, but the edges are not even. It requires some trimming to even.</li>
            <li> Works as designed and the bristles are very nice.  Invaluable when doing your nails.  If you haven&#x27;t gotten one before, get one.</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time and works great!</li>
            <li> This brush is basically a makeup brush.  It&#x27;s no where near a &amp;#34;French manicure clean-up brush&amp;#34;.  When you add in the shipping costs, this brush is just silly.</li>
            <li> This is great sized.  I had a makeup brush with the same shape that I was using to shape the tips of my nails.  It works good, but was too big.  This brush is PERFECT size!  I really like that its smaller and easier to control, many know when you&#x27;re trying to paint the opposite hand that is not your main writing hand, it can be difficult, this makes it so much easier!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to anyone doing their own french manicures.</li>
            <li> I just used this brush last night when I did my own French Manicure and it works just fine.  I have a little shot glass that I put rubbing alcohol in and I just dip the brush in that when I want to clean up the white smile on my nails.  It seemed to work fine and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This brush has good quality bristles and the handle has a nice shape to grip.  Quick to ship, would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great brush for cleaning stray nail polish.  Tends to loose its cleaning edge as the brush puffs when used, but you can get the edge back by dipping back in the nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush but I removed one star because the bristles don&#x27;t always stick together like they should to get a perfect smile line on my French manicure, I have to re-dip it in the solution. Besides that minor inconvenience I do recommend this brush because the bristles are sturdy and don&#x27;t fall out of the brush like many cheap brushes do. It&#x27;s also thick and compact which gives you more control over your smile line. I love this because I do my own nails and when I&#x27;m using my non-dominant hand to do my nails, having a brush with good control is very helpful. It looks like a expensive high end brush and it has been the best I have found so far. It came well packaged and did not arrive with the bristles bent in half like many of my other brushes have arrived. So if your in need of a decent, useful, nice looking manicure brush then this may be the one for you!! I like it very much.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  This brush hasn&#x27;t been used much because I&#x27;m still using my old brushes for now but when I did use it a couple of times it was very nice in the clean up process! I&#x27;ve seen nail technicians use it to shape a French Manicure but since I use a light color as the back base it wouldn&#x27;t work as well for me French&#x27;s.  I can easily draw a good French using only the brush of the nail polish I choose.</li>
            <li> Originally I had purchased substitute brushes from craft stores trying to find the right brush to create the perfect smile line well I don&#x27;t need to look any further this little brush is perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen nail places use this so I decided to get one (easier than using a Q-Tip). This really was a good buy!</li>
            <li> This brush works great with my small hands, it&#x27;s perfect for me.  Does nice smiley french and I use it to clean up my edges.  Such a great clean up brush.  Would recommend to those who do there own gel nails.</li>
            <li> Great product, I really recommend all the things I rate highly I stand by them 100%!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy and so are those I bought them for!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this.  It doesn&#x27;t shed bristles and the silver part has stayed firmly attached to the metal, which can be a problem with things like this.  I did have some acetone take off a bit of the black color on the handle, which is a bit odd.  The shape is great for cleanup around the cuticle and french manicures.</li>
            <li> Just like the professional.. .works great and really helps clean up nail polish mistakes, I am so happy I got it.</li>
            <li> Fine,  solid bristles.  Does tight (does not fray).  Is solid enough to really help detail.  Especially for the price and lack of alternatives, this is not a bad brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I personally dont like extremely soft brushes because i dont feel that there thick enough. But this one is perfect. It&#x27;s exactly like the ones they use in the nail salons.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Arrived earlier than expected.  When I used it, it fit perfectly in my hand, not too long like some brushes, which made it easier to hold.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great when it comes to doing your own french tips!</li>
            <li> nail polish sticks to the brush hairs even when dipped in remover, might work with acrylic but it doesn&#x27;t work for manicuring natural nails</li>
            <li> nice brush works great for french</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I used it to do my first manicure on my nails. I also use it for clean up around my cuticles. Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> This brush was very useful when I used it and it stands up well to the acetone, I like it.</li>
            <li> Its a little too small to load enough fluid and draw enough powder for a large enough ball in one application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product. The bristles could be more secure and evenly trimmed.</li>
            <li> It works perfect and is just the right size, I am very glad I got it and it is so affordable too.</li>
            <li> this brush does the job. I feel it does not work as good as some of the nail shops brushes but does the job and if used repeatedly can get the polish off the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help remove any polish and gel around my cuticle when putting my gel polish on before curing under the LED light. It works really nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a little over a year. The tip has curled, so I&#x27;ve actually become accustomed to using it with the curl. I am going to invest in a nicer brush since I use this for french tips; and cleaning up nail polish around the cuticle for perfect, clean lines. This was a great brush to begin with.</li>
            <li> I did not like this brush at all for nails.  It&#x27;s too soft and ends up messing up my polish more than fixing it.  I&#x27;ve had much better luck with a cheap plastic brush that probably came in something I bought at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> A good brush for use with nail care.  A little large for some purposes, but just right for other things.</li>
            <li> Hey - it works!  I&#x27;ve done French several times using this brush, and it makes it so much easier than using a q-tip or your own fingernail. The quality is good, and the price was reasonable. The bristles are starting to separate, but that might be expected. It&#x27;s probably time to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you&#x27;re doing your own nails at home, make it easier on yourself - get this brush! Oh, it works really well with the Gelish products, too! That&#x27;s a bonus - the work you do on your French manicure will last longer!</li>
            <li> The brush broke apart from the metal part and the black part. I&#x27;ll have to glue it back together, but other than that it works fine. Great for removing polish from around the nail. I work at a nail salon, and I spill acetone all the time, so that&#x27;s probably why it broke apart, because I&#x27;m using it every single day. I might need to buy a second one in the near future anyway.</li>
            <li> Perfect for creating &amp;#34;smile lines&amp;#34; for French manicures!  Has held up through many uses so far, no shedding of the bristles, no issues.</li>
            <li> I like this brush to just clean up around my cuticles and anywhere I was sloppy with my polish when doing a manicure, I did try to use it to clean up polish for a french manicure but it seems to absorb way too much pure acetone even after I blotted on my paper towel. Over all its a great little brush just not for french manicure</li>
            <li> The brush is well constructed: the ferrule is securely attached to the plastic handle, the bristles are perfectly aligned in a half circle and they don&#x27;t fan out or clump together when saturated with acetone.  It helps create clean &amp;#34;smile&amp;#34; lines, so it is a must have for DIY french manicures.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of years and it has held up well. It is rather small which makes it easier to handle.  From the bottom of the handle to the end of the ferrule, it is about 4 inches long and the bristles are about 1/4&amp;#34; wide and 3/8&amp;#34; in height.</li>
            <li> nice tool works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for several months and LOVE it. The bristles are stiff enough that they pretty much do all the work when doing a French manicure. I DEFINITELY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It super easy to use, I love it, for French manicure, to clean around your fingers, it have a lots of use, really good quality, I highly recommended..</li>
            <li> Perfect for cleanup during gel polish application and makes French tips a breeze.  Would definitely purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> It was great at first but only lasted about 10 manicures.  The metal part came away from the handle and unless I wanted to super glue it back, it wouldn&#x27;t work anymore.  I chucked it.</li>
            <li> The cleanup brush was a very good buy, and it&#x27;s working wonderfully for me while I&#x27;m polishing nails. These brushes are usualky very exspensive.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality brush to clean up side some mess when you put nail polish on or to make perfect french manicure lines.</li>
            <li> Nice brush. Made well. Works great.</li>
            <li> It works ok, but not an amazing brush. I use this for tips on gel nails.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  It is perfect for DIY french manicure curves.  The paint on the handle did start to get slimy when I was cleaning the brush in acetone but I see that as a learning experience.  Just make sure you only clean the brush head and you&#x27;ll be good.  I like it so much I bought another as a backup.</li>
            <li> This is a well made brush and does what it is intended to do.  What more can I say.  Thanks</li>
            <li> So happy to own this clean-up brush. Great quality and shape to clean up polish before curing under UV light. For french nails it is a must.</li>
            <li> Works just as I expected.  I have never done a French manicure, but this brush made it easy.  Will use also for other gel nail colors for clean up on sides, etc.  Highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> great brush, i use it for clean up around the cuticles and anywhere else i need and it does the trick, its perfect because its dense but not too dense so its movable but still has force behind it if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> The products I received were not as pictured, they do not work for clean-up, the bristles are too short and coarse, don&#x27;t hold enough polish remover to do the job they are meant for.</li>
            <li> Good brush. Easy to use</li>
            <li> This brush works well, what more can I say.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Nice brush. Works very well for detailing a do-it-yourself French manicure. Shipping was slow but I wasn&#x27;t in a big hurry anyway so no biggie. Bottom line is I have it, the price was great and it works well!</li>
            <li> Update 8/22/15: I&#x27;m still using this brush! I buy new ones when my last one gets a little too bushy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See my photo below. My nails look salon-quality and I love using this brush. My French takes only 20 minutes now. I recommend this brush to all my friends who want to do French at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;This Debra Lynn french manicure brush helps to create the perfect smile line every time. I first paint the white, which can be a little messy, then clean up the smile with the brush dipped in pure acetone. The curved head of the brush creates a perfectly rounded smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also is great for cleaning up the cuticle area when using dark nail polish, for a perfect salon look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friends think I spend $$$ to have a French mani every week, but this is my secret weapon.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect! Just what ive been needing!</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush as I do my own gel nails at home, It works great. I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I use this for french manicures and have been for months. Use with pure acetone nail polish remover and it works perfect.</li>
            <li> I have learned how to make the smile line for French manicure with this brush.  I save money by doing the manicure myself.</li>
            <li> I use this brush with every manicure I give. The bristles are sturdy, flexible, and soft. Easy to clean. Love the shiny short handle.</li>
            <li> used for doing my own shellac manicure and dipped in a bit of 99% alcohol it cleaned up the &amp;#34;smile lines&amp;#34; nicely.</li>
            <li> This is brush is just OK. The hairs were starting to come out after one use. I will probably spend a little more money and get a better quality brush for French manicures.</li>
            <li> Great tool for a perfect French smile. No shedding. Compact. Elegant and simple design. Must have tool for professional manicure at home. Great for shellac nails too.</li>
            <li> But do NOT use with acetone or it will eat away at it.  Dont let it get too dry always rinse it off aftef every use</li>
            <li> Works great for nails. It&#x27;s not the highest quality but it is cheap. There were a few loose hairs, but overall, it does the job quite well.</li>
            <li> Awesome really a great brush for not a lot of cash. Really creates a smooth line and leaves no brush strokes visible.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to do my own french menicure.  Unfortunately the edges are not sharp so it doesn&#x27;t create a smooth finish.  I ended up having to use a paint brush instead.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for cleaning excess polish from cuticle and sides of fingers.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a bit thinner, skinnier. Great quality though!  I actually do recommend it. It does fantastic with French mani clean ups or massive slip errors on the side of your fingers. Holds a lot of remover so dab on a cloth before doing your clean up!  Steady hand though, the thick bristles will mess ur polish up</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for about a year now and its still in good condition. Make sure you rinse it off well after using it to clean up any areas so that the bristles do not stick together. Also, it works best with pure acetone that you can purchase at walmart or any sallys. If you use any of the other nail polish removers it tends to clump up and makes everything a lot messier.</li>
            <li> This little brush gave me professional looking nails with ease!!! I never thought it would be that easy to have french tip nails that look like a professional did it.  If this one doesn&#x27;t last I would purchase another one!! It is holding up really nice and has held it&#x27;s shape nicely as well excellent product</li>
            <li> Makes doing my french mani a lot easier by myself.</li>
            <li> I received the brush just in a couple of days!  It works as well as touted.  The shorter handle on it makes it much easier to use and control.  Great find!</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own french manicures for a long time with various brushes since actual manicure specific brushes are not available at my local beauty stores.  I wanted to love this perfectly shaped brush, but I found it to be very thin and soft.  Also, the bristles kept separating (in a V-shape), leaving a gap in my smile lines while I worked.  Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Great brush for clean up of all polish</li>
            <li> I can go on forever about how much I love love love love love love this brush. It works wonders! For the price you really can&#x27;t beat it! I use this brush for French manicures, cleaning around the nails, and just simply anything. This brush is my favorite brush and I will definately be repurchasing when mine wears out which seems like it won&#x27;t be anytime soon because it&#x27;s just UHHH-MAZINGGG! the end. :)</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for manicure clean up!</li>
            <li> Served my purpose to clean up misses on my gel manicure. Cannot attest to how it would do for a french manicure.</li>
            <li> I am a nail tech and I find this brush pretty decent to arch French designs or for clean-ups. It&#x27;s not the best I&#x27;ve used but definately not the worst. If you&#x27;re someone who just wants to enjoy a nice polish on your nails without going to the salon, I would recommend this brush. It&#x27;s easy to use. If you are a nail tech, I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a waste of money, but you&#x27;ve probably had better brushes before. It&#x27;s nothing that would drag your performance. I just prefer a softer brush.</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but worth the money. Great brush for doing gel nails, and nails with nail polish remover in general.</li>
            <li> This little brush is a miracle worker for doing french nails.  I tried to do it before I bought the brush which was a joke.  After I bought the brush I did it like a pro and it was incredibly easy using the brush.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for putting gel on nails.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use the hair is cheap and not working for French manicure lines</li>
            <li> Like to use this after using KONAD stamps on my nails. cleans the ends on my fingers good! Does the Job and its nice and sturdy and not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a french manicure brush before, so maybe there are better ones out there, but for the price can you REALLY complain?!? My french manicures turned out great, and I&#x27;m horrible at doing nails.</li>
            <li> It is advertised for French Manicures and it is true to it&#x27;s word.  I use it with Gelish polishes, so once I get the base put down and zapped with UV, then I paint white on the tips.  I&#x27;m not very careful with it because I dip this brush in non-acetone remover and use it to clean up the white tip and then I lock it in with UV.  Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> The bristles are the right length and stay together nicely to make a nice line for french manicures.  Good price.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this brush.. I paid 5 dollars and that was far too much. Look at the picture I posted..  the tip is trimmed extremely sloppy.. I wish I had seen/ known this before I wasted my money. Your better of using one of  your makeup brushes, even the cheapest ones, don&#x27;t look like that.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good quality brush. Works great for me! Now I can clean up my nails just like the salon.</li>
            <li> As soon as i got it i had to use it right away its so tiny and it works great. I love it thanks!</li>
            <li> I tryed using the brush to make the smile line for the french manicure I was doing, the bristles kept going all over the place.  So as you can imagen it didnt make the smile line. Very poor quality brush. should have known better the price seemed like a steal but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> looks and works great consider the price</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed! Great for French manicures and for polish clean up around nails. This is a great product/price. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My purpose in purchasing this brush was to clean up my mistakes around my nails when I was polishing them and this does the trick. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you want it to create the French manicure look though because the bristles on the brush separate so you wouldn&#x27;t be able to make the &amp;#34;half moon&amp;#34; correctly.</li>
            <li> This brush wont leave a clean french nail look. It brushes all over because of its sofness. Returning it. Not a good a brush.</li>
            <li> Not to small. Not to long. Just Right and works for many things when your doing nails. The price was reasonable and it came quicker than expected. Would recommend this to anyone who wants a great brush.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Great for my Manicures. Price is right too. I will be buying more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> I use this for my french manicures I do for myself and it makes it so much easier to get the lines looking nice.</li>
            <li> Great little brush.  It could actually be a little longer on the handle but other than that it works, well.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are right on and I am glad I took the chance. Very cheap and my French pedicures look professional! I will be saving $70.00 or more a month by doing them myself!</li>
            <li> When i saw the reviews and the youtube tutorials for the product, I thought &amp;#34;pfft!&amp;#34; but thought that i&#x27;d give it a try. I recently started doing my own nails, and apart from apply nailpolish I don&#x27;t have much skill. However, this brush is very easy to use and it creates the PERFECT smile line. I feel more confident doing french manicures now that i have this product! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little bigger, but it does fine. Be sure to use it with acetone. It doesn&#x27;t do so well with non-acetone removers.</li>
            <li> The brush is of a cheap quality, the bristtles separate when you try to clean up the nail enamel, sometimes making a mess. The handle is too short and sometimes hard to maneuver, especially when you are doing your own manicure. I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> This product was easy to use and provides just what is needed to get the job done in a professional at home manner.</li>
            <li> not much to go wrong here</li>
            <li> I use regular kolinksy brushes to fix my smile line but I thought this brush would make it faster and easier. For me its a waste of money. As soon as I went to clean up my smile line the brush bristles went in all little jagged different directions.</li>
            <li> It clumped up when i dipped it in acetone and the hairs of the brush were constantly coming out. The quality of this product wasnt good. you are better off using a q-tip.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush. I use it with acetone to clean up my cuticles after my home polish/manicure.</li>
            <li> I like the size and shape for easy french manicure.  Took a lot longer to get than I expected.  Nice but not sure worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this nail brush, and surprised it is doing such a great job for how inexpensive it was!</li>
            <li> This product works well and I like it quite a bit.  My only complaint is that nail polish remover very easily takes off the black paint on the brush handle.  It&#x27;s no big surprised (nail polish remover taking off paint), but it did make me wish the handle had been made of plastic, rather than painted wood.</li>
            <li> I like the brush but not for what it was described as.  I like it for the CND powders, it applies them well, not very good as a clean up brush for the french manicure.</li>
            <li> When I used this brush on someone else it worked well but found it not as good when using it on myself.&lt;br /&gt;This brush works pretty good. I am looking for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the bristles were not so soft, I feel  I could do a better job with firmer tighter brush.&lt;br /&gt;I am new at this and hope with practise it will get better</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I do my own nails but want professional results.  This brush makes nice sharp lines for a French manicure.</li>
            <li> Too hard to use...didn&#x27;t like it and already stopped using it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on it...walmart had them cheaper if you really want one.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush. It is great for cleaning up a french manicure line, or just the edges of a regular manicure. There are only 2 cons for me. The first is that the nail polish cakes onto the edge of the brush pretty badly. It turns it crusty and not as neat. The second problem came when I was soaking the edge to get the polish off of it. The container tipped over, and the nail polish remover got onto the handle. It almost immediately melted the handle of the brush! It looked like there was polish on the side, so I wiped it with a napkin. Then the entire side of coating wiped off. It is still usable, but for the price I would have expected it to be a little more sturdy.</li>
            <li> Perfect tool for cleaning up the excess nail polish. I noticed that many nail salons use brushes like this. Now that I got it, I can get the perfect manicure done in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as expected.  The only slight drawback is that I thought the handle would be longer.  However, the length does not hinder its use.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li> the bristles are not cut appropriately and therefore make it very difficult to leave a clean edge.  I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect brush.  Currently the best one I found is a makeup brush!</li>
            <li> I use this to perfect my smile line on my French manicures and to clean up around my cuticle.  The brush works great and was a decent price.  It came on time as promised.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush.  I have been wanting to get one to do my own french manicures and when it came, I tried it out right away.  I use it with CND Shellac polish.  The brush gave great smile lines. It does take some practice to get everything perfect, especially if you are a perfectionist like me.  My biggest problem was the white polish wrinkling because I couldn&#x27;t get it on thin enough but that was not the brushes fault. Despite the wrinkling, the smile line was still perfect (of course I re-did that hand because I wanted it to be perfect). I was even able to get perfect smile lines while using my non-dominant hand. If you are using a gel polish, it helps to put the bottle is warm/hot water to thin it out.  Also, dip the brush in rubbing alcohol when touching up/making your smile lines.  I would recommend this brush to everyone. It&#x27;s a great price and it will save you money from going to the salon while still giving salon results. Practice makes perfect!</li>
            <li> I bought this along with a French Manicure nail polish set. It&#x27;s taken a bit of practice, but I can now give myself a professional looking, inexpensive French Manicure.</li>
            <li> My dog ate it before I got the chance to actually use it, but it&#x27;s the perfect size brush to fix french manis with. I&#x27;m going to order another!</li>
            <li> This brush are so helpful when I make manicure very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;well made have good quality material so far work ok</li>
            <li> I love this brush it helps making clean up around nail bed so easy..worth every penny recommend if you are a messing nail painter</li>
            <li> Works as it should for French manis at home</li>
            <li> The brush is very small, looks bigger than it is. The color would smear alot. Overall its ok but I would look for a different brush. Just way to small for a smile line. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Hopefully its good for something.</li>
            <li> I no longer need to go to the salon for manicures--this tool lets me clean up my errors with acetone, giving me salon-quality manicures at home.</li>
            <li> Started doing my own shellac nails at home. This brush is great for French manicures. Easy to control and clean.</li>
            <li> Good quality and size. I still can&#x27;t use it well, but that&#x27;s the user&#x27;s fault :)</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if this is a nice brush or not, I am not a licensed nail tech...it seems as if it needs some more bristles b/c when wet the ends kind of look like the end of a saw blade, so that when trying to do french manicure, it does not &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; all the white polish in one swoop like I expected</li>
            <li> this is a good nail brush to use for French manicures.  You just dip the brush in nail polish remover to make the smile line in the white polish tip.</li>
            <li> Bristles are Too thin. You can still get the job done but very carefully.  Not like the ones in salons.</li>
            <li> When doing the smile line, the brissels clump together no matter what I try. Might look for a filbert brush like another reviewer mentioned.</li>
            <li> This brush is great is does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I love it I use it for my French manicure and it works to create flawless lines.</li>
            <li> How can a silly little brush make such a difference?  For anyone who does their own manicures, this brush is a must have.&lt;br /&gt;It can be used to clean up the white on a French manicure and to remove any polish from your cuticles or sides of your nails.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> Very short, but perfect for fixing up paint when doing French tip. The bristles are soft. It&#x27;s awesome. If I had to, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a mini brush. Thought it was going to be a full size.. Not worth it. Too overrated, thought it would of been good bc of all the good reviews. It&#x27;s not! Very cheaply made for the price</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this brush was awesome for a french manicure.  This was my first time giving myself a French manicure and the smile lines came out perfect the first time.  It was a challenge keeping my hand stead when using my non-dominate hand, however it still came out great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did notice is that you do have to swipe the brush in the same direction each time and clean the brush in acetone after each swipe. For instance, if you are sweeping the brush from left to right on the nail, do not try to change the direction.  Make each of your passes on that nail from left to right and clean the brush after each swipe.  That way the polish will not smear and you will get perfect smile lines.</li>
            <li> I actually use this brush to combine types of face cream and vitamin c powders. Then apply to my face. This way I am not wasting the liquid portion into the palm of my hand. So much better this way. I am using a shot glass as my mixing palette and it&#x27;s easier to scoop out the ingredients. Those serum&#x27;s for our faces are so expensive - now I don&#x27;t waste anything in the process.</li>
            <li> I bought this to do my gel manicures at home. It is a nice brush with perfect length handle. Nice soft bristles.</li>
            <li> If you only had one brush then this would be it.  Soft and versatile.  It is easy to clean.  I have had it for months and it is still soft.  Be careful not to get acetone on the handle.</li>
            <li> I bought this to clean up my french manicure.  I find when I dip it in alcohol the bristles separate and I don&#x27;t get a clean line.  I will still use it but I really doesn&#x27;t do what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this brush as I had a hard time creating smile lines.  I read that a filbert brush works well to create smile lines so I willl try that instead.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to finally teach myself how to do a perfect smile line. Let me just say, it&#x27;s way easier to do it on your toes than it is to do it on your hands. I&#x27;m still practicing though! The brush is made well and has lasted thus far.</li>
            <li> piece of crap. doesn&#x27;t deliver nice, smooth results. Instead, the bristles clump together - leaving me unable to get the line that I want. also, the bristles end up holding the white polish, so when you try to straighten the smile line, the white spreads across the rest of the nail bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> This brush is not as wide as I had hoped for. This makes cleaning up the white tips on every nail but my pinkies a little more difficult. I am sure this would not be the same for others that are not a novice with an at home manicure! My reason for the 3 stars is that several of the bristles are either loose or cut longer than the rest so this also makes it difficult to have a nice clean line with only a couple swipes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...this doesn&#x27;t work well for clean up like I thought it would. I actually ended up using it to pick up the &#x27;excess&#x27; water marble polish when I do water marble nail art. It&#x27;s just caked with old polish. lol</li>
            <li> this brush perfect for french manicure smile lines! the bristles are good quality and compact (great for nice clean lines).</li>
            <li> I use this to clean up around my cuticles while stamping and it works great!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for French tips.  It is just stiff enough to remove the excess without smearing it all over the place.</li>
            <li> Used to use QTips to clean the white line of my french manicures, this is much better and fits the bill.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Easy to use! Great quality !</li>
            <li> Exactly what I neede to make the perfect french manicure on myself. Puts paint right where I need it. easy to clean and durable.</li>
            <li> Good price for a good brush.  I use it for dipping in polish remover and wiping off the mistakes.  No hairs falling off.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price.</li>
            <li> I use this for french manicure clean ups...its works perfectly!!! Love it</li>
            <li> Small so it&#x27;s easy to control but the brush itself is kinda cheap</li>
            <li> Very nice brush! I really like it and would definitely recommend to others. It is excellent for doing french manicures.</li>
            <li> I needed this so that I could perfect my French tip manicures. It does the job and I got this for. Great price.</li>
            <li> It did not work great for a french manicure line. I used pure acetone and it was not creating an even line for the french manicure. If you are going to use for clean up than it works great.</li>
            <li> Despite I have read in some reviews about the size of this brush I couldn&#x27;t imagine that it is so small. I didn&#x27;t like to work with it at all.</li>
            <li> Best brush for cleanup that I&#x27;ve ever owned, the bristles stay nice for the most part unless you abuse the brush</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes love it</li>
            <li> I did not expect this to work as well as it does, but it works great. The bristles are compact and just firm enough to clean up the lines.</li>
            <li> Works as it&#x27;s supposed to.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> A nail polish clean up brush is supposed to have stiff bristles that don&#x27;t flare out when you put it in acetone to clean up the nail edges &amp; cuticle to give you a professional look.  This one did not, the bristles were super soft like an eyeshadow brush.  Bottom line, this does not do the job.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed by the quality of this brush. The bristles flare out and make it impossible to create a smooth smile line.</li>
            <li> Is ok for the price but a little too big for my finger nails. overall is a good quality product for the price.  Is very important that it doesn&#x27;t loose its bristles.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for doing multi colors of gel nail polish. It cleans up great with the gel remover.</li>
            <li> This brush isnt the greatest brush on earth, and likey not the best out there for what it is supposed to do, but for the price I wouldnt expect it to be either.  It does what I need it to and I am quite satisfied with that.  My biggest complaint with it is the separation of the bristles when wet at the tip.  Which causes it to be not as exact and leaves pointy parts.  However this is probably because the bristles are simply a little longer than necessary.  Since I use the brush for clean up of mistakes and not for actually doing french manicures it works out just fine.</li>
            <li> I first would like to say I am not a professional nail tech. My purpose for doing my nails is I love my hands to look good and it was really getting expensive going to the salon. So, I started doing my own French using OPI products then I discovered gel polish and I love the gelish products! The secret to a great French manicure is the brush. I have tried about 7 or 8 brushes and the DL Professional is one I tried. I must admit it was not great for me! I needed a brush where the bristles would not spread when I was creating my smile or curve on my nails. The brush is OK, but I have found the Osaka French brushes to be way better for me - as an amateur. The Osaka&#x27;s bristles are stiffer and creates a perfect curve - for me! So, try this and if you find it not as effective, check out the Osaka and also read the reviews. Actually, these are the brushes I see in the nail salons I have used in my area.</li>

            <li> As far as doing french tips, this brush was a waste and does not get the job done. It&#x27;s only purpose is to clean excess polish off.</li>
            <li> This brush is the perfect size and thickness for touching up any mistakes while doing an at-home mani/pedi. It&#x27;s just like what my manicurist uses.</li>
            <li> This brush works fantastic!  Perfect brush for applying UV gel.  Just clean it off with alcohol.</li>
            <li> I have not tried this out yet but I am looking forward on trying it out. It is not a cheap brush at all, very nice.</li>
            <li> The only way to get a professional look French manicure is by using a brush to clean up white tip. The brush is small but it does it job, the bristles seem to be of good quality. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I like using this when I do a French manicure. It gives you precision you don&#x27;t normally have when doing this type manicure.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to clean up the white nail polish when doing french manicures. The brush shape and flexibility is perfect for this task. Only problem I&#x27;ve encountered is when I dip the brush too far in the acetone, it instantly eats away the black paint and you get goop all over yours hands. But you can easily avoid this by watching how far you dip it. I wont remove a star for that because it&#x27;s my own fault because I rush and don&#x27;t watch what I&#x27;m doing.</li>

            <li> I love this brush.  The bristles are soft and supple, it works like magic for making almost perfect french tips with any color I choose to use to fit my mood.  Small and light, this brush isn&#x27;t bulky like some I have used and doesn&#x27;t take up much space at all.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush for doing french manicures.  I&#x27;ve tried a few different and some of the brushes have bristles that are too soft.  This one is the perfect stiffness.</li>
            <li> Serves it purpose and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Love the shape of the brush! Makes beautiful smile line.</li>
            <li> Got this brush to use for my .008mm glitter with my CND Shellac polish. Not only is it stiff enough for application but it is also soft enough for movement.  I have also used it to apply the white of my CND shellac with alcohol and it works well for this application too.</li>
            <li> Been doing my own pedicures---this brush makes it look like I was in the salon.  Takes a few times to get perfect but really pleased with the results. Just be careful not to get any polish remover on the handle---also remember to get brush cleaner to keep brush in shape!!</li>
            <li> You chose how you want to use it, make up or nails.  It&#x27;s super soft, and works great for those precise strokes you need when doing your nails.</li>
            <li> I always saw the mani/pedi &amp;#34;girl&amp;#34; using a brush when correcting nail polish &amp;#34;oopses.&amp;#34;I tried different type of paint brushes to get the same effectiveness of cleaning the mistakes on my skin, but nothing worked as well as this brush does! When I use it, I don&#x27;t even get smudges or need to re-do those nails that I messed up while trying to remove the polish from my skin previously with a Q-tip! Peoronally I think this is a fantastic way to have professional/salon looking nails &amp; WAY cheaper too! Regarding shipping, I think I got the package the next day (using Amazon Prime)! What a surprise that was!</li>
            <li> This brush has officially saved my french manicures! The rounded tip is perfect for cleaning up the lines - and it also works great for cleaning up excess polish from your cuticles.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this is thick enough to clean the edge or clean the sides of my finger nails.not that satisfied.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are stiff enough to get the job done.  It is thin enough to get in the cracks of your nails and clean up that unwanted nail polish.  If you need a clean up brush this is cheap and does the trick!!</li>
            <li> Bought this since I started doing my own gel &amp; shellac nails.&lt;br /&gt;As an experiment, I thought this might be useful. It&#x27;s very&lt;br /&gt;handy and I can use it to get just the edges cleaned up as&lt;br /&gt;well as use it for french manicures.</li>
