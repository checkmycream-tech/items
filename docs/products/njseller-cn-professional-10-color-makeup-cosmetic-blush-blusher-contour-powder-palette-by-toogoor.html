            <li> my first one I ordered came in before it expected but BUSTED everywhere</li>
            <li> This was too powdery(chalk like) and not dark enough for contouring.</li>
            <li> I opened the box, all smiles, the box was dusty and full of makeup</li>
            <li> since I thought maybe a little got out, even on the bubble wrap and all over the box until I actually opened the lid and saw the one that it wasn&#x27;t just a little blush dust from some of them, but one actually had broke.</li>
            <li> I soon realized they are not  a very pigmented product.</li>
            <li> Not very pigmented I&#x27;m a brown skin girl and</li>
            <li> the blushes are really not for me.</li>
            <li> I mean I could only salvage one eight of the entire thing, not much.</li>
            <li> ALSO came quicker than expected !</li>
            <li> I am a black, caramel tone female in her late 20&#x27;s and all of the shades in this palette works for me.</li>
            <li> Full of glistening glitter colors are pale and came broken never buying this again !!</li>
            <li> The colors I ordered are a little off</li>
            <li> but you need to apply it a few times a day to stay on</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s getting only four stars because the brown I wanted for my contour was broken.</li>
            <li> Its become my go to blush for my everyday look</li>
            <li> Hard to apply correctly and blend.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> The pigments are horrible and do not transfer to the face well at all.</li>

            <li> I love the colors and how pigmented they are</li>
            <li> This set of blushes are pretty awesome. However, they do definitely have quite a bit of fallout.&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, they are truly pigmented and have pretty good staying power.&lt;br /&gt;This is wonderful if your just starting out with makeup. It includes a great variety of blush colors that can&lt;br /&gt;match pretty much any skin color.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this palette, even though it has fallout. I believe it something that can be worked with. Especially for the price. Its great!</li>
            <li> Great colors look amazing</li>
            <li> I was expecting a lot more from these blushes. I soon realized they are not  a very pigmented product. I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great pigment for the price!!!</li>
            <li> Blushes are one of those things that you apply depending on your mood. I love having options in one palette. It has the down size of not being travel friendly but who really travels with ALL their blushes anyway?  It is highly pigmented to apply with a light hand.&lt;br /&gt;Also, most of them are matte.</li>
            <li> loved it I honestly thought omg what if its cracked or doesn&#x27;t work but I was wrong love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! best purchase I&#x27;ve done</li>
            <li> The pigments are horrible and do not transfer to the face well at all.</li>
            <li> its okay but you need to apply it a few times a day to stay on</li>
            <li> Delivery took a month.  I had actually forgotten I had even ordered it by the time it got here.  The colors are pretty, but kind of chalky for my taste.  Nonetheless, the colors do show up and I don&#x27;t have much to complain about, but probably will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> High color transfer. Hard to apply correctly and blend.</li>
            <li> The colors I ordered are a little off</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  an Ok platte. Not very pigmented I&#x27;m a brown skin girl and the blushes are really not for me. And it has shimmer for days. Not a shimmer girl at all. It may work for you but it&#x27;s not for me. I guess you get what you pay for. The seller is a fast shipper and the platte was in great condition not one broke. Overall I&#x27;m looking for blush thats very pigmented and No shimmer</li>
            <li> I LOVED it! But it&#x27;s getting only four stars because the brown I wanted for my contour was broken. I tried to salvage it, but just decide to buy an eyeshadow compact to replace it. I mean I could only salvage one eight of the entire thing, not much. I opened the box, all smiles, the box was dusty and full of makeup but I wasn&#x27;t worried at first since I thought maybe a little got out, even on the bubble wrap and all over the box until I actually opened the lid and saw the one that it wasn&#x27;t just a little blush dust from some of them, but one actually had broke.</li>
            <li> These blushes are amazing!! They blend so well &amp; look so natural on any skin tone!! Even the ones that have shimmer!! I have a taupe complexion &amp; they all work for me. Even if u choose to blend more than one at one time!!</li>
            <li> The colors were ok could have been a little more pigmented for those are us with a darker completions.overall not bad for the price!</li>
