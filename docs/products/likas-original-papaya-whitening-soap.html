            <li>I use it daily on the neded areas and I have experienced great results.</li>
            <li>Amazon, please be more precise in vetting your sellers!</li>
            <li>Nothing like it was noted on the packaging so just make sure you prepare a lot of high-collagen moisturizers and sun-screens if you plan to be exposed under the sun</li>

            <li>It honestly an okay soap.</li>

            <li>okay</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still using it and love it</li>
            <li>however many reviews claimed that this product dries your skin</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>Keeps the skin looking and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>This soap is more of an exfoliant.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after reading many reviews.  </li>
            <li>It cleanses the skin very well and has a light pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I noticed results very quickly with this soap.  </li>
            <li>Gets rid of tan lines threw out time, but it also blends it making tan lines not look as strong.</li>
            <li>I bought from many sellers and finally this one is authentic!!</li>
            <li>It is, however, a nice soap (it leaves the skin feeling soft and is ideal for sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>It has done a wonderful job in lightening my dark spots.</li>
            <li>But to be honest I really dont know what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li>a light brown hispanic</li>
            <li>I have to use a moisturizer with it as it is very drieing on my face but effective</li>
            <li>im excited to use it</li>
            <li>My face/skin felt clean afterward</li>
            <li>The good thing it that it does not dry your skin out.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get the product quickly and have been using it diligently</li>
            <li>(just make sure you dont get exposed too much coz</li>
            <li>It made my skin nice and soft and without acne</li>
            <li>Its a good product and the shipping was instant..</li>
            <li>(I have super oily skin) and that it would brighten up my skin.</li>
            <li>It also has a mild waxy odor</li>
            <li>This is the real one!!</li>
            <li>Although I can&#x27;t say whether or not the whitening aspect works, I must say that since using this, my skin feels more clean &amp; smooth and its cleared up some minor acne.  </li>
            <li>, it smell good and cleans well however, when I run out I bought from a different seller in the package, I made sure the pack has the labels and all the award before buying, but when i used the other soap it semlls like a strong chemical.</li>
            <li>It was truly worth the patience and faithful application.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>great product, not sure how it works, but it does.</li>
            <li>Trust me when I say that it will be extremely drying at first but just invest in a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>i havent used it yet but as far as people having mold on there soap mine came in fine, unopened package and smelled fresh</li>
            <li>Overall, a nice soap but did not fulfill it&#x27;s main purpose - to whiten skin.</li>
            <li>My skin felt much better, it started to lighten and some acne present went away..</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing some more.</li>
            <li>i know freaked me out at first....</li>
            <li>This is the first Amazon review I&#x27;ve ever done.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like tanning and like my natural Latino light skin color.</li>
            <li>I first bought these two</li>
            <li>I purchased 2 bars and I am still on the first one.</li>
            <li>i realized the other soaps i was using wasnt getting me clean, my bathtub required extensive cleaning for about week of using this soap because the water turned grey from all the dirt this soap cleansed from my body, it exfoliated me very good.  </li>
            <li>It does dry my skin a lot, but i apply my moisturizer and its ok.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey for its kind</li>
            <li>This product is very dependable for its purpose, though you just need to be prepared for the skin-drying effect of it.</li>
            <li>It has worked really well.</li>
            <li>This product functions and works very well.</li>
            <li>i was a swimmer in high school for all four years!</li>
            <li>but when i was in high school they called me AKON in the locker room!</li>
            <li>I really like the soap because it works</li>
            <li>Now I believe I have the real one by the description</li>
            <li>It really hasn&#x27;t been whitening my skin</li>
            <li>My ex Co worker told me about it cause its a very well known product in the Phillipines to lighten skin.</li>
            <li>This soap doesnt have much of a fragrance</li>
            <li>I had to use a very creamy moisturizer afterwards.  </li>
            <li>, I saw the results and my back has never been this clean.</li>
            <li>Particularly the skin of my knees, elbows and arm pits.</li>
            <li>I had blemished on my back from many years back that just would not go away.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it actually helps whiten or not yet have not been using it long enough, however it smells nice and it feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m older, my acne is under control</li>
            <li>Obviously others with a different skin type/luck might have better results, but I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s main claim is skin whitening.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>I love the product, I havnt seen any other item that cleans my back the way this soap does.</li>
            <li>I have light brown skin with dark patches on my cheek and chin area.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve done a fair share of research on this product and I have previously tried half a bar</li>
            <li>This product just get rids of dead skin cells and makes the skin to its normal light color.</li>
            <li>Original Likas Papaya is NOT worth it.</li>
            <li>and when i received it both the packaging and the soap had mold on them and they smelled old.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still early</li>
            <li>,i think the product had to been old</li>
            <li>just a waste of money, simple dove bath soap are much better than this for me.</li>
            <li>It lathered very well, but was very drying on my skin (my skin felt tight and itchy).  </li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin, and usually use cleansers such as Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear,</li>
            <li>So even though i liked yours i do not know who is selling the fake Likas??</li>
            <li>but I have only been using the new ones for several weeks...</li>
            <li>Skin is just the same as before albeit a tad bit more dry which is not very good.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this soap because it does the job, i have tried other soaps since ordering this one which work well also but the acid based soaps like kojic sans cant be used everyday because they are too strong for my skin.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it and see if it really whitens my skin and dark spots</li>
            <li>Two stars because it&#x27;s a decent soap, but it did not work for me in those other aspects.</li>
            <li>I have been using it since last year in combination with Bath and Body Works Bigelow Lemon creme and two different vitamin K eye cremes (Queen bee and Reventin Renew Intense Dark Circle</li>

            <li> It lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> the water will literally turn grey!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t not understand why do people rate things that are below average, the reason is that such kind of reviews misguide the newly customers and publicize the item for no reasons which is very bad in my opinion.</li>
            <li> but I let my skin thoroughly dry</li>
            <li> only been a few days of using it 2 times daily and my skin feels sooo silky!!</li>
            <li> some white things on the top too, :(((</li>
            <li> but why should I wait so long when other soaps lighten faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i cant believe i even purchased this such a waste</li>
            <li> it is on the expensive side, my first time using this soap</li>
            <li> this product &amp; it is always delivered before the estimated due date.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t feel any other benefits that I&#x27;d read about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, if your looking to do some extreme whitening this isn&#x27;t the soap for you.</li>
            <li> I suppose it could dry you out a little, but I use lotion so that is not an issue.</li>
            <li> so dissapointed&#x3D;( I ordered this product very excited to try it out</li>
            <li> i was desperate to get back to my natural color and likas helped drastically!!!</li>
            <li> Mind you, I didn&#x27;t heavily use it and my skin is not particularly sensitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much brighter than the fake one.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not really worth mentioning to friends</li>
            <li> I had dark spots on my face from a breakout and thought this might help and it did,  </li>
            <li> I have less outbreaks when using this soap.</li>
            <li> so I went ahead and bought another two bars from here to compare it to the previous one I bought.</li>
            <li> My main concern was that I have purchased a fake one..</li>
            <li> i have medium dark caramel complexion skin and this soap works wonders for me!</li>
            <li> and I do see a little bit of brightening.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are slowly fading away.</li>
            <li> i was so dissapointed when i receive my order it was open and smell bad and got mold and both of them was open already</li>
            <li> I went this past two years without using it</li>
            <li> The fake one has white powder on it this one doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really whiten my skin either or help with cystic acne...at least for me anyway.  :(</li>
            <li> Ive used at least 2 bars</li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked so slowly that after awhile, I stopped looking for the difference but continued using it.</li>
            <li> no more outdoor pools for me!</li>
            <li> I would always end up having to quit using this product because my acne was really bad and needed medicated facial scrub.</li>
            <li> It only dries out your skin really badly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the fake soaps.</li>
            <li> The boxes were both open when I received them and there was disgusting black mold on the insides of the box.</li>
            <li> The item seems looks very\\&quot; old\\&quot;, two boxes were open when I received them, and there was disgusting black mold insides of the box, the soap</li>
            <li> Before now I would use it in conjunction with other face products because I had bad acne.</li>
            <li> but sadly it does not work.</li>
            <li> does NOT work save your money so expensive for soap</li>
            <li> also, it smells weird.</li>
            <li> This product is also a fake hyped item and is not working for me at all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it just didn&#x27;t make a difference for me.</li>
            <li> Its smells weird but its</li>
            <li> Fake soaps..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looks like these are fake soaps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect</li>
            <li> The soap was VERY irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> My experience with the product was so bad that I felt compelled to write a review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I purchased this soap, I wanted to even the tone in the area under my eyes and at the base of my neck.  </li>
            <li> My face has always been three shades darker than the rest of my body which I found horrific</li>
            <li> Awful</li>
            <li> just felt nasty!....</li>
            <li> product is awful, just awful.</li>

            <li> Very nice soap. The only problem is that it dries the skin but helps in lightening of tan skin.</li>
            <li> The boxes were both open when I received them and there was disgusting black mold on the insides of the box. The soap was also misshapen and looked different from pictures I&#x27;ve seen of \\&quot;authentic\\&quot; Likas soap. Amazon, please be more precise in vetting your sellers!</li>
            <li> im so dissapointed&#x3D;( I ordered this product very excited to try it out and when i received it both the packaging and the soap had mold on them and they smelled old.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I am African American and was looking for a way to even my skin tone. Particularly the skin of my knees, elbows and arm pits. This soap works amazingly. I should have purchased and used it long ago. I recommend it to anyone looking to get rid of any build up of dead/dry skin. I use it daily on the neded areas and I have experienced great results. I wish I&#x27;d taken before photos. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about this soap. I had blemished on my back from many years back that just would not go away. About three weeks of using this soap, I saw the results and my back has never been this clean.</li>
            <li> I love the product, I havnt seen any other item that cleans my back the way this soap does.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get the product quickly and have been using it diligently but sadly it does not work. It has made my skin oily. Did not help with acne scars.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that this is working.  I bought this for my daughter at her request.  I also got her the Belo Skin Whitening Anti-perspirant.  She has seen no results and she&#x27;s been using them for about a month now.</li>
            <li> I did see some change in my skin as soon as 3 days!! My skin felt much better, it started to lighten and some acne present went away.. I would totally recommend this to anyone! And I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing some more.</li>
            <li> I have light brown skin with dark patches on my cheek and chin area. After reading some of the reviews, I decited to try this product out. I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and I do not see any changes. It may take longer so that is the reason why I rated the product OK! I will continue using both the bars to see if there is any changes to my face.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this but it does not give me the results I was looking for. The good thing it that it does not dry your skin out. But to be honest I really dont know what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this to lighten some age-related hyperpigmentation on my face.  I do have sensitive skin, and usually use cleansers such as Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear, etc so I did have my concerns.  Although I can&#x27;t say whether or not the whitening aspect works, I must say that since using this, my skin feels more clean &amp; smooth and its cleared up some minor acne.  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> does NOT work save your money so expensive for soap i cant believe i even purchased this such a waste</li>
            <li> Not sure if it actually helps whiten or not yet have not been using it long enough, however it smells nice and it feels good on my skin. I suppose it could dry you out a little, but I use lotion so that is not an issue.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my acne and no I didn&#x27;t notice brighter skin either. Keep looking!!&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it at all</li>
            <li> This product is very dependable for its purpose, though you just need to be prepared for the skin-drying effect of it. Nothing like it was noted on the packaging so just make sure you prepare a lot of high-collagen moisturizers and sun-screens if you plan to be exposed under the sun (just make sure you dont get exposed too much coz it&#x27;s gonna cause you pigmentations/freckles). It is a little pricey for its kind but this brand is already trusted.</li>
            <li> After using my ski. Itched a lot. Too drying. Also it did not lighten any of the skin, even from sun exposure after using dermabrasive gloves</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on and off for two years and it has worked a bit. Before now I would use it in conjunction with other face products because I had bad acne. I would always end up having to quit using this product because my acne was really bad and needed medicated facial scrub. Now I&#x27;m older, my acne is under control and I can use this product for the purpose I intended. My face has always been three shades darker than the rest of my body which I found horrific so I use this AND carolight for my face. It has worked really well. My face is evening out nicely!</li>
            <li> i love this soap altho it is on the expensive side, my first time using this soap i realized the other soaps i was using wasnt getting me clean, my bathtub required extensive cleaning for about week of using this soap because the water turned grey from all the dirt this soap cleansed from my body, it exfoliated me very good.  It isnt a skin bleaching soap however it will exfoliate you making you even toned.  I will continue to buy this soap because it does the job, i have tried other soaps since ordering this one which work well also but the acid based soaps like kojic sans cant be used everyday because they are too strong for my skin.....i have medium dark caramel complexion skin and this soap works wonders for me!</li>
            <li> It honestly an okay soap. When I used it I received no visible lightening. I didn&#x27;t break out while using this soap though so thats good. It made my skin nice and soft and without acne but it didnt lighten which is why I gave it a  3*.&lt;br /&gt;I suppose if i used to for months or an entire year I would eventually see lightening but why should I wait so long when other soaps lighten faster.&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Helps Acne&lt;br /&gt;Makes skin smooth&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t lighten&lt;br /&gt;Lightening was my purpose for buying the soap</li>
            <li> The item seems looks very\\&quot; old\\&quot;, two boxes were open when I received them, and there was disgusting black mold insides of the box, the soap some white things on the top too, :(((</li>
            <li> This soap did nothing for my skin. Skin is just the same as before albeit a tad bit more dry which is not very good. Feel like a lot of moisture was lost everytime I washed my face. Also 0 brightening effects. Would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> hasnt been effective for me--after using for over a month i gave up. didn&#x27;t see any results to keep going on. also, it smells weird.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this soap, I wanted to even the tone in the area under my eyes and at the base of my neck.  I have been using it since last year in combination with Bath and Body Works Bigelow Lemon creme and two different vitamin K eye cremes (Queen bee and Reventin Renew Intense Dark Circle cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked so slowly that after awhile, I stopped looking for the difference but continued using it. Now, the area under my eyes and my neck are are greatly improved!!!  It was truly worth the patience and faithful application.</li>
            <li> Always satisfied w/this product &amp; it is always delivered before the estimated due date.&lt;br /&gt;I have even recommended this product to both my mom &amp; sister who are constant users&lt;br /&gt;of this product as well.</li>
            <li> This product is also a fake hyped item and is not working for me at all. I don&#x27;t not understand why do people rate things that are below average, the reason is that such kind of reviews misguide the newly customers and publicize the item for no reasons which is very bad in my opinion. I don&#x27;t like this product and will never by it again just a waste of money, simple dove bath soap are much better than this for me.</li>
            <li> This does not work. It only dries out your skin really badly. Do not purchase. It made my skin like paper.</li>
            <li> Did not help me out at all and it gave me breakouts. Awful</li>
            <li> This product functions and works very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of it helping with my acne (I have super oily skin) and that it would brighten up my skin. Two stars because it&#x27;s a decent soap, but it did not work for me in those other aspects. My face/skin felt clean afterward but I didn&#x27;t feel any other benefits that I&#x27;d read about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this a fair chance and used it every day for about three to four months. Unfortunately, it just didn&#x27;t make a difference for me. Obviously others with a different skin type/luck might have better results, but I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use this product are all good for me</li>
            <li> after using this product for a full year i can say that it did wonders for my body and face!!!! i was a swimmer in high school for all four years! and we had an outdoor pool!!! im a light brown hispanic but when i was in high school they called me AKON in the locker room! yikes!!!! i was desperate to get back to my natural color and likas helped drastically!!! leave it on ur skin for 2-3 minutes then scrub and wash off! the water will literally turn grey! i know freaked me out at first.... however after helping me like 3/4 of the way till reach ing my color the product just stop working, stubbon i continued to use it for a month and the soap turned on me!!! i started getting acne breakouts and my skin just felt nasty!.... i say give it a try and keep using it and hopefully it wont tunr on you! lol but i must say goodbye to this product since im finally back to my color but need I reming you im a sophmore in college now! so two years later! no more outdoor pools for me!</li>
            <li> Great product! It took care of my acne , acne scars and my skin did brighten a bit. It does dry my skin a lot, but i apply my moisturizer and its ok.</li>
            <li> I want to start off by saying I&#x27;m African American. I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this soap. I have oily acne prone skin and this is just what I needed. This soap helps control the oil production in my skin therefor helping reduce breakouts. Its also helping brighten my skin not lighten or whiten it. My dark spots are slowly fading away. I love it I&#x27;ll be using this soap for a lifetime. Well worth it. Let me add that you should use a cleanser along with it for best results.</li>
            <li> This is the first Amazon review I&#x27;ve ever done. I ordered Likas Papaya and tried it. My experience with the product was so bad that I felt compelled to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is awful, just awful. After not even quite one week, I had to stop. My face was SO RED, SO ITCHY, and SO DRY. The soap was VERY irritating to my skin. Mind you, I didn&#x27;t heavily use it and my skin is not particularly sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, save your money and use it on another product elsewhere as I will be doing. Original Likas Papaya is NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Likas Papaya soap for a while. I went this past two years without using it and I miss this soap. I have less outbreaks when using this soap. I also don&#x27;t like tanning and like my natural Latino light skin color. This product just get rids of dead skin cells and makes the skin to its normal light color. Gets rid of tan lines threw out time, but it also blends it making tan lines not look as strong. (not a big fan of farmers tan lines)</li>
            <li> i havent used it yet but as far as people having mold on there soap mine came in fine, unopened package and smelled fresh im excited to use it</li>
            <li> Its smells weird but its okay i don&#x27;t mind using it since i already bought now i have to use it,, its not so for whitening its like regular bar soap just with a funky smell</li>
            <li> I first bought these two and I loved it, it smell good and cleans well however, when I run out I bought from a different seller in the package, I made sure the pack has the labels and all the award before buying, but when i used the other soap it semlls like a strong chemical. So even though i liked yours i do not know who is selling the fake Likas??</li>
            <li> i was so dissapointed when i receive my order it was open and smell bad and got mold and both of them was open already</li>
            <li> Its a good product and the shipping was instant..The product itself worked like most of the reviews said it would, so no worries there !!</li>
            <li> This is the real one!! I bought from many sellers and finally this one is authentic!! See the picture the left one is fake, the right one is from this seller that&#x27;s the real likas soap. The package and hologram and it&#x27;s much brighter than the fake one. The fake one has white powder on it this one doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Fake soaps..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like these are fake soaps.The boxes were both open when I received them. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the fake soaps.</li>
            <li> Likas Papaya Soap did not meet my expectations... I did not see any results and I have been using it for quite sometime now... I wouldn&#x27;t buy it anymore...</li>
            <li> great product, not sure how it works, but it does. Ive used at least 2 bars and I&#x27;m still using it and love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect it&#x27;s not really worth mentioning to friends but it works over time I haven&#x27;t gotten any acne since I started using it</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks. Don&#x27;t see any results but it&#x27;s still early and it&#x27;s a great soap either way!</li>
            <li> The soap appeared to have a beige color...it was not orange like it was supose to be..I really like the soap because it works,i think the product had to been old</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve done a fair share of research on this product and I have previously tried half a bar but it didn&#x27;t seem like it was doing anything to my skin. My main concern was that I have purchased a fake one..so I went ahead and bought another two bars from here to compare it to the previous one I bought. Now I believe I have the real one by the description however many reviews claimed that this product dries your skin but it had no such affect on my skin. It also has a mild waxy odor and I&#x27;m not sure if that was normal. It really hasn&#x27;t been whitening my skin but I have only been using the new ones for several weeks...and some say it takes a long time for it to work. I will provide an update in three months.</li>
            <li> only been a few days of using it 2 times daily and my skin feels sooo silky!! love it! only thing it leaves my skin feeling very dry so i use cocoa butter and its great!!! havent seen any lightening as of yet but will continue to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s main claim is skin whitening. My skin did not whiten. It is, however, a nice soap (it leaves the skin feeling soft and is ideal for sensitive skin). I did notice it helped reduce acne. It did not get rid of my acne but helped to reduce it. Overall, a nice soap but did not fulfill it&#x27;s main purpose - to whiten skin. PS. I used both soaps to their entirety.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product before.  I love it.  It lasts a long time.  Makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. It does make your skin peel with continued use. If you have sensitive skin, be very careful not to burn yourself with over use. My ex Co worker told me about it cause its a very well known product in the Phillipines to lighten skin.</li>
            <li> Keeps the skin looking and feeling healthy. I use it for face and body and I do see a little bit of brightening. i may order this product again or may try something else. This soap doesnt have much of a fragrance and that is good.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a geat soap. It cleanses the skin very well and has a light pleasant smell. It has done a wonderful job in lightening my dark spots. When i shower i lather the soap and leave it on for a couple minutes then rinse. It works most effectively that way. I recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good and I&#x27;ll always order it because It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!!!! After several weeks of use, I noticed my skin looks brighter.  It did not whiten the skin, it just look so refreshed.  It took the dullness away.  There is a drying affect after using the soap but I let my skin thoroughly dry and I moisturize my skin afterwards.  I recommended this to my son and he noticed a brightness as well.  I will order it again.  I purchased 2 bars and I am still on the first one.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for a yr now and I have to say that it is great. However, if your looking to do some extreme whitening this isn&#x27;t the soap for you. This soap is more of an exfoliant. Trust me when I say that it will be extremely drying at first but just invest in a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I noticed results very quickly with this soap.  I had dark spots on my face from a breakout and thought this might help and it did,  I have to use a moisturizer with it as it is very drieing on my face but effective</li>
            <li> I like this product it is good for exfoliation. I have been using it for a month now and it helps with the exfoliation of my skin.</li>
            <li> Despite the reviews I went ahead and ordered it but had mold in it. i was dissapointed with the product. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I will update the review when I use the product</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading many reviews.  It lathered very well, but was very drying on my skin (my skin felt tight and itchy).  I had to use a very creamy moisturizer afterwards.  It didn&#x27;t really whiten my skin either or help with cystic acne...at least for me anyway.  :(</li>
            <li> Just got my package and used it. I am impressed, it gave my skin a refreshing feeling. I&#x27;ll keep using it and see if it really whitens my skin and dark spots</li>
