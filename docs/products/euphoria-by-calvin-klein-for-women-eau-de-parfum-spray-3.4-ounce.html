            <li>I love the places that put out a bowl of coffee beans so you can cleanse your palate (olfactory style) in between sniffs.  </li>
            <li>My husband bought this perfume for me for my Mother&#x27;s day and i love it.</li>
            <li>and i fell in love</li>
            <li>Euphoria is my all time favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this lovely fragrance for years and have come to think of it as my signature scent.  </li>
            <li>Calvin Klein&#x27;s Euphoria has an interesting smell to it.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and bought the perfume based on the reviews, there are many things not mentioned in the product reviews</li>
            <li>I love this perfume for nights out.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel sexy</li>
            <li>i LOVE it..and will certainly buy more of it!!</li>
            <li>If you want to smell good and not over powering this is it and of course the price is right.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful scent, not too sweet, but a crisp and clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>Euphoria is a nice, strong scent, but it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>, it smells amazing and its 100% original</li>
            <li>Very rich, high-class fragrance.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone for themselves or for a nice gift for a special friend.</li>
            <li>, i wear this on special occasions, it smells really nice.</li>
            <li>Great smell, strong but very feminine, gives me confidence.</li>
            <li>It does have a very sexy touch to it which is probably why it always wins compliments...from men and women.</li>
            <li>She loves the scent and the bottle is kind of cool looking too.</li>
            <li>This is a super nice scent.</li>
            <li>and my sister loved it so much that I ordered it again to gift it to my sister and we both love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my wife and confess that I enjoy it the most because it smells so sexy on her.</li>
            <li>my favorite out of all the perfumes i have so far (and i do have a lot! :P)</li>
            <li>This is a large bottle and a good buy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to any woman who wants to smell great!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sweet, light and lovely in the beginning.</li>
            <li>So I found it on amazon at a considerably lower price and was so happy.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells fabulous, i have received many comments and I would recommend this perfume</li>
            <li>Just as delightful as I expected it too be.</li>
            <li>I love to wear it when I want to feel important or in charge.  </li>
            <li>I loved the fragrance so much that I had to order another bottle.  </li>
            <li>It really was a gorgeous fruity scent.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this fragance and will certainly buy more of it!</li>
            <li>Well Euphoria has a really nice distinct scent that makes it somewhat unique from most of the colognes.</li>
            <li>Love this smell, it&#x27;s such a beautiful sweet scent that I love on the friend that it was purchased for.</li>
            <li>This product is the original euphoria I love this fragance.</li>
            <li>The same gorgeous scent I always buy!</li>
            <li>Euphoria is one of the most beautiful fragrances I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.  </li>
            <li>shipped and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure future purchases will be made with Amazon at great savings.</li>
            <li>This makes choosing a gift for her easy for me.</li>
            <li>This 3.4 ounce eau de PARFUM spray is easily averaging $90 at department stores.</li>
            <li>Those of you who feel it&#x27;s too strong for</li>
            <li>This is by far, the most erotic scent I have ever worn.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit too musky/ too strong for me.</li>
            <li>Be sure that you&#x27;ll receive the right price because they offered me the product for 45 dollars and charged me 75!</li>
            <li>it was the exact product described at an amazing price.  </li>
            <li>It is not too sweet nor too overwhelming to anyone.</li>
            <li>:) Slightly sweet and floral and musky, but not overly-anything.</li>
            <li>I love Calvin but this fragrance is too sweet and not an alluring scent.</li>
            <li>The recipient was thrilled with the design of the bottle first off, I have yet to know how the fragrance itself is liked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is light, sweet, spicy &amp; sophisticated without being strong or overbearing.  </li>
            <li>Smells fine</li>
            <li>GREAT SELLER, FAST DELIVERY, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li>I cant stop smelling this perfume it smells delicious, mysterious, and very feminine!</li>
            <li>However, Amazon quickly responded by refunding my purchase :)</li>
            <li>I work at a large pet store and let&#x27;s be honest, sometimes it smells</li>
            <li>It has a light, flowery smell, which we both like.</li>
            <li>it was just way too cheap..</li>
            <li>It arrived within a few days, which I was also very happy about.</li>
            <li>she said she loves this size bottle,and at such a Great Prce...</li>
            <li>It was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It was affordable and she thinks its a great present.</li>
            <li>And you don&#x27;t really require alot of it to smell really nice throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>The mens cologne from the same line is just as great.  </li>
            <li>Calvin Klein &amp;#34;euphoria&amp;#34; smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>A number of people have commented favorably on it, although I wear it lightly.</li>
            <li>Shippin was free and received item within a week after submitting order.</li>
            <li>The ladies of the house really enjoy this item.</li>
            <li>Just keep making it available on Amazon &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34;..</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li>It is light, but lingering.  </li>
            <li>When I opened the delivery box the perfume box looked like what it was suppose to be, but when I took the bottle out of the box it had not lableling on it and the bottle was a cheap plastic</li>
            <li>One even asked me what the name of the perfume was because he liked it so much he wanted to buy a bottle for his wife...</li>
            <li>I also liked how fast I received it after I bought it.  </li>
            <li>and  fit  </li>
            <li>It does not smell like the one I got from the department store, It is light and fading after 5 mins, I wonder if you send me the actural Euphoria by Calvin Klein or something else</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still wondering why it&#x27;s gotten such great reviews.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic, and it is a lot cheaper than purchasing it through a retail store.</li>
            <li>I attempted to get a refund, as this smells nothing like the real product, and was kindly told I could check with Calvin Klein and link the batch number on the bottle.</li>
            <li>I know perfumes are an individual preference thing, but this smells great and isn&#x27;t overbearing.  </li>
            <li>but, I feel over 80% of women will enjoy this scent.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the fragrance.</li>
            <li>thanks to my loving husband</li>
            <li>I love This product, and your price was much more reasonable than the store.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a Xmas gift for my 33 year old granddaughter, and she absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>Fast service, great price,  the real deal.</li>
            <li>It has real staying power and smells better and better as the night goes on.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>A very intriguing smell...</li>
            <li>I love my perfume and this is my absolutely favorite fragrance, I usually get it at Sam&#x27;s club for a really good price but this price was even better...</li>
            <li>The scent itself doesn&#x27;t really fade easy most especially if you move alot - the more you will smell good if you do that.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it&#x27;s not overpowering just a rich aroma scent that smells clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>This is probably in the top 3 perfumes for me that my wife wears consistently.  </li>
            <li>I bought this original perfume, now my girlfriend loves me.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s original and was well packaged...</li>
            <li>i wear it to go clubbing or something, not office friendly unless you wear one spritz all over the body.</li>
            <li>I would expect it to be a higher quality, I have not tried it from a known authentic source</li>
            <li>Just love it so much!</li>
            <li>Still in original package.  </li>
            <li>I ordered several bottles at Christmas and was thrilled!</li>
            <li>So excited</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>My mom has worn this scent for 5+ years and it did not compare to the original.</li>
            <li>This seller should never be able to sell through you again as I made you aware of this immediately.</li>
            <li>Instantly in love like your first time.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for a trip to Vegas but ended up buying this again and again.</li>
            <li>It is a unique perfume with a unique chemistry and it is also versatile.</li>
            <li>Excelente colonia, 100% original.</li>
            <li>No the original.</li>
            <li>Smells rich, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Unique that it doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; musky celebrity-named odor that comes with the lower priced fragrances.  </li>
            <li>By the way, this smells like a sexy, provocitive, suductive perfume but also good to wear during the day because at the same time its clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looking for a new fragrance is far from my idea of a good time!  </li>
            <li>I would give Amazon 5 stars for price, free shipping, and quick arrival (came within 5 days of ordering).  </li>
            <li>My wife loves it, the price was fantastic and I was amazed at how quickly it arrived.</li>
            <li>If you like a scent that not&#x27;s heavy and floral, you&#x27;ll love this!</li>
            <li>I REALLY liked the original Euphoria which was clear in color, but I guess they discontinued it.  </li>
            <li>She will certainly want me to get her more of this product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for a special gift for my Mother.  </li>
            <li>Euphoria is for special moments, that doesn&#x27;t smell like ALL others, this scent is not over powering and always gets &amp;</li>
            <li>right!  </li>
            <li>EUPHORIA is exactly right!</li>
            <li>AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT!</li>
            <li>It has more of a fresh clean summery smell but would be great to use all year round.</li>
            <li>Great purchase, was as expected</li>
            <li>Smells great and is definitely the real deal!</li>
            <li>I love this product and it is very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I suppose it is true that you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>I was to receive a full refund with the additional money for shipping</li>
            <li>You ever buy something for someone and LOVE IT so much...</li>
            <li>It is very sensual and seductive and it makes you feel so sexy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had nice perfume, so I was really surprised that I could still smell it on my wrist when I got home from an 8 hour work shift.</li>
            <li>One of my co-workers described it as \\&quot;a really nice person smell, like someone who goes outside and naturally smells really good from being around woods and</li>
            <li>so seductive just a sweet parfume for a sweet price unlike the mall prices.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a christmas present for my girlfriend this year and she absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>I thought your price was much more reasonable than in department stores.</li>
            <li>Oh wait, no it sucks...don&#x27;t buy it because I want to be the only woman that smells that good.</li>
            <li>This is my daughter&#x27;s absolute favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>Has a sweet smell but</li>
            <li>This was a full 3.4 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li>, I had to have full size.</li>
            <li>The bottle has no markings on it at all as the true product does and it smells</li>
            <li>wow nice</li>
            <li>I have bought this for my former girlfriend and mother, and they both loved it.</li>
            <li>like I should&#x27;ve known better with the price and all fairness fast shipping</li>
            <li>I demanded a full refund and threw the junk out.  </li>
            <li>interestingly, after the whole 3.4 ounce of perfume being poured in my bag, my bag doesn&#x27;t smell that</li>
            <li>It has a sensual, yet sophisticated scent that is absolutely timeless.  </li>
            <li>Not too sweet or spicy</li>
            <li>thanks :)</li>
            <li>My husband loves it so that&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li>My mom doesn&#x27;t like it because she thinks it&#x27;s too sweet.</li>
            <li>but this is a botle full alcohol and water</li>
            <li>Everyone thought I was at Macy&#x27;s looking for hours to find the right perfume, and this did a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s pretty strong, not watery.</li>
            <li>The price is great for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li>I recently purhcased it as a birthday gift for her, and she was thrilled at how large it was, and I was thrilled at the amazing low price.  </li>
            <li>I was very thankful &amp; excited to find this!</li>
            <li>Euphoria is a great perfume for young adult women.</li>
            <li>Unopened box, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I was even more pleased when I got my actual bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li>A quick call to the manufacturer determined that it was manufactured in 2007.  </li>
            <li>Thank you amazon for offering this perfume at such great pricing and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>just wears off so quickly.</li>
            <li>must say, however, that I began choosing Euphoria only because my all time favorite fragrance is not made any more.  </li>
            <li>A quick trip to the store to sample</li>
            <li>like, most sprays, I feel it is too high priced.</li>
            <li>Very good small and quality</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and pretty.</li>
            <li>It has a very clean classic scent.</li>
            <li>After the first wear, it has become my absolute favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I will be back for sure!  </li>
            <li>it is exactly as described by the seller!</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m really bummed about that because it cost $55!!</li>
            <li>and I appreciated that!!</li>
            <li>Not the real deal!!</li>
            <li>Calvin Klein scents, this one is a total winner that I&#x27;ll make sure to keep on my shelf!</li>
            <li>It arrived early and the packaging was very secure</li>
            <li>it is enough to make the user smell amazing.</li>
            <li>Its smells light and which is what my wife wants and its EDP which means its not diluted with alcohol.</li>
            <li>So much so that it was like cheap men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>A nice bouquet of smells which lasts all day---very sensual from the male perspective !!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft yet somewhat sophisticated.  </li>
            <li>Product was just as expected, fragrance and strength were just as good as one bought at a box store, but</li>
            <li>It is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It just screams sexy, smoldering, and classy</li>
            <li>what can I say I love it, is soft and smell</li>
            <li>A friend of mine wears this scent and I know that some perfumes don&#x27;t always smell the same when they are on your own body, but I took a risk</li>
            <li>I gifted to my young sister-in-law</li>
            <li>It does smell nice, but comparing to the store bought one it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth it.    </li>
            <li>worth  </li>
            <li>it smelled so nice , then  the  following week i sprayed some on me</li>
            <li>Have always liked this, and I have been wearing this perfume for several years now.</li>
            <li>It has such a soft and sensual scent that I can&#x27;t resist but to keep smelling it lol.</li>
            <li>I will stick with retail stores for this product, price difference is worth it to get quality product.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, I often refer to it as my professional perfume.  </li>
            <li>Be cautious of overspraying because it is quite powerful, but without being stinky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to find this fragrance on Amazon right after I had smelled and fell in love with it at Macy&#x27;s Department Store.</li>
            <li>With the right spot on the body, you will smell dashing, trust me.</li>
            <li>Item was priced right for this product.  </li>
            <li>just the right evening fragrance</li>
            <li>it was the right size that I wanted.</li>
            <li>I like to get the product right away and with Amazon I did.</li>
            <li>I did research and the price was right for me.</li>
            <li>Gives the right tingle for men to lookup.</li>
            <li>And shipping was right on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I saw the bottle, the description of the fragrance, and the amount of positive reviews, I just had to get it!</li>
            <li>I bought an imitation of this perfume and my girlfriend loved it.</li>
            <li>Xmas present for my girlfriend doesn&#x27;t smell anywhere as good as the one she normally buys from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>&quot; I never thought I would like a Calvin Klein product so much, and I can&#x27;t wait to buy myself a full bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like pure alcohol!</li>
            <li>The product was delivered quickly and wrapped very well.  </li>
            <li>Scent last and seems to change making it more intriguing .  </li>
            <li>and I never really realized the difference between cheap perfume and top of the line.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast, too.</li>
            <li>Mild with a gentle smell.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price for this perfume.</li>
            <li>Thank You very much.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for the special lady in your life.</li>
            <li>I would say the perfume is very strong for a woman in her 20s (being an adult in my early 20s).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of musky and a little bit sweet.</li>
            <li>This is a great scent and was hard to find during Christmas week.</li>
            <li>Mission accomplished!</li>
            <li>it has a great long lasting smell.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I have received compliments and questions about what I&#x27;m wearing since the first time I used Euphoria.</li>
            <li>I visited a Sephora recently and the saleslady told me that this was her favorite scent.</li>
            <li>After I told her how much it had cost me, she couldn&#x27;t believe it either!</li>
            <li>I was first given this as a gift and am hooked on it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Since I first purchased this perfume 2</li>
            <li>Perfumes change their scent in 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing, because when I tried to return it, it says I can&#x27;t because of shipping.&lt;br /&gt;GO TO MACYS or another big department store and buy it even if it costs more.</li>
            <li>My wife has several fragrances of comparable price and this is her favorite.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume to date, and I have tried many over the past decade.</li>
            <li>I have used Euphoria for several years and love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is crisp and sensual.  </li>
            <li>Scent last many hours after application.</li>
            <li>She says she wants to take herself on a date when she wears it!  </li>
            <li>Product was exactly as advertised and my wife could not be happier.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent for several years.  </li>
            <li>I work with the public and get many compliments on this perfume.  </li>
            <li>Crisp fragrance with lots of floral.  </li>
            <li>Love this wear it daily</li>
            <li>The only thing I dislike is the way the sprayer works as it will rotate in the top so you always have to check where the mister hole is to avoid being sprayed elsewhere.</li>
            <li>this product was just as i expected with sweet undercurrents and lovely over all notes.</li>
            <li>My husband had purchased this perfume for me the first time I tried it</li>
            <li>I first purchased for $80 dollars.  </li>
            <li>It was definitely not fake.</li>
            <li>It sprays in a stream instead of a mist and the smell last, for at most, 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as advertised...</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>If I could only capture those top notes...</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>.this was my first time to order on line</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this perfume a couple of years ago and people are constantly complimenting me on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for everything!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just that by the middle of the day, it seems not to be there any more.</li>
            <li>Only Calvin Klein scent that I find to like, most of the others just tend to be dated.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad the price is as low as it is on amazon!</li>
            <li>Will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>This bottle she say will last her a year or more.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t exactly smell like flowers.</li>
            <li>I really loved the smell of this perfume for the first few hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always love Calvin Klein products especially the perfumes but the Euphoria is just not for me.</li>
            <li>Ever lasting lovely odour.</li>
            <li>My husbands first words</li>
            <li>I ORDERED PRETTY CLOSE TO CHRISTMAS, BUT IT ARRIVED  WITH TIME TO SPARE.  </li>
            <li>This is first time we bought online</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>It is the first time it happens when I make an online purchase to lose money and do not send me the product.</li>
            <li>My wife fell in love with this fragrance at a local store.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering it last for day I love smelling it on her.</li>
            <li>This perfume is exactly how it&#x27;s described . . .</li>
            <li>she did not only like it but love it</li>
            <li>Well worth the money and get a lot of good comments when walking past people.</li>
            <li>Not the first time I have bought it for my wife.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I love this scent, but of course, scents are different on everyone.</li>
            <li>I first found this perfume looking through a magazine.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and very nice smell.</li>
            <li>but at the same time I&#x27;m sure there is something to be said for your nose just getting used to certain scents.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally not into heavy, warm smells, but this smells SO sexy and seductive!</li>
            <li>It smells classy, clean and luxurious when she puts it on.</li>
            <li>As for the scent, I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend for younger girls under 20, and I think it is more for fall/winter.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent so much that instead of buying another brand for variety, I am buying another 3.4 oz bottle which will last me another 4 years.</li>
            <li>This perfume has a lovely scent and it&#x27;s not super sweet like some of them.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t know the scent previously and took a chance, my own fault for not going to Macy&#x27;s to sample it first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for 4 years now and keep getting positive remarks from people.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for very efficiently meet my request!</li>
            <li>A perfect blend of black violet, pomegranate, black orchid, mahogany wood, persimmon, and lotus blossom.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to purchase this product for half the price that I would pay in the department store for the same exact item.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been one to wear perfume because most are too musky and strong for me, or I get tired of the scent quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to open</li>
            <li>That means a lot because he&#x27;s very particular about scents.  </li>
            <li>Purchased the Euphoria as a Xmas gift for my sister who is very particular about her scents.</li>
            <li>I especially like it because it is not too strong, but lasts all day.</li>
            <li>and she describes it as long lasting and good quality perfume.  </li>
            <li>it smelled different plus wasnt as strong</li>
            <li>Would certainly buy again.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is so smart.</li>
            <li>This is pure sophistication in a bottle.</li>
            <li>They were always out of the large bottle for sale then when I compared the price with Amazon and the store even with the 30% off coupon</li>
            <li>This bottle is LARGE.</li>
            <li>it is soft and not overwhelming aroma not a fan of perfume but love it when the love of my life wears it</li>
            <li>smells good but the box comes with no wrapper.dont know why is it so?is it a returned one or what.first time i ordered  a perfume without knowing the smell ,i just went with the reviews and ordered it.iam not happy with the packing and never expected this from items sold directly by amazon.as far as smell is concerned,its good.</li>
            <li>Also, buyer beware:  package perfume gift sets often contain OLDER perfumes!</li>
            <li>Smelled very old!!</li>
            <li>She really likes it.  </li>
            <li>Money very well spend...</li>
            <li>As always I get fast service</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this perfume!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and hope that CK doesn&#x27;t ever discontinue this product!</li>
            <li>Fast service and product was as advertised and came in factory box.</li>
            <li>Amazon has a reputation with their perfumes and authenticity, this stuff is real and</li>
            <li>And thanks to the company for sending it to me.</li>
            <li>It was much cheaper to buy through amazon then go to the department store.  </li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t know how to describe this scent.</li>
            <li>thanks again...</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for my mother, and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>and it really does the trick, trust me.</li>
            <li>AND WAS MUCH CHEAPER THAN THE STORE</li>
            <li>She wears it very well</li>
            <li>and I find it very pleasing.</li>
            <li>Well, i really don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li>Thanks so muc.</li>
            <li>and this is very close.  </li>
            <li>This is the real product, I&#x27;ve purchased from Macys for years and couldn&#x27;t pass up this deal.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>I really like this scent, have used it for a couple of years.  </li>
            <li>would buy it again real soon.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It was a gift for my friend, I really like it</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>A local store had it for sale, buy one, get one for free.</li>
            <li>or very close.</li>
            <li>Very feminine.</li>
            <li>and i really like it</li>
            <li>I will never shop at Amazon again if this is not addressed real soon, and it has been over a week and don&#x27;t see it happening.  </li>
            <li>and I must say it smells really well.</li>
            <li>which is very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But very price.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted this perfume and it was 85.00 at macys</li>
            <li>and I really expected more out of it.</li>
            <li>It was not the real version at all.</li>
            <li>this one is like a women&#x27;s cologne and is really close to a man&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>I really like the Euphoria by Calvin Klein.  </li>
            <li>by Calvin Klein for Women, Eau De Parfum Spray, 3.4 Ounce sells for twice as much in departments stores.</li>
            <li>The scent was NOT even close to real Euphoria.  </li>
            <li>It really does smell like euphoria</li>
            <li>the whole lid fall apart in my bag after 5 days.</li>
            <li>Used it so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nothing to rave about.</li>
            <li>If you really want to see how it smells, try it on at Sephora or buy a sample vial off eBay like I did.</li>
            <li>The price was a real bargain.</li>
            <li>It is very sensual and lasts all day, yet isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It was much cheaper than going to Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This perfume is really the calvin klein version.</li>
            <li>It is the real deal &amp; I can&#x27;t beat the price or delivery from anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>A very sensual scent.</li>
            <li>doesnt have much of a smell will not purchase it again</li>
            <li>I thought the price was reasonable too.</li>
            <li>Very seductive and aromatic fragance.,</li>
            <li>I appreciated so much.</li>
            <li>thanks again Carlena</li>
            <li>thanks.....</li>
            <li>do much to smell it yourself.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Amazon, I really like bargains.</li>
            <li>So the shopping process is very cautious.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting and very elegant scent.</li>
            <li>Warm but not too heavy and floral but not to flowery.</li>
            <li>It shipped pretty quickly and it came in the same purple/mauve box it does elsewhere.</li>
            <li>It is subtle and elegant; does not \\&quot;fill\\&quot; your nostrils like cheap perfume does.</li>
            <li>GET MORE COMPLIMENTS FROM EUPHORIA THAN ANY OTHER.  </li>
            <li>You cant go wrong, and It smells really really good!</li>
            <li>HAVE RECEIVED MORE COMPLIMENTS ON THIS COLOGNE THAN ANY OTHER COLOGNE</li>
            <li>It does not have the last effecting or the fresh smell!</li>
            <li>I just got it in today, so I&#x27;m excited to wear it out because a lot of people say they constantly get compliments on it.</li>
            <li>She has been using it for some time now along with other perfumes but this is the one she loves most.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this item in the past numerous times at Boscov&#x27;s, Kohl&#x27;s, and Macy&#x27;s with great satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Nice smell but does not last long at all!  </li>
            <li>This perfume is STRONG and SUPER LONG LASTING!</li>
            <li>It is so expensive in the department stores, I was happy to find it at such a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, smells amazing, stays on all day, and double the price in other stores... buy it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly floral and spicy without being overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>but, when I first started using it {about 2 years ago}, I also bought a small silver canister for my purse that was more like the oil.   </li>
            <li>Gift sets are known to have older shelf dates.</li>
            <li>and I was lucky enough to get a gift card to Amazon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of those classic perfumes to have, which work in all situations.</li>
            <li>even though i feel this perfume has a  lovely scent i dont understand why it smells different after the 2nd week ...</li>
            <li>Now one thing I know for sure about Euphoria is that is smells differently when sprayed on different parts of my body.</li>
            <li>This scent is classic and has the ability to mutate from day to evening.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this as a gift item to...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat a high end perfume for the price that I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>and it was rated highly.  </li>
            <li>buy fragrances on the high end because Emeraude was four decades ago</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what you get with a high quality perfume.</li>
            <li>Lasts far longer than most other perfumes my wife has used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean, neat scent that can smell professional and decently homely at the same time.</li>
            <li>but i like euphoria blossom a little bit better,</li>
            <li>I had a tough time finding a scent that is a good balance.</li>
            <li>This is a great scent for Fall/Winter - &amp;#34;Heavier/dense&amp;#34; scent that will fit the mood when snuggling up with the fleece blanket when it&#x27;s cold and snowing outside.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe the great deal on Amazon for this and was a bit worried by the comments about it being a fake.</li>
            <li>The last thing I do before leaving the house is spray on Euphoria and it always makes me smile.</li>
            <li>One  more thing though, the scent of euphoria doesn&#x27;t last as long as it used to.</li>
            <li>You absolutely can&#x27;t beat this price, especially for Eau de Parfum, which lasts longer and is a higher quality perfume than Eau de Toilette.</li>
            <li>I saw Euphoria on amazon.com for 1/2 the price I normally pay</li>
            <li>:) So I put it on everyday.  </li>
            <li>a total savings and worth it.  </li>
            <li>and I secretly go behind her to use it because it smells so good .</li>
            <li>Love the smell, although it does not last very long.</li>
            <li>but like many of these other reviews it is definitely not the real deal  </li>
            <li>The brick/mortar Euphoria is on the left with the product I bought from Amazon on the right.  </li>
            <li>Smells and lasts just like if you were to purchase right in the store such as Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It is not fake, smells and lasts exactly the same as bought from the store  for the double as much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how to review a perfume since you all can&#x27;t smell it, but seriously, this is the best perfume ever.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, the new bottle has a lot number stamped on the bottom.  </li>
            <li>It was cheaper for the 3.4oz bottle from Amazon than I could find a 1.7oz bottle for at any store around where I live.</li>
            <li>While I was at work, I couldn&#x27;t help but tell my co-workers, and as soon as I mentioned that I was trying a new perfume they all said</li>
            <li>It came in a box wrapped and brand new.</li>
            <li>It might have taken even longer for me to find a new fragrance, but I had a stroke of luck... a friend of mine was wearing Euphoria, and I asked about it.  </li>
            <li>Brand new in sealed packaging, not a scratch on the box or bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be more careful in the future.</li>
            <li>excellence in service and price , I will beback to you in the near future, wish you continue success with your bussiness</li>
            <li>I spent a LOT more at department store for same exact item (same quality too)!  </li>
            <li>Gave it to a very old man.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sensual but very soft and wears well throughout the day.</li>
            <li>it was a very masculine musk.  </li>
            <li>The smell is also not exactly the same as the authentic version.  </li>
            <li>My wife has worn Euphoria for years and the scent drives me wild!</li>
            <li>The one I bought was sold by AND fulfilled by Amazon, and it&#x27;s definitely the real thing!</li>
            <li>Love this, I have had this for Men in the past, and I bought my wife some for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I will be getting more for other family members for next christma and birthday presents.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the exact same product sold in stores.</li>
            <li>i was so excited because this was a present i want to present my wife.</li>
            <li>I went with the 3.4oz, double the size of the smaller, as it was only $5 more.</li>
            <li>Exactly the same scent.</li>
            <li>But for those reading the review...it is exactly the same as the bottle I bought at Belks 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>And it DOES last through the whole day!</li>
            <li>The smell is not your typical light and flowerly perfume.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m left wanting the sweet back.</li>
            <li>The bottle itself appears to be authentic, but the content.s are pale lavender while my new bottle is filled with dark orchid-colored product (with a scent at least three times as strong).  </li>
            <li>I love this product, it&#x27;s a bigger bottle than I have purchased in the store for LESS $.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance (somewhat woodsy) while the black orchids give it a romantic feel</li>
            <li>It seems like Amazon sold me some old product.  </li>
            <li>This will be my 5th bottle so far.  </li>
            <li>OLD FAITHFUL!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ever tear out one of those perfume testers from a magazine and become completely captivated by the fragrance?</li>
            <li>Very costly for such a week perfume-sorry Calvin.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if its old or what ?</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 10 years and it has never got old.</li>
            <li>I have received a number of compliments from friends and complete strangers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know anything about smells (my sister told me there are soft smells, floral smells</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was just old</li>
            <li>I would not only recommend purchasing this product but highly recommend purchasing from this seller!</li>
            <li>I went ahead and found a low price online, ordered it for Christmas, and it came on time, and was received very well on unwrapping day.</li>
            <li>It came unopened, new in the box, exactly as described, and sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li>It is bold yet it tones down as you rub it on your skin.</li>
            <li>But worth tracking the prices as it changes several times but on an average amazon price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not too strong but not too weak either, right in the middle</li>
            <li>It is a subtle, interesting scent that doesn&#x27;t over power</li>
            <li>I get many compliments when wearing it as it is a subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li>The scent is distinct and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>No matter what buyer i buy this particular fragrance from, it always smells the same.</li>
            <li>You actually have to be careful on how much you put on because it is strong and does last long, and it lingers on your clothes.</li>
            <li>it lasted me a long time because you do not need to put that much of it on every time.</li>
            <li>could barely detect a hint of the fragrance, even when holding my wrist directly under my nose.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s partially my fault for not getting a tester first I suppose.</li>
            <li>Might last all year with such a large bottle of it.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve smelled at least 3 other brands that had nearly the EXACT SAME SCENT!</li>
            <li>It came in the sealed original box just as if I bought it from the mall but only half price.</li>
            <li>The perfume appeared to be a new box and bottle but obviously was NOT the perfume I ordered.  </li>
            <li>and this is my new go to daily choice.</li>
            <li>BUT every time I order a new bottle it is different.&lt;br /&gt;the color changes, the bottle is the same shape but the part that is silver is not always silver.</li>
            <li>VERY reasonable price-half the price comparing with other retailers.</li>
            <li>and now I feel I spent a ton of money on either a fake or maybe something that was out of date and lost the great smell of Euphoria.  </li>
            <li>I love how little you need to spray and it actually lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>i do always go to amazon first, and i did buy before euphoria and other perfume&#x27;s too - no problems whatsoever</li>
            <li>She has found it at other places but at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li>And we are not able to return the product due to: &amp;#34;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.&amp;#34; Overall, I would not recommend or buy this product again.</li>
            <li>Excelente compra, el producto llego en buen estado y a tiempo, de manera general podria recalcar que es una fragancia exquisita</li>
            <li>Addicting Scent - Seductive and romantic, but also classy.</li>
            <li>most frustrating thing is that you cannot even return it as it is &amp;#34;flamable material&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The first day I wore it, when I got home, I immediately showered to get the scent off me because it was slightly nauseating.</li>
            <li>, what are you wearing&amp;#34; small comment to make a lady feel a little special!!</li>
            <li>I would also suggest getting this straight from Amazon as opposed to other sellers or a retailor you trust as there are lots of counterfeits being sold out there.</li>
            <li>It is important to be careful not to purchase any fragrance that has been bottled for too long because the scent has a tendency not to last very long.</li>
            <li>The main notes are rose hip, Japanese apple, green leaves, Lotus, black orchid, red woods, black violet and amber.  </li>
            <li>I checked locally and this was a large bottle compared to the smaller one and much cheaper than the small bottle.</li>
            <li>It is a really light fragrance with a long staying power, so a little go a long way.</li>
            <li>For the past year, I had assumed I was just so accustomed to the scent that it seemed less potent.  </li>
            <li>disappointed with the product, but amazon customer service is always great</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the fragrance was very light as compared to other Euphoria purchases that were made at department stores.  </li>
            <li>It is the exact same scent, bottle, packaging of the one in the local beauty store r way less.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my wife and she was amazed at how large the bottle was, and how little it cost.  </li>
            <li>Then I opened my new bottle and spritzed on the other.</li>
            <li>&quot; Even though it&#x27;s not over-powering, it&#x27;s still a little heavy, so if you wanted something light for the summer</li>
            <li>At the beginning I was not satisfied because the scent was not as strong as my previous ones, and it was not lasting as the ones I had</li>

            <li> Amazon better have their stores.</li>
            <li> The favorite was \\&quot;Initial\\&quot; by Boucheron.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was exquisite - like a white pearl.  </li>
            <li> I love the places that put out a bowl of coffee beans so you can cleanse your palate (olfactory style) in between sniffs.  </li>
            <li> My husband bought this perfume for me for my Mother&#x27;s day and i love it.</li>
            <li> and i fell in love</li>
            <li> Euphoria is my all time favorite scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this lovely fragrance for years and have come to think of it as my signature scent.  </li>
            <li> Calvin Klein&#x27;s Euphoria has an interesting smell to it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and bought the perfume based on the reviews, there are many things not mentioned in the product reviews</li>
            <li> I love this perfume for nights out.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel sexy</li>
            <li> i LOVE it..and will certainly buy more of it!!</li>
            <li> If you want to smell good and not over powering this is it and of course the price is right.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful scent, not too sweet, but a crisp and clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> Euphoria is a nice, strong scent, but it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> , it smells amazing and its 100% original</li>
            <li> Very rich, high-class fragrance.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone for themselves or for a nice gift for a special friend.</li>
            <li> , i wear this on special occasions, it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Great smell, strong but very feminine, gives me confidence.</li>
            <li> It does have a very sexy touch to it which is probably why it always wins compliments...from men and women.</li>
            <li> She loves the scent and the bottle is kind of cool looking too.</li>
            <li> This is a super nice scent.</li>
            <li> and my sister loved it so much that I ordered it again to gift it to my sister and we both love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife and confess that I enjoy it the most because it smells so sexy on her.</li>
            <li> my favorite out of all the perfumes i have so far (and i do have a lot! :P)</li>
            <li> This is a large bottle and a good buy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to any woman who wants to smell great!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sweet, light and lovely in the beginning.</li>
            <li> So I found it on amazon at a considerably lower price and was so happy.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells fabulous, i have received many comments and I would recommend this perfume</li>
            <li> Just as delightful as I expected it too be.</li>
            <li> I love to wear it when I want to feel important or in charge.  </li>
            <li> I loved the fragrance so much that I had to order another bottle.  </li>
            <li> It really was a gorgeous fruity scent.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this fragance and will certainly buy more of it!</li>
            <li> Well Euphoria has a really nice distinct scent that makes it somewhat unique from most of the colognes.</li>
            <li> Love this smell, it&#x27;s such a beautiful sweet scent that I love on the friend that it was purchased for.</li>
            <li> This product is the original euphoria I love this fragance.</li>
            <li> The same gorgeous scent I always buy!</li>
            <li> Euphoria is one of the most beautiful fragrances I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.  </li>
            <li> shipped and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure future purchases will be made with Amazon at great savings.</li>
            <li> This makes choosing a gift for her easy for me.</li>
            <li> This 3.4 ounce eau de PARFUM spray is easily averaging $90 at department stores.</li>
            <li> Those of you who feel it&#x27;s too strong for</li>
            <li> This is by far, the most erotic scent I have ever worn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too musky/ too strong for me.</li>
            <li> Be sure that you&#x27;ll receive the right price because they offered me the product for 45 dollars and charged me 75!</li>
            <li> it was the exact product described at an amazing price.  </li>
            <li> It is not too sweet nor too overwhelming to anyone.</li>
            <li> :) Slightly sweet and floral and musky, but not overly-anything.</li>
            <li> I love Calvin but this fragrance is too sweet and not an alluring scent.</li>
            <li> The recipient was thrilled with the design of the bottle first off, I have yet to know how the fragrance itself is liked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is light, sweet, spicy &amp; sophisticated without being strong or overbearing.  </li>
            <li> Smells fine</li>
            <li> GREAT SELLER, FAST DELIVERY, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li> I cant stop smelling this perfume it smells delicious, mysterious, and very feminine!</li>
            <li> However, Amazon quickly responded by refunding my purchase :)</li>
            <li> I work at a large pet store and let&#x27;s be honest, sometimes it smells</li>
            <li> It has a light, flowery smell, which we both like.</li>
            <li> it was just way too cheap..</li>
            <li> It arrived within a few days, which I was also very happy about.</li>
            <li> she said she loves this size bottle,and at such a Great Prce...</li>
            <li> It was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It was affordable and she thinks its a great present.</li>
            <li> And you don&#x27;t really require alot of it to smell really nice throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much</li>
            <li> The mens cologne from the same line is just as great.  </li>
            <li> Calvin Klein &amp;#34;euphoria&amp;#34; smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> A number of people have commented favorably on it, although I wear it lightly.</li>
            <li> Shippin was free and received item within a week after submitting order.</li>
            <li> The ladies of the house really enjoy this item.</li>
            <li> Just keep making it available on Amazon &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34;..</li>
            <li> Perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It is light, but lingering.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the delivery box the perfume box looked like what it was suppose to be, but when I took the bottle out of the box it had not lableling on it and the bottle was a cheap plastic</li>
            <li> One even asked me what the name of the perfume was because he liked it so much he wanted to buy a bottle for his wife...</li>
            <li> I also liked how fast I received it after I bought it.  </li>
            <li> and  fit  </li>
            <li> It does not smell like the one I got from the department store, It is light and fading after 5 mins, I wonder if you send me the actural Euphoria by Calvin Klein or something else</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still wondering why it&#x27;s gotten such great reviews.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, and it is a lot cheaper than purchasing it through a retail store.</li>
            <li> I attempted to get a refund, as this smells nothing like the real product, and was kindly told I could check with Calvin Klein and link the batch number on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I know perfumes are an individual preference thing, but this smells great and isn&#x27;t overbearing.  </li>
            <li> but, I feel over 80% of women will enjoy this scent.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the fragrance.</li>
            <li> thanks to my loving husband</li>
            <li> I love This product, and your price was much more reasonable than the store.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Xmas gift for my 33 year old granddaughter, and she absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li> Fast service, great price,  the real deal.</li>
            <li> It has real staying power and smells better and better as the night goes on.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> A very intriguing smell...</li>
            <li> I love my perfume and this is my absolutely favorite fragrance, I usually get it at Sam&#x27;s club for a really good price but this price was even better...</li>
            <li> The scent itself doesn&#x27;t really fade easy most especially if you move alot - the more you will smell good if you do that.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it&#x27;s not overpowering just a rich aroma scent that smells clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> This is probably in the top 3 perfumes for me that my wife wears consistently.  </li>
            <li> I bought this original perfume, now my girlfriend loves me.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s original and was well packaged...</li>
            <li> i wear it to go clubbing or something, not office friendly unless you wear one spritz all over the body.</li>
            <li> I would expect it to be a higher quality, I have not tried it from a known authentic source</li>
            <li> Just love it so much!</li>
            <li> Still in original package.  </li>
            <li> I ordered several bottles at Christmas and was thrilled!</li>
            <li> So excited</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> My mom has worn this scent for 5+ years and it did not compare to the original.</li>
            <li> This seller should never be able to sell through you again as I made you aware of this immediately.</li>
            <li> Instantly in love like your first time.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for a trip to Vegas but ended up buying this again and again.</li>
            <li> It is a unique perfume with a unique chemistry and it is also versatile.</li>
            <li> Excelente colonia, 100% original.</li>
            <li> No the original.</li>
            <li> Smells rich, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Unique that it doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; musky celebrity-named odor that comes with the lower priced fragrances.  </li>
            <li> By the way, this smells like a sexy, provocitive, suductive perfume but also good to wear during the day because at the same time its clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looking for a new fragrance is far from my idea of a good time!  </li>
            <li> I would give Amazon 5 stars for price, free shipping, and quick arrival (came within 5 days of ordering).  </li>
            <li> My wife loves it, the price was fantastic and I was amazed at how quickly it arrived.</li>
            <li> If you like a scent that not&#x27;s heavy and floral, you&#x27;ll love this!</li>
            <li> I REALLY liked the original Euphoria which was clear in color, but I guess they discontinued it.  </li>
            <li> She will certainly want me to get her more of this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a special gift for my Mother.  </li>
            <li> Euphoria is for special moments, that doesn&#x27;t smell like ALL others, this scent is not over powering and always gets &amp;</li>
            <li> right!  </li>
            <li> EUPHORIA is exactly right!</li>
            <li> AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT!</li>
            <li> It has more of a fresh clean summery smell but would be great to use all year round.</li>
            <li> Great purchase, was as expected</li>
            <li> Smells great and is definitely the real deal!</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> I suppose it is true that you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> I was to receive a full refund with the additional money for shipping</li>
            <li> You ever buy something for someone and LOVE IT so much...</li>
            <li> It is very sensual and seductive and it makes you feel so sexy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had nice perfume, so I was really surprised that I could still smell it on my wrist when I got home from an 8 hour work shift.</li>
            <li> One of my co-workers described it as \\&quot;a really nice person smell, like someone who goes outside and naturally smells really good from being around woods and</li>
            <li> so seductive just a sweet parfume for a sweet price unlike the mall prices.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a christmas present for my girlfriend this year and she absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> I thought your price was much more reasonable than in department stores.</li>
            <li> Oh wait, no it sucks...don&#x27;t buy it because I want to be the only woman that smells that good.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s absolute favorite scent.  </li>
            <li> Has a sweet smell but</li>
            <li> This was a full 3.4 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> , I had to have full size.</li>
            <li> The bottle has no markings on it at all as the true product does and it smells</li>
            <li> wow nice</li>
            <li> I have bought this for my former girlfriend and mother, and they both loved it.</li>
            <li> like I should&#x27;ve known better with the price and all fairness fast shipping</li>
            <li> I demanded a full refund and threw the junk out.  </li>
            <li> interestingly, after the whole 3.4 ounce of perfume being poured in my bag, my bag doesn&#x27;t smell that</li>
            <li> It has a sensual, yet sophisticated scent that is absolutely timeless.  </li>
            <li> Not too sweet or spicy</li>
            <li> thanks :)</li>
            <li> My husband loves it so that&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li> My mom doesn&#x27;t like it because she thinks it&#x27;s too sweet.</li>
            <li> but this is a botle full alcohol and water</li>
            <li> Everyone thought I was at Macy&#x27;s looking for hours to find the right perfume, and this did a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s pretty strong, not watery.</li>
            <li> The price is great for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li> I recently purhcased it as a birthday gift for her, and she was thrilled at how large it was, and I was thrilled at the amazing low price.  </li>
            <li> I was very thankful &amp; excited to find this!</li>
            <li> Euphoria is a great perfume for young adult women.</li>
            <li> Unopened box, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I was even more pleased when I got my actual bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li> A quick call to the manufacturer determined that it was manufactured in 2007.  </li>
            <li> Thank you amazon for offering this perfume at such great pricing and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> just wears off so quickly.</li>
            <li> must say, however, that I began choosing Euphoria only because my all time favorite fragrance is not made any more.  </li>
            <li> A quick trip to the store to sample</li>
            <li> like, most sprays, I feel it is too high priced.</li>
            <li> Very good small and quality</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and pretty.</li>
            <li> It has a very clean classic scent.</li>
            <li> After the first wear, it has become my absolute favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I will be back for sure!  </li>
            <li> it is exactly as described by the seller!</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m really bummed about that because it cost $55!!</li>
            <li> and I appreciated that!!</li>
            <li> Not the real deal!!</li>
            <li> Calvin Klein scents, this one is a total winner that I&#x27;ll make sure to keep on my shelf!</li>
            <li> It arrived early and the packaging was very secure</li>
            <li> it is enough to make the user smell amazing.</li>
            <li> Its smells light and which is what my wife wants and its EDP which means its not diluted with alcohol.</li>
            <li> So much so that it was like cheap men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> A nice bouquet of smells which lasts all day---very sensual from the male perspective !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft yet somewhat sophisticated.  </li>
            <li> Product was just as expected, fragrance and strength were just as good as one bought at a box store, but</li>
            <li> It is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It just screams sexy, smoldering, and classy</li>
            <li> what can I say I love it, is soft and smell</li>
            <li> A friend of mine wears this scent and I know that some perfumes don&#x27;t always smell the same when they are on your own body, but I took a risk</li>
            <li> I gifted to my young sister-in-law</li>
            <li> It does smell nice, but comparing to the store bought one it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well worth it.    </li>
            <li> worth  </li>
            <li> it smelled so nice , then  the  following week i sprayed some on me</li>
            <li> Have always liked this, and I have been wearing this perfume for several years now.</li>
            <li> It has such a soft and sensual scent that I can&#x27;t resist but to keep smelling it lol.</li>
            <li> I will stick with retail stores for this product, price difference is worth it to get quality product.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, I often refer to it as my professional perfume.  </li>
            <li> Be cautious of overspraying because it is quite powerful, but without being stinky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to find this fragrance on Amazon right after I had smelled and fell in love with it at Macy&#x27;s Department Store.</li>
            <li> With the right spot on the body, you will smell dashing, trust me.</li>
            <li> Item was priced right for this product.  </li>
            <li> just the right evening fragrance</li>
            <li> it was the right size that I wanted.</li>
            <li> I like to get the product right away and with Amazon I did.</li>
            <li> I did research and the price was right for me.</li>
            <li> Gives the right tingle for men to lookup.</li>
            <li> And shipping was right on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I saw the bottle, the description of the fragrance, and the amount of positive reviews, I just had to get it!</li>
            <li> I bought an imitation of this perfume and my girlfriend loved it.</li>
            <li> Xmas present for my girlfriend doesn&#x27;t smell anywhere as good as the one she normally buys from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> &quot; I never thought I would like a Calvin Klein product so much, and I can&#x27;t wait to buy myself a full bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like pure alcohol!</li>
            <li> The product was delivered quickly and wrapped very well.  </li>
            <li> Scent last and seems to change making it more intriguing .  </li>
            <li> and I never really realized the difference between cheap perfume and top of the line.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast, too.</li>
            <li> Mild with a gentle smell.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price for this perfume.</li>
            <li> Thank You very much.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for the special lady in your life.</li>
            <li> I would say the perfume is very strong for a woman in her 20s (being an adult in my early 20s).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of musky and a little bit sweet.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent and was hard to find during Christmas week.</li>
            <li> Mission accomplished!</li>
            <li> it has a great long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I have received compliments and questions about what I&#x27;m wearing since the first time I used Euphoria.</li>
            <li> I visited a Sephora recently and the saleslady told me that this was her favorite scent.</li>
            <li> After I told her how much it had cost me, she couldn&#x27;t believe it either!</li>
            <li> I was first given this as a gift and am hooked on it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Since I first purchased this perfume 2</li>
            <li> Perfumes change their scent in 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing, because when I tried to return it, it says I can&#x27;t because of shipping.&lt;br /&gt;GO TO MACYS or another big department store and buy it even if it costs more.</li>
            <li> My wife has several fragrances of comparable price and this is her favorite.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume to date, and I have tried many over the past decade.</li>
            <li> I have used Euphoria for several years and love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is crisp and sensual.  </li>
            <li> Scent last many hours after application.</li>
            <li> She says she wants to take herself on a date when she wears it!  </li>
            <li> Product was exactly as advertised and my wife could not be happier.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent for several years.  </li>
            <li> I work with the public and get many compliments on this perfume.  </li>
            <li> Crisp fragrance with lots of floral.  </li>
            <li> Love this wear it daily</li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike is the way the sprayer works as it will rotate in the top so you always have to check where the mister hole is to avoid being sprayed elsewhere.</li>
            <li> this product was just as i expected with sweet undercurrents and lovely over all notes.</li>
            <li> My husband had purchased this perfume for me the first time I tried it</li>
            <li> I first purchased for $80 dollars.  </li>
            <li> It was definitely not fake.</li>
            <li> It sprays in a stream instead of a mist and the smell last, for at most, 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as advertised...</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> If I could only capture those top notes...</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> .this was my first time to order on line</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this perfume a couple of years ago and people are constantly complimenting me on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for everything!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just that by the middle of the day, it seems not to be there any more.</li>
            <li> Only Calvin Klein scent that I find to like, most of the others just tend to be dated.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad the price is as low as it is on amazon!</li>
            <li> Will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> This bottle she say will last her a year or more.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t exactly smell like flowers.</li>
            <li> I really loved the smell of this perfume for the first few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always love Calvin Klein products especially the perfumes but the Euphoria is just not for me.</li>
            <li> Ever lasting lovely odour.</li>
            <li> My husbands first words</li>
            <li> I ORDERED PRETTY CLOSE TO CHRISTMAS, BUT IT ARRIVED  WITH TIME TO SPARE.  </li>
            <li> This is first time we bought online</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> It is the first time it happens when I make an online purchase to lose money and do not send me the product.</li>
            <li> My wife fell in love with this fragrance at a local store.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering it last for day I love smelling it on her.</li>
            <li> This perfume is exactly how it&#x27;s described . . .</li>
            <li> she did not only like it but love it</li>
            <li> Well worth the money and get a lot of good comments when walking past people.</li>
            <li> Not the first time I have bought it for my wife.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, but of course, scents are different on everyone.</li>
            <li> I first found this perfume looking through a magazine.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and very nice smell.</li>
            <li> but at the same time I&#x27;m sure there is something to be said for your nose just getting used to certain scents.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally not into heavy, warm smells, but this smells SO sexy and seductive!</li>
            <li> It smells classy, clean and luxurious when she puts it on.</li>
            <li> As for the scent, I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend for younger girls under 20, and I think it is more for fall/winter.  </li>
            <li> I love this scent so much that instead of buying another brand for variety, I am buying another 3.4 oz bottle which will last me another 4 years.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a lovely scent and it&#x27;s not super sweet like some of them.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t know the scent previously and took a chance, my own fault for not going to Macy&#x27;s to sample it first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for 4 years now and keep getting positive remarks from people.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for very efficiently meet my request!</li>
            <li> A perfect blend of black violet, pomegranate, black orchid, mahogany wood, persimmon, and lotus blossom.  </li>
            <li> I was so happy to purchase this product for half the price that I would pay in the department store for the same exact item.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to wear perfume because most are too musky and strong for me, or I get tired of the scent quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to open</li>
            <li> That means a lot because he&#x27;s very particular about scents.  </li>
            <li> Purchased the Euphoria as a Xmas gift for my sister who is very particular about her scents.</li>
            <li> I especially like it because it is not too strong, but lasts all day.</li>
            <li> and she describes it as long lasting and good quality perfume.  </li>
            <li> it smelled different plus wasnt as strong</li>
            <li> Would certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is so smart.</li>
            <li> This is pure sophistication in a bottle.</li>
            <li> They were always out of the large bottle for sale then when I compared the price with Amazon and the store even with the 30% off coupon</li>
            <li> This bottle is LARGE.</li>
            <li> it is soft and not overwhelming aroma not a fan of perfume but love it when the love of my life wears it</li>
            <li> smells good but the box comes with no wrapper.dont know why is it so?is it a returned one or what.first time i ordered  a perfume without knowing the smell ,i just went with the reviews and ordered it.iam not happy with the packing and never expected this from items sold directly by amazon.as far as smell is concerned,its good.</li>
            <li> Also, buyer beware:  package perfume gift sets often contain OLDER perfumes!</li>
            <li> Smelled very old!!</li>
            <li> She really likes it.  </li>
            <li> Money very well spend...</li>
            <li> As always I get fast service</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this perfume!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and hope that CK doesn&#x27;t ever discontinue this product!</li>
            <li> Fast service and product was as advertised and came in factory box.</li>
            <li> Amazon has a reputation with their perfumes and authenticity, this stuff is real and</li>
            <li> And thanks to the company for sending it to me.</li>
            <li> It was much cheaper to buy through amazon then go to the department store.  </li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t know how to describe this scent.</li>
            <li> thanks again...</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my mother, and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> and it really does the trick, trust me.</li>
            <li> AND WAS MUCH CHEAPER THAN THE STORE</li>
            <li> She wears it very well</li>
            <li> and I find it very pleasing.</li>
            <li> Well, i really don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> Thanks so muc.</li>
            <li> and this is very close.  </li>
            <li> This is the real product, I&#x27;ve purchased from Macys for years and couldn&#x27;t pass up this deal.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> I really like this scent, have used it for a couple of years.  </li>
            <li> would buy it again real soon.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my friend, I really like it</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> A local store had it for sale, buy one, get one for free.</li>
            <li> or very close.</li>
            <li> Very feminine.</li>
            <li> and i really like it</li>
            <li> I will never shop at Amazon again if this is not addressed real soon, and it has been over a week and don&#x27;t see it happening.  </li>
            <li> and I must say it smells really well.</li>
            <li> which is very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But very price.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this perfume and it was 85.00 at macys</li>
            <li> and I really expected more out of it.</li>
            <li> It was not the real version at all.</li>
            <li> this one is like a women&#x27;s cologne and is really close to a man&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> I really like the Euphoria by Calvin Klein.  </li>
            <li> by Calvin Klein for Women, Eau De Parfum Spray, 3.4 Ounce sells for twice as much in departments stores.</li>
            <li> The scent was NOT even close to real Euphoria.  </li>
            <li> It really does smell like euphoria</li>
            <li> the whole lid fall apart in my bag after 5 days.</li>
            <li> Used it so much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nothing to rave about.</li>
            <li> If you really want to see how it smells, try it on at Sephora or buy a sample vial off eBay like I did.</li>
            <li> The price was a real bargain.</li>
            <li> It is very sensual and lasts all day, yet isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li> It was much cheaper than going to Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This perfume is really the calvin klein version.</li>
            <li> It is the real deal &amp; I can&#x27;t beat the price or delivery from anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> A very sensual scent.</li>
            <li> doesnt have much of a smell will not purchase it again</li>
            <li> I thought the price was reasonable too.</li>
            <li> Very seductive and aromatic fragance.,</li>
            <li> I appreciated so much.</li>
            <li> thanks again Carlena</li>
            <li> thanks.....</li>
            <li> do much to smell it yourself.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Amazon, I really like bargains.</li>
            <li> So the shopping process is very cautious.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting and very elegant scent.</li>
            <li> Warm but not too heavy and floral but not to flowery.</li>
            <li> It shipped pretty quickly and it came in the same purple/mauve box it does elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It is subtle and elegant; does not \\&quot;fill\\&quot; your nostrils like cheap perfume does.</li>
            <li> GET MORE COMPLIMENTS FROM EUPHORIA THAN ANY OTHER.  </li>
            <li> You cant go wrong, and It smells really really good!</li>
            <li> HAVE RECEIVED MORE COMPLIMENTS ON THIS COLOGNE THAN ANY OTHER COLOGNE</li>
            <li> It does not have the last effecting or the fresh smell!</li>
            <li> I just got it in today, so I&#x27;m excited to wear it out because a lot of people say they constantly get compliments on it.</li>
            <li> She has been using it for some time now along with other perfumes but this is the one she loves most.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this item in the past numerous times at Boscov&#x27;s, Kohl&#x27;s, and Macy&#x27;s with great satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Nice smell but does not last long at all!  </li>
            <li> This perfume is STRONG and SUPER LONG LASTING!</li>
            <li> It is so expensive in the department stores, I was happy to find it at such a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, smells amazing, stays on all day, and double the price in other stores... buy it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly floral and spicy without being overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> but, when I first started using it {about 2 years ago}, I also bought a small silver canister for my purse that was more like the oil.   </li>
            <li> Gift sets are known to have older shelf dates.</li>
            <li> and I was lucky enough to get a gift card to Amazon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those classic perfumes to have, which work in all situations.</li>
            <li> even though i feel this perfume has a  lovely scent i dont understand why it smells different after the 2nd week ...</li>
            <li> Now one thing I know for sure about Euphoria is that is smells differently when sprayed on different parts of my body.</li>
            <li> This scent is classic and has the ability to mutate from day to evening.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this as a gift item to...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat a high end perfume for the price that I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> and it was rated highly.  </li>
            <li> buy fragrances on the high end because Emeraude was four decades ago</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what you get with a high quality perfume.</li>
            <li> Lasts far longer than most other perfumes my wife has used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean, neat scent that can smell professional and decently homely at the same time.</li>
            <li> but i like euphoria blossom a little bit better,</li>
            <li> I had a tough time finding a scent that is a good balance.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent for Fall/Winter - &amp;#34;Heavier/dense&amp;#34; scent that will fit the mood when snuggling up with the fleece blanket when it&#x27;s cold and snowing outside.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the great deal on Amazon for this and was a bit worried by the comments about it being a fake.</li>
            <li> The last thing I do before leaving the house is spray on Euphoria and it always makes me smile.</li>
            <li> One  more thing though, the scent of euphoria doesn&#x27;t last as long as it used to.</li>
            <li> You absolutely can&#x27;t beat this price, especially for Eau de Parfum, which lasts longer and is a higher quality perfume than Eau de Toilette.</li>
            <li> I saw Euphoria on amazon.com for 1/2 the price I normally pay</li>
            <li> :) So I put it on everyday.  </li>
            <li> a total savings and worth it.  </li>
            <li> and I secretly go behind her to use it because it smells so good .</li>
            <li> Love the smell, although it does not last very long.</li>
            <li> but like many of these other reviews it is definitely not the real deal  </li>
            <li> The brick/mortar Euphoria is on the left with the product I bought from Amazon on the right.  </li>
            <li> Smells and lasts just like if you were to purchase right in the store such as Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It is not fake, smells and lasts exactly the same as bought from the store  for the double as much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to review a perfume since you all can&#x27;t smell it, but seriously, this is the best perfume ever.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, the new bottle has a lot number stamped on the bottom.  </li>
            <li> It was cheaper for the 3.4oz bottle from Amazon than I could find a 1.7oz bottle for at any store around where I live.</li>
            <li> While I was at work, I couldn&#x27;t help but tell my co-workers, and as soon as I mentioned that I was trying a new perfume they all said</li>
            <li> It came in a box wrapped and brand new.</li>
            <li> It might have taken even longer for me to find a new fragrance, but I had a stroke of luck... a friend of mine was wearing Euphoria, and I asked about it.  </li>
            <li> Brand new in sealed packaging, not a scratch on the box or bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be more careful in the future.</li>
            <li> excellence in service and price , I will beback to you in the near future, wish you continue success with your bussiness</li>
            <li> I spent a LOT more at department store for same exact item (same quality too)!  </li>
            <li> Gave it to a very old man.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sensual but very soft and wears well throughout the day.</li>
            <li> it was a very masculine musk.  </li>
            <li> The smell is also not exactly the same as the authentic version.  </li>
            <li> My wife has worn Euphoria for years and the scent drives me wild!</li>
            <li> The one I bought was sold by AND fulfilled by Amazon, and it&#x27;s definitely the real thing!</li>
            <li> Love this, I have had this for Men in the past, and I bought my wife some for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I will be getting more for other family members for next christma and birthday presents.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the exact same product sold in stores.</li>
            <li> i was so excited because this was a present i want to present my wife.</li>
            <li> I went with the 3.4oz, double the size of the smaller, as it was only $5 more.</li>
            <li> Exactly the same scent.</li>
            <li> But for those reading the review...it is exactly the same as the bottle I bought at Belks 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> And it DOES last through the whole day!</li>
            <li> The smell is not your typical light and flowerly perfume.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m left wanting the sweet back.</li>
            <li> The bottle itself appears to be authentic, but the content.s are pale lavender while my new bottle is filled with dark orchid-colored product (with a scent at least three times as strong).  </li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s a bigger bottle than I have purchased in the store for LESS $.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance (somewhat woodsy) while the black orchids give it a romantic feel</li>
            <li> It seems like Amazon sold me some old product.  </li>
            <li> This will be my 5th bottle so far.  </li>
            <li> OLD FAITHFUL!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ever tear out one of those perfume testers from a magazine and become completely captivated by the fragrance?</li>
            <li> Very costly for such a week perfume-sorry Calvin.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if its old or what ?</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 10 years and it has never got old.</li>
            <li> I have received a number of compliments from friends and complete strangers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about smells (my sister told me there are soft smells, floral smells</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just old</li>
            <li> I would not only recommend purchasing this product but highly recommend purchasing from this seller!</li>
            <li> I went ahead and found a low price online, ordered it for Christmas, and it came on time, and was received very well on unwrapping day.</li>
            <li> It came unopened, new in the box, exactly as described, and sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> It is bold yet it tones down as you rub it on your skin.</li>
            <li> But worth tracking the prices as it changes several times but on an average amazon price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not too strong but not too weak either, right in the middle</li>
            <li> It is a subtle, interesting scent that doesn&#x27;t over power</li>
            <li> I get many compliments when wearing it as it is a subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li> The scent is distinct and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> No matter what buyer i buy this particular fragrance from, it always smells the same.</li>
            <li> You actually have to be careful on how much you put on because it is strong and does last long, and it lingers on your clothes.</li>
            <li> it lasted me a long time because you do not need to put that much of it on every time.</li>
            <li> could barely detect a hint of the fragrance, even when holding my wrist directly under my nose.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s partially my fault for not getting a tester first I suppose.</li>
            <li> Might last all year with such a large bottle of it.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve smelled at least 3 other brands that had nearly the EXACT SAME SCENT!</li>
            <li> It came in the sealed original box just as if I bought it from the mall but only half price.</li>
            <li> The perfume appeared to be a new box and bottle but obviously was NOT the perfume I ordered.  </li>
            <li> and this is my new go to daily choice.</li>
            <li> BUT every time I order a new bottle it is different.&lt;br /&gt;the color changes, the bottle is the same shape but the part that is silver is not always silver.</li>
            <li> VERY reasonable price-half the price comparing with other retailers.</li>
            <li> and now I feel I spent a ton of money on either a fake or maybe something that was out of date and lost the great smell of Euphoria.  </li>
            <li> I love how little you need to spray and it actually lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> i do always go to amazon first, and i did buy before euphoria and other perfume&#x27;s too - no problems whatsoever</li>
            <li> She has found it at other places but at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li> And we are not able to return the product due to: &amp;#34;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.&amp;#34; Overall, I would not recommend or buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Excelente compra, el producto llego en buen estado y a tiempo, de manera general podria recalcar que es una fragancia exquisita</li>
            <li> Addicting Scent - Seductive and romantic, but also classy.</li>
            <li> most frustrating thing is that you cannot even return it as it is &amp;#34;flamable material&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The first day I wore it, when I got home, I immediately showered to get the scent off me because it was slightly nauseating.</li>
            <li> , what are you wearing&amp;#34; small comment to make a lady feel a little special!!</li>
            <li> I would also suggest getting this straight from Amazon as opposed to other sellers or a retailor you trust as there are lots of counterfeits being sold out there.</li>
            <li> It is important to be careful not to purchase any fragrance that has been bottled for too long because the scent has a tendency not to last very long.</li>
            <li> The main notes are rose hip, Japanese apple, green leaves, Lotus, black orchid, red woods, black violet and amber.  </li>
            <li> I checked locally and this was a large bottle compared to the smaller one and much cheaper than the small bottle.</li>
            <li> It is a really light fragrance with a long staying power, so a little go a long way.</li>
            <li> For the past year, I had assumed I was just so accustomed to the scent that it seemed less potent.  </li>
            <li> disappointed with the product, but amazon customer service is always great</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the fragrance was very light as compared to other Euphoria purchases that were made at department stores.  </li>
            <li> It is the exact same scent, bottle, packaging of the one in the local beauty store r way less.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife and she was amazed at how large the bottle was, and how little it cost.  </li>
            <li> Then I opened my new bottle and spritzed on the other.</li>
            <li> &quot; Even though it&#x27;s not over-powering, it&#x27;s still a little heavy, so if you wanted something light for the summer</li>
            <li> At the beginning I was not satisfied because the scent was not as strong as my previous ones, and it was not lasting as the ones I had</li>
            <li> She says that the smell/perfume goes away in less than an hour and is highly displeased.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that this might be a fake for the low price, but the product was genuine and came completely sealed and brand new in the box</li>
            <li> believe it was an imitation, as its quality was way far from the ones I used to have.</li>
            <li> Did not smell the same and the scent didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is that Euphoria, while a great fragrance, has very poor staying quality and at its price is not a good value.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth bottle and as long as Calvin Klein makes it, I will buy it.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x60;t really long lasting.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it&#x27;s long lasting too!</li>
            <li> And it lasts so long, that in the evening, after having sprayed just 3 short sprays in the morning, people still notice it.</li>
            <li> But doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long though.  </li>
            <li> but I find the scent doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> The fragrance seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I predict it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> will  last a  long  time too</li>
            <li> a second time.&lt;br /&gt;the scent also lasts long</li>
            <li> This bottle will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> It is sold by Amazon.com LLC, so I do not know if that has any influence on whether the product is original or a fake, but i purchased another perfume at the same time and have the same issue with it.</li>
            <li> Slightly &#x27;musky&#x27; I guess, but not heavy?  </li>
            <li> but this time not loving it soo much.</li>
            <li> I am most unhappy with this product, I was told I would get a refund, I have not gotten one.  </li>
            <li> It is definetly not a young girls parfum.</li>
            <li> how long I&#x27;ve had to wait for this.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for a long time, it is long lasting,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and for the price</li>
            <li> From now on as long as amazon carries the product I will buy it from them.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time admirer of the CK line of scents and Euphoria didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> Amazon should have a policy on how long they should keep the fragrances on the shelf.</li>
            <li> I wanted this for a long long time and one day I just went on and bought it for myself.</li>
            <li> I had put it on my wrist and the scent stayed for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> The size that came was bigger than I expected, the other one lasted me for 2 years, so I expect this to be the same.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, you can&#x27;t go wrong with such a provocative yet classy scent Euphoria brings.</li>
            <li> However the design of the bottle is kind of stupid because the bottom is not flat and it can not sit still and keeps turning.</li>
            <li> I think it resembles the scent Prada perfume (that&#x27;s the one I originally wanted, but it was too expensive, so I had settled for Euphoria.</li>
            <li> Other reviews had the same comment.</li>
            <li> the other 2 were two  different shades of purple.  </li>
            <li> i was just a little nervous about this perfume because i want to present my wife, but when i open at the front of my wife</li>
            <li> The scent of this spray didn&#x27;t seem as concentrated as the scent in the tester bottle of the same perfume; other than that, it met expectations.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a purfume that will stay on your clothes or your body for very long.  </li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because the scent only lasts a few hours before having to reapply.</li>
            <li> Though it was, it is so nice that a company cares about their customer to touch base with them on a personal level!  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not new or novel, but to me</li>
            <li> I swear every single time I wear this, someone stops me and asks what am I wearing.  </li>
            <li> I get compliments every single time I wear it...</li>
            <li> I ordered this online because I can get twice as much for half the cost of the small bottle.  </li>
            <li> have ordered through Amazon before with good luck, this however has left a  horrible taste in my mouth, I want my money back as promised.</li>
            <li> yeah is definitely watered down and smells like urine.</li>
            <li> but recently i&#x27;ve bough euphoria &amp; dune and these are not real!!</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s still a lot of it left because a little of it goes a long way...</li>
            <li> I sprayed on a generous amount and half an hour later</li>
            <li> As for the cost, it was much less than the department stores at the local mall&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> so she&#x27;s wears this not first time, the other person for whom i bought euphoria, also said that fragrance on the skin is different what she had before  </li>
            <li> I read a review stating the scent didn&#x27;t last but a half hour.</li>
            <li> I tend to wear only one fragrance for long periods of time, and Euphoria has been my pick for a few years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, Calvin Klein gets less stars because like other reviewers have said, the smell does not last long.  </li>
            <li> (i still have a little left from that one) AND it only lasts a little while...</li>
            <li> you feel a little mysterious and mischievous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more than one bad experience with buying perfume here and won&#x27;t do it again.</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I opened my box a few weeks back and noticed that I wasn&#x27;t getting any comments on my &amp;#34;great smell&amp;#34; anymore.  </li>
            <li> I opened the package it is not real</li>
            <li> Every year I get it for her for the last few years and she loves the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a perfume wearer</li>
            <li> ordered 3 bottles and 1 was pink colored perfume</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very feminine.</li>
            <li> Christmas present that gets use everyday.  </li>
            <li> Just because I read those reviews, I took my nearly empty bottle of perfume and spritzed on one hand.</li>
            <li> I like it when it mellow down already because the smell lingers long and after a day</li>
            <li> But this bottle&#x27;s scent is a little off, not sure if its an old bottle or if its a knock off.</li>
            <li> The smell did not last long, the quality was poor and if I could I would send back!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Euphoria for a long time and was a bit skeptical because the price was so much lower than what you would find in the store.</li>
            <li> Somebody in another review mentioned that the scent seems to disappear earlier than in the past.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way cheaper here than other places.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until today, after having received another bottle from a trusted brick and mortar store, that I realized this Amazon product was extremely dilute for eau de parfum.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t overpower anyone &amp; just use 1 or 2 sprays!</li>
            <li> I received it sooner than expected as well!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and the scent lasts and lasts!  </li>
            <li> It was an imitation of the perfume.</li>
            <li> Euphoria is a soft, subtle fragrance that can be worn everyday and on dates.</li>
            <li> It did leak in shipment.this is stupid to have to put in so many words.</li>
            <li> I am guarenteed at least two compliments a day in public whenever I wear this perfum  !</li>
            <li> Please inform the proper department of my complaint.  </li>
            <li> Please strike my last negative comment, that was meant for another company.  </li>
            <li> but the liquid on the inside is a dark purple</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> It is not the least bit overpowering but has enough staying power so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about it wearing off.</li>
            <li> I hate it when I find something I love</li>
            <li> It is pricey but there are far worse.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed it several times and absolutely NO SCENT!!!!!  </li>
            <li> This bottle seemed  watered down....</li>
            <li> and I need to use three times as I previously did with the one I had bought at Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> A mix of Pomegranate, Black Orchid, Lotus Blossom, and Liquid Amber, this fragrance turns woody as the day passes.</li>
            <li> It was 20 dollars less than the price in departmental stores and it arrived on the time stated by the sellers.</li>
            <li> Got it at half the price of the department stores</li>
            <li> and I got it for so much less than in a department store.</li>
            <li> The price here is half of what you would pay in the department stores.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll go to the mall as I should have in the first place:(</li>
            <li> I typically buy discounted perfume at wal-mart or target or something that does the trick for my wife.  </li>
            <li> Amazon.com had it in stock for less than half that at $41 when I bought it.</li>
            <li> I am a complete sucker this euphoria is a big fat fake I should have waited to write my review.</li>
            <li> When I first wrote this review it was blocked, probably because I am telling an inconvenient truth.</li>
            <li> When it came, I was a little unsure of how I&#x27;d like it.  </li>
            <li> It has a floral/sweet scent, almost a little musky as well.</li>
            <li> I get brutal headaches from most Estee Lauder products</li>
            <li> This product smells totally like fake or it has been on their shelf for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant because I usually purchase in the store, but this was not an imitation or outdated/stale etc.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a manufacturing ploy and its not very cute.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am wary of smaller, unknown sellers offering luxury beauty products, but this product is listed &amp;#34;sold by Amazon.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of finding a few perfumes/colognes you like and then just mixing up what you wear that day and matching it to your mood and activity for the day.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and people have noticed that I wouldn&#x27;t expect to notice.  </li>
            <li> It is not too heavy</li>
            <li> Will know after a few months</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s not genuine Calvin Klein.</li>
            <li> and this is the perfume I wear to work everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Euphoria for a few years.  </li>
            <li> It lasts all day too - no wearing off immediately for wasted product and repeated application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s half of what I usually pay and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> not sure if this wasn&#x27;t a knock off, I HAVE ALWAYS bought  this fragrance in the stores, tried this route because it was less expensive but fragrance was weak and did not last long.</li>
            <li> Some of the men are like little puppies with their tails wagging!     </li>
            <li> I wasted my hard earned money but learned a valuable lesson.</li>
            <li> Made in China, not authentic.  </li>
            <li> This item was kept in a drawer for the past year, and there is no chance whatsoever that sunlight faded the color.</li>
            <li> She gave me a small bottle of it as a sample, and I&#x27;ve worn it every day since.  </li>
            <li> I USUALLY GO TO.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Chanel Chance wearer for the past 15+ years</li>
            <li> I can usually smell it for days on my clothes.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend gave me a small sample</li>
            <li> What woman does not LOVE this scent, answer is -</li>
            <li> I thought hmm maybe it was mixed wrong....</li>
            <li> I usually purchase my perfumes from Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> so im not sure ...</li>
            <li> yes i would , mayb its just me , not sure..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was not satisfied with the length of time that it took to receive this product.</li>
            <li> I gave this perfume as a gift and found out later on that it was a fake.</li>
            <li> Not cool amazon not cool at all!!!.</li>
            <li> Had been wanting to purchase for the last few years but could never afford to buy  it from all the fancy stores, too expensive ($70 - $80) !  </li>
            <li> Seems a little weak.</li>
            <li> hardly merit&#x27;s giving any star at all.  </li>
            <li> and I could hardly get the cap off</li>
            <li> It smells dreamy after it&#x27;s been on at least 2 hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get asked what scent I&#x27;m wearing at least once</li>
            <li> I ran out at least six weeks ago, but I&#x27;m waiting for my birthday before spending the money.  </li>
            <li> tend to like perfumes with that amber and woodsy base, it works really well on me.</li>
            <li> The fragrance isn&#x27;t as stong as some others that she wears and it&#x27;s unlikely to dominate a room as some other fragrances can.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s less expensive</li>
            <li> Found it on Amazon for nearly half the price and was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m not a huge fan.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why the fragrance is weak</li>
            <li> /&gt;Top notes are pomegranate and persimmons followed by black orchid, lotus blossom, and champaca flower, and the base notes are amber, cream, black violet, and wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However the design of the bottle needs to change because it&#x27;s impossible to use all of it when the bottle is almost empty.</li>
            <li> It is very confusing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ADDICTED.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy about being out 38.00.  </li>
            <li> The cost was approximately $15 cheaper</li>
            <li> Very subtle scent.</li>
            <li> The smell of this fragrance is not incredible.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a mother&#x27;s day present, and was very disappointed to realize upon opening that the scent was nothing like Euphoria.</li>
            <li> I want my money back on this FAKE  bottle!!!</li>
            <li> The Ephoria perfume that I received from Phiou offer was a fake product</li>
            <li> This is a fake.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely obsessed.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this perfume.</li>
            <li> NEEDLESS TO SAY...</li>
            <li> .The bottle is kinda silly</li>
            <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE!!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is a fake version of Euphoria.</li>
            <li> Never can go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> It was fake Euphoria....</li>
            <li> No where was it disclosed it was fake.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this on-line purchase, for this product, MUST BE A REJECT or OUT OF DATE.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, but it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> Could this be fake?</li>
            <li> sorry noseies 😄</li>
            <li> It do not look like a fake perfume as i thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Target also carries it but still to expensive.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t understand those that review this as fake.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother who claims that it has to be a fake product.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed, I gave it to my sister.</li>
            <li> The smel is so faint you find yourself spraying on</li>

            <li> Not that expensive for a 3.4 oz either.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve heard about it but wasn&#x27;t believer - looks like from the time amazon use other reseller they sell fake items (1-2 days for process)  shame on you amazon!!!</li>

            <li> How disappointing.  </li>

            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, I would even spray it on me before I go to bed!</li>
            <li> I decided this time to get it from Amazon not knowing that I was going to give a FAKE!</li>
            <li> I use it for myself and the price was not too bad but can get it cheaper from groupon.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was a birthday present for my wife.  She really likes it.  Mission accomplished!</li>
            <li> Money very well spend...</li>
            <li> I always get compliments when I wear this.....people ALWAYS love it!  I am regular on this parfum!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why the fragrance is weak and I need to use three times as I previously did with the one I had bought at Macy&#x27;s.  The worst part is that I ordered two and gave one as a gift. I am embarrassed to ask my friend if she has had the same problem.  It seems like Amazon sold me some old product.  I did not notice the &amp;#34;non-returnable clause&amp;#34; before I ordered, otherwise it would be going back.  I should have known the price was too good.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell.  It&#x27;s not too over-bearing.  The product was delivered quickly and wrapped very well.  If you like Calvin Klein&#x27;s fragrances, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is very inexpensive.  As Calving Klein has great parfum this is my favorite.  I would recommend to any of family members and friends.  Thank god for Amazon.</li>
            <li> Euphoria is a great perfume for young adult women. I got it as a gift for my 25-year-old girlfriend and she loves it. I highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Euphoria for years and I still love it. Everywhere I go people say I smell so good and ask what am I wearing. The last thing I do before leaving the house is spray on Euphoria and it always makes me smile. This is my fourth bottle and as long as Calvin Klein makes it, I will buy it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this fragrance.....................but, when I first started using it {about 2 years ago}, I also bought a small silver canister for my purse that was more like the oil.   Now, I can&#x27;t seem to find it.  I hate it when I find something I love and then it goes away.</li>
            <li> Euphoria is my favorite fragrance. I receive many compliments when I wear it. The price is very good for the size, and I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This is probably in the top 3 perfumes for me that my wife wears consistently.  Somebody in another review mentioned that the scent seems to disappear earlier than in the past.  I&#x27;ve sort of thought the same thing but at the same time I&#x27;m sure there is something to be said for your nose just getting used to certain scents.  I&#x27;m a fan of finding a few perfumes/colognes you like and then just mixing up what you wear that day and matching it to your mood and activity for the day.  This seems to help some in the notice factor for what you smell?????</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly and the packaging was perfect.  My only complaint is that the fragrance was very light as compared to other Euphoria purchases that were made at department stores.  The price was very good.  I have heard that shipping by air may affect the fragrance.  As time goes by the fragrance seems to get stronger.</li>
            <li> This was a gift but it is just what she wanted!</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with the product. Bought it for my wife for our wedding anniversary and the price was almost 40% lower than department stores. Product was well packaged and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and people have noticed that I wouldn&#x27;t expect to notice.  It&#x27;s nice to be noticed.  :)</li>
            <li> A nice bouquet of smells which lasts all day---very sensual from the male perspective !!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, smells amazing, stays on all day, and double the price in other stores... buy it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume 2-3 years ago. it lasted me a long time because you do not need to put that much of it on every time. it has a great long lasting smell. i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who has this perfume, and I&#x27;ve wanted it for the longest time.  I almost made the mistake of buying it in a perfume store, because I saved so much more money buying it on amazon.  The shipping was very quick as well!</li>
            <li> Sometimes you wonder about the authenticity of something like this when its sold at a good price. Well, my purchase was truly a good deal. Unopened box, shipped quickly. Wife is happy, therefore.......</li>
            <li> I think  my title says it all. I  get Euphoria at a great price, it ships quickly and I plan  to keep buying it through Amazon. :)</li>
            <li> Euphoria is a soft, subtle fragrance that can be worn everyday and on dates. It does have a very sexy touch to it which is probably why it always wins compliments...from men and women. This is a great deal; Euphoria goes for about $90 (with Chicago tax) in department stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend. It has a light, flowery smell, which we both like. The fragrance isn&#x27;t as stong as some others that she wears and it&#x27;s unlikely to dominate a room as some other fragrances can. This is a large bottle and a good buy.</li>
            <li> I bought an imitation of this perfume and my girlfriend loved it. I bought this original perfume, now my girlfriend loves me. We are very happy.</li>
            <li> I love this perfum. It came in the sealed original box just as if I bought it from the mall but only half price. I am guarenteed at least two compliments a day in public whenever I wear this perfum  !</li>
            <li> The Ephoria perfume that I received from Phiou offer was a fake product and I would not recommend the seller to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my signature scent. It is so expensive in the department stores, I was happy to find it at such a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> I love Euphoria and always receive compliments when I wear it. However the design of the bottle needs to change because it&#x27;s impossible to use all of it when the bottle is almost empty. One day when I find the time I will write to Calvin Klein and suggest that it be remedied somehow. As always I get fast service that&#x27;s why I buy on Amazon...even when purchasing from another seller one&#x27;s credit card is protected.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much! All as in the description!</li>
            <li> The Euphoria perfume i bought was Horrible..Definitely Not the same Euphoria i had bought a couple years ago in a store...(i still have a little left from that one) AND it only lasts a little while...I am VERY disappointed!  Would not buy it again...</li>
            <li> i had doubt about buying on amazon cos it was just way too cheap..but i&#x27;m glad i did, it&#x27;s original and was well packaged...love euphoria!! best perfume ever..i&#x27;m a girl who loves male/strong perfume, had issey miyaki and eternityfor men  but this stole my heart</li>
            <li> Made in China, not authentic.  Authentic would be made in USA.  The smell is also not exactly the same as the authentic version.  Will not purchase again from Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mom and she loved it. It&#x27;s way cheaper here than other places. Highly recommend this perfume!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, after smelling it at Macy&#x27;s. She loves it, and I love it on her. Way better price on Amazon than the retail stores.</li>
            <li> gift,she loves this perfume,will buy again</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on December 8, 2013 to replace a bottle I had purchased at a trusted brick and mortar store (this is my favorite scent, and I had run out of it-gasp!).  It wasn&#x27;t until today, after having received another bottle from a trusted brick and mortar store, that I realized this Amazon product was extremely dilute for eau de parfum.  For the past year, I had assumed I was just so accustomed to the scent that it seemed less potent.  The bottle itself appears to be authentic, but the content.s are pale lavender while my new bottle is filled with dark orchid-colored product (with a scent at least three times as strong).  Furthermore, the new bottle has a lot number stamped on the bottom.  This product:  no lot number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am wary of smaller, unknown sellers offering luxury beauty products, but this product is listed &amp;#34;sold by Amazon.&amp;#34;  How disappointing.  I suppose it is true that you get what you pay for.  Beware of prices too good to be true, no matter who is selling the item in question!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note the attached picture.  The brick/mortar Euphoria is on the left with the product I bought from Amazon on the right.  This item was kept in a drawer for the past year, and there is no chance whatsoever that sunlight faded the color.</li>
            <li> The perfume is gone in 5 minutes of spraying. I am disappointed with it. I have used the EDT and it works much better than this</li>
            <li> CAN NOT BEAT THE PRICE FOR THE SAME QUALITY.</li>
            <li> My wife has worn Euphoria for years and the scent drives me wild!</li>
            <li> The package arrived as scheduled and there were no problems.    However, IMO the Eau de Parfum is targettted at 35+ women. It is definetly not a young girls parfum.</li>
            <li> I have received compliments and questions about what I&#x27;m wearing since the first time I used Euphoria. I smelled a sample in a magazine and couldn&#x27;t believe how great this fragrance smelled. I was even more pleased when I got my actual bottle of perfume. I&#x27;ve never been one to wear perfume because most are too musky and strong for me, or I get tired of the scent quickly. Euphoria is a nice, strong scent, but it&#x27;s not too strong. I feel confident for loving such a great smelling perfume, and it&#x27;s always nice to receive compliments on it! Highly recommend and hope that CK doesn&#x27;t ever discontinue this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my sister and she loved it, even at the price that was paid. Cost-effective. Very good.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and the fragrance is wonderful  but it isn&#x60;t really long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for about a year and I get so many compliments on it. Oh, and it&#x27;s long lasting too!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the perfume</li>
            <li> My wife is a fan of this perfume.  The price is better than the department stores and most of the discount perfume shops.  Fast service and product was as advertised and came in factory box.</li>
            <li> Amazon has a reputation with their perfumes and authenticity, this stuff is real and if its not, its the best knockoff! This perfume is STRONG and SUPER LONG LASTING! i wear it to go clubbing or something, not office friendly unless you wear one spritz all over the body.</li>
            <li> Great deal.  I bought it for my wife for Christmas.  It was cheaper for the 3.4oz bottle from Amazon than I could find a 1.7oz bottle for at any store around where I live.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, although it does not last very long. I would expect it to be a higher quality, I have not tried it from a known authentic source therefore I have nothing to compare it to.  Seems a little weak.</li>
            <li> When I saw the bottle, the description of the fragrance, and the amount of positive reviews, I just had to get it! My boyfriend loves pomegranate, so I thought it would smell nice. It&#x27;s partially my fault for not getting a tester first I suppose. Upon getting it a whiff from the bottle, I think to myself, &amp;#34;Well it&#x27;s okay more of a fall/winter evening type of fragrance.&amp;#34; After I apply it lasts me about 7-8 hours, maybe more sometimes depending on the weather. But halfway through, I start smelling something rancid! This perfume must not be for my skin because as soon as it warms the scent changes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance so I was happy to find it at such a good price. It arrived within a few days, which I was also very happy about.</li>
            <li> My husband got me this perfume and I love it.  I&#x27;ve received many compliments already from people at work.  I especially like it because it is not too strong, but lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The perfume appeared to be a new box and bottle but obviously was NOT the perfume I ordered.  I was to receive a full refund with the additional money for shipping and I have received nothing as of today.  I will not order perfume again especially when it is shipped from Odeur Bonne.</li>
            <li> Great smelling perfume! Arrived in great condition and the smell is exactly as I remembered.... Very appealing and will attract others:)</li>
            <li> Like this perfume--get many compliments from both men &amp; women. I was hesitant because I usually purchase in the store, but this was not an imitation or outdated/stale etc.  Arrived perfectly packaged and sealed. Only downside was that even with Prime, it took about a week to arrive, so order ahead if you need it for a gift. This fragrance has been around a while now so it&#x27;s not new or novel, but to me it&#x27;s kind of a warm, comfortable standby.  As for the scent, I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend for younger girls under 20, and I think it is more for fall/winter.  A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t overpower anyone &amp; just use 1 or 2 sprays!</li>
            <li> Euphoria is one of the most beautiful fragrances I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.  The scent is simliar to Chanel&#x27;s Chance, which I absolutely love.  It&#x27;s soft yet somewhat sophisticated.  So why only one star?  It doesn&#x27;t last.  I sprayed on a generous amount and half an hour later could barely detect a hint of the fragrance, even when holding my wrist directly under my nose.  I repeated this experiment (since I had bought the bottle) several days in a row, always with the same result. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that Euphoria, while a great fragrance, has very poor staying quality and at its price is not a good value.</li>
            <li> Ha!! You ever buy something for someone and LOVE IT so much... you KEEP IT!!! I just did!!! Getting her something else!!</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh, this is the BOMB fragrance! It lasts all day and smells so sophisticated - floral and woodsy and musky and wildly sexy. I&#x27;m not kidding: men act like they want to have an affair with me whenever I wear this. They ask me, \\&quot;What ARE you wearing?\\&quot; and stare and say, \\&quot;Mmmmmmm......\\&quot; Women love it too. It is very sensual and seductive and it makes you feel so sexy. Those of you who feel it&#x27;s too strong for you - whatever, dude. Try Euphoria Blossom for a lighter fragrance, I guess. I&#x27;m sticking with this. As for the woman who said it doesn&#x27;t last - were you using eau de cologne, or eau de toilette? Because eau de parfum lasts and lasts.....</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume for my birthday and it is by far the best smelling women&#x27;s fragrance i&#x27;ve ever used!  It smells wonderfully on me and i got a lot of compliments! :)</li>
            <li> This is a fake.  The  cap doesn&#x27;t have the brand name on it as it is supposed to. Don&#x27;t buy it. I thought I found a great deal and I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> everyone asks what my wifes perfume is ,this is a very fine product . nice to smell something so wonderful. it is exceptional</li>
            <li> This is my favorite and it is a very good deal! It was delivered quickly and came in perfect condition. If you are a fan, you will enjoy the savings!</li>
            <li> Be sure that you&#x27;ll receive the right price because they offered me the product for 45 dollars and charged me 75! If I would have known that was going to be the price I would have gone to Macy&#x27;s and enjoyed my day!</li>
            <li> smells good but the box comes with no wrapper.dont know why is it so?is it a returned one or what.first time i ordered  a perfume without knowing the smell ,i just went with the reviews and ordered it.iam not happy with the packing and never expected this from items sold directly by amazon.as far as smell is concerned,its good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for 4 years now and keep getting positive remarks from people. Women of course are much more outspoken to ask what perfume i&#x27;m wearing. I love this scent so much that instead of buying another brand for variety, I am buying another 3.4 oz bottle which will last me another 4 years. It is subtle and elegant; does not \\&quot;fill\\&quot; your nostrils like cheap perfume does. And it lasts so long, that in the evening, after having sprayed just 3 short sprays in the morning, people still notice it. I think it resembles the scent Prada perfume (that&#x27;s the one I originally wanted, but it was too expensive, so I had settled for Euphoria. Well, that turned out to be perfect.)   My only regret is the shape and look of the bottle. I&#x27;d rather have a beautifully decorated glass bottle instead of a silver taco in my hand.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume .. it&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> The name of this products fits it perfectly.. this perfume is absolutely awesome.. i LOVE it..and will certainly buy more of it!!</li>
            <li> Sorry, I got it today! I just love the smell of this perfume! And thanks to the company for sending it to me. You have no idea how long I&#x27;ve had to wait for this. ( not because of you)&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you again! I feel sexy!</li>
            <li> This perfume is great smelling.  This will be my 5th bottle so far.  It was much cheaper to buy through amazon then go to the department store.  I recommend this fragrance to everyone. Very reasonable price for this perfume.</li>
            <li> I totally love this perfume. Found it here as a good deal. When I tested it in a perfume shop, took one sniff and I did not want to let my breath out, it is enchanting to me. Love it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the service and the perfume!!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it !&lt;br /&gt;Happy wife !! Happy Life !! :D</li>
            <li> I visited a Sephora recently and the saleslady told me that this was her favorite scent. As soon as I smelled it I fell in love! She gave me a small bottle of it as a sample, and I&#x27;ve worn it every day since.  I&#x27;m completely obsessed. I&#x27;ve never had nice perfume, so I was really surprised that I could still smell it on my wrist when I got home from an 8 hour work shift. While I was at work, I couldn&#x27;t help but tell my co-workers, and as soon as I mentioned that I was trying a new perfume they all said \\&quot;so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been smelling! What&#x27;s it called?!\\&quot; I never thought I would like a Calvin Klein product so much, and I can&#x27;t wait to buy myself a full bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t know how to describe this scent. It&#x27;s kind of musky and a little bit sweet. It&#x27;s not over-powering either. One of my co-workers described it as \\&quot;a really nice person smell, like someone who goes outside and naturally smells really good from being around woods and flowers.\\&quot; Even though it&#x27;s not over-powering, it&#x27;s still a little heavy, so if you wanted something light for the summer then this probably isn&#x27;t for you. But I completely love it.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase. It arrived sooner than expected. I get alot of compliments.  Thank you for the great service.</li>
            <li> Thank You very much. This is my Moms second purchase of Euphoria. she said she loves this size bottle,and at such a Great Prce... thanks again...:) have a great day.</li>
            <li> great price and arrived quickly will order again</li>
            <li> I opened my box a few weeks back and noticed that I wasn&#x27;t getting any comments on my &amp;#34;great smell&amp;#34; anymore.  I asked my best friend to smell my should where I spray my parfum.  She said she thought she smelled laundry detergent!  I knew I wasn&#x27;t smelling my parfum when I changed clothes in the afternoon anymore and now I feel I spent a ton of money on either a fake or maybe something that was out of date and lost the great smell of Euphoria.  I&#x27;ll be more careful in the future.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my mother, and she absolutely loves it. After I told her how much it had cost me, she couldn&#x27;t believe it either!</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on this fragrance!!</li>
            <li> I was first given this as a gift and am hooked on it.  I bought my second bottle for myself because I get compliments everywhere I go.  I use it exclusively but don&#x27;t drown myself in it.  A spritz here and there is all you need so it lasts a long time.  It is pricey but there are far worse.  It is a subtle, interesting scent that doesn&#x27;t over power so I would imagine most women could wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone for themselves or for a nice gift for a special friend.</li>
            <li> Its intensity and flavor are delicious. It keeps all the time and even after washing the garments retain the nuances of perfume.</li>
            <li> This is by far, the most erotic scent I have ever worn. I have purchased and worn Euphoria for 8 years now. Amazon has the best price!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, the price was $54.81.  The billing statement enclosed with the shipment shows total price as $54.81, however, my VISA was charged $59.79.  I sent an email on 8/9/11 regarding this overcharge and the reply I got was a request to review this product.  I&#x27;m replyig in this manner since I cant find a phone number to call.  Please inform the proper department of my complaint.  Shirley</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my fragrance...I get stopped daily and told I smell great!</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL PERFUM FOR A WOMAN</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for a while.  It is not too heavy and I get a lot of compliments of the great fragrance.  I think the parfum has a longer lasting fragance. Give it a try you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great product, my wife loved getting it for Christmas!</li>
            <li> I love this parfum and I always get a ton of compliments when I wear it.  This was actually a gift for my mother who would use mine everytime she came to my house.  I paid $75 at Ulta for mine, so this was a great deal.</li>
            <li> It came in a box wrapped and brand new. It smells so great I love it. so seductive just a sweet parfume for a sweet price unlike the mall prices.</li>
            <li> Exotic floral-fruity fragrance. The main notes are rose hip, Japanese apple, green leaves, Lotus, black orchid, red woods, black violet and amber.  This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume and she describes it as long lasting and good quality perfume.  This is also at 30 to 40 bucks a good price for this perfume of this size.  I would also suggest getting this straight from Amazon as opposed to other sellers or a retailor you trust as there are lots of counterfeits being sold out there.</li>
            <li> False advertisement!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife.  It was fantastic.  The packaging was great.  The scent was even better!</li>
            <li> Long lasting and very nice smell. I loved it. My second bottle. If you like flower smell you should try it.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite cologne.  I recently purhcased it as a birthday gift for her, and she was thrilled at how large it was, and I was thrilled at the amazing low price.  This is just one of many wonderful bargains I&#x27;ve received through shopping at Amazon.  Thank you!  Rose  Allen Park, MI</li>
            <li> Please strike my last negative comment, that was meant for another company.  I will order from this company again in the future.</li>
            <li> I received Euphoria as a birthday gift two years ago.  I loved the fragrance so much that I had to order another bottle.  I was hoping that it arrive before I went to my cousin wedding and it did.  I received so many compliments.  I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I would give Amazon 5 stars for price, free shipping, and quick arrival (came within 5 days of ordering).  I love Euphoria!  I spent a LOT more at department store for same exact item (same quality too)!  However, Calvin Klein gets less stars because like other reviewers have said, the smell does not last long.  Disappointing!  Also, buyer beware:  package perfume gift sets often contain OLDER perfumes!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a christmas present for my girlfriend this year and she absolutely loved it. Everyone thought I was at Macy&#x27;s looking for hours to find the right perfume, and this did a fantastic job. The box and bottle are elegant, and it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to go off of the Amazon reviews, and I am glad I did. It was affordable and she thinks its a great present.</li>
            <li> perfect!  This was exactly what I was looking for at an unbelievable price.  I will be back for sure!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance soooooooo flippin muchhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!! It is my def. my favorite out of all the perfumes i have so far (and i do have a lot! :P) So take my word for it... It will be well worth it!!! This will be that one perfume i will buy again and again!!! Yayyy! :D</li>
            <li> This is the best parfum ever! I&#x27;ve used it for years now and this bottle is the 3oz at such a great price! I can find the 1oz bottles locally in stores for twice the price. Will definitely be ordering again</li>
            <li> 2nd time purchasing this perfume. The scent is awesome and classy. Planning on buying another for an Xmas gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> Well Euphoria has a really nice distinct scent that makes it somewhat unique from most of the colognes. It is bold yet it tones down as you rub it on your skin. And you don&#x27;t really require alot of it to smell really nice throughout the day. I only spray once and it really does the trick, trust me. The scent itself doesn&#x27;t really fade easy most especially if you move alot - the more you will smell good if you do that. With the right spot on the body, you will smell dashing, trust me.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED DIFFERENT PERFUMES, BUT ALWAYS COME BACK TO THIS......OLD FAITHFUL!&lt;br /&gt;I GET MORE COMPLIMENTS FROM EUPHORIA THAN ANY OTHER.  AND WAS MUCH CHEAPER THAN THE STORE I USUALLY GO TO.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and it is exactly as described by the seller!</li>
            <li> Since I first purchased this perfume 2+ years ago, it&#x27;s the only perfume I wear. I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments about it from perfect strangers in stores, restaurants, etc. If you like a scent that not&#x27;s heavy and floral, you&#x27;ll love this!</li>
            <li> Save a lot of money for this present for my mom! You cant go wrong, and It smells really really good!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my wife for Christmas and when she opened it, it seemed &#x27;off&#x27; to her.  A quick call to the manufacturer determined that it was manufactured in 2007.  Perfumes change their scent in 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing, because when I tried to return it, it says I can&#x27;t because of shipping.&lt;br /&gt;GO TO MACYS or another big department store and buy it even if it costs more.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes for the best price!! If I run out I&#x27;ll def buy through this seller again!</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with my bottle of \\&quot;Euphoria\\&quot; by Calvin Klein.  It came unopened, new in the box, exactly as described, and sooner than expected.  Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t purchased Euphoria from Amazon, I have to say this is one of the best longest lasting perfumes around. I actually bought a bottle from kohls and saved a boatload of money. This perfume has a lovely scent and it&#x27;s not super sweet like some of them. It has more of a fresh clean summery smell but would be great to use all year round. I was looking for a perfume that would smell wonderful and last for hours, which I have found in Euphoria. I would definately recommend this to anyone. It is simply amazing!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied  with product</li>
            <li> Euphoria by CK. The fragrance of this perfume is truly euphoric! A mix of Pomegranate, Black Orchid, Lotus Blossom, and Liquid Amber, this fragrance turns woody as the day passes. I&#x27;ve got compliments during the day whenever I am wearing this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is confident and sexy. A must have!</li>
            <li> i have used this perfume before and absolutely love the scent. when i saw the price of this item, i thought it was too good to be true. It was 20 dollars less than the price in departmental stores and it arrived on the time stated by the sellers. I will definitely reoommend these sellers. One  more thing though, the scent of euphoria doesn&#x27;t last as long as it used to. I think this is a manufacturing ploy and its not very cute.</li>
            <li> My husband bought me this perfume, and I loved it.  I liked it so much I bought a bottle for my mother.  You cannot beat the affotable price and the bottle is beautiful and modern looking.  The mens cologne from the same line is just as great.  You cannot go wrong with this perfume.</li>
            <li> Berry nice kind of perfium, only uses and you will feel diferent tan the others, i like this lotion or oerfium</li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume for years. You absolutely can&#x27;t beat this price, especially for Eau de Parfum, which lasts longer and is a higher quality perfume than Eau de Toilette. The one I bought was sold by AND fulfilled by Amazon, and it&#x27;s definitely the real thing! Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it. The mag sample does it no justice and it smells better on your skin. Every woman should have this in their collection.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that smelled good and lingered for a while and this is great! I thought I remembered trying it once in Macy&#x27;s so decided to take a chance and I am very happy. Fast delivery and awesome price compared to department stores.</li>
            <li> My wife has several fragrances of comparable price and this is her favorite.  I purchased this for her Christmas 2012 and she was delighted to receive another for 2014.  She wears it very well and I find it very pleasing.</li>
            <li> I bought Calvin Klein For Women parfum as a Christmas gift to my sister. To see the smile on her face at Christmas when she opened her gift, was priceless. As for the cost, it was much less than the department stores at the local mall&#x27;s. Thank you Amazon for a great deal!!</li>
            <li> i ordered it because i have a couple friends that love it. Well, i really don&#x27;t care for it. And now i can&#x27;t find the return sticky label to return it and i&#x27;m really bummed about that because it cost $55!! &lt;br /&gt;maybe if you could help me with that, that would be great! &lt;br /&gt;thanks Becky</li>
            <li> Calvin Klein &amp;#34;euphoria&amp;#34; smells fantastic. I highly recommend this to any woman who wants to smell great!! I get a lot of compliments when I wear it...</li>
            <li> Bought this item as a Christmas gift for my wife.  Product was just as expected, fragrance and strength were just as good as one bought at a box store, but a lot better price here</li>
            <li> This was something our daughter specifically asked for at Christmas.  She was delighted to receive it and I was very pleased with the scent.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this fragrance! I thought your price was much more reasonable than in department stores. Thanks so muc.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, sweet but not to much, good price, my favorite perfume from now on. I must confess that calvin klein and Hugo Boss are my favorite perfume brands</li>
            <li> I have been using euphoria since 3 years and I love it. the perfume last for longer hours on your cloths.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ok with this perfume.  I REALLY liked the original Euphoria which was clear in color, but I guess they discontinued it.  Can&#x27;t find it anywhere.  I still get compliments on this one though.  I like the smell of a mans aftershave (not musk) and this is very close.  Men seem to like it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume to date, and I have tried many over the past decade. I also receive many compliments on how great the smell. One of the 1 star reviews had mentioned that they weren&#x27;t able to smell it on themselves after 30 minutes. I too cannot smell it on myself, but others can, and they love it!</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  At 7:00am, I&#x27;ll spray it twice on the body and once on my wrist and I still get complements on it after 3:00pm.  I saw the earlier review about the scent not lasting. With the Eau De Parfum, my experience is to the contrary.  It is light, sweet, spicy &amp; sophisticated without being strong or overbearing.  It is by far my favorite.  This is definitely a must have.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product in 4 days, In time for Christmas. The price was exceptional. This is a great scent and was hard to find during Christmas week. Amazon provides excellent service.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  My husband bought this for me years ago I still get compliments to this day.  I ordered this online because I can get twice as much for half the cost of the small bottle.  I will definitely purchase again from Amazon!</li>
            <li> This Euphoria perfume is great. I bought this for my grandfather to give as a gift to my grandmother for Christmas. Got it at half the price of the department stores</li>
            <li> She loves the fragrance and I loved the price.</li>
            <li> I have used Euphoria for several years and love the fragrance. I can&#x27;t tell you how many time I&#x27;ve had someone stop me and ask what I am wearing. Just love it so much!</li>
            <li> HAVE RECEIVED MORE COMPLIMENTS ON THIS COLOGNE THAN ANY OTHER COLOGNE THAT I HAVE EVER WORN THROUGHOUT MY LIFE.  NEEDLESS TO SAY...I LOVE IT AND SO DO MANY OTHERS!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected! This is the real product, I&#x27;ve purchased from Macys for years and couldn&#x27;t pass up this deal. Would certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> i bay parfums to sell with my friends. a friend of my tells my abou this eupharia by calvin klein.she say that euphoria is an excellent parfum .that is the reason I choose the maximum rating of 5 star for this parfum</li>
            <li> i do always go to amazon first, and i did buy before euphoria and other perfume&#x27;s too - no problems whatsoever but recently i&#x27;ve bough euphoria &amp; dune and these are not real!! my mom use this (dune) for years so she&#x27;s wears this not first time, the other person for whom i bought euphoria, also said that fragrance on the skin is different what she had before  i&#x27;ve heard about it but wasn&#x27;t believer - looks like from the time amazon use other reseller they sell fake items (1-2 days for process)  shame on you amazon!!!</li>
            <li> I smell just like a whore when I wear it.  I was shopping around at Bob Evans Gift Shop and two women followed me and finally said, they had been tracking the wonderful smell and it had to be me!  Flattery will get you everywhere.  They said they would order some as soon as they got home.</li>
            <li> A happy wife is a happy life. She loves it. It does smell WONDERFUL. SERIOUSLY A GREAT PRICE ON THIS. I checked locally and this was a large bottle compared to the smaller one and much cheaper than the small bottle.</li>
            <li> I had a tough time finding a scent that is a good balance. This one works well for me as does Eternity and Romance.  A number of people have commented favorably on it, although I wear it lightly. I guess I hit a winner.</li>
            <li> buy this perfume for my sister and&#x27;ll buy one for my wife, it really is an extraordinary essence, it smells delicious and she loves it really is a great product.</li>
            <li> It is so orgasmic I can&#x27;t even begin to put the words together to describe this item. If I could fall in love with myself all over again I would. Lol</li>
            <li> everyone knows that perfume doesn&#x27;t smell the same on everyone.&lt;br /&gt;This perfume was made for me.It might be made for you.</li>
            <li> Ever tear out one of those perfume testers from a magazine and become completely captivated by the fragrance? Well, that&#x27;s how Euphoria entered my life. I priced it online at several sources and found the Amazon site to be the best value. So buy with confidence, ladies! You&#x27;ll love the scent and the deal!</li>
            <li> I received this parfum as a birthday gift and I fell in love with it as soon as I smelled it.  The scent lasts all day without being too overbearing. I swear every single time I wear this, someone stops me and asks what am I wearing.  The fragrance is crisp and sensual.  It kind of reminds me of Bath &amp; Body Works&#x27; Moonlight Path. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it, especially for the price that Amazon is offering it for!</li>
            <li> In January I found a magazine with a paper sample of Euphoria intact. I scrubbed my hair and clothes with this. Everywhere I went people would ask what that wonderful smell was. I could still smell it on my coat days later. So even though I was up to my ears in Christmas debt I splurged on a $59.00 bottle. It is a work of art to the eyes as the bottle itself is magnificent and a valium to the nerves with it&#x27;s relaxing scent. I keep it close even at work. Oh wait, no it sucks...don&#x27;t buy it because I want to be the only woman that smells that good.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is so smart. I receive many compliments. Scent last many hours after application. Beautiful bottle</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and I got it for so much less than in a department store. Delivery was fast. Will shop here again.</li>
            <li> Thank you amazon for offering this perfume at such great pricing and fast shipping. I love this perfume and I get so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s absolute favorite scent.  I ordered it as a surprise for Christmas.  She says she wants to take herself on a date when she wears it!  Ha!</li>
            <li> I use Eternity daily and thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.  I really like it but I need to use it more to rate it fairly.</li>
            <li> Still in original package.  Item was priced right for this product.  Larger bottle was also a surprise and bargain at the price sold.</li>
            <li> Love this, I have had this for Men in the past, and I bought my wife some for Christmas. It smells classy, clean and luxurious when she puts it on. Has a sweet smell but not too sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff, Love Calvin Klein fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T</li>
            <li> I really like this scent, have used it for a couple of years.  I didn&#x27;t realize how BIG the container is.  Next time I would order a lesser amount...not the fault of anyone but myself.</li>
            <li> loved it. was nice fragrance. I* would recamend  it to others.my daughters love it .I would buy it again real soon.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume that people(men,women,and teens) want to know what awesome fragrance I am wearing. It is not too sweet nor too overwhelming to anyone. I read a review stating the scent didn&#x27;t last but a half hour. It is important to be careful not to purchase any fragrance that has been bottled for too long because the scent has a tendency not to last very long. Gift sets are known to have older shelf dates. Also, applying the lotion before the fragrance does hold the scent longer if from a gift set.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as advertised and my wife could not be happier. Shippin was free and received item within a week after submitting order.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! I&#x27;m normally not into heavy, warm smells, but this smells SO sexy and seductive! I love how little you need to spray and it actually lasts all day long. This is my first CK perfume and I am so impressed with it. I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on how great it smells. It just screams sexy, smoldering, and classy .The bottle is kinda silly but you&#x27;re not looking at the bottle when you keep smelling yourself.</li>
            <li> good for women.....my wife likes it.I highly recommend this as a gift item to...But worth tracking the prices as it changes several times but on an average amazon price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> One of my signature scents. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it&#x27;s not overpowering just a rich aroma scent that smells clean and fresh.  I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Plead do not buy this product it is a fake version of Euphoria. I want my money back</li>
            <li> Purfume smells really nice. But doesn&#x27;t last long.  This isn&#x27;t a purfume that will stay on your clothes or your body for very long.  But it does smell good.</li>
            <li> just the right evening fragrance</li>
            <li> My favorite scent for several years.  I work with the public and get many compliments on this perfume.  The price here is half of what you would pay in the department stores.</li>
            <li> This is a famyastic product. The ladies of the house really enjoy this item. The price and size are great. I will be getting more for other family members for next christma and birthday presents.</li>
            <li> Wonderful intoxicating scent!  Didn&#x27;t last long though.  I give the scent itself five stars but the length of the scent  hardly merit&#x27;s giving any star at all.  Very costly for such a week perfume-sorry Calvin.</li>
            <li> This calogne is one to receive a lot of notice. Sparkly, and jazzy at the same time.  Crisp fragrance with lots of floral.  Love it.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This product is the original euphoria I love this fragance. Good customer service and quick shipment.</li>
            <li> Great price and came in about 3 days. Was a mother&#x27;s day gift and she loved it. Great job guys!</li>
            <li> The person I purchased it for was trilled, and was surprisedthat I would have thought of it. I am a hero.</li>
            <li> Love this wear it daily many complements lasts all day</li>
            <li> I am a complete sucker this euphoria is a big fat fake I should have waited to write my review.I opened the package it is not real I really hate that. I have always liked amazon but now I am looking for another online site to spend my money! Not cool amazon not cool at all!!!.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my friend, I really like it and she likes, too! It&#x27;s adorable and smells great.! You won&#x27;t regret to have this..</li>
            <li> There is not anything I could add about this fragrance, it is my all time favorite at any price but it was great to order it from Amazon at a reduced rate.  Just keep making it available on Amazon &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34;..</li>
            <li> Probably my fav!  Soon to be on my third bottle.  It gets tons on compliments.  Price was unbeatable as well!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best smelling perfumes I have ever worn. I buy perfumes or colognes all over the world and this is my new go to daily choice.</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for a long time, it is long lasting,&lt;br /&gt;and I have had many comments on it. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything&lt;br /&gt;else and I will order from amazon from now on with the price&lt;br /&gt;they offer this fragrance at.</li>
            <li> Would have given a 5 but I find the scent doesn&#x27;t last long..bought this perfume years ago and  had like it but this time not loving it soo much. I will probably give it to my younger sister , well that is if she likes it.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my daughter and she was thrilled with the scent.  It made her very happy and that made me very happy.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and the it was the right size that I wanted. I would recommend this and the vendor to everyone.</li>
            <li> My mother wanted this perfume, so I bought it for her. She tells me it looks great, and the smell is awesome. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for some good perfume.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat a high end perfume for the price that I paid for it.  I&#x27;ve been a Chanel Chance wearer for the past 15+ years and this is my go-to when I want to change it up.</li>
            <li> My daughter just loves it...a wonderful perfume that fits her perefctly!  I would definitely purchase it again in the future  for her.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t know the scent previously and took a chance, my own fault for not going to Macy&#x27;s to sample it first</li>
            <li> what can I say I love it, is soft and smell great everyone ask me want perfume I used and complement me saying that smells great.</li>
            <li> Smells fine but the color is off so don&#x27;t know if its old or what ? Will know after a few months</li>
            <li> She enjoyed this one the most out of all her gifts she got. She wore it the same night she opened it. She&#x27;s happy and I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> I really like this it is soft and not overwhelming aroma not a fan of perfume but love it when the love of my life wears it</li>
            <li> I knew what I was ordering and it was just what I wanted. I love This product, and your price was much more reasonable than the store.</li>
            <li> Love this smell! People compliment all the time. I have used this product for 10 years and it has never got old.</li>
            <li> Love this Perfume. If you want to smell good and not over powering this is it and of course the price is right.</li>
            <li> I do really love this fragrance.  I get compliments regularly.  This was my third bottle.  Great value. I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom for last Christmas and she loves it!  She wears it every day and it&#x27;s almost out - I will have to buy more for her soon.  Excellent gift for a lady who is into perfumes.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my gal friend who like Euphoria and it does not disappoint.  The scent is distinct and long lasting.  Definitely  recommended!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this scent by a co-worker who always smelled SO good. I finally had to ask her what it was, and Euphoria turned out to be the heavenly scent! Beware: wear at your own discretion. Heads will turn!</li>
            <li> This was a full 3.4 ounce bottle. For the price it was a great deal.  My daughter was thrilled with the product and the smell.</li>
            <li> I gave this rating because I wanted to buy this for a Christmas gift for my sister.  A local store had it for sale, buy one, get one for free. When I went to buy it, they didn&#x27;t have it.  It was in their flyer on sale for 2 weeks and they never had it in stock.  So,  went to Amazon.com and found it.  Price was great and I had a gift card to apply to my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my sister&#x27;s favorite perfumes.  She has used it since it came out.  Amazon.com has great prices and free shipping for purchases over $35.00.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my daughter and she loved it.  The price was perfect too.  She has found it at other places but at a much higher price.  Will definitely order it from here again.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Xmas gift for my 33 year old granddaughter, and she absolutely loved it.  I was glad I was able to purchase this through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent.  Size is very nice and an excellent value.  Lasts far longer than most other perfumes my wife has used.</li>
            <li> I love it!  I love it!  I love it!  it is a warm sensous smell and makes you feel sexy.</li>
            <li> I hated it because it does not smell like my usual Euphoria i always get. The bottle had a plastic piece I have never seen before.&lt;br /&gt; I have worn this perfume for years and l always love it and get many complements. I can usually smell it for days on my clothes. This bottle seemed  watered down....not like any I have ever experienced ever before.I ordered several bottles at Christmas and was thrilled! I want my money back on this FAKE  bottle!!!</li>
            <li> Great purchase, was as expected</li>
            <li> BUT every time I order a new bottle it is different.&lt;br /&gt;the color changes, the bottle is the same shape but the part that is silver is not always silver. It is very confusing.  They all smell the same. or very close.</li>
            <li> This cologne for men smells so good.  I wear the women&#x27;s, but I wasn&#x27;t sure what the men&#x27;s would smell like, but it smells so sexy.  My husband loves it.  The price is great for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li> Fast service, great price,  the real deal. So excited</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with Euphoria by Calvin Klein. The fragrance seems to last a long time. I have received a number of compliments from friends and complete strangers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to review a perfume since you all can&#x27;t smell it, but seriously, this is the best perfume ever.  Slightly &#x27;musky&#x27; I guess, but not heavy?  A very intriguing smell...I get compliments every single time I wear it...it smells so good and I always put it on after a shower, even if I\\&quot;m just going to bed.  I&#x27;m ADDICTED.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Was searching for a perfume that I could wear all the time. This is the one. I get many compliments. It isnt over powering. Really pleasant and wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful and light perfume. Perfect for everyday use. I would recommend. It&#x27;s light and pretty. Very feminine.</li>
            <li> I sampled this in a magazine, but when I got it - I don&#x27;t care for the smell.  This has nothing to do with the shipper at all, just the product</li>
            <li> Love this perfume; it has lasted me more than a year now (I wear it occasionally)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume as the scent is not overpowering like some.  I get many compliments when wearing it as it is a subtle fragrance. The only thing I dislike is the way the sprayer works as it will rotate in the top so you always have to check where the mister hole is to avoid being sprayed elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Euphoria is one of my favorite fragrances!  It is light, but lingering.  Have had many people ask what I was wearing as it smelled so good.  Some said it was &amp;#34;relaxing&amp;#34;.  Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have worn this scent for 10 years, I love it!! But this bottle&#x27;s scent is a little off, not sure if its an old bottle or if its a knock off.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite perfume and great price!!!!  I shop everywhere for this product it is the only perfume I wear.  This is definitely lowest price.</li>
            <li> this is like the fifth bottle i buy.. and i really like it, it smells amazing and its 100% original</li>
            <li> Girlfriend gave me a small sample and I got so many compliments, I had to have full size. I love it!</li>
            <li> My husband gave this to me for Christmas and I love it! Packaging was perfect and it was a full size as promised.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000MJZO78 Euphoria by Calvin Klein for Women 1.7 oz Eau de. Parfum EDP Spray]]I actually bought the bigger bottle. this product was just as i expected with sweet undercurrents and lovely over all notes. i haven&#x27;t actually bought it from amazon i bought it from a drug store but it lasted me a good 2 months and that is with EVERYONE in my family using it. that&#x27;s 16 people!!! if you want to try it i would recommend you buy the smaller sized bottle.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to find this fragrance on Amazon right after I had smelled and fell in love with it at Macy&#x27;s Department Store. There in the store this set was twice the price plus more. I was very thankful &amp; excited to find this!</li>
            <li> Love this scent!  Musky and very sexy, but not overpowering.  Every time I wear it I get tons of compliments, especially from men.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my fiancé for Christmas and she just loves it. Long lasting and very elegant scent. Would recommend it to any woman and it makes a lovely gift</li>
            <li> I am most unhappy with this product, I was told I would get a refund, I have not gotten one.  This is not Euphoria at all, it is a fake and a bad one at that.  I paid 38.00 dollars for something I threw away, as I was told I would not have to send it back to get my refund.  The bottle has no markings on it at all as the true product does and it smells terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy about being out 38.00.  I contacted Amazon to file a claim and have heard back.  I will never shop at Amazon again if this is not addressed real soon, and it has been over a week and don&#x27;t see it happening.  I also will make sure others know about this.  I want my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered through Amazon before with good luck, this however has left a  horrible taste in my mouth, I want my money back as promised.</li>
            <li> I cannot get enough of this smell!  It is so beautiful!  My all time favorite one!&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very attractive as well.  When I ran out of this I actually pouted!&lt;br /&gt;I begged for it for Christmas too and I was lucky enough to get a gift card to Amazon so I could buy it for myself!</li>
            <li> Wonderful it smells wonderful. Never used it before but I smelled it and wanted to try it. I would do it again.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife and she was amazed at how large the bottle was, and how little it cost.  Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine wears this scent and I know that some perfumes don&#x27;t always smell the same when they are on your own body, but I took a risk and I bought it and it paid off!!  I love this perfume!  I get a lot of compliments on it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume purchased for my daughter. She is thrilled with it and I \\&quot;borrow\\&quot; it when she isn&#x27;t around.....</li>
            <li> I havent even tested it before buying it, but I am very happy with the purchase. Is the best perfume I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this perfume.... It last all day.  I always get compliments on it.  Purchase it, you wont be sorry. :)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and the price was absolutely incredible.  i have had strangers come up to me and ask me what perfume i am wearing .  it is a great scent!</li>
            <li> My husband had purchased this perfume for me the first time I tried it and everyone would say oh you smell really nice what is that you&#x27;re wearing? So I found it on amazon at a considerably lower price and was so happy. I would definitely recommend this fragrance to anyone.</li>
            <li> Perfume does not have the TRUE fragrance of the Calvin Klein &amp;#34;Euphoria&amp;#34; beautiful distinct Eau De Parfum!! Is it a &amp;#34;knockoff&amp;#34;???</li>
            <li> I know some people are hesitant about buying perfume that needs to be shipped but when you buy this one, you wont have any issues. No matter what buyer i buy this particular fragrance from, it always smells the same. My wife cant get enough of this stuff. This is the only perfume she has ever had that needed to be re-bought after she goes through her supply....lol</li>
            <li> Every year I get gifts for the employees in my company so I ask them all what they would like. One woman always asks me for this same perfume, the Euphoria. Every year I get it for her for the last few years and she loves the scent. Based on her suggestion I got my wife a sample too. Perfect gift.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells fabulous, i have received many comments and I would recommend this perfume and I would also continue to wear this scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and I love it. It has a real sexy smell and she likes it to and gets complements.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my girlfriend and I must say it smells really well. I don&#x27;t know anything about smells (my sister told me there are soft smells, floral smells and so on, I think...) What I can tell you though is that the smell is amazing, it&#x27;s not too strong but not too weak either, right in the middle which is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size: I would recommend this 3.4 Ounce to anyone. It carries a lot and with only one spray it is enough to make the user smell amazing. I predict it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts: I wanted a good perfume, instead I got an amazing perfume! I am very pleased with my purchase and would encourage anyone to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, please ask and I&#x27;ll answer as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s a bigger bottle than I have purchased in the store for LESS $. I will definitely order this product again online vs. a store purchase.</li>
            <li> What woman does not LOVE this scent, answer is - They all LOVE it! Men can be overpowered so use sparingly ladies!</li>
            <li> Great price and it&#x27;s the exact same product sold in stores. It shipped pretty quickly and it came in the same purple/mauve box it does elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The price was excellent and the perfume is awesome.  It arrived early and the packaging was very secure</li>
            <li> I have received nothing BUT compliments when I am wearing this. If I could change one thing it would be the price.</li>
            <li> Very good product, I loved it, I would not hesitate to recommend the purchase or store or buy it again in this way. Excellent.</li>
            <li> This is pure sophistication in a bottle. I am a fan of Calvin Klein fragrances, they are elegant without being overbearing. This I believe, is the best of the lot. I have been using Eternity, but this is a notch above.</li>
            <li> Its smells light and which is what my wife wants and its EDP which means its not diluted with alcohol. definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> Great price for my perfume.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about he company and perfume.  I get so many compliments on Euphoria perfume.  I first purchased for $80 dollars.  But very price.  This company was at a way better price and the customer service is excellent!  Not only did it come package correctly, on time, but they contacted me to ask me if the order was correct and on time.  Though it was, it is so nice that a company cares about their customer to touch base with them on a personal level!  A must buy THROUGH this company!</li>
            <li> I wear this daily and get nothing but compliments. Everyone asks what I am wearing but I hesitate to tell them as I don&#x27;t want them all to wear &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; signature scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for 7 years. I always get compliments! It&#x27;s such a feminine scent. I couldn&#x27;t believe the great deal on Amazon for this and was a bit worried by the comments about it being a fake. It was definitely not fake. The same gorgeous scent I always buy!</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume for girls and women in their 20-30s. I gifted to my young sister-in-law and she loved it. It comes as a set with perfume , body lotion and a vial. Just the perfect gift which gives value to your money and satisfies the person who owns it complete satisfaction.</li>
            <li> One of my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume. Never can go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Good value when I bought it, boyfriend likes the smell, and I like the smell. :) Slightly sweet and floral and musky, but not overly-anything.</li>
            <li> I just love it. I have allot of compliments!!!</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife as a gift.  She loves the scent and the bottle is kind of cool looking too. She recommends it.</li>
            <li> there just isn&#x27;t any smell when I wear it  I was disappointed. Other reviews had the same comment. I have tried the product about three times</li>
            <li> it was the exact product described at an amazing price.  shipped and arrived very quickly. very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Nice smell but does not last long at all!  I was so anxious to receive my package but was disappointed after :(</li>
            <li> What a great price. I really wanted this perfume and it was 85.00 at macys and I got a great price through you. thank u!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a mother&#x27;s day present, and was very disappointed to realize upon opening that the scent was nothing like Euphoria. My mom has worn this scent for 5+ years and it did not compare to the original. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> I love Euphoria, but with this purchase I did not have a good experience.  It sprays in a stream instead of a mist and the smell last, for at most, 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance (somewhat woodsy) while the black orchids give it a romantic feel</li>
            <li> This perfume I also bought for my Christmas and I really expected more out of it. Maybe its just not my type of scent.</li>
            <li> Great bargain and smells divine.  Packaged so that nothing would possibly happening to the perfume.  Made a wonderful gift for Valentine&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li> Euphoria has been my fav perfume for a while. When I found this deal I couldn&#x27;t pass it up! I received it sooner than expected as well! Very happy customer!!</li>
            <li> Smelled very old!! So much so that it was like cheap men&#x27;s cologne. Gave it to a very old man. I wasted my hard earned money but learned a valuable lesson. Next time I&#x27;ll go to the mall as I should have in the first place:(</li>
            <li> This is a lovely fragrance for those who don&#x27;t want a perfume that hits you over the head with its scent. It&#x27;s sensual but very soft and wears well throughout the day. The order arrived quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Had this perfume before and just had to get it again. I would recommend it for anyone. Very subtle scent.</li>
            <li> wow nice she loved it</li>
            <li> I have bought this for my former girlfriend and mother, and they both loved it. I love it too.</li>
            <li> Fake please do not buy!!</li>
            <li> This did not meet my expectations. It was not the real version at all. The smell did not last long, the quality was poor and if I could I would send back!</li>
            <li> When I opened the delivery box the perfume box looked like what it was suppose to be, but when I took the bottle out of the box it had not lableling on it and the bottle was a cheap plastic and I could hardly get the cap off and when I did I thought the bottle was going to fall apart??  Then when I went to spray the perfume it went everywhere, the spray nosal was broke and when I smelled it it was aweful!!  Did not smell like Euphoria and I have been wearing this perfume for 7yrs. now.  I tried to contact the company several times and I got no reponse, so I filed and A to Z claim with Amazon and they took care of me and I appreciated that!!</li>
            <li> I had bought this for me a while back and my sister loved it so much that I ordered it again to gift it to my sister and we both love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is not what I ordered! I ordered two bottles of the euphoria and I&#x27;ve been buying it since it&#x27;s came out and I&#x27;ve never had the smell be like this. It&#x27;s like pure alcohol! I thought hmm maybe it was mixed wrong.... So I opened the second box it was the same way. Both bottles r the correct bottle and the box too but the liquid on the inside is a dark purple and it&#x27;s not the fragrance I ordered.</li>
            <li> I submitted another review  and it was not allowed to be posted but like many of these other reviews it is definitely not the real deal  I know what it is supposed to smell  like I should&#x27;ve known better with the price and all fairness fast shipping but I returned it</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Euphoria for several years.  It never ceases to amaze me, but I always get compliments from people that &amp;#34;I smell good&amp;#34;.  Love this product...........</li>
            <li> Great scent and a huge bottle.  What a deal!  I am more than pleased with this purchase.  This bottle will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> It is a great del and a great product, for that size. My wife always goes back to this product</li>
            <li> I have asked for return. It does smell nice, but comparing to the store bought one it doesn&#x27;t last. disappointed with the product, but amazon customer service is always great and they took care of the refund.</li>
            <li> Very good smelling perfume. My girlfriend loves it, and so do I. She will certainly want me to get her more of this product.</li>
            <li> I have never wore a fragrence to wear both men and women come up to me and want to know what I am wearing!!!  I have been wearing this fragerance for years.  I lkove it!!!!</li>
            <li> GREAT SELLER, FAST DELIVERY, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</li>
            <li> This does not smell like the bottle I purchased at a department store. I don&#x27;t know if it was just old or it&#x27;s not genuine Calvin Klein. I&#x27;ve had more than one bad experience with buying perfume here and won&#x27;t do it again. Yes, it&#x27;s less expensive but it&#x27;s not worth it. It was definitely not up to par.</li>
            <li> LOVE this fragance and will certainly buy more of it! The price is very good for the size, and I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read the review and it was rated highly.  When it came, I was a little unsure of how I&#x27;d like it.  After the first wear, it has become my absolute favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product, wife loved it! Enough said!</li>
            <li> smells good but i like euphoria blossom better... this one is like a women&#x27;s cologne and is really close to a man&#x27;s cologne. smells very good but i like euphoria blossom a little bit better, lol. this one is a deeper scent, probably good for going out at night or a fall/winter scent. still smells nice though! i like it!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as advertised... Would by form them again..&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Perfect &amp; received when said</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted. The packaging was nicely put together and the perfume box wasn&#x27;t damaged in any way. Easy to open and I am extremely pleased with this purchase. I would recommend this to anyone who likes this scent.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Calvin Klein&#x27;s Euphoria for years.  I usually purchase my perfumes from Macy&#x27;s.  I am also a big fan of Amazon.com. I have purchased many things on Amazon over the years. I saw Euphoria on amazon.com for 1/2 the price I normally pay so I bought it.  THERE IS NO SMELL TO THIS PERFUME!  I sprayed it several times and absolutely NO SCENT!!!!!  It is odorless!  Then imagine my surprise when I find out I can&#x27;t return it because Amazon classifies it as a hazardous gas!  I am very disappointed and out $35+!</li>
            <li> What more can I say.  The price was great and I love the product.  It&#x27;s wonderful for a more mature lady and my husband likes it on me.  That means a lot because he&#x27;s very particular about scents.  I was thrilled to find it at this price and haven&#x27;t regretted my purchase for a moment.</li>
            <li> I work at a large pet store and let&#x27;s be honest, sometimes it smells and sometimes I smell too as a result... I keep the &amp;#34;silver taco&amp;#34; in my purse so I can freshen up in the middle of the day if need be... I get so many compliments from customers on how lovely I smell! One even asked me what the name of the perfume was because he liked it so much he wanted to buy a bottle for his wife... I&#x27;ve been using the same bottle for months and there&#x27;s still a lot of it left because a little of it goes a long way...</li>
            <li> Love Calvin Klein fragrances and this is another go to scent for me.  Warm but not too heavy and floral but not to flowery.</li>
            <li> This has become my signature scent and everywhere I go I have both men AND women walking by me and saying \\&quot;mmmm... you smell GOOD!\\&quot;  I swear I wonder if this has phermones in it? Some of the men are like little puppies with their tails wagging!     I must say... I love the reaction. And I LOVE the euphoria!</li>
            <li> I loved the top notes of this perfume- all fruity and sensual.  It really was a gorgeous fruity scent.  But then I got beyond the top notes and all I smelled was musk.  Lots of musk, and it was a very masculine musk.  I smelled like a man most of the day.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m not a huge fan.  If I could only capture those top notes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And people aren&#x27;t kidding on the staying power.  This stuff lasts forever.</li>
            <li> This indeed is a beautiful fragrance.  It lasts a long time and for the price it&#x27;s well worth it.    Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I really like the Euphoria by Calvin Klein.  I am so glad I bought it.  I also liked how fast I received it after I bought it.  I like to get the product right away and with Amazon I did.</li>
            <li> I love Calvin but this fragrance is too sweet and not an alluring scent.</li>
            <li> I pay $82 for this same perfume (brand and size) in department stores and yet I got it for approx. $46 on Amazon!!!  I don&#x27;t know how they do it...........</li>
            <li> It does NOT smell the same as the bottle I purchased from Younkers!  It does not have the last effecting or the fresh smell! It does not meet my expectations and I would not recommend purchasing this item. However, Amazon quickly responded by refunding my purchase :)</li>
            <li> I cant stop smelling this perfume it smells delicious, mysterious, and very feminine! Wearing this perfume makes me feel sexxy lol! Please don&#x27;t buy it I want to be the only woman wearing this scent...just joking buy it you wont regret it! ;)</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that this might be a fake for the low price, but the product was genuine and came completely sealed and brand new in the box</li>
            <li> Just as delightful as I expected it too be.</li>
            <li> I  love  this  product  and  fit  the  price  paid it was  defiantly  more  then  worth  the  purchase.  It  will  last a  long  time too</li>
            <li> Loved the calvin klein euphoria.the shipping was great .this was my first time to order on line and it was with amazon.I will order again.I have a lot of birthdays coming up.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this perfume a couple of years ago and people are constantly complimenting me on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great seller and great product!  Thanks for everything!</li>
            <li> Euphoria by Calvin Klein for Women, Eau De Parfum Spray, 3.4 Ounce. Purchased for my wife. She has been using this product for years without giving her a headache. I decided to purchase it at Amazon this time. It is the same as what they sell at department stores but at a discounted price which you&#x27;ll never get at department stores.  She is very happy. So am I!</li>
            <li> I love my Euphoria!  Had been wanting to purchase for the last few years but could never afford to buy  it from all the fancy stores, too expensive ($70 - $80) !  I went on Amazon and found Euphoria for  $38!  I get compliments on it everywhere I go!  I recommend Euphoria for all us beautiful women!  I will definitely purchase Euphoria from Amazon in the future.</li>
            <li> Calvin Klein outdid himself with Euphoria. It&#x27;s a clean, neat scent that can smell professional and decently homely at the same time. It can stay on your clothes delightfully for days. Spray it on your coats and blazers and step out in a better mood. I still find the scent refreshing after years of use. It&#x27;s one of those classic perfumes to have, which work in all situations.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom and she LOVES it! I&#x27;m not much of a perfume wearer but I would wear this!</li>
            <li> Euphoria by Calvin Klein for Women was on the top of my daughter&#x27;s Christmas list, she LOVES IT! Beautiful bottle!</li>
            <li> My favorite....&lt;br /&gt;Euphoria by Calvin Klein for Women, Eau De Parfum Spray, 3.4 Ounce sells for twice as much in departments stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she loved it. Its one of her favorite perfume and it was arrived on time and it was origional as well, of course!</li>
            <li> Excelente compra, el producto llego en buen estado y a tiempo, de manera general podria recalcar que es una fragancia exquisita</li>
            <li> Wife will only wear this,and she loves it.</li>
            <li> On time delivery. Product as advertised</li>
            <li> Great product that works very well for my needs. Thank you for offering a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Been wearing this fragrance for many years my all time favorite getting many compliments on it to</li>
            <li> Love this smell, it&#x27;s such a beautiful sweet scent that I love on the friend that it was purchased for. I would definitely buy this item again.</li>
            <li> The wife just loves this product and uses it often.  I will definitely replace it with the same the next time she needs such.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know...  the sample I got from the department store seemed to last longer.  This fragrance sort of fades out.  I love the scent, it&#x27;s just that by the middle of the day, it seems not to be there any more.</li>
            <li> It was fake Euphoria....ordered 3 bottles and 1 was pink colored perfume n the other 2 were two  different shades of purple.  The bottles were plastic not metal and glass.  I&#x27;ve worn Euphoria for 5+ yrs....I could identify its fraudulent content immediately.  I demanded a full refund and threw the junk out.  The scent was NOT even close to real Euphoria.  No where was it disclosed it was fake.  This seller should never be able to sell through you again as I made you aware of this immediately.</li>
            <li> very sophisticated, a great signature perfume. It&#x27;s not overpowering and this is the perfume I wear to work everyday. I get compliments all the time and everyone always asks what I&#x27;m wearing</li>
            <li> This is a sexy bottle and a sexy scent.  Scent last and seems to change making it more intriguing .  Arrived on time and well packaged.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this scent and I love it as she is wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;Great price as well.</li>
            <li> Purchased the Euphoria as a Xmas gift for my sister who is very particular about her scents. She loved this one and she also thought the bottle was very attractive</li>
            <li> Only Calvin Klein scent that I find to like, most of the others just tend to be dated.  Scent last for hours.</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for years, and I have never found a better price than here.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> there  was a sample of this perfume in a ad i really liked it ..  when it arrived i sprayed some on me it smelled so nice , then  the  following week i sprayed some on me it smelled different plus wasnt as strong so im not sure ... buti did give 5 stsrs becuz arrived on time , the sellers are great , if you need assistance they respond asap ..  even though i feel this perfume has a  lovely scent i dont understand why it smells different after the 2nd week ... would i recommend this perfume yes i would , mayb its just me , not sure..</li>
            <li> hi,&lt;br /&gt;  i was just a little nervous about this perfume because i want to present my wife, but when i open at the front of my wife i was so excited because this was a present i want to present my wife. she was to glad to have. the bottle is perfect so charming i highly recommend this . best gift for woman or girls close your eyes and buy it. you gonna appreciate me for this product .</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I use it for myself and the price was not too bad but can get it cheaper from groupon. I also gave a friend of mine this gift to try it. have not heard yet if she does.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this scent and I love the scent on her. I&#x27;m glad the price is as low as it is on amazon!</li>
            <li> Great perfume, CK is always a nice gift. Very nice aroma and not over powering. Will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife and confess that I enjoy it the most because it smells so sexy on her.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like the one I got from the department store, It is light and fading after 5 mins, I wonder if you send me the actural Euphoria by Calvin Klein or something else</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes.  I find it kind of musky but in a good way.  I have received many compliments on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It really does smell like euphoria</li>
            <li> Le gusto a mi esposa, tiene muy buen aroma. llego a tiempo y sin ningún problema el empaque sin ningún problema</li>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance. My mother in law has worn this for years, and I found it for an excellent price here on amazon for a present.</li>
            <li> At the beginning I was not satisfied because the scent was not as strong as my previous ones, and it was not lasting as the ones I had before.&lt;br /&gt;Then, the whole lid fall apart in my bag after 5 days. $40 for 5 days!&lt;br /&gt;And interestingly, after the whole 3.4 ounce of perfume being poured in my bag, my bag doesn&#x27;t smell that much!&lt;br /&gt;I believe it was an imitation, as its quality was way far from the ones I used to have.</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT MY WIFE WANTED</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift for my birthday last year.  Used it so much I ran out and was very happy that I could purchase it again..</li>
            <li> Not the real deal!! Had to put it on 3 times yesterday!! Disappointed!!  Should have known better.  Price was tooooo good!</li>
            <li> What a lovely scent!  I get a lot of complements on this perfume.  Comes in a beautiful bottle.  Makes a beautiful display all by itself.</li>
            <li> I ordered the perfume for my friend as a holiday gift. Amazon offered good price so I placed an order. The order was shipped instantly and received the package within two days. I was extremely disappointed when I opened the package. The outer wrapper of the perfume was cut open. When I opened the box, there were finger impressions on the bottle. Looks like they sent me a used product.&lt;br /&gt;Also the perfume doesn&#x27;t smell the way I buy ones from mace&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I WEAR TWO PERFUMES  THIS AND ESTE LAUDER&#x27;S  SPELLBOUND.......I GET COMPLIMENTS  FOR  THE EUPHORIA ALOT....I LOVE IT.....  SO HAPPY I WAS ABLE TO FIND IT AGAIN......</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girl for Christmas. Smells wonderful and got it cheaper than in the stores. This bottle she say will last her a year or more.</li>
            <li> This spray was not for me, but, my daughter.  Spray smells great, but, like, most sprays, I feel it is too high priced.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price, my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT!!!...Product. VERY reasonable price-half the price comparing with other retailers. I recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described.</li>
            <li> Very good small and quality</li>
            <li> Before, I&#x27;ve never remembered to put on perfume so often. But with Euphoria, I just love smelling myself :) So I put it on everyday.  It smells dreamy after it&#x27;s been on at least 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also attracts men like bees to honey. I actually don&#x27;t like that cuz I&#x27;d rather have a man be attracted to me, and not my perfume :)</li>
            <li> The smell of this fragrance is not incredible. I&#x27;m still wondering why it&#x27;s gotten such great reviews. It&#x27;s not very feminine. It could also be a scent for male. It&#x27;s not light. It doesn&#x27;t exactly smell like flowers. It&#x27;s a somewhat pleasant fragrance but smells like nothing I&#x27;ve ever smelled in nature. The first day I wore it, when I got home, I immediately showered to get the scent off me because it was slightly nauseating. And I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve smelled at least 3 other brands that had nearly the EXACT SAME SCENT! It&#x27;s really nothing to rave about. I did receive a compliment on the perfume but I also wore my Ann Taylor flowery perfume with it so that combination may have drawn the compliment... Anyway, do not buy. If you really want to see how it smells, try it on at Sephora or buy a sample vial off eBay like I did.</li>
            <li> I really loved the smell of this perfume for the first few hours. It&#x27;s very sweet, light and lovely in the beginning. After a while it leaves a very strong woody, patchouli scent and I&#x27;m left wanting the sweet back.</li>
            <li> I did research and the price was right for me. This was ordered as a gift. My sister loves this perfume so I would recommend.</li>
            <li> It was Euphoria just buying this product. People said how wonderful this was........but for me it was Euphoria. Instantly in love like your first time. It will be for you too.</li>
            <li> I have always used this product it&#x27;s my very favorite. I get tons of compliments on this perfume. The price was a real bargain. It&#x27;s half of what I usually pay and arrived on time. From now on as long as amazon carries the product I will buy it from them.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice scent.  I only gave it 4 stars because the scent only lasts a few hours before having to reapply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always love Calvin Klein products especially the perfumes but the Euphoria is just not for me. It&#x27;s a bit too musky/ too strong for me. I like it when it mellow down already because the smell lingers long and after a day, your clothes still smells good without being over powering. I suggest if you spray this, 1 spray is enough or you can spray your clothes a day ahead before wearing it so by the time you have to wear your clothes, it wouldn&#x27;t be too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I got this as a present for my wife. I love it when she wears it and she does to.</li>
            <li> I just fell in love with this perfume, :)  bought it for a second time.&lt;br /&gt;the scent also lasts long</li>
            <li> This was bought as a gift for my girlfriend and everything was great. Service, shipping, price and quality was what everyone would like it to be.</li>
            <li> Did not smell the same and the scent didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> my wife loves it and I like the way it smells on her.</li>
            <li> Excelente perfume, recibido el producto en buenas condiciones de acuerdo a la acordado, la compra se completo satisfactoriamente, recomendados. Gracias</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a gift for my wife. We had purchased Euphoria perviously and this is a replacement at a great price.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent, timely delivery</li>
            <li> It has a sensual, yet sophisticated scent that is absolutely timeless.  I love Calvin Klein&#x27;s Euphoria, and Amazon for it&#x27;s convenience and great prices.  Very happy customer! :-)</li>
            <li> excellence in service and price , I will beback to you in the near future, wish you continue success with your bussiness</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife, who loves it.  I went with the 3.4oz, double the size of the smaller, as it was only $5 more.</li>
            <li> The scent of this spray didn&#x27;t seem as concentrated as the scent in the tester bottle of the same perfume; other than that, it met expectations.</li>
            <li> DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM from this on-line site. I have purchased this item in the past numerous times at Boscov&#x27;s, Kohl&#x27;s, and Macy&#x27;s with great satisfaction. Unfortunately, this on-line purchase, for this product, MUST BE A REJECT or OUT OF DATE. The cost was approximately $15 cheaper and I can tell. NEVER AGAIN would I do an online purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I threw out the box, ergo, no return.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just marvelous.... I could use it all time.. Ever lasting lovely odour. I really love it. Very fantastic awesome o e.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a very good price</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this perfume and it is the best that I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I got Euphoria by Calvin Klein for my wife. I have been a long time admirer of the CK line of scents and Euphoria didn&#x27;t disappoint. Euphoria by Calvin Klein was my wife&#x27;s introduction to the Calvin Klein perfumes and she loves this stuff. Guys, if you want to spice things up with your lady, check out this scent!</li>
            <li> Calvin Klein Euphoria is a MUST have fragrance.  It is very sensual and lasts all day, yet isn&#x27;t overpowering.  A perfect blend of black violet, pomegranate, black orchid, mahogany wood, persimmon, and lotus blossom.  Not too sweet or spicy --Just right!  I get many compliments on it throughout the day.  Kudos to Calvin Klein.  I just bought it for myself for Christmas, however, I paid $70 for the 3.4 ounce at the department store.  I&#x27;ve added to my wish list and I&#x27;m sure future purchases will be made with Amazon at great savings.</li>
            <li> Everyone always compliments me on how amazing I smell! I will get this perfume again for sure.  I bought one for my sister as well.</li>
            <li> The recipient was thrilled with the design of the bottle first off, I have yet to know how the fragrance itself is liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smelled something so wonderful in the produce section of a grocery store and when I realized it was coming from a shopper (I knew at that moment it was a Christmas gift I was going to give someone), I found her in another part of the store and asked her what she was wearing and she told me Calvin Klein Euphoria.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, but it is expensive.  What more can I say?  It smellsgreat on her, too!</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume in a beautiful bottle. Would recommend if you like a nice, not in your face, scent.  It&#x27;s pleasant to the senses.</li>
            <li> Have always liked this, and I have been wearing this perfume for several years now. I ran out, so I bought a larger bottle this time.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my wife and I am glad that I chose this.  She liked it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it was way cheaper on Amazon than it was on a store in mall.</li>
            <li> awesome smell....mild and sweet</li>
            <li> Smells great and is definitely the real deal!</li>
            <li> This is my wifes favorite perfume and I LOVE the way it smells on her. It makes me wanna jump her bones</li>
            <li> I  have been using Calvin Klein Euphoria Eau De Parfum Spray for several years.  I can&#x27;t say enough about it except, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It is the only parfum I can wear without getting a headache.  I get so many complements on how good I smell.  I Love It!!</li>
            <li> I always get compliments it&#x27;s perfect perfume not too much or too girly I love it and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> EUPHORIA is exactly right! My husbands first words were&amp;#34; What fragrance are you wearing? You smell so good!&amp;#34; That made my week because it stirred his senses and his actions have been have you lost your mind!!!!&lt;br /&gt;If alluring and sexy are two things you like to be and feel, buy fragrances on the high end because Emeraude was four decades ago and you will be noticed, in a good way.</li>
            <li> THE PERFUME WAS A GIFT.  I ORDERED PRETTY CLOSE TO CHRISTMAS, BUT IT ARRIVED  WITH TIME TO SPARE.  I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE FAST SERVICE, AND THE PRICE WAS EXCELLENT!  THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This is a scent my wife likes so I purchased it for her.  Everything about the purchase and delivery went as anticipated.  The gift has been given and she is happy with the item - nothing else matters.  All is well!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas, I love it and so does she!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this. Smells and lasts just like if you were to purchase right in the store such as Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It smells good when you spray it on, but fades quickly. Unlike the one i bought at Macy&#x27;s.  Could this be fake?</li>
            <li> Nobody compares to euphoria,sorry noseies 😄</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t smell it when applied. No one has said they like the scent.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I purchased online and it was good for the price. It do not look like a fake perfume as i thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife. This is her favorite perfume. This is first time we bought online and we are happy.</li>
            <li> A friend from work wears this perfume. I loved the smell so went to the store to use the tester to find out if it would work with my chemistry and there we go It&#x27;s now my favorite. They were always out of the large bottle for sale then when I compared the price with Amazon and the store even with the 30% off coupon Amazon was a much better deal. You get the biggest bottle for about the same price as Kolh&#x27;s smaller sized bottle. Target also carries it but still to expensive. Hope this helps you to decide were to get this. By the way, this smells like a sexy, provocitive, suductive perfume but also good to wear during the day because at the same time its clean and fresh. Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> Great value, and the real deal. I have been wearing Euphoria for a long time and was a bit skeptical because the price was so much lower than what you would find in the store. I am more than pleased.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on this one. Everywhere I go. Nice floral smell. And it&#x27;s pretty strong, not watery.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite found it online for a great price.  It was much cheaper than going to Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This is something I would recommend to a friend, great price, great service, great value! There are several versions of this name though, so if you&#x27;re shopping for someone else take care to find out which version is their favorite.</li>
            <li> This perfume is really the calvin klein version. thank god! i was worried that i&#x27;d get ripped off. anyways, great perfume and fast delivery. thanks!</li>
            <li> The bottle is out of this world. The fragrance lingers and is a blast. Gives the right tingle for men to lookup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Euphoria for a few years.  My husband loves it!  It is the real deal &amp; I can&#x27;t beat the price or delivery from anywhere else.  I am extremely pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I am sorry that I purchased this product through whom ever it was sent. It was an imitation of the perfume. I am very disappointed. I will not recommend for any one to buy via this company.</li>
            <li> Will always buy the perfume. It has a very clean classic scent. Get so many compliments when wearing this fragrance</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with this purchase . And my daughter loved it . Price for the size I got was a great deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on December and It haven&#x27;t deliveried in Ecuador.&lt;br /&gt; But the money was charged my credit card I have tried the return it but this product is not allowed. It is the first time it happens when I make an online purchase to lose money and do not send me the product.</li>
            <li> Christmas present that gets use everyday.  I typically buy discounted perfume at wal-mart or target or something that does the trick for my wife.  She loves the scent and I never really realized the difference between cheap perfume and top of the line.  This is top of the line.  In fact, one spray is all it takes for her and the bathroom smells girlie all day after she uses it.  I&#x27;d buy another when she runs through this bottle.  Might last all year with such a large bottle of it.  Also...very nice bottle that she displays on the counter without reservation.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I love my perfume and this is my absolutely favorite fragrance, I usually get it at Sam&#x27;s club for a really good price but this price was even better...a total savings and worth it.  Recieved my order quickly and was totally happy..thanks :)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and have bought it for years. Smells wonderful. Cost is good for the amount you get</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Euphoria for 8 or so years now and it&#x27;s still my favorite scent. People often stop and ask me what I&#x27;m wearing or comment that someone smells nice.</li>
            <li> One spray of this perfume and everyone will be asking what you are wearing. I originally bought this for a trip to Vegas but ended up buying this again and again. The smell is not your typical light and flowerly perfume. It is not manly in any way, nor does it carry a woodsy smell. But it is a great perfume to have for those days you feel a little mysterious and mischievous!</li>
            <li> My wife buys this all the time, it is a nice smell for executives, not overbearing but a plesant smell.</li>
            <li> This is a Great product, and it smells amazing. This is my favorite perfume. Boyfriend loves it. I always get compliments everywhere I go.</li>
            <li> My wife fell in love with this fragrance at a local store.  I looked at the price.... $90... Ouch! Found it on Amazon for nearly half the price and was skeptical. I ordered it anyway and it tried out perfect. It is the exact same scent, bottle, packaging of the one in the local beauty store r way less. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, and it is a lot cheaper than purchasing it through a retail store. It is a good size bottle, as well.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff, it smells great and has real staying power. Once it&#x27;s on others will know it.</li>
            <li> Great smell, strong but very feminine, gives me confidence. It is not fake, smells and lasts exactly the same as bought from the store  for the double as much.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Bought it for my wife on Valentines Day based on reviews.  Took a chance, and its the best smelling stuff I&#x27;ve bought her.  Its got a good even blend, not too sweet which is what I like.</li>
            <li> i love this perfume!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand those that review this as fake. Just because I read those reviews, I took my nearly empty bottle of perfume and spritzed on one hand. Then I opened my new bottle and spritzed on the other. Exactly the same scent. Now one thing I know for sure about Euphoria is that is smells differently when sprayed on different parts of my body. My preference is to spay it on my neck. It is a unique perfume with a unique chemistry and it is also versatile. But for those reading the review...it is exactly the same as the bottle I bought at Belks 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> One of the best perfumes, I have even bought.</li>
            <li> My fav perfume. Every time I wear it get tons of compliments from both men and women.</li>
            <li> This is a super nice scent. It is not the least bit overpowering but has enough staying power so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about it wearing off. You will smell it on your clothes until you launder them. A very sensual scent. My husband loves it so that&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li> I love this scent by CK. It is of the &amp;#34;grown and sexy&amp;#34; variety. This scent is classic and has the ability to mutate from day to evening.</li>
            <li> Price Great, quality great. Very happy with purchase. Highly recommended for the special lady in your life. Top notch like most CK products.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Eau De Parfum Spray!  If you choose to purchase and wear this product, expect to be noticed and receive compliments!  A little goes a long way and the scent lasts and lasts!  Seller provides excellent product and reasonable shipping rates and delivery time.  I would not only recommend purchasing this product but highly recommend purchasing from this seller!</li>
            <li> Addicting Scent - Seductive and romantic, but also classy. I often find myself wafting the scent towards me.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful Design - The bottle looks and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;Versatility - I wear it both to the office and for going out.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Lotion - I received the perfume AND a lotion, which was a pleasant surprise!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, 10/10 would buy again!</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother who claims that it has to be a fake product. It is sold by Amazon.com LLC, so I do not know if that has any influence on whether the product is original or a fake, but i purchased another perfume at the same time and have the same issue with it. She says that the smell/perfume goes away in less than an hour and is highly displeased. And we are not able to return the product due to: &amp;#34;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.&amp;#34; Overall, I would not recommend or buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I attempted to get a refund, as this smells nothing like the real product, and was kindly told I could check with Calvin Klein and link the batch number on the bottle. Just felt I should share this information, as I&#x27;m out the $42 I had saved.</li>
            <li> Got it for my lady she loves it. The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering it last for day I love smelling it on her.</li>
            <li> doesnt have much of a smell will not purchase it again</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife. She loves it.</li>
            <li> The scent is ok. However the design of the bottle is kind of stupid because the bottom is not flat and it can not sit still and keeps turning.</li>
            <li> Excelente colonia, 100% original.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Mom, and it&#x27;s the only perfume she wears. She loves the scent and gets several compliments.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find Euphoria on Amazon.com, and for a good price too. This is my favorite scent. I thought the price was reasonable too.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It has such a soft and sensual scent that I can&#x27;t resist but to keep smelling it lol. Men love this scent on the ladies, I know my husband does. I highly recommend this, you can&#x27;t go wrong with such a provocative yet classy scent Euphoria brings.</li>
            <li> Got this for a girlfriend.  The scent is amazing to me and she loves it as well.  I know perfumes are an individual preference thing, but this smells great and isn&#x27;t overbearing.  Amazon has a great price on it as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister at one point and she raved about it. So I decided to try  it, I had a very different experience. I was not impressed, I gave it to my sister.</li>
            <li> I actually tried several different perfumes in a couple of different department stores including JCPenney and Kohl&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;This seems like something my wife would like, so I went ahead and found a low price online, ordered it for Christmas, and it came on time, and was received very well on unwrapping day.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering, and my husband LOVES IT!  Deciding on a scent is a very personal thing but, I feel over 80% of women will enjoy this scent.</li>
            <li> This perfume honestly smells delicious, I can&#x27;t get enough of it. If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, I would even spray it on me before I go to bed! However, if you do not like perfumes that are on the sweeter side, then this might not be for you. My mom doesn&#x27;t like it because she thinks it&#x27;s too sweet. It has a floral/sweet scent, almost a little musky as well. I just got it in today, so I&#x27;m excited to wear it out because a lot of people say they constantly get compliments on it. And it DOES last through the whole day! I don&#x27;t know why people say it doesn&#x27;t... You actually have to be careful on how much you put on because it is strong and does last long, and it lingers on your clothes. That&#x27;s what you get with a high quality perfume. The price is also amazing on Amazon. In the department stores, this larger bottle will cost you about 80 bucks! But I got it for under 50. And shipping was right on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended!!</li>
            <li> It is a pleasant smell! It is beautiful! It was easy o order while sitting here at home! i would reccommend it to my friends and relatives when they ask about it!</li>
            <li> This is a great scent for Fall/Winter - &amp;#34;Heavier/dense&amp;#34; scent that will fit the mood when snuggling up with the fleece blanket when it&#x27;s cold and snowing outside.</li>
            <li> This perfume is exactly how it&#x27;s described . . . As Euphoric!  This is the real scent and it&#x27;s wonderful! Men purchase this for your Lady because you&#x27;ll want to smell her all day! Wonderful investment!</li>
            <li> Very good gift. It did leak in shipment.this is stupid to have to put in so many words. I will never do this again</li>
            <li> not sure if this wasn&#x27;t a knock off, I HAVE ALWAYS bought  this fragrance in the stores, tried this route because it was less expensive but fragrance was weak and did not last long. I will stick with retail stores for this product, price difference is worth it to get quality product.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife she did not only like it but love it and I secretly go behind her to use it because it smells so good .</li>
            <li> No the original. Smells horrible.</li>
            <li> Very seductive and aromatic fragance.,</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this smell. Well worth the money and get a lot of good comments when walking past people. Smells rich, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Loved it ............</li>
            <li> Awesome smell on women</li>
            <li> very good item and seller</li>
            <li> I get asked what scent I&#x27;m wearing at least once I week.  I LOVE this perfume!  Smells better the longer I wear it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, I often refer to it as my professional perfume.  I love to wear it when I want to feel important or in charge.  Its a scent the last all day and lets everyone know that you have arrived.</li>
            <li> I did my research on pricing before buying this and it&#x27;s a great price! It ranged from $60-$80. Everyone I&#x27;m around loves the smell too!</li>
            <li> It was super awesome to get the product as fast as I did. I appreciated so much. thanks again Carlena</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to use this perfume sparingly. It&#x27;s at a great price so I can afford to wear it 24 hours a day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a special gift for my Mother.  She loves it.  Very rich, high-class fragrance.  Unique that it doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; musky celebrity-named odor that comes with the lower priced fragrances.  Everyone that smells this long-lasting scent loves it-and I do too.</li>
            <li> i though i was getting a deal but this is a botle full alcohol and water this realy bad fake parfume you guys should no sale this product thanks.....</li>
            <li> Mom requested this and I was able to get this awesome Spray for almost 1/3 of the department store prices. The shipping was super fast, too. Hey, great Mom happiness!</li>
            <li> Euphoria is for special moments, that doesn&#x27;t smell like ALL others, this scent is not over powering and always gets &amp;#34;boy you smell wonderful, what are you wearing&amp;#34; small comment to make a lady feel a little special!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance, beautiful bottle, but the spray mechanism stopped working about 1/3 of the way through.  Now it just&lt;br /&gt;drips out onto my fingers, and I transfer it from them to my neck and wrists.</li>
            <li> Great product would order from this seller again</li>
            <li> Not the first time I have bought it for my wife.  She has been using it for some time now along with other perfumes but this is the one she loves most.  I like the way it smells myself. This makes choosing a gift for her easy for me.</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS GET PEOPLE ASKING ME WHAT ARE YOU WEARING? I LOVE THE SMELL AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT! YOU MUST HAVE EUPHORIA IN YOUR COLLECTION.</li>
            <li> Good one from CK. My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Great price good product!!!</li>
            <li> A coworker wears this and I wanted to try it. The smel is so faint you find yourself spraying on do much to smell it yourself. This product smells nothing like the ones in the store don&#x27;t waiste your money unless you want an expensive air freshner .</li>
            <li> My wife smells good now.</li>
            <li> This product smells totally like fake or it has been on their shelf for a very long time. just wears off so quickly. Amazon should have a policy on how long they should keep the fragrances on the shelf. Such a big company and look at what they ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most frustrating thing is that you cannot even return it as it is &amp;#34;flamable material&amp;#34;. Amazon better have their stores. Not buying this kind of stuff from Amazon ever!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter and son-in-law got this for me a couple of years ago.  The size that came was bigger than I expected, the other one lasted me for 2 years, so I expect this to be the same.  I enjoy the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Had a magazine with this scent in a card and had to have it.  It is a wonderful scent, not too sweet, but a crisp and clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites! I recommend it, the product came on their box! It is great and very cheap!</li>
            <li> I use this product daily.  I was so happy to purchase this product for half the price that I would pay in the department store for the same exact item.  Thanks Amazon, I really like bargains.</li>
            <li> This product met all my expectations! Thanks Amazon for very efficiently meet my request! I intend to buy more products from you!</li>
            <li> I wanted this for a long long time and one day I just went on and bought it for myself. I get compliments on how nice I smell and that is great. Not that expensive for a 3.4 oz either.</li>
            <li> I have been forcing myself to wait for my next Euphoria purchase.  I ran out at least six weeks ago, but I&#x27;m waiting for my birthday before spending the money.  I tend to wear only one fragrance for long periods of time, and Euphoria has been my pick for a few years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, however, that I began choosing Euphoria only because my all time favorite fragrance is not made any more.  The favorite was \\&quot;Initial\\&quot; by Boucheron.  The bottle was exquisite - like a white pearl.  I searched far and wide for it but eventually accepted the fact that I had to go through the selection process again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking for a new fragrance is far from my idea of a good time!  I get brutal headaches from most Estee Lauder products (White Linen can put me into migraine hell).  So the shopping process is very cautious.  I love the places that put out a bowl of coffee beans so you can cleanse your palate (olfactory style) in between sniffs.  It might have taken even longer for me to find a new fragrance, but I had a stroke of luck... a friend of mine was wearing Euphoria, and I asked about it.  A quick trip to the store to sample and I knew my search had ended.  From that day to this, Euphoria is it for me!</li>
            <li> My husband bought this perfume for me for my Mother&#x27;s day and i love it. i remember my mother brought this perfume from the UK and i fell in love and i always wanted to have one. thanks to my loving husband i now have my own, i wear this on special occasions, it smells really nice. i would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Euphoria is my all time favorite scent.  I&#x27;ve worn this lovely fragrance for years and have come to think of it as my signature scent.  It&#x27;s slightly floral and spicy without being overwhelming.  It lasts all day too - no wearing off immediately for wasted product and repeated application.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, the price was fantastic and I was amazed at how quickly it arrived.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I received the product in perfect condition. I am grateful</li>
            <li> Mild with a gentle smell.</li>
            <li> Calvin Klein&#x27;s Euphoria has an interesting smell to it. I would say the perfume is very strong for a woman in her 20s (being an adult in my early 20s). I read the reviews and bought the perfume based on the reviews, there are many things not mentioned in the product reviews however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not satisfied with the length of time that it took to receive this product. I purchased this item on August 2 and did not receive it until August 13. There was an 11 day period between the time I received this item, despite being an Amazon Prime member. When I first wrote this review it was blocked, probably because I am telling an inconvenient truth.</li>
            <li> I gave this perfume as a gift and found out later on that it was a fake. I always give the same perfume to my mother in law, but I purchased from Macy&#x27;s. I decided this time to get it from Amazon not knowing that I was going to give a FAKE!</li>
            <li> Xmas present for my girlfriend doesn&#x27;t smell anywhere as good as the one she normally buys from Macy&#x27;s. Will not buy anywhere else again. I urge any one out there that&#x27;s indecisive just buy from Macy&#x27;s. Yeah its double the price but its money well spend because the stuff on yeah is definitely watered down and smells like urine. Its that bad!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume for nights out. It has real staying power and smells better and better as the night goes on. It makes me feel sexy and it is not cloyingly overpowering. A great value at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it for years and almost every day someone raves about it and asks me for the name. I love this scent, but of course, scents are different on everyone. I won&#x27;t ever stray from Euphoria.</li>
            <li> I first found this perfume looking through a magazine. The sample test strip was there and unused, which was a plus for me. I had put it on my wrist and the scent stayed for a long period of time. I just received this in the mail today, and&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I ordered it.!!  It is a really light fragrance with a long staying power, so a little go a long way. I have only had it on now for about an hour so I will give another update and let you know what kind of comments I receive on the scent. Can&#x27;t wait!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> my signature fragnant</li>
            <li> This 3.4 ounce eau de PARFUM spray is easily averaging $90 at department stores. Amazon.com had it in stock for less than half that at $41 when I bought it. This bottle is LARGE. Brand new in sealed packaging, not a scratch on the box or bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top notes are pomegranate and persimmons followed by black orchid, lotus blossom, and champaca flower, and the base notes are amber, cream, black violet, and wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to like perfumes with that amber and woodsy base, it works really well on me. The chosen fruits and flowers overlaying this are not overpowering at all, and this perfume LASTS all day. Be cautious of overspraying because it is quite powerful, but without being stinky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Calvin Klein scents, this one is a total winner that I&#x27;ll make sure to keep on my shelf!</li>
