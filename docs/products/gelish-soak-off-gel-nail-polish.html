            <li> Very nice color but it takes forever to dry up. At least 5 minutes and still wet....</li>
            <li> Seems too runny compared to my other Gelish brand polishes.</li>
            <li> did not seal as others I have had</li>
            <li> Very deep wine color , great for fall</li>
            <li> This color is beautiful and the product is superior. Love it.</li>
            <li> The product quality is average...the size is great for the price...if you go to sallys you paymore for the mini gelish bottles. Unfortunately I was thinking this was going to be a deep purple....its a deep maroon/purple/almost black...as my friend says \\&quot;blood purple\\&quot;.I do not think this is a pretty color. I was looking for a dark, but true purple.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful deep, dark, shimmery purple - perfect for the Fall!! It is also very long wearing when you follow the whole gel polish regimen.</li>
            <li> What a gorgeous color!!! This polish has great coverage. I love Gelish polish. Fantastic experience with fast shipping!!!! I recomend this color if you need a nice purple color.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome sexy sultry purple. Great for the winter season. I was inspired by the kardashians. They wear a lot of deep colors</li>
            <li> I have several gel polish from Harmony Gelish and OPI. This is one of my all time favorite. The color is dark and pretty. It applies well and doesn&#x27;t shirnk much during apply. It is dark enough but still can look like it is not just black. love it.</li>
            <li> This color is more of a maroon than a dark plum. I find this often with Harmony colors....swatches don&#x27;t match what is in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I ordered this polish to go with a Gelish starter kit I purchased. I was looking for a dark purple color, like eggplant maybe. The photo looked like this was perfect. It looks more like a maroon than purple. Kind of like blood. It looks nice for fall, just not quite what I was looking for. I guess ordering online you won&#x27;t really know what a color looks like.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color&lt;br /&gt;Got a lot of compliments&lt;br /&gt;Stinks that I have to do two coats to get full coverage&lt;br /&gt;Ships fast</li>
            <li> can be better quality</li>
            <li> The delivery came safe, but the bottle had fallen out of it&#x27;s bubble wrap.  In rough handling, it could have been damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the color, but the picture does not do justice. It&#x27;s like a dark, black purple akin to a plum.  Since I&#x27;m red color blind I. can&#x27;t see it except in bright light. Otherwise it looks black to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gellish quality feels better than just mere nail polish. I wish I knew about it sooner.</li>
            <li> This color is a deep purple that is perfect for fall. It only takes two coats to get the nice rich color.</li>
            <li> Awesome colooooooor loved it!!!</li>
            <li> Pretty true to the color swatch provided --  a deep purple/red.  Goes on very well without &amp;#34;shrinkage&amp;#34; that often plaques the dark colors.</li>
            <li> Great color. Lasted 8 days before my first chip, which is great considering I wash my hands a lot. I also was doing home repairs with this . A lot better than polish.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I purchased this product.  Gelish is a Salon grade product that you can typically only purchase from stores that require a cosmetology license.  Great fresh product and the same brand/quality as I purchase from CosmoProf, only cheaper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty dark. Kinda hard to tell if it&#x27;s purple or black unless you&#x27;re in the light.</li>
