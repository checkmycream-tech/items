            <li>it smelled amazing</li>
            <li>Have had many good shaves with Taylor creams and intend to keep using them.</li>
            <li>I purchased this AND the Trufitt  and Hill brand Rose scents and they are practically identical in quality of lather, scent and skin comfort.</li>
            <li>I got a really nice 4 pass shave with just a dip into the jar.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice smell to it and feels nice after the shave.  </li>
            <li>The rose smell&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;like chemical rose all day.</li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>I could not use the Rose scented  shaving cream because it was liquefied.  </li>
            <li>just like smelling a rose bush on a warm summer evening...</li>
            <li>Moisturizing isn&#x27;t great (not bad either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smelled good and worked fine</li>
            <li>Until they get it right, DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li>Great, super smelling stuff, I love it.</li>
            <li>Scent is great and it lathers really well!</li>
            <li>Great purchase and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>If you like a strong rose scent then this is for you.</li>
            <li>The rose scent is mild and a nice aroma while shaving.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and lathers really well, I pair it with a good shaving soap for a better lather.  </li>
            <li>This and Avocado are my two favorite TOBS products.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Usually there is also a paper across the top of the tub upon opening.</li>
            <li>Great protection and is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>My favorite shave cream.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, and it lasts around 4 hours.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The rose scent is not as intense as Trumper&#x27;s but that is a good thing.</li>
            <li>It was delivered on time and in good condition the first time I opened the tub</li>
            <li>This is great new scent from TOBS.  </li>
            <li>Out of all the rose creams I&#x27;ve tried, this smells the most like fresh cut roses.</li>
            <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street makes great products</li>
            <li>with all the TOBS I&#x27;ve tried so far, this one lathers well and feels great on my face.  </li>
            <li>This cream whips up to a good foam really well, but i have come to expect that from T.O.B.S. creams.</li>
            <li>Awesome smell, Lathers up extremely well.  </li>
            <li>Easy to lather.  </li>
            <li>my after shave covers it up easily though.</li>
            <li>It smells a bit strong when you&#x27;re making up a lather</li>
            <li>and it never got to strong and</li>
            <li>Deserves 5 stars as it smells exactly like a rose.</li>
            <li>This scent is amazing, fresh,  clean and leaves your face feeling invigorated.  </li>
            <li>I have tried this cream via a sampler pack from another vendor and was excited to receive this full size version as my sample ran out (love the scent of this product).</li>
            <li>Razor glides smoothly over cushion of cream.</li>
            <li>over powering and is light.</li>
            <li>It was the first time I have ever been able to shave without getting any cuts.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and has lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li>I received a new jar of the Rose Scent today.  </li>
            <li>I want to highly recommend this soap to you because of its quality and refreshing and easy on your face shaving.  </li>
            <li>However,  AMAZON made it right very quickly.    </li>
            <li>Top notch and great but not too heavy scent!</li>
            <li>Only advice....step up and get a good brush.</li>
            <li>Upon arrival I found the inside of the sealed plastic bag that the container was in was full of soap.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and fresh, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Like all other TOB creams the Rose is no exception to a smooth and well refreshing shave.</li>
            <li>Other than that it works great.</li>
            <li>scent is clean an fresh like the lime.  </li>
            <li>Very cushioney lather and my Merkur 42C open comb felt great with it.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and quickly dissipates after you shave.</li>
            <li>The Rose scent is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>This shaving soap has a very barber shop smell and leaves your face smooth and a clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>Smooth shave and lathers really well.</li>
            <li>I have used about 4 different fragrances and have now settled on Rose.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think its worth the time.</li>
            <li>This cream has the same performance but with the rose scent.</li>
            <li>Definately worth the money.</li>
            <li>order this soap during cool weather because it sits on a hot truck for a day</li>
            <li>This is my favorite of the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams.</li>
            <li>Scent is distinctly roses, but a bit on the grandmother&#x27;s body powder side.</li>
            <li>I previously bought the Sandalwood and the lather and scent were amazing!</li>
            <li>Just right scent.  </li>
            <li>Shaving cream from this company in other scents have been great, but for some reason, this particular scent has he consistency of soup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my third jar of Rose Shaving Cream am very please with the quality and aroma.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy and old fashioned like the lavender and rose.</li>
            <li>I received the rose scent today and it was melted, the lid was loose and it  leaked all over.  </li>
            <li>And a great thick lather.</li>
            <li>but it was pretty liquidy and</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t appear to make it more solid.  </li>
            <li>It lubricates pretty well</li>
            <li>and you can do no wrong</li>
            <li>of this is personal, of course, and others may love it.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a loyal user....and highly recommend the shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It also left my legs super silky smooth after.</li>
            <li>I have tried all of Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>The TOBS Rose shaving cream was leaking slightly on delivery into the plastic packaging</li>
            <li>and it made the thickest cream I have ever been able to make I applied rich thick lather to my face four times to make sure I had shaved every last hair</li>
            <li>two more times I really had a hard time wash it down the drain but the smell was great the whole time</li>
            <li>suspicion is that the tub I got had been filled from a much larger container - maybe to create a retail item from a wholesale batch.</li>
            <li>Does not take much for each use.</li>
            <li>Absolutely a luxury item.  </li>
            <li>It does smell like real graprefruit.  </li>
            <li>, I was using too much.  </li>
            <li>I use my brush to get a small dab of Rose Shaving Cream and mix it with my shaving soap and hot water.</li>
            <li>It easily creates a rich lather that provides a slick shaving surface.  </li>
            <li>loses that quickly and remains very light.</li>
            <li>I ordered this particular item however it arrived with noticeable leakage - soap had liquified and run out over the tub.&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li>- EXCEPT for this particular product.</li>
            <li>this was either stored at too high a temperature</li>
            <li>Vey high quality product.</li>
            <li>In short, the rose scent is vastly inferior to he standard scent.</li>
            <li>To me though the scent when i first put it on is a bit harsh, almost like a light ammonia</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time if used properly making it more affordable than the price appears.</li>
            <li>Also the product seems more &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;soupy&amp;#34; than similar products from other high end shaving creams like Castle Forbes or Trumper.  </li>
            <li>I easily get three face-loads with a dot about half the size of a dime.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to shave both my legs with just two small dollops on each leg.  </li>
            <li>Again, as long as it lasts, it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>but I would not buy from a merchant who ships this watery version again because it is not up to Taylor of Old Bond standards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;v been ubing Taylor of Old Bond Street for 5 or 6 years</li>
            <li>Unfortunately for me the scent is too much like a rose.</li>
            <li>It has improved the quality of my shaves and leaves a nice subtle lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have a very heavy beard and have used many different shaving creams.</li>
            <li>It sure goes a long way,  just takes very little.  </li>
            <li>But I really have no idea why this cream is so loose and watery.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a little crazy to spend so much money on one jar of shaving cream, but it was more than worth it!  </li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Taylor of Old Bond shaving creams that come in the tub like this one.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how masculine this actually smells.  </li>
            <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street is now the only shaving cream I will use.</li>
            <li>Also the smell of the roses was just right - not too heavy or perfumy.  </li>
            <li>If you use this soap everyday it will last for months, its worth every penny.    </li>
            <li>If I had  anything negative to say is that I burn through it rather quickly.</li>

            <li> I have tried all of Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> The TOBS Rose shaving cream was leaking slightly on delivery into the plastic packaging</li>
            <li> and it made the thickest cream I have ever been able to make I applied rich thick lather to my face four times to make sure I had shaved every last hair</li>
            <li> two more times I really had a hard time wash it down the drain but the smell was great the whole time</li>
            <li> suspicion is that the tub I got had been filled from a much larger container - maybe to create a retail item from a wholesale batch.</li>
            <li> Does not take much for each use.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a luxury item.  </li>
            <li> It does smell like real graprefruit.  </li>
            <li> , I was using too much.  </li>
            <li> I use my brush to get a small dab of Rose Shaving Cream and mix it with my shaving soap and hot water.</li>
            <li> It easily creates a rich lather that provides a slick shaving surface.  </li>
            <li> loses that quickly and remains very light.</li>
            <li> I ordered this particular item however it arrived with noticeable leakage - soap had liquified and run out over the tub.&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> - EXCEPT for this particular product.</li>
            <li> this was either stored at too high a temperature</li>
            <li> Vey high quality product.</li>
            <li> In short, the rose scent is vastly inferior to he standard scent.</li>
            <li> To me though the scent when i first put it on is a bit harsh, almost like a light ammonia</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time if used properly making it more affordable than the price appears.</li>
            <li> Also the product seems more &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;soupy&amp;#34; than similar products from other high end shaving creams like Castle Forbes or Trumper.  </li>
            <li> I easily get three face-loads with a dot about half the size of a dime.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to shave both my legs with just two small dollops on each leg.  </li>
            <li> Again, as long as it lasts, it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> but I would not buy from a merchant who ships this watery version again because it is not up to Taylor of Old Bond standards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v been ubing Taylor of Old Bond Street for 5 or 6 years</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me the scent is too much like a rose.</li>
            <li> It has improved the quality of my shaves and leaves a nice subtle lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard and have used many different shaving creams.</li>
            <li> It sure goes a long way,  just takes very little.  </li>
            <li> But I really have no idea why this cream is so loose and watery.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little crazy to spend so much money on one jar of shaving cream, but it was more than worth it!  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Taylor of Old Bond shaving creams that come in the tub like this one.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how masculine this actually smells.  </li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street is now the only shaving cream I will use.</li>
            <li> Also the smell of the roses was just right - not too heavy or perfumy.  </li>
            <li> If you use this soap everyday it will last for months, its worth every penny.    </li>
            <li> If I had  anything negative to say is that I burn through it rather quickly.</li>
            <li> The lather is thick and creamy and well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Sad that I may have to wait a few months for it to cool down before I can enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I found a milkshake consistency - not a rather stiff product as I normally</li>
            <li> I suspect, but can&#x27;t prove hat it has to do with the seller, since I previously bought his product directly from Amazon - again with no problem.</li>
            <li> Only a very small amount is needed to facilitate a very close shave.</li>
            <li> The shave cream seems a little lighter (less dense) than others, but that could just be because it&#x27;s a really fresh batch and my other jars have been around for a while.  </li>
            <li> overall I preferred other scents I&#x27;ve tried that had a creamier consistency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other comments about refrigerating it to solidify it back up</li>
            <li> The lather is about the same as all the other TOBS scents I have tried (excellent!).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> You only need a little to build up a lot of lather.</li>
            <li> Hard or soft water.</li>
            <li> I have been using this year old shaving cream every day  lately.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately when I received it the entire thing had melted in the truck (was home from work today and didn&#x27;t even leave it sitting outside long enough to melt).</li>
            <li> Like other TOBS products, it takes only a small amount to get enough suds to do three passes for someone with a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a face latherer so, while a little put off by the consistency, this had absolutely no impact on the performance and actually made it a little easier to apply to the brush.  </li>
            <li> Thick consistency with a pink color (it whips up white)</li>
            <li> and I still had a enough soap that I could have applied thick layers at lest</li>
            <li> or else was watered down.</li>
            <li> ** may be a bit unfair, because this is high quality shaving cream, as all TOBS creams are.</li>
            <li> When opening the container I found a watery mess.  </li>
            <li> It did have the plastic covering on the inside, but that was at the bottom of the mess.  </li>
            <li> I like the scent, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like manly things as much as the other guys, but this Shaving Cream&#x27;s fragrance has me addicted to it.  </li>
            <li> As others have noted, this s a watery mess!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a rose person, but I like the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li> Even after weeks it remains watery and sloppy even before adding any water.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a loyal user....and highly recommend the shaving cream. Only advice....step up and get a good brush.</li>
            <li> Deserves 5 stars as it smells exactly like a rose. Unfortunately for me the scent is too much like a rose. If you like a strong rose scent then this is for you.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and lathers really well, I pair it with a good shaving soap for a better lather.  This has become one of my and my gf&#x27;s favorites!</li>
            <li> Scent is great and it lathers really well!</li>
            <li> My order arrived well packed, but the shaving cream was the consistency of gruel.  I&#x27;m a face latherer so, while a little put off by the consistency, this had absolutely no impact on the performance and actually made it a little easier to apply to the brush.  LOTS of lather.  I easily get three face-loads with a dot about half the size of a dime.  Excellent face protection.  I&#x27;m not really a rose person, but I like the smell of this product.  This and Avocado are my two favorite TOBS products.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Like all other TOB creams the Rose is no exception to a smooth and well refreshing shave. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Great cream that lathers easily. Have had many good shaves with Taylor creams and intend to keep using them.</li>
            <li> Soap was melted when it was arrived</li>
            <li> Love the smell. And a great thick lather. My face and nose give it 2 big thumbs up.</li>
            <li> It smells a bit strong when you&#x27;re making up a lather but it is quite mellow once you rinse it off.  Like other TOBS products, it takes only a small amount to get enough suds to do three passes for someone with a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I use this product with my regular shaving soap.  I use my brush to get a small dab of Rose Shaving Cream and mix it with my shaving soap and hot water. This extends the life of the shaving cream and I can adjust the consistency with the amount of water I add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my third jar of Rose Shaving Cream am very please with the quality and aroma.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Taylor of Old Bond shaving creams that come in the tub like this one.&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered this particular item however it arrived with noticeable leakage - soap had liquified and run out over the tub.&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening I found a milkshake consistency - not a rather stiff product as I normally find.&lt;br /&gt;Usually there is also a paper across the top of the tub upon opening. That was missing.&lt;br /&gt;My suspicion is that the tub I got had been filled from a much larger container - maybe to create a retail item from a wholesale batch. But I really have no idea why this cream is so loose and watery. Even after weeks it remains watery and sloppy even before adding any water. I still mix it up to a great lather and a good shave - but I would not buy from a merchant who ships this watery version again because it is not up to Taylor of Old Bond standards.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving cream I have ever used.  I thought it was a little crazy to spend so much money on one jar of shaving cream, but it was more than worth it!  It smells divine and I was able to shave both my legs with just two small dollops on each leg.  It was the first time I have ever been able to shave without getting any cuts.  It also left my legs super silky smooth after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v been ubing Taylor of Old Bond Street for 5 or 6 years and I have to say it spoils me.  I have used about 4 different fragrances and have now settled on Rose.</li>
            <li> What can you say. It&#x27;s  TOBS that should tell you it&#x27;s a quality product. I like the scent, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how masculine this actually smells.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Upon arrival I found the inside of the sealed plastic bag that the container was in was full of soap.  When opening the container I found a watery mess.  No cream, just liquid soap.  It did have the plastic covering on the inside, but that was at the bottom of the mess.  Until they get it right, DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time and in good condition the first time I opened the tub it smelled amazing I used my brush just like I always do to lather up and it made the thickest cream I have ever been able to make I applied rich thick lather to my face four times to make sure I had shaved every last hair and I still had a enough soap that I could have applied thick layers at lest two more times I really had a hard time wash it down the drain but the smell was great the whole time and it never got to strong and an added bonus the wife loves the smell and rubs against me nonstop just to get close so she can smell it again</li>
            <li> Easy to lather.  Great protection and is very moisturizing.  Does not take much for each use.</li>
            <li> Top notch and great but not too heavy scent! I purchased this AND the Trufitt  and Hill brand Rose scents and they are practically identical in quality of lather, scent and skin comfort. This is the best value in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve used. Hard or soft water. Razor glides smoothly over cushion of cream. Just right scent.  Works well with witch hazel</li>
            <li> Smells great and has lasted a long time.  Smooth shave and lathers really well.</li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street makes great products - EXCEPT for this particular product. As others have noted, this s a watery mess! Shaving cream from this company in other scents have been great, but for some reason, this particular scent has he consistency of soup. I suspect, but can&#x27;t prove hat it has to do with the seller, since I previously bought his product directly from Amazon - again with no problem. I think hat this was either stored at too high a temperature or else was watered down. In short, the rose scent is vastly inferior to he standard scent.</li>
            <li> Smelled good and worked fine but it was pretty liquidy and overall I preferred other scents I&#x27;ve tried that had a creamier consistency.</li>
            <li> My favorite shave cream. The rose scent is mild and a nice aroma while shaving. I&#x27;ve tried many brands and I like Taylor best.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product.</li>
            <li> The TOBS Rose shaving cream was leaking slightly on delivery into the plastic packaging so I had to do a bit of cleanup initially.  Also the product seems more &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;soupy&amp;#34; than similar products from other high end shaving creams like Castle Forbes or Trumper.  Per suggestions from others I tried to put it into the fridge and it didn&#x27;t appear to make it more solid.  The reason I gave it 4 stars (almost perfect) is I used the product today and the runny consistency does not affect the performance.  I got a really nice 4 pass shave with just a dip into the jar.  Also the smell of the roses was just right - not too heavy or perfumy.  I&#x27;m wondering if this is a manufacturing issue or a storage issue?</li>
            <li> Love the product but it melted! I have tried this cream via a sampler pack from another vendor and was excited to receive this full size version as my sample ran out (love the scent of this product). Unfortunately when I received it the entire thing had melted in the truck (was home from work today and didn&#x27;t even leave it sitting outside long enough to melt). I&#x27;ve read other comments about refrigerating it to solidify it back up but I don&#x27;t think its worth the time. Returning immediately. Sad that I may have to wait a few months for it to cool down before I can enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Absolutely a luxury item.  The lather is thick and creamy and well worth the money.  It has a nice smell to it and feels nice after the shave.  If I had  anything negative to say is that I burn through it rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Great, super smelling stuff, I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, and it lasts around 4 hours.</li>
            <li> This is my daily she cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of TOBS and have collected a number of their shaving creams.  I like to mix it up a bit to keep things interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all the TOBS I&#x27;ve tried so far, this one lathers well and feels great on my face.  I find the fragrance very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell, Lathers up extremely well.  Great lubrication and glide.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It has a great scent that makes me look forward to shaving, and my wife loves it as well.  It easily creates a rich lather that provides a slick shaving surface.  It&#x27;s the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve found and is excellent paired with my DE razors.</li>
            <li> Excellent cream! The quality you come to expect from TOBS and a scent that is heavenly! I pair this with Trumper&#x27;s Coral Skin Food as a pre-shave and Coral Skin Tonic as an aftershave!</li>
            <li> great smell, my after shave covers it up easily though.</li>
            <li> This is great new scent from TOBS.  It does smell like real graprefruit.  The scent is light and fresh, not overpowering.  The shave cream seems a little lighter (less dense) than others, but that could just be because it&#x27;s a really fresh batch and my other jars have been around for a while.  The lather is about the same as all the other TOBS scents I have tried (excellent!).&lt;br /&gt;This scent is clean an fresh like the lime.  It is not heavy and old fashioned like the lavender and rose.</li>
            <li> This cream whips up to a good foam really well, but i have come to expect that from T.O.B.S. creams. The rose smell&lt;br /&gt;isn&#x27;t over powering and is light. Thick consistency with a pink color (it whips up white) you wont spend the day smelling&lt;br /&gt;like chemical rose all day. To me though the scent when i first put it on is a bit harsh, almost like a light ammonia smell.&lt;br /&gt;It loses that quickly and remains very light. It lubricates pretty well but i recommend some beard prep before hand.</li>
            <li> Vey high quality product. You won&#x27;t know how inadequate can creams are until you try this. Nice scent. Lasts a long time if used properly making it more affordable than the price appears.</li>
            <li> Taylor of bond st is the best Shaving Cream money can buy I like the Sandlewood and Rose Sents the best combined with a Simpsons shaving brush and you can do no wrong</li>
            <li> I previously bought the Sandalwood and the lather and scent were amazing! This cream has the same performance but with the rose scent. The scent hits you in the face while shaving but after rinsing it off, goes awa after ahwile and should not conflict with aftershave or cologne. Very cushioney lather and my Merkur 42C open comb felt great with it. Definately worth the money. The rose scent is not as intense as Trumper&#x27;s but that is a good thing. Great purchase and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this brand in the Sandalwood scent about a year ago.  I have been using this year old shaving cream every day  lately.  It sure goes a long way,  just takes very little.  I received the rose scent today and it was melted, the lid was loose and it  leaked all over.  However,  AMAZON made it right very quickly.    I am not taking away any stars for a packaging mishap.  I am rating and reviewing the product and giving it 5 stars all the way.  This shaving soap has a very barber shop smell and leaves your face smooth and a clean feeling.  I had to learn how to use this  soap, I was using too much.  If you use this soap everyday it will last for months, its worth every penny.    I want to make a suggestion to you,  order this soap during cool weather because it sits on a hot truck for a day or so it  will melt.  I want to highly recommend this soap to you because of its quality and refreshing and easy on your face shaving.  Again,  I want to say that I reviewed this product for its quality and value for the price.  I could not use the Rose scented  shaving cream because it was liquefied.  However, this brand is tops no matter what scent that you order.    10-06-14:  I received a new jar of the Rose Scent today.  It is the quality of this brand that I have reviewed.  This scent is amazing, fresh,  clean and leaves your face feeling invigorated.  Again, as long as it lasts, it&#x27;s worth every penny.  By the way, this jar of soap  arrived NOT melted and in perfect condition.  The weather is cooler now...</li>
            <li> As promised.  Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Good alternative to shaving soap. Will leave a residue feel on your face though.</li>
            <li> This is my go to cream when I&#x27;m not using Eton College. Out of all the rose creams I&#x27;ve tried, this smells the most like fresh cut roses. The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and quickly dissipates after you shave.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams. Only a very small amount is needed to facilitate a very close shave.</li>
            <li> 3 *** may be a bit unfair, because this is high quality shaving cream, as all TOBS creams are. But among them this one is undistinguished. Scent is distinctly roses, but a bit on the grandmother&#x27;s body powder side. Moisturizing isn&#x27;t great (not bad either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this is personal, of course, and others may love it.</li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard and have used many different shaving creams. Taylor of Old Bond Street is now the only shaving cream I will use. You only need a little to build up a lot of lather. It has improved the quality of my shaves and leaves a nice subtle lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have tried all of Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams and this is by far my favorite. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like manly things as much as the other guys, but this Shaving Cream&#x27;s fragrance has me addicted to it.  Its not overpowering, its not synthetic smelling... just like smelling a rose bush on a warm summer evening... Great shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The Rose scent is barely noticeable. Other than that it works great.</li>
    </ol>
