    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best styling product I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a great job controlling frizz and flyaway hair, it leaves your hair manageable and it&#x27;s not sticky feeling which is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a great smoothing/glosser/anti-frizz product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So this one worked, but with some not so great side effects.</li>
            <li>and it does a great job with smoothing out frizz and fly-aways.  </li>
            <li>Would be a great product if it was not for the smell.</li>
            <li>As your hair dries, it dissipates greatly and becomes acceptably subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>I prefer to smell like sugar and spice and everything nice!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant (not overpowering smell) and it does seem to remove frizz from hair.</li>
            <li>have to say I&#x27;m delighted with the results.  </li>
            <li>Also loved the bottle and the color of the bottle.</li>
            <li>you are seeking a smoothing lotion that you can feel good about, try [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This product has a nice, pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>(A hair pick that I&#x27;ve used for the better part of a decade!)</li>
            <li>The first thing I always test on these hair products is the smell and this one was great!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t promote tangles which is great for my fine hair</li>
            <li>This is a nice smoothing lotion.</li>
            <li>have shoulder-length curly hair and was looking for something that would be a nice leave-in for tamed curls instead of frizz.</li>
            <li>I really liked the fragrance, too.</li>
            <li>but it did have a salon scent which I liked.</li>
            <li>This smoothing lotion has a pleasant smell and spreads easily into hair.</li>
            <li>It does wash out very easily.</li>
            <li>I brushed it as best I could</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how silky and smooth my hair felt after using this!  </li>
            <li>My hair appears shinier and I&#x27;ve received many compliments.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, it&#x27;s not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I wonder how many people buy BOTH</li>
            <li>Bed head, day-old head are OK but man-head is not for me.</li>
            <li>At $15.00, I expect high-quality, safe contents.</li>
            <li>This smoothing lotion by Toni &amp; Guy is really more of a cream.</li>
            <li>It worked better on my washed hair before blow drying</li>
            <li>Nope, smells pretty good to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and appealing, brushing thru tangles seems to be easier</li>
            <li>Then I became more comfortable with the product using a penny size amount.</li>
            <li>It imparted a modicum of shine, but I can&#x27;t say that this is a good product for shine enhancement on the whole.</li>
            <li>That being said, it did a great job of smoothing my hair, especially the top.</li>
            <li>I found the scent to be way too strong.  </li>
            <li>Up towards my scalp the hair is in great shape, so that leaves me to suspect that this product is going to be most beneficial for dry or damaged</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product, as I haven&#x27;t been happy with any other product I&#x27;ve tried, but I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels really smooth but not sticky.</li>
            <li>When the humidity is low, it will do whatever I want and look great.  </li>
            <li>but since it&#x27;s not as close to my nose, the fragrance doesn&#x27;t offend me as much as when it&#x27;s on my own head.  </li>
            <li>This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for frizz too however I do need to reapply the next day to refresh.</li>
            <li>In both cases, I had to rewash my hair in order to feel comfortable leaving the house.</li>
            <li>; I haven&#x27;t experienced that at all, but then, everyone&#x27;s tolerance is a bit different.</li>
            <li>You might try it before a bit event or important outing.  </li>
            <li>This definitely isn&#x27;t my favorite product I&#x27;ve tried, but it works pretty well if you want really light</li>
            <li>I have used it on my own hair and on my 18 month old who has curly hair (I put some into her dry hair to help reform the curls and it has worked great).</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine hair and this does a good job giving my hair a soft and sleek look.</li>
            <li>It made my hair very manageable and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t care for the scent of the Tony &amp; Guy products, but it dissipates quickly, so it is tolerable.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t continue using this particular product by Toni &amp; Guy, but I do love their sea salt texturizing spray</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a smoothing lotion that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank AND do exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to doâ€¦ SMOOTH.  </li>
            <li>After being on there fora day, I also felt like my hair was kind of greasy, though since I often don&#x27;t use much product, it could just be normal for any product use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also retained my hair&#x27;s natural full body (which is good since a &amp;#34;smoothing&amp;#34; application can flatten) and kept my hairs natural curl and waves intact.</li>
            <li>My hair looks smooth, not greasy, and doesn&#x27;t frizz up quite so much in the humidity.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair, so at times I am working with static electricity.  </li>
            <li>I think this is great to have around for special occasion hair styling when it really matters how you look, but it&#x27;s a bit out of my price range for everyday use.</li>
            <li>When the humidity is high, it morphs into a huge, monstrous ball of tacky frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that&#x27;s getting rather fine and has a tendency toward flyaways and frizz, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a good product that will control my curls (or waves; I often braid it when wet to help control things).</li>
            <li>This product, although full of parabens, keeps my fizzy hair in place, I have not curly nor straight, so with it, it looks like a curlish under control bed head</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight enough for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Why do these product always have to be designed with such strong scents?!  </li>
            <li>This works very good on my long hair, as long as I keep it away from my scalp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was very smooth in the same way that coated hair with wax or grease would make it smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really like the fresh scent that it leaves in my hair.</li>
            <li>This might or might not bother you, but you should be aware of it.  </li>
            <li>used this exactly two times.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I ended up with what looked like an oily patch on the side of my head</li>
            <li>I used about a size of a quarter at first.</li>
            <li>If you have to use that much at a time it will get very pricey quickly.</li>
            <li>but it will last you for years and the natural contents will let you sleep better at night!</li>
            <li>While others have disliked the scent, it didn&#x27;t really bother me - so it&#x27;s definitely a to each his own kind of smell and something to be mindful of.</li>
            <li>This smoothing lotion is a decent product and does calm my hair from the frizzies.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use more that a pea-sized amount, and use it on DRY hair, after you&#x27;ve finished styling it and before using any sprays.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a strong fragrance, which I don&#x27;t especially like.</li>
            <li>I recently tried ALTERNA BAMBOO Smooth Kendi Oil Dry Oil Mist, and love it.</li>
            <li>I really like how my hair feels when I use this cream.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the fragrance, though.  </li>
            <li>I prefer very light/mild fragrances.</li>
            <li>It calms the frizzies, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much besides that.  </li>
            <li>which of course I don&#x27;t really like; it doesn&#x27;t work as well and it has a scent I find bothersome.  </li>
            <li>really seems to condition dryer ends</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to waste it), but it still seemed effective in taming flyaway hair and frizz.</li>
            <li>Although it works fine on my long straight hair (leaving it glossy and still touchable) I could not handle leaving it in.  </li>
            <li>If however, I just rub some of the white creme between my hands, and ONLY apply down on my hair, away from my head, concentrating on my roots, it&#x27;s one of the most effective smoothing products I&#x27;ve used!&lt;br</li>
            <li>And when used with a flat iron, the product seems to enhance the smooth shiny look.  </li>
            <li>The price was a little higher than what I am used to spending but it made my hair feel like I was in a top end</li>
            <li>I checked the labels on other anti-frizz products on my shelf (mostly made by Pantene and TRESemme), and none of them had ANY parabens.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, there are just far too many drawbacks to these products to recommend them, especially when there are so many other hair products that work better, don&#x27;t have as many questionable ingredients, and are a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>This also smacks of some labeling dishonesty; I feel like they used several different kinds to make them appear lower in the list of ingredients (kind of like when a food manufacturer uses sugar, cane syrup, dextrose, and fructose all in the same product so that SUGAR doesn&#x27;t appear as the first ingredient).  </li>

            <li>Toni&amp;Guy Classic Smoothing Lotion / B00GJ7WV8M&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is highly skippable to me.</li>
            <li>I gave a high review to Tony and Guy Leave in Conditioner</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend that for adding wavy texture to hairstyles.</li>
            <li>This is a much thinner lotion, which happily surprised me.  </li>
            <li>I would just caution anyone NOT to use it on their scalp or close to it if that hair is fairly normal.  </li>
            <li>This works OK on both wet and dry hair, also a little goes a long way which is good</li>
            <li>I love several of their other products, but this one didn&#x27;t stand out to me.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that the ingredients are EXACTLY the same.  </li>
            <li>I had to take another shower later in the day after using this for the first time in order to remove the scent.  </li>
            <li>You just want to smooth down flyaways and surface frizz, not douse your head in a vat of grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This seems to calm that down as well, which is nice because it is hard to find a product for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and used the smoothing lotion when I straightened my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair was soft, shiny and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I have moderately sensitive skin, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had a hair product make me itchy before.  </li>
            <li>This tube went directly into the refuse bin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m quite surprised at all of the reviews that say it has a bad/manly smell</li>
            <li>I have baby-fine, naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li>shampoo and no other conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toni&amp;Guy makes superior hair care products for salon quality results, but it is expensive.</li>
            <li>I want a product that doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, that actually smooths it out, and that has a light scent.</li>
            <li>None of the listed ingredients are high end and the tube is simple.</li>
            <li>the cost wasn&#x27;t so high, I would give this five stars, but I will likely purchase again since it does work so well for me</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair in healthy condition and the first time I tried this I applied a quarter size amount to my towel dried hair and this product left my hair feeling weighed down and there was no shine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and isn&#x27;t gummy feeling like other (more expensive) brands.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that although the scent is the same as in this same brand&#x27;s conditioner that I use, for some reason it is much stronger.</li>
            <li>I got less smoothing but my fine hair still looked like an old yarn mop.</li>
            <li>My hair is just below my shoulderblades, and a walnut-sized glob left it feeling greasy, particularly the next day.</li>
            <li>It also left my hair soft (I used it in combination with &amp;#34;Clear&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is more expensive than the product I normally use</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s okay, but not great.  </li>
            <li>My problem is that I need products like this to tame the frizz but even used sparingly, my hair can be easily weighed-down and left looking unattractively flat.</li>
            <li>I ended up using about half that amount, and it helps control frizz pretty well.</li>
            <li>It will make your hair smoother and less frizzy, but with mineral oil as the second ingredient, it&#x27;s also likely to be too heavy of a product for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>recommend this even as I wonder if the company is trying to fool us by putting out the same product with the same ingredients (as far as I can tell), with a different name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The directions say to apply a walnut-sized dollop to wet or dry hair, but I found this to be waaaay too much</li>
            <li>Other people have noted the strong smell; it&#x27;s chemical-smelling in the extreme to me (though I am VERY sensitive to scent), and it also makes my curls feel heavy and dry and crunchy.</li>
            <li>The scent is hard to describe although I don&#x27;t find it either feminine or masculine, or offensive, but that is purely subjective.</li>

            <li> I have naturally wavy hair, so at times I am working with static electricity.  </li>
            <li> I think this is great to have around for special occasion hair styling when it really matters how you look, but it&#x27;s a bit out of my price range for everyday use.</li>
            <li> When the humidity is high, it morphs into a huge, monstrous ball of tacky frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that&#x27;s getting rather fine and has a tendency toward flyaways and frizz, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a good product that will control my curls (or waves; I often braid it when wet to help control things).</li>
            <li> This product, although full of parabens, keeps my fizzy hair in place, I have not curly nor straight, so with it, it looks like a curlish under control bed head</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight enough for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Why do these product always have to be designed with such strong scents?!  </li>
            <li> This works very good on my long hair, as long as I keep it away from my scalp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was very smooth in the same way that coated hair with wax or grease would make it smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really like the fresh scent that it leaves in my hair.</li>
            <li> This might or might not bother you, but you should be aware of it.  </li>
            <li> used this exactly two times.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I ended up with what looked like an oily patch on the side of my head</li>
            <li> I used about a size of a quarter at first.</li>
            <li> If you have to use that much at a time it will get very pricey quickly.</li>
            <li> but it will last you for years and the natural contents will let you sleep better at night!</li>
            <li> While others have disliked the scent, it didn&#x27;t really bother me - so it&#x27;s definitely a to each his own kind of smell and something to be mindful of.</li>
            <li> This smoothing lotion is a decent product and does calm my hair from the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use more that a pea-sized amount, and use it on DRY hair, after you&#x27;ve finished styling it and before using any sprays.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a strong fragrance, which I don&#x27;t especially like.</li>
            <li> I recently tried ALTERNA BAMBOO Smooth Kendi Oil Dry Oil Mist, and love it.</li>
            <li> I really like how my hair feels when I use this cream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the fragrance, though.  </li>
            <li> I prefer very light/mild fragrances.</li>
            <li> It calms the frizzies, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much besides that.  </li>
            <li> which of course I don&#x27;t really like; it doesn&#x27;t work as well and it has a scent I find bothersome.  </li>
            <li> really seems to condition dryer ends</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to waste it), but it still seemed effective in taming flyaway hair and frizz.</li>
            <li> Although it works fine on my long straight hair (leaving it glossy and still touchable) I could not handle leaving it in.  </li>
            <li> If however, I just rub some of the white creme between my hands, and ONLY apply down on my hair, away from my head, concentrating on my roots, it&#x27;s one of the most effective smoothing products I&#x27;ve used!&lt;br</li>
            <li> And when used with a flat iron, the product seems to enhance the smooth shiny look.  </li>
            <li> The price was a little higher than what I am used to spending but it made my hair feel like I was in a top end</li>
            <li> I checked the labels on other anti-frizz products on my shelf (mostly made by Pantene and TRESemme), and none of them had ANY parabens.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, there are just far too many drawbacks to these products to recommend them, especially when there are so many other hair products that work better, don&#x27;t have as many questionable ingredients, and are a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> This also smacks of some labeling dishonesty; I feel like they used several different kinds to make them appear lower in the list of ingredients (kind of like when a food manufacturer uses sugar, cane syrup, dextrose, and fructose all in the same product so that SUGAR doesn&#x27;t appear as the first ingredient).  </li>

            <li> Toni&amp;Guy Classic Smoothing Lotion / B00GJ7WV8M&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is highly skippable to me.</li>
            <li> I gave a high review to Tony and Guy Leave in Conditioner</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend that for adding wavy texture to hairstyles.</li>
            <li> This is a much thinner lotion, which happily surprised me.  </li>
            <li> I would just caution anyone NOT to use it on their scalp or close to it if that hair is fairly normal.  </li>
            <li> This works OK on both wet and dry hair, also a little goes a long way which is good</li>
            <li> I love several of their other products, but this one didn&#x27;t stand out to me.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the ingredients are EXACTLY the same.  </li>
            <li> I had to take another shower later in the day after using this for the first time in order to remove the scent.  </li>
            <li> You just want to smooth down flyaways and surface frizz, not douse your head in a vat of grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This seems to calm that down as well, which is nice because it is hard to find a product for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and used the smoothing lotion when I straightened my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was soft, shiny and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have moderately sensitive skin, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had a hair product make me itchy before.  </li>
            <li> This tube went directly into the refuse bin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m quite surprised at all of the reviews that say it has a bad/manly smell</li>
            <li> I have baby-fine, naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li> shampoo and no other conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toni&amp;Guy makes superior hair care products for salon quality results, but it is expensive.</li>
            <li> I want a product that doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, that actually smooths it out, and that has a light scent.</li>
            <li> None of the listed ingredients are high end and the tube is simple.</li>
            <li> the cost wasn&#x27;t so high, I would give this five stars, but I will likely purchase again since it does work so well for me</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair in healthy condition and the first time I tried this I applied a quarter size amount to my towel dried hair and this product left my hair feeling weighed down and there was no shine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and isn&#x27;t gummy feeling like other (more expensive) brands.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that although the scent is the same as in this same brand&#x27;s conditioner that I use, for some reason it is much stronger.</li>
            <li> I got less smoothing but my fine hair still looked like an old yarn mop.</li>
            <li> My hair is just below my shoulderblades, and a walnut-sized glob left it feeling greasy, particularly the next day.</li>
            <li> It also left my hair soft (I used it in combination with &amp;#34;Clear&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is more expensive than the product I normally use</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s okay, but not great.  </li>
            <li> My problem is that I need products like this to tame the frizz but even used sparingly, my hair can be easily weighed-down and left looking unattractively flat.</li>
            <li> I ended up using about half that amount, and it helps control frizz pretty well.</li>
            <li> It will make your hair smoother and less frizzy, but with mineral oil as the second ingredient, it&#x27;s also likely to be too heavy of a product for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> recommend this even as I wonder if the company is trying to fool us by putting out the same product with the same ingredients (as far as I can tell), with a different name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The directions say to apply a walnut-sized dollop to wet or dry hair, but I found this to be waaaay too much</li>
            <li> Other people have noted the strong smell; it&#x27;s chemical-smelling in the extreme to me (though I am VERY sensitive to scent), and it also makes my curls feel heavy and dry and crunchy.</li>
            <li> The scent is hard to describe although I don&#x27;t find it either feminine or masculine, or offensive, but that is purely subjective.</li>
            <li> To also really calm the frizz for me, I had to use quite a bit (the directions already say use a walnut sized glob, and I to use probably an extra half of that size), which only added to the too heavy feel.</li>
            <li> On my hair, the results are continuously poor, with a weighty feel and scent that is offputting, but when used to assist in the brushing of my Shih Tzu, if I simply put a teensy bit on my hands, rubbing them together and then petting the dog, I can achieve a result with less static than without the product.  </li>
            <li> Having read some online reviews, I applied the product sparingly ... and my long, wavy, hair still came out flat.</li>
            <li> I use a very small amount now, which I work into my palms first and then apply to my hair, concentrating on the ends and avoiding my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s one of those products I really can&#x27;t use after every shampoo or it causes a build up which leaves my hair flat and dull.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a *bad* smell, but it was nothing special, and there was just too much of</li>
            <li> The first time, I was afraid I had too much.</li>
            <li> Since it oozed out of the tube rapidly (at least in the warmth of a California spring day), I couldn&#x27;t really measure it as instructed.</li>
            <li> I have tried several Toni&amp;Guy products to date and have found them to be slightly above average.  </li>
            <li> product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, super-thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The key to using the Toni&amp;Guy Classic Smoothing Lotion is to use a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> The next time, I tried slightly less and ended up with the same lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it a few more times using less and the results were the same, dull hair with a heavy feel.</li>
            <li> Flyaways and little weird hairs tend to stay flat with the rest of my hair longer, giving my hair a smooth, brushed look for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> If you let it air dry it accentuates your curls.</li>
            <li> might make your hair feel a bit dry though, but havenÂ´t found anything else yet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The hair on my ends is rather dry and a bit damaged.  </li>
            <li> I can guess that I&#x27;ll get no more than 15 applications from this bottle with modest usage (and that&#x27;s a generous guess).</li>
            <li> This product can be used on wet or dry hair, but I prefer to use it on dry hair.</li>
            <li> and it left my hair weighted down and almost oily.</li>
            <li> instructions say to use a walnut-sized glob in your hair, and I&#x27;d recommend starting out with less than that.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the tube is much larger than the three and a half ounces of lotion it holds, so I wondered if the tube I&#x27;d received might have leaked in the package.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer to spend less on a product that does the same thing as this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically get too alarmed about additives, but there are FIVE different kinds of parabens in these conditioners.  </li>
            <li> Just a tiny dab, less than a dime, rubbed in my hands and then rubbed through my almost-dry hair</li>
            <li> hair has a slight natural curl in it and tends toward a little bit of frizz.</li>
            <li> After rubbing about a pea-sized glob of the smoothing lotion on my palms I used my fingers to distribute the product on the frizzy parts of my freshly washed and dried, long somewhat curly, thin textured hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my long ends shiny and manageable, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did nothing for my dry hair except weigh it down.</li>
            <li> It made my clean hair look dirty.</li>
            <li> A little dollop goes a surprisingly long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve learned that a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can see how a leave-in conditioner could also be used as a smoothing lotion, but selling the same product as two different products seems a little dishonest.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly Irish hair, highlighted in the salon and dry.</li>
            <li> noticed other reviewers complaining about the scent.  </li>
            <li> I found this by accident, as the local Ulta didn&#x27;t have my usual Redken product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Likewise, the low-end contents made me extremely nervous.</li>
            <li> I have super long, thick hair and did not apply this too liberally (because it is expensive</li>
            <li> It seems expensive and not worth the higher price compared to drugstore products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The (not very sweet) scent will linger throughout the day.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of products out there, like this one, that cost less and do the same, if not a better job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half-convinced that it did genuine damage to my hair, as my hair started tangling so badly after a week with this lotion that I literally couldn&#x27;t run a hair pick through it.</li>
            <li> There is no protective seal on the tube, so my rating knocked off a star from an average to a below average review of the product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve not had issues with it weighing down my hair.  </li>
            <li> I typically use it on towel-dried hair before blow-drying.</li>
            <li> I tried again with less product.</li>
            <li> I tried even less (about a dime)</li>
            <li> I discontinued use and went back to my usual products and my hair eventually returned to its usual softness, thank goodness.</li>
            <li> smoothed my hair and did make it look less fly-away.</li>
            <li> There was less frizz, but it had a weighty feel that I didn&#x27;t dig.</li>
            <li> It is a slightly steeper investment ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can get by with using a lot less than the recommended walnut size.  </li>
            <li> I like to use anti frizz or smoothing lotions to give my hair a less frizzy finish.</li>
            <li> but by night it was a tangled mess.</li>
            <li> It was still a grubby mess.</li>
            <li> This had little effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does leave my hair smoother and a little shinier and I like the way my hair feels afterward.</li>
            <li> They recommend a &amp;#34;walnut size&amp;#34; amount to use, but I use much less than that just to tame my flyaway hairs in between shampoos.</li>
            <li> My hair felt waxy and hung limply.</li>
            <li> What a waste of my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put it too close to my scalp, it can look oily and heavy.  </li>
            <li> but it felt lifeless and heavy instead of sleek and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer dull frizzies than have manly smelling hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a chemist, but I believe there are at least NINE ingredients used in these T&amp;G products that are solely there for the purpose of scenting the product.  </li>
            <li> And, while I have no sensitivities/allergies to fragrance, anyone who does will want to smell this in-person to ensure that they will not have a negative reaction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used smoothing lotions before that were unbelievably thick and gooey.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m tired of purchasing products that do nothing.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno&#x27;s hair smoothing creme, but unfortunately they discontinued the one I like and started using another version...</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s crazy!  </li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t hate the smell either.</li>
            <li> This has a very bad smell.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like how my hair feels when I use this cream. Feels really smooth but not sticky. Gives your hair body and manageability. If you let it air dry it accentuates your curls.</li>
            <li> After rubbing about a pea-sized glob of the smoothing lotion on my palms I used my fingers to distribute the product on the frizzy parts of my freshly washed and dried, long somewhat curly, thin textured hair. My problem is that I need products like this to tame the frizz but even used sparingly, my hair can be easily weighed-down and left looking unattractively flat. It did the job -- the frizzies were tamed and my hair looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that although the scent is the same as in this same brand&#x27;s conditioner that I use, for some reason it is much stronger. The scent is hard to describe although I don&#x27;t find it either feminine or masculine, or offensive, but that is purely subjective. About an hour or so after applying, I no longer noticed the fragrance, so it did fade. And, although I like the scent, if concerned, try to test out with a local vendor before purchasing to ensure there are no issues.</li>
            <li> I like this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, super-thick, curly hair.  When the humidity is low, it will do whatever I want and look great.  When the humidity is high, it morphs into a huge, monstrous ball of tacky frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used smoothing lotions before that were unbelievably thick and gooey.  This is a much thinner lotion, which happily surprised me.  Now here&#x27;s the trick to using this:  ignore the instructions to \\&quot;rub a walnut sized amount of product\\&quot; into your damp hair.  Walnut sized?  That&#x27;s crazy. On damp hair?  Nooooooo. Don&#x27;t use more that a pea-sized amount, and use it on DRY hair, after you&#x27;ve finished styling it and before using any sprays.  You just want to smooth down flyaways and surface frizz, not douse your head in a vat of grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I&#x27;m delighted with the results.  My hair looks smooth, not greasy, and doesn&#x27;t frizz up quite so much in the humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed other reviewers complaining about the scent.  I didn&#x27;t remember anything offensive, so I just went and gave it a sniff.  Nope, smells pretty good to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have tried several Toni&amp;Guy products to date and have found them to be slightly above average.  This smoothing lotion is a decent product and does calm my hair from the frizzies.  I don&#x27;t really care for the fragrance, though.  It seems expensive and not worth the higher price compared to drugstore products.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that&#x27;s getting rather fine and has a tendency toward flyaways and frizz, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a good product that will control my curls (or waves; I often braid it when wet to help control things). This definitely isn&#x27;t my favorite product I&#x27;ve tried, but it works pretty well if you want really light hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to use a walnut-sized glob in your hair, and I&#x27;d recommend starting out with less than that. My hair is just below my shoulderblades, and a walnut-sized glob left it feeling greasy, particularly the next day. I ended up using about half that amount, and it helps control frizz pretty well.</li>
            <li> The key to using the Toni&amp;Guy Classic Smoothing Lotion is to use a very small amount.  On my hair, the results are continuously poor, with a weighty feel and scent that is offputting, but when used to assist in the brushing of my Shih Tzu, if I simply put a teensy bit on my hands, rubbing them together and then petting the dog, I can achieve a result with less static than without the product.  I don&#x27;t care for the scent on her either, but since it&#x27;s not as close to my nose, the fragrance doesn&#x27;t offend me as much as when it&#x27;s on my own head.  Additionally, the tube is much larger than the three and a half ounces of lotion it holds, so I wondered if the tube I&#x27;d received might have leaked in the package.  There is no protective seal on the tube, so my rating knocked off a star from an average to a below average review of the product.  For the price, it should have a seal.  None of the listed ingredients are high end and the tube is simple.</li>
            <li> This smoothing lotion has a pleasant smell and spreads easily into hair. I typically use it on towel-dried hair before blow-drying. I have straight, fine hair and this does a good job giving my hair a soft and sleek look. Flyaways and little weird hairs tend to stay flat with the rest of my hair longer, giving my hair a smooth, brushed look for a longer period of time. It doesn&#x27;t promote tangles which is great for my fine hair and I really like the fresh scent that it leaves in my hair. A little dollop goes a surprisingly long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my hair likes to tangle, I don&#x27;t use any product daily, but this has joined the rotation of my hair products and I imagine it will remain a product that I continue to use.</li>
            <li> This works OK on both wet and dry hair, also a little goes a long way which is good considering it&#x27;s a bit pricey. I dont care for the smell but thats just me...I prefer very light/mild fragrances. It does a great job controlling frizz and flyaway hair, it leaves your hair manageable and it&#x27;s not sticky feeling which is great.</li>
            <li> This is a nice smoothing lotion. It has a pleasant (not overpowering smell) and it does seem to remove frizz from hair. I have used it on my own hair and on my 18 month old who has curly hair (I put some into her dry hair to help reform the curls and it has worked great).</li>
            <li> I have tried this three times. The first time, I was afraid I had too much. I applied what looked to me like a walnut sized amount. It made my clean hair look dirty. My hair felt waxy and hung limply. I brushed it as best I could but by night it was a tangled mess. It was very smooth in the same way that coated hair with wax or grease would make it smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried again with less product. I got less smoothing but my fine hair still looked like an old yarn mop. It was still a grubby mess. I tried even less (about a dime) it stuck in one area and did nothing I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is highly skippable to me.</li>
            <li> The instructions for this say that you should use a &amp;#34;walnut size&amp;#34; amount. Since it oozed out of the tube rapidly (at least in the warmth of a California spring day), I couldn&#x27;t really measure it as instructed. That being said, it did a great job of smoothing my hair, especially the top. I have super long, thick hair and did not apply this too liberally (because it is expensive and I don&#x27;t want to waste it), but it still seemed effective in taming flyaway hair and frizz. It imparted a modicum of shine, but I can&#x27;t say that this is a good product for shine enhancement on the whole. It also retained my hair&#x27;s natural full body (which is good since a &amp;#34;smoothing&amp;#34; application can flatten) and kept my hairs natural curl and waves intact. It also left my hair soft (I used it in combination with &amp;#34;Clear&amp;#34; shampoo and no other conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toni&amp;Guy makes superior hair care products for salon quality results, but it is expensive. I can guess that I&#x27;ll get no more than 15 applications from this bottle with modest usage (and that&#x27;s a generous guess). Given the current price of $10.55 per tube, it&#x27;s a lot more expensive than some othe products. I think this is great to have around for special occasion hair styling when it really matters how you look, but it&#x27;s a bit out of my price range for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This is the best styling product I have ever used!  I found this by accident, as the local Ulta didn&#x27;t have my usual Redken product. I&#x27;ll never go back.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how silky and smooth my hair felt after using this!  I have naturally curly hair, and used the smoothing lotion when I straightened my hair.  My hair was soft, shiny and not frizzy.  And when used with a flat iron, the product seems to enhance the smooth shiny look.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a smoothing lotion that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank AND do exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to doâ€¦ SMOOTH.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and isn&#x27;t gummy feeling like other (more expensive) brands.  The fragrance is light and appealing, brushing thru tangles seems to be easier and I&#x27;ve not had issues with it weighing down my hair.  My hair appears shinier and I&#x27;ve received many compliments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, it&#x27;s not my favorite.  It calms the frizzies, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much besides that.  I have naturally wavy hair, so at times I am working with static electricity.  This seems to calm that down as well, which is nice because it is hard to find a product for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for the scent of the Tony &amp; Guy products, but it dissipates quickly, so it is tolerable.  I love several of their other products, but this one didn&#x27;t stand out to me.  There are a lot of products out there, like this one, that cost less and do the same, if not a better job.  I would prefer to spend less on a product that does the same thing as this one.</li>
            <li> Toni&amp;Guy Classic Smoothing Lotion / B00GJ7WV8M&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder-length curly hair and was looking for something that would be a nice leave-in for tamed curls instead of frizz. I&#x27;m not a fan of this smoothing lotion. Other people have noted the strong smell; it&#x27;s chemical-smelling in the extreme to me (though I am VERY sensitive to scent), and it also makes my curls feel heavy and dry and crunchy. I&#x27;m half-convinced that it did genuine damage to my hair, as my hair started tangling so badly after a week with this lotion that I literally couldn&#x27;t run a hair pick through it. (A hair pick that I&#x27;ve used for the better part of a decade!) I discontinued use and went back to my usual products and my hair eventually returned to its usual softness, thank goodness. But I am displeased with the results and would not use again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Ana Mardoll</li>
            <li> I have curly/wavy hair that has a tendency of knotting up underneath.  My hair isn&#x27;t even that curly but the knots are sometimes the size of my fist...it&#x27;s crazy!  That&#x27;s not to mention the smaller knots that like to form throughout my hair.  Once I started using the Smoothing Lotion the knots were history.  I have longer than shoulder length hair and I use a quarter size amount of the product in my hair after towel drying it then comb it through.  It&#x27;s great for frizz too however I do need to reapply the next day to refresh.</li>
            <li> I gave a high review to Tony and Guy Leave in Conditioner and I give this Tony and Guy Smoothing Lotion the same review BECAUSE IT IS THE SAME. The ingredients are the same. This may seem thicker but I think it&#x27;s my imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smoothed my hair and did make it look less fly-away. If I crunch my hair I get curls that stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve learned that a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The (not very sweet) scent will linger throughout the day. Some find it objectionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this even as I wonder if the company is trying to fool us by putting out the same product with the same ingredients (as far as I can tell), with a different name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please leave a comment and let me know what you think.</li>
            <li> The first thing I always test on these hair products is the smell and this one was great! It made my hair very manageable and feeling healthy. Also loved the bottle and the color of the bottle. The price was a little higher than what I am used to spending but it made my hair feel like I was in a top end salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy in the future!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a great smoothing/glosser/anti-frizz product.  Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to be trying this smoothing lotion around the same time that I tried another of the company&#x27;s products, [[ASIN:B006L6AA8Y Toni &amp; Guy Prep Leave-In Conditioner]].  I noticed that the ingredients are EXACTLY the same.  I can see how a leave-in conditioner could also be used as a smoothing lotion, but selling the same product as two different products seems a little dishonest.  I wonder how many people buy BOTH (and that, of course, is probably T&amp;G&#x27;s objective).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how does it work?  Well, it&#x27;s okay, but not great.  It will make your hair smoother and less frizzy, but with mineral oil as the second ingredient, it&#x27;s also likely to be too heavy of a product for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of ingredients, this thing is LOADED with parabens (a type of preservative).  This might or might not bother you, but you should be aware of it.  Google it and see what you think.  There has been a lot of consumer demand to remove parabens from products because some studies have indicated that they have estrogen-like properties, and some researchers say there might be a link between parabens and breast cancer.  MIGHT.  Read up on it and you decide how you feel about it.  I don&#x27;t typically get too alarmed about additives, but there are FIVE different kinds of parabens in these conditioners.  This also smacks of some labeling dishonesty; I feel like they used several different kinds to make them appear lower in the list of ingredients (kind of like when a food manufacturer uses sugar, cane syrup, dextrose, and fructose all in the same product so that SUGAR doesn&#x27;t appear as the first ingredient).  I could be wrong, but why would T&amp;G use so many different kinds?  I checked the labels on other anti-frizz products on my shelf (mostly made by Pantene and TRESemme), and none of them had ANY parabens.  So why would T&amp;G use FIVE?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there&#x27;s the fragrance.  I&#x27;m not a chemist, but I believe there are at least NINE ingredients used in these T&amp;G products that are solely there for the purpose of scenting the product.  And you can tell!  I found the scent to be way too strong.  It wasn&#x27;t a *bad* smell, but it was nothing special, and there was just too much of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last issue I take with these products is that they seemed to make my hands itch.  I have moderately sensitive skin, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had a hair product make me itchy before.  Some people are allergic to parabens, though, so maybe I&#x27;m one of them.  Or maybe it was one of those nine fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, there are just far too many drawbacks to these products to recommend them, especially when there are so many other hair products that work better, don&#x27;t have as many questionable ingredients, and are a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> This product can be used on wet or dry hair, but I prefer to use it on dry hair. They recommend a &amp;#34;walnut size&amp;#34; amount to use, but I use much less than that just to tame my flyaway hairs in between shampoos. This product has a nice, pleasant fragrance. It is creamy and does not feel sticky.</li>
            <li> This item does it job as a smoother and polisher but has a manly fragrance. I&#x27;d prefer dull frizzies than have manly smelling hair. Bed head, day-old head are OK but man-head is not for me. I prefer to smell like sugar and spice and everything nice!</li>
            <li> I actually often don&#x27;t find frizz control type products to help, but this one did work for me. There was less frizz, but it had a weighty feel that I didn&#x27;t dig. To also really calm the frizz for me, I had to use quite a bit (the directions already say use a walnut sized glob, and I to use probably an extra half of that size), which only added to the too heavy feel. After being on there fora day, I also felt like my hair was kind of greasy, though since I often don&#x27;t use much product, it could just be normal for any product use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this one worked, but with some not so great side effects. While others have disliked the scent, it didn&#x27;t really bother me - so it&#x27;s definitely a to each his own kind of smell and something to be mindful of.</li>
            <li> This product, although full of parabens, keeps my fizzy hair in place, I have not curly nor straight, so with it, it looks like a curlish under control bed head that I like and that looks done.&lt;br /&gt;it might make your hair feel a bit dry though, but havenÂ´t found anything else yet.</li>
            <li> The fragrance here is epically off-putting. And, while I have no sensitivities/allergies to fragrance, anyone who does will want to smell this in-person to ensure that they will not have a negative reaction. For this reason alone, using this product became virtually impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this exactly two times. Having read some online reviews, I applied the product sparingly ... and my long, wavy, hair still came out flat. The next time, I tried slightly less and ended up with the same lifeless hair. In both cases, I had to rewash my hair in order to feel comfortable leaving the house. What a waste of my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, the low-end contents made me extremely nervous. At $15.00, I expect high-quality, safe contents. This tube went directly into the refuse bin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are seeking a smoothing lotion that you can feel good about, try [[ASIN:B0045WDQFA ALTERNA BAMBOO Smooth Kendi Oil Dry Oil Mist]]. It is a slightly steeper investment ... but it will last you for years and the natural contents will let you sleep better at night!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair in healthy condition and the first time I tried this I applied a quarter size amount to my towel dried hair and this product left my hair feeling weighed down and there was no shine. I&#x27;ve tried it a few more times using less and the results were the same, dull hair with a heavy feel. I won&#x27;t continue using this particular product by Toni &amp; Guy, but I do love their sea salt texturizing spray and I highly recommend that for adding wavy texture to hairstyles.</li>
            <li> Why do these product always have to be designed with such strong scents?!  Although it works fine on my long straight hair (leaving it glossy and still touchable) I could not handle leaving it in.  I had to take another shower later in the day after using this for the first time in order to remove the scent.  Since oneâ€™s hair is close to oneâ€™s nose, the smell persists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get by with using a lot less than the recommended walnut size.  If you have to use that much at a time it will get very pricey quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno&#x27;s hair smoothing creme, but unfortunately they discontinued the one I like and started using another version... which of course I don&#x27;t really like; it doesn&#x27;t work as well and it has a scent I find bothersome.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product, as I haven&#x27;t been happy with any other product I&#x27;ve tried, but I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has a slight natural curl in it and tends toward a little bit of frizz. I want a product that doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, that actually smooths it out, and that has a light scent. This Toni&amp;Guy lotion actually does all of that! I&#x27;ve been very happy using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite surprised at all of the reviews that say it has a bad/manly smell; I haven&#x27;t experienced that at all, but then, everyone&#x27;s tolerance is a bit different. My husband, who has a super-sniffer, hasn&#x27;t said anything about it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the cost wasn&#x27;t so high, I would give this five stars, but I will likely purchase again since it does work so well for me and I&#x27;m tired of purchasing products that do nothing.</li>
            <li> I have baby-fine, naturally wavy hair. I like to use anti frizz or smoothing lotions to give my hair a less frizzy finish. I found this product did the trick. It&#x27;s light weight enough for my fine hair. I really liked the fragrance, too. Just a tiny dab, less than a dime, rubbed in my hands and then rubbed through my almost-dry hair gives me the look I want. A similar product I like is Garnier Sleek and Shine cr&amp;egrave;me. I especially like it on humid or rainy days.</li>
            <li> This works very good on my long hair, as long as I keep it away from my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;If I put it too close to my scalp, it can look oily and heavy.  If however, I just rub some of the white creme between my hands, and ONLY apply down on my hair, away from my head, concentrating on my roots, it&#x27;s one of the most effective smoothing products I&#x27;ve used!&lt;br /&gt;It really seems to condition dryer ends and it does a great job with smoothing out frizz and fly-aways.  It leaves my long ends shiny and manageable, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.&lt;br /&gt;The hair on my ends is rather dry and a bit damaged.  Up towards my scalp the hair is in great shape, so that leaves me to suspect that this product is going to be most beneficial for dry or damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;I like it a lot.  I would just caution anyone NOT to use it on their scalp or close to it if that hair is fairly normal.  You might try it before a bit event or important outing.  The first time I used it, I ended up with what looked like an oily patch on the side of my head and I had to rewash my hair.  It does wash out very easily.</li>
            <li> This had little effect on my hair. My hair is thin.  It did keep my hair from frizzing . I used about a size of a quarter at first. Then I became more comfortable with the product using a penny size amount. This has a very bad smell. Would be a great product if it was not for the smell.</li>
            <li> I have wiry hair that tends toward being frizzy. This smoothing lotion by Toni &amp; Guy is really more of a cream. The directions say to apply a walnut-sized dollop to wet or dry hair, but I found this to be waaaay too much and it left my hair weighted down and almost oily. I use a very small amount now, which I work into my palms first and then apply to my hair, concentrating on the ends and avoiding my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave my hair smoother and a little shinier and I like the way my hair feels afterward. However, it&#x27;s one of those products I really can&#x27;t use after every shampoo or it causes a build up which leaves my hair flat and dull. For me, using it every second or third shampoo is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a strong fragrance, which I don&#x27;t especially like. However, I don&#x27;t hate the smell either. As your hair dries, it dissipates greatly and becomes acceptably subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is more expensive than the product I normally use and since I&#x27;m not nuts about the scent, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again unless it is on sale.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t come away with a salon feel but it did have a salon scent which I liked. I have thick curly Irish hair, highlighted in the salon and dry. It did nothing for my dry hair except weigh it down. It worked better on my washed hair before blow drying but it felt lifeless and heavy instead of sleek and shiny. I recently tried ALTERNA BAMBOO Smooth Kendi Oil Dry Oil Mist, and love it.</li>
