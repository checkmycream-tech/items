            <li>Guys, this is a great gift for your wife, sister or mom!</li>
            <li>The perfect item for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>My skin feels great after using this mitt!  </li>
            <li>This is the best exfoliator mitt I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVED this exfoliating mitt!</li>
            <li>Packaging is beautiful and mitts come with use and care instructions.</li>
            <li>This will undoubtedly save me a lot of money on spa exfoliations, so for that I am happy.</li>
            <li>This mitt is great for exfoliating your skin.</li>
            <li>This will make a great gift for family and friends.</li>
            <li>Great mitt - just on one use, my skin already felt cleaner and smoother.</li>
            <li>This would make a great birthday gift for my friends.</li>
            <li>Love this mitt!!</li>
            <li>I use in the shower not after soaking in bath and still think it is very effective.</li>
            <li>I understand it is good for smoothing lips</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVED it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also a packaging nerd and was totally impressed by the creative packaging that the mitt arrived in -- it was like it was packaged JUST for me by Joyaplenty and not just thrown in a box like many distributors do.</li>
            <li>SO nice, and spa like. :) yay!</li>
            <li>I received this exfoliation mitt from the company as a gift, and I was asked to write an honest review of it.</li>
            <li>I was asked to give an honest review of this mitt.  </li>
            <li>company gave me this mitt (or case) in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>I decided it was time to take matters into my own hands.</li>
            <li>And since most women don’t know about these mitts, I figure I’ve found a nice gift that they won’t already have.</li>
            <li>Her skin feels to smooth after just one use!</li>
            <li>I love both of these mitts and saw immediate results.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother and my face seems to have a more even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I love buying things that give</li>
            <li>For one thing, this mitt covers way more area than exfoliating gloves do, so it’s faster.</li>
            <li>I was dubious, but the 15-minute hot bath soak sounded good.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny and more!  </li>
            <li>I like this exfoliating mitt better than the alternative cheap gloves.</li>
            <li>As someone who does a lot of dry brushing this is a huge improvement over brushes and loofahs and best of all takes up no space when traveling.</li>
            <li>It does what a face mask, exfoliating scrub and wash cloth do, except all in one!It feels great on my skin and leaves my face feeling super soft -- it also seems to have helped with acne as well.</li>
            <li>She loves spa treatments and exfoliating, and I knew she would enjoy a product like this.  </li>
            <li>This exfoliation mitt is the best thing ever for removing dead skin.  </li>
            <li>What an unusual and effective texture these items have.</li>
            <li>Skin was silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Wish I had taken a pic of original packaging.</li>
            <li>!!! Wow! This is amazing.</li>
            <li>The last time I experienced the same kind of freshness on my skin, was when I went to sauna in Finland 3 months ago -  the exfoliating effect you get with this mitt (which you normally get only after sweating your time in sauna, and washing the toxins away with a proper shower brush) is awesome - and that&#x27;s without sauna!</li>
            <li>I love my natural skin brush and mitt!  </li>
            <li>I could tell a difference in my skin after the first use!  </li>
            <li>The silk facial mitt is just as great;  I can skip the $$ crystals I have been using and have the same smooth and energized-looking results.</li>
            <li>Works great as others have stated, see the dead skin just rolling off</li>
            <li>Plus, the mitt is made from natural fibers, unlike most exfoliating gloves I’ve seen.</li>
            <li>My husband has even commented on how soft my skin is becoming.</li>
            <li>After just 3 uses, my skin feels so much smoother and silkier!  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried a pedicure, I almost kicked the pedicurist in the face (accidently, of course).</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and quick to dry, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>When I applied the fine-grain linen to my legs and arms, the long-stroke massage not only felt good, but the effects were obvious and immediate.</li>
            <li>I am sure I will use this often this summer when my skin feels dry from summer heat and sun exposure.</li>
            <li>The rest of my skin seemed dry and more wrinkled than desirable, as well.</li>
            <li>If you follow instructions, your skin will peel off easily without irritation, and you&#x27;ll be left with glowing skin!</li>
            <li>I never fully trust products to do what they say they will do, but this particular product has me convinced!</li>
            <li>I am sold on the gentle simplicity, cleanliness, and effectiveness of these mitts.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care).</li>
            <li>The textures of both the body and face mitt are effective in removing dried skin, but not abrasive.</li>
            <li>The quality seems to be good enough to last a long time.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions, soaked and then exfoliated with the mitt and it easily and gently removed dead skin in large rolls.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight and drys very quickly unlike other exfoliating mitts I have used before.</li>
            <li>I was looking in the package for the &amp;#34;stuff,&amp;#34; expecting some gritty product to use with the mitt, and then saw the process was simply the fine fabric against well-soaked skin.</li>
            <li>Not too long ago, however, I noticed those fine lines and enlarged pours associated with aging beginning to multiply on my face.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how easily the dead skin came off and she was too.</li>
            <li>I was delightfully surprised by this exfoliating mitt.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft...</li>
            <li>I was asked to give an honest review for this mitt and I have read other products to use for a natural skin brush and was skeptical of an exfoliation mitt because I normally use body scrubs and didn&#x27;t see much difference in my skin, I used this for the first time and couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of skin that rolled off.  </li>
            <li>I usually use body scrubs and my skin never feels as smooth as it did after using the mitt.  </li>
            <li>I can feel the difference, the skin becomes so soft, yet not dry.</li>
            <li>I can see this becoming a weekly routine and am already addicted to my new mitt.</li>

            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife as a &amp;#34;late Mother&#x27;s Day&amp;#34; present. She loves spa treatments and exfoliating, and I knew she would enjoy a product like this.  After just one use, she is hooked! I watched her use it, and it was crazy to see all of that dead skin come off! I was amazed at how easily the dead skin came off and she was too. Her skin feels to smooth after just one use! This will undoubtedly save me a lot of money on spa exfoliations, so for that I am happy. Guys, this is a great gift for your wife, sister or mom!</li>
            <li> This mitt is great for exfoliating your skin. It is lightweight and drys very quickly unlike other exfoliating mitts I have used before. I understand it is good for smoothing lips so I plan to try it for that purpose also.</li>
            <li> I was asked to give an honest review for this mitt and I have read other products to use for a natural skin brush and was skeptical of an exfoliation mitt because I normally use body scrubs and didn&#x27;t see much difference in my skin, I used this for the first time and couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of skin that rolled off.

            <li> The perfect item for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Great mitt - just on one use, my skin already felt cleaner and smoother. I reached out to support and they were super-helpful. 5-stars.</li>
            <li> in a word.....AMAZING</li>
            <li> My skin feels great after using this mitt!  Well constructed too.</li>
            <li> I was delightfully surprised by this exfoliating mitt. It&#x27;s so simple to use and the results are immediate.  I received this exfoliation mitt from the company as a gift, and I was asked to write an honest review of it.

            <li> I love my natural skin brush and mitt!  After just 3 uses, my skin feels so much smoother and silkier!  I purchased a skin renewal system months ago that  was very expensive and didn&#x27;t work this well!  I am sure I will use this often this summer when my skin feels dry from summer heat and sun exposure. This would make a great birthday gift for my friends. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in my skin after the first use!  Will use every week.</li>
            <li> Love this mitt!!

I followed the directions, soaked and then exfoliated with the mitt and it easily and gently removed dead skin in large rolls.  Worth every penny and more!  This is on my personal gift list for friends!</li>
            <li> What an unusual and effective texture these items have. As someone who does a lot of dry brushing this is a huge improvement over brushes and loofahs and best of all takes up no space when traveling. Easy to clean and quick to dry, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was asked to give an honest review of this mitt.  I absolutely LOVED it.  The amount of dead skin that came off was shocking!  Skin was silky smooth.  I usually use body scrubs and my skin never feels as smooth as it did after using the mitt.  I will be giving this mitt as a gift at XMAS time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVED this exfoliating mitt! It does what a face mask, exfoliating scrub and wash cloth do, except all in one!It feels great on my skin and leaves my face feeling super soft -- it also seems to have helped with acne as well. I&#x27;ve used other exfoliating mitts and they just don&#x27;t seem to be made as well. I&#x27;m also a packaging nerd and was totally impressed by the creative packaging that the mitt arrived in -- it was like it was packaged JUST for me by Joyaplenty and not just thrown in a box like many distributors do. I would definitely buy this product again and am considering it as gifts for friends as well. Plus it&#x27;s a bonus that a portion of the profits go to Children&#x27;s Shelters in the US -- I love buying things that give back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company gave me this mitt (or case) in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Works great as others have stated, see the dead skin just rolling off but I haven&#x27;t gotten the same satisfaction with the face mit (but since I bought this for the body mit I don&#x27;t really care).</li>
            <li> I like this exfoliating mitt better than the alternative cheap gloves. For one thing, this mitt covers way more area than exfoliating gloves do, so it’s faster. The quality seems to be good enough to last a long time. I have never gotten dead skin rolls from exfoliating with gloves this mitt makes.

            <li> This is the best exfoliator mitt I have ever used.  Can&#x27;t praise it enough!</li>
            <li> I am horribly ticklish and I have sensitive skin. The first time I tried a pedicure, I almost kicked the pedicurist in the face (accidently, of course). Then, my husband bought me a massage for my birthday, and I squirmed through the entire supposed-to-be-relaxing session. I swore off spa treatments after that. Not too long ago, however, I noticed those fine lines and enlarged pours associated with aging beginning to multiply on my face. The rest of my skin seemed dry and more wrinkled than desirable, as well. I decided it was time to take matters into my own hands. A friend recommended this new, Joyaplenty skin mitt and, somewhat skeptically, I purchased it. A few weeks later and I wouldn&#x27;t part with it for the world! The textures of both the body and face mitt are effective in removing dried skin, but not abrasive. My husband has even commented on how soft my skin is becoming. And the pours on my face are visibly shrinking! I never fully trust products to do what they say they will do, but this particular product has me convinced!</li>
            <li> !!! Wow! This is amazing. My skin has never felt so soft...and I&#x27;ve been to a Turkish bath in Turkey! Packaging is beautiful and mitts come with use and care instructions. Wish I had taken a pic of original packaging. If you follow instructions, your skin will peel off easily without irritation, and you&#x27;ll be left with glowing skin! Not only that, but with each purchase this company gives to children&#x27;s charities. I will totally buy this as a gift for a girlfriend now. SO nice, and spa like. :) yay!</li>
