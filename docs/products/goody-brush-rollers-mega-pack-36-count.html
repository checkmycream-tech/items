            <li> I find myself wanting more of a \\&quot;hairdo\\&quot; than my stylist does for me so once she trims my hair and shampoos me, I use these rollers to create a longer-lasting, somewhat poufy hairdo.  With some [[ASIN:B000XTAA08 TIGI Bed Head Superstar Volumizing Leave-In Conditioner, 6.76 Ounce]], I can go a few extra days without having to re-do.      I&#x27;m noticing that bigger hair is making a comeback so I&#x27;m right in fashion.  These curlers/rollers offer a range of sizes-the larger diameter ones add height to the crown and the medium and smaller ones make tighter curl which really stays in the ends.  There are enough sizes and quantity of each to accommodate short or long hair.    Oh, you can pull-out the brushes and just have the curlers if your scalp is sensitive (or you want to really go old school and sleep in them).  You can really go green and roll your towel-dried hair and bypass the blow dryer and curling or flat irons.</li>
            <li> i just roll my hair for a couple of hours.  these are easy to put up fast and don&#x27;t pull hair out like the velcro ones do.</li>
            <li> This is not good for long hair as it tangles... And the pins poke. I would not recommend this product unless u have short hair</li>
            <li> These are very nice rollers once in they stay in place. I love the color and would order more, I would recoment these to&lt;br /&gt;Anyone.</li>
            <li> I remember sleeping on these rollers when I was a teenage. When you want a curl to last longer use the rollers instead of the curling iron.</li>
            <li> I was looking for brush rollers -- the kind I used when I was in high school.  These rollers do the trick - gives my hair a more bouffant look.  The  package could use some extra large rollers, but right now my hair is short enough for these to do what I want.</li>
            <li> These are great brush rollers, the bristles really help with keeping hair strands in place. However, the white pins that are supposed to hold the rollers in are so complicated to use. I ended using hair pins instead.</li>
            <li> These brush rollers are the perfect sizes for setting short to medium length hair. Being a brush (open) design, your hair stays on the roller and dries quickly. Love them!</li>
            <li> I am 77 years old, and do not like curling irons, etc.  I was having trouble finding brush rollers, which I have used since the 1970&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;These are perfect.  There are various sizes, and the vinyl zippered case is absolutely wonderful for storage and travel.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.[[ASIN:B003USG7GA Goody Brush Rollers, Mega Pack, 36 Count]]</li>
            <li> these are the best hair rollers that I find that hold the hair good and gives a long lasting curl and the price is right.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, and so naturally I have to deal with a lot of frizz and flyaways. I hate using heat based styling products regularly, so even though a curling rod does a good job, I was looking for something that I could use daily. And I came across the Goody Brush Rollers. I have never used rollers before so though I&#x27;ll give these a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the brush rollers would work best for people with straight hair.  They just didn&#x27;t work for me.  My hair would get stuck in the brushes in the rollers and there was extra breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I decided to take the brushes out and just use the rollers. That worked way better. I was nervous that the rollers won&#x27;t stay in place without the brushes, but they worked fine when I used two of the pins with each roller.  There are definitely plenty of rollers and in all different sizes. I tend to use the biggest ones for the hair on my back and one size smaller in the front as there just isn&#x27;t enough of the same size for all my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to compare these to Velcro rollers but I have never tried those and don&#x27;t feel like spending money on another set of rollers, but if I do in the future, I&#x27;ll update the review.</li>
            <li> I super like this!! cant find this at the stores for a good price, nice and neat..they shipped it pretty fast too!! one problem though the a lot of the plastic bristles are broken :( but it really works wonders on your hair! lovess it ;)</li>
            <li> Got rid of all my brush rollers long ago... now it seems I have missed them.I have very long hair and none of the newer rollers stay on my head. Not my hot rollers or any of the many I have gone through since saying good-bye to brush rollers.I bought two pkg&#x27;s of these rollers... Thay are exactly what they say they are, they even come with the pics you need to hold them in place! They work great... I got them at a fair price and they were delivered in a timely manner. They work and your style will stay in much longer. Good luck</li>
            <li> My mother had my father look all over town for these rollers, and nobody has them. I got them for her and she was so happy. She said they work better than any other kind of roller she has ever used.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I like Goody Brush rollers, only I thought the bigger rollers were a Bigger size.  My error, I do recommend Goody Rollers, I just take the brush out for sleeping.</li>
            <li> I am happy with these curlers, but, you know, curlers are curlers. How do you give five stars to curlers? They suit the purpose.</li>
            <li> Pros: Stays in the hair very well&lt;br /&gt;  Gives nice looking, long lasting curls&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: You must be very precise when rolling your hair or you will get them stuck on the way out! (The first time I used them I thought I was going to have to cut out two of them!)&lt;br /&gt;  Fairly uncomfortable to wear. (The bristles of the rollers are uncomfortable on your scalp. I don&#x27;t think you could ever sleep in these.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these worked well for my Chin-Length hair. I don&#x27;t think these would be good for hair that is longer than shoulder-length.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the roller sizes.  These are small to extra small rollers.  I wanted medium to large rollers. Live and learn.  I will keep them, but do not see using them anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe they still make these.  Have been wanting to let my hair grow, and this makes it easier.  Hate using the curling iron every day.</li>
            <li> Multiple sizes, easy to use, durable, and great for the old school types (like me!)  The package does contain plastic pins to secure the rollers in the hair.  Brushes are removable, and the rollers are easy to clean.  My stylist said they had a hard time finding these in the beauty supply stores.  Leave it to Amazon to carry just what I need, and at a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled for years with styling tools like hot rollers, curling irons and blow dryers. The best I could do was make my hair look o.k. for a few hours.  Then I remembered how I used to roll my wet hair on brush rollers back in the 60&#x27;s (yikes!), and how fast it was.  So I purchased these brush rollers plus a retro-style bonnet hair dryer.  My hair is medium/short and dries in about 20 minutes under the dryer.  Actually, this is my second set of rollers.  The same rollers are available at WalMart under the \\&quot;Conair\\&quot; name.  Same rollers, same package, different name.  There&#x27;s plenty of rollers, 9 of each size, but I actually needed more than 9 of one size; thats why I purchased this second set.  Unlike hot rollers that shape my hair for a few hours, brush rollers shape my hair for a few days.  I highly recommend these for anybody who has the time to sit under a dryer.</li>
