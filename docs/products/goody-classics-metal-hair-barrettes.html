            <li>best barette ever!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Beautiful!</li>
            <li>and this is the best.</li>
            <li>Goody barettes continue to be the best on the market in my experience.  </li>
            <li>This accessory is very good and practical for a gorgeous hairstyle in your hair.</li>
            <li>Great hair clips.</li>
            <li>But attractive.</li>
            <li>I guess nothing is ever as good as it used to be.  </li>
            <li>Daughter loved this selection of 4 pairs of barrettes.  </li>
            <li>They do a great job of holding my fine hair, which can be tricky (heavier ones slip out).</li>
            <li>These barrettes are not as cheap as others that I just purchased, but they are not that great.</li>
            <li>they just slide out bit by bit until they fall out of their own accord.</li>
            <li>These barettes are really nice.</li>
            <li>Nice muted tones as well.</li>
            <li>Loved it :) I recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>These are cheap!</li>
            <li>Love these just prefect.</li>
            <li>They come as an 8 pack, so you always have more if you lose one (or two).  </li>
            <li>They were exactly as described and purchased at a fair price.  </li>
            <li>Nice color/texture variety in this array of barettes, just the right size for my hair.</li>
            <li>Great but only because the person that gave them to me is very special to me</li>
            <li>Stays in place and its easy to secure.</li>
            <li>Great barrettes for daily use.</li>
            <li>I miss the good old days when you could buy quality barrettes.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to find them on here.</li>
            <li>i love these barrettes I use them to put my hair in a ponytail I have trouble using ponytail holders these work great</li>
            <li>These are definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>They are metal, which is great for extra durability - especially when they&#x27;re worn daily.</li>
            <li>The quality of the metal is decent, better than some I&#x27;ve tried, and they won&#x27;t bend out of shape from use, but their capacity for holding hair is limited.</li>
            <li>as I am older, I dont want shiny clips in my hair.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not trying to use them as ponytailers, just to gather up loose hair on the sides and smooth it away from my face.)</li>
            <li>These duller finishes disguise dirt and the build-up of hairspray in addition to just being pretty alternatives to their standard, polished finishes and slotted styles.</li>
            <li>I really need barrettes but these were NOT as high quality as the ones I bought from the same brand 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I still have my old ones</li>
            <li>They are harder to close around hair and really gave me a headache.  </li>
            <li>the top set is thick set of dark tone with a flower like a daisy?</li>

            <li> the top set is thick set of dark tone with a flower like a daisy?</li>
            <li> I have slick straight thinner locks.</li>
            <li> They look nice, but are VERY difficult to use.</li>
            <li> the next is thin silver but brushed, then a thick set of brushed gold tone, then the bottom is lighter toned but more flowers.</li>
            <li> Always looking for the right barett that holds thin hair</li>
            <li> It is really hard to find Goody barrettes where I live now.</li>
            <li> Not big enough or sturdy enough to hold all of very thick hair in the back with 1 barrette.</li>
            <li> I love to have these around--they are inexpensive, lightweight, and impossible to break (since they are metal).  </li>
            <li> they can slip over time in my hair if I try to pull back too small a chunk of hair.</li>
            <li> they are hard to find but I like the look of them over the standard shiny gold or sliver.</li>
            <li> do not stay tightly in my hair.</li>
            <li> A little too hard too put on and take off.  </li>
            <li> The metal is so stiff I couldn&#x27;t close them over my hair!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly, past-the-shoulders hair</li>
            <li> not a great purchase.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t flashy, which is what I wanted.</li>

            <li> bought for the clasping mechanism. the barette is one piece.  best barette ever!</li>
            <li> Not big enough or sturdy enough to hold all of very thick hair in the back with 1 barrette.</li>
            <li> do not stay tightly in my hair. they just slide out bit by bit until they fall out of their own accord. not a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Great barrettes for daily use.</li>
            <li> I really need barrettes but these were NOT as high quality as the ones I bought from the same brand 10 years ago.  They are harder to close around hair and really gave me a headache.  I still have my old ones and I cherish them.  I guess nothing is ever as good as it used to be.  These are cheap!</li>
            <li> Love these just prefect.</li>
            <li> These barettes are really nice. Nice muted tones as well. It is really hard to find Goody barrettes where I live now. These are definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great hair clips. Ordered them online because I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the headache of going to Target.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find barrettes for women anywhere so I was excited to find them on here. These aren&#x27;t flashy, which is what I wanted. They do the trick.</li>
            <li> A little too hard too put on and take off.  But attractive.</li>
            <li> Nice color/texture variety in this array of barettes, just the right size for my hair. I use them every day.</li>
            <li> This accessory is very good and practical for a gorgeous hairstyle in your hair. It&#x27;s Beautiful! Loved it :) I recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love to have these around--they are inexpensive, lightweight, and impossible to break (since they are metal).  They come as an 8 pack, so you always have more if you lose one (or two).  I like the neutral metallic colors, and the variable width.  They do a great job of holding my fine hair, which can be tricky (heavier ones slip out).</li>

            <li> I have very thick, curly, past-the-shoulders hair and I struggle to get it into these barrettes. Sometimes they pop open on me. (I&#x27;m not trying to use them as ponytailers, just to gather up loose hair on the sides and smooth it away from my face.) The quality of the metal is decent, better than some I&#x27;ve tried, and they won&#x27;t bend out of shape from use, but their capacity for holding hair is limited. Of note, they also do not have any protective plastic or silicone layer over the metal to protect hair from snagging.</li>
            <li> these are the same as a set I had years ago but lost some over time. the top set is thick set of dark tone with a flower like a daisy? imprinted on it. the next is thin silver but brushed, then a thick set of brushed gold tone, then the bottom is lighter toned but more flowers. they are hard to find but I like the look of them over the standard shiny gold or sliver. I guess I feel they are a bit dressier? as I am older, I dont want shiny clips in my hair. I have slick straight thinner locks. they can slip over time in my hair if I try to pull back too small a chunk of hair.</li>
            <li> These barrettes are not as cheap as others that I just purchased, but they are not that great. I miss the good old days when you could buy quality barrettes.</li>
