    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It came in perfect condition and you do get 4boxes inside containing 12 each.</li>
            <li>Still these are the best non-lubricated condoms for the price!</li>
            <li>great bargain, they are not expired or close to it!</li>
            <li>great mic covers for mics</li>
            <li>Thought these would be good for oral sex.</li>
            <li>This is an absolutely incredible cheap buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to most pre-lubricated condoms, so these work great because I can use my own lube</li>
            <li>It is lovely to buy in bulk and not stand in the drug store line getting the &#x27;stare&#x27;!</li>
            <li>Better than pre-lubricated products.</li>
            <li>I love these condoms.</li>
            <li>Without lubrication on the inside nothing stays on better.</li>
            <li>I hope that they do not stop manufacturing these as there is not one condom on the market that works better for safety reasons.</li>
            <li>Faster fine.</li>
            <li>As a sound tech in television, I use these to protect my audio transmitters from water and actor sweat.</li>
            <li>Aside from that, non-lubricated condoms are excellent for quick, water-proof protection of small items.</li>
            <li>These are good basic condoms, been using them for years and have never run across a defect.</li>
            <li>But really, why would I buy this product if I didn&#x27;t already know how we feel about them!</li>
            <li>A simple product  we use for for an unintended benefit, keeping all our &amp;#34;TOYS&amp;#34; free of emissions AND lube.</li>
            <li>I actually ordered these for non-sexual use, but I imagine they&#x27;re equally useful for that purpose as well.</li>
            <li>Cheap and easy solution for isolating pressed powder pellets from the high pressure fluids used in cold isostatic pressing.</li>
            <li>There is no other choice</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The occasionaly one does seem to fail under 50,000 PSI loads.</li>
            <li> Too big and taste horrible.</li>
            <li> This is an awkward review to do.</li>

            <li> Cheap and easy solution for isolating pressed powder pellets from the high pressure fluids used in cold isostatic pressing. The occasionaly one does seem to fail under 50,000 PSI loads.</li>
            <li> great mic covers for mics</li>
            <li> I actually ordered these for non-sexual use, but I imagine they&#x27;re equally useful for that purpose as well. Aside from that, non-lubricated condoms are excellent for quick, water-proof protection of small items. I place them over the barrels of rifles prior to storage to help keep dust and moisture out of them.</li>
            <li> Better than pre-lubricated products.</li>
            <li> It came in perfect condition and you do get 4boxes inside containing 12 each.</li>
            <li> No local retailers stock unlubricated condoms, so I&#x27;m forced to order them online. These are good basic condoms, been using them for years and have never run across a defect. Plus they are not soaked in poisons or whatever else they put on lubed condoms.</li>
            <li> I love these condoms. Without lubrication on the inside nothing stays on better. I hope that they do not stop manufacturing these as there is not one condom on the market that works better for safety reasons. This is an absolutely incredible cheap buy. Faster fine.</li>
            <li> There is no other choice but I would rather buy them in bulk rather than retail boxes. Still these are the best non-lubricated condoms for the price!</li>
            <li> As a sound tech in television, I use these to protect my audio transmitters from water and actor sweat.</li>

            <li> This is the preference of my husband and I. We usually don&#x27;t need lube so these work well for us. We do keep some in the bathroom though, just in case.</li>
            <li> great bargain, they are not expired or close to it!</li>
            <li> Thought these would be good for oral sex. They are not. Too big and taste horrible.</li>
            <li> This is an awkward review to do. But if I don&#x27;t do it, I&#x27;ll keep getting Emails requesting I do. But really, why would I buy this product if I didn&#x27;t already know how we feel about them! It is lovely to buy in bulk and not stand in the drug store line getting the &#x27;stare&#x27;!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most pre-lubricated condoms, so these work great because I can use my own lube and well... I&#x27;m not pregnant!</li>
