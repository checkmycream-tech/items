            <li>Truly amazing product.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and it is durable and effective</li>
            <li>It would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li>All in all, the Body Buddy is easy to manipulate, easy to clean up, and is a wonderful aid for those of us who either prefer or need to apply lotion to our own backs.</li>
            <li>It cleans up very easily also.  </li>
            <li>This applicator is effective, easy to use and conveniently folds into a corner of my suitcase.  </li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t absorb the lotion.</li>
            <li>I do seem to go through a lot more lotion when I use it.  </li>
            <li>This works much better than the long-handled lotion applicator I had been using.</li>
            <li>and I was expecting more of a sponge</li>
            <li>I guess this vinyl-like substance is better at rubbing the lotion in without globbing</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift and love it.</li>
            <li>I truly love it.</li>
            <li>TMI? :)</li>
            <li>Living alone I find this is a perfect way to apply lotion to my back.  </li>
            <li>We love the body buddy lotion applicator.</li>
            <li>Since I need to apply a prescription lotion, I&#x27;ll probably be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Three more words required.</li>
            <li>It does the trick, but I agree with most reviewers about the elastic handles.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s better than most things out there.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is &#x27;Made In The USA&#x27;.</li>
            <li>This is the greatest product ever for easy, thorough application of lotion to my back!  </li>
            <li>Smooth and easy to use and my backside sez: U da MAN!</li>
            <li>Body Buddy works great when you live alone.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The Body Buddy is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li>It is SO easy to apply, SO easy to use &amp; SO easy to clean - amazing, so glad someone came up with this product</li>
            <li>I have found it absolutely ideal for applying lotion to my back.  </li>
            <li>After many sunburns on my back, I am so happy to find this.</li>
            <li>Allows for easy application of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I would easily give it five stars</li>
            <li>Use any lotion you like, washes up easy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Cleans up easily by pulling the buddy across your thigh.</li>
            <li>The plastic is easy to use and</li>
            <li>For the price and the way it&#x27;s used, this product should have strong, non-stretch rope straps.</li>
            <li>The right tools make a HUGE difference! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed it in the W/D and turns out fine.  </li>
            <li>This is fast, easy, and effective.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean</li>
            <li>and i needed to put lotion on my back  and this applicator worked great and solved my problem.</li>
            <li>It rolls it smoothly</li>
            <li>The surface is smooth material, so when you apply the lotion it runs.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Easy to put on and clean too.  </li>
            <li>I finally had to get rid of it and was so happy to find another one.</li>
            <li>This applicator is just fantastic.</li>
            <li>I would think you could find something in a sewing shop and make it yourself fairly cheaply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to have discovered this product on Amazon in different colors</li>
            <li>For those of us who are flexibility-challenged, this is a great tool to apply lotion or medication on your back.  </li>
            <li>This gets the job done and is easy to wipe clean and sanitize.</li>
            <li>The Body Buddy is an excellent product for people who want an easy and effective way to apply liquids, foams, or lotions to any part of their bodies that are difficult to reach.</li>
            <li>but well worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my Body Buddy for seven months and loved it--until recently.  </li>
            <li>No residue is apparent after application, but if you&#x27;re a clean freak, wipe with a warm cloth after each use.</li>
            <li>Every once in a while, the applicator needs a quick wipe.  </li>
            <li>but EVERY time I apply tanning lotion to my back, back of my arms etc it is PERFECT!  </li>
            <li>With just a couple of pulls back &amp; forth, the lotion warms and it massages your back &amp; feels GREAT!</li>
            <li>My lotion goes on smoothly and pretty evenly.</li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>This is the best invention for dry back skin ever.  </li>
            <li>That being said, all in all this is a great little helper.</li>
            <li>Nothing drips; change hands and rub some more to get both sides completely.  </li>
            <li>is well worth the purchase</li>
            <li>It says machine washable, but I wash it in the sink with mild soap and warm water and hang it to dry.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a quick and effective way to spread lotion on your back!</li>
            <li>Hurray for smart products!</li>
            <li>The Body Buddy is soft and easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it a month and very much</li>
            <li>Works pretty good but takes a little practice.</li>
            <li>I paid more for this than some other lotion applicators, but it is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>For the first time, I am able to moisturize all over my back.  </li>
            <li>Perfectly logical.  </li>
            <li>Shorter elastic would be better or even a different non-elastic handle.</li>
            <li>I love how I can put lotion ALL over my back all by myself.</li>
            <li>This lotion applicator works really well!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>The only thing that would be better is if it were heated.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It really does!</li>
            <li>I live alone and had to apply prescription creams and ointments to my back and this thing was simply amazing.  </li>
            <li>I live alone with nobody to help me but lotion on my back and this comes in handy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean; just wipe it down with a mild soap and rinse.</li>
            <li>I need to really grab the ends of the actual band...but even with that I still love body buddy.</li>
            <li>Generally, this is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>Original purchase is over six years old, so this is a very durable product.  </li>
            <li>Without a doubt, but considering how long this has lasted, I am well satisfied.  </li>
            <li>With this, you can really get around the curves of the back from the top, bottom and to the sides with no problem and it washes really.</li>
            <li>It is truly non-absorbent, easy to store (I keep mine on the door knob of the bathroom), and a simple,inexpensive answer to a universal challenge.</li>
            <li>I wash it with a load in my washing machine, then wipe it dry with a cloth (another 30 seconds at most).  </li>
            <li>It is really nothing much more than a long strip of vinyl cloth.</li>
            <li>Every winter my skin gets so dry and itchy, and I&#x27;m always trying to find a good way to moisturize my back.  </li>
            <li>ingenious little invention, purchased it for tanning lotion prior to my vacation,,, love it</li>
            <li>With this applicator, it takes literally FIVE MINUTES for a very even, smooth self-tan that reaches all across my back.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It is very well constructed.</li>
            <li>I do not have much flexibility in one arm.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.  </li>
            <li>Though it is a perfect idea to moisturize one&#x27;s back, the vinyl started cracking on each edge only five months after I got it, which means it is a bit scratchy when using now,  Not particularly comfortable.</li>
            <li>, this is legally stealing money from consumers......</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I am actually still using my original, but the straps are going to give out one of these days</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to have something that soothes dry skin in the middle of my back.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to swipe the Body Buddy back and forth until my back has been thoroughly covered and the lotion is completely absorbed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to use without using the elastic handles and it spreads lotion on my back pretty darn well.</li>
            <li>The vinyl is soft, but not absorbent, so it is very easy to wipe down or wash.</li>
            <li>The lotion is quickly all over my back</li>
            <li>Super product for applying lotions to ones back.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Still, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Sure, a little bit on the pricey side</li>
            <li>Not really a complaint.  </li>
            <li>It is made of a soft vinyl, but at first I thought it was soft leather.  </li>
            <li>It allows me to effectively lotion my back from the shoulders down with almost no effort.  </li>
            <li>With this I can apply lotion to my entire back easily.</li>
            <li>Like most people I have dry skin in the winter and of course your back is the hardest spot to reach with lotion.</li>
            <li>It is a rather unattractive color, but that minor flaw was quickly forgiven when I realized how well it works.  </li>
            <li>At first blush, the elastic handles seemed like an inconvenience, but I do notice the stretch helps when changing direction as I alternate between my right and left hands taking the high side.  </li>
            <li>I live alone</li>
            <li>I just got my new one</li>
            <li>And of course if you have super dry skin</li>
            <li>I would recommend warming up the fabric first if possible</li>
            <li>Even if you have a significant other.</li>
            <li>My back itched from dry skin all winter long as I could not apply lotion on my own</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical of how this product would work, but the non-absorbent fabric is perfect.</li>
            <li>Although they are securely attached, they stretch to far making it a little awarkward to use.</li>
            <li>I dance in ballroom dance competitions and since I am very pasty-pale-skinned, I have to put self-tanner lotion all over, including my back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, yet doesn&#x27;t absorb the lotion.</li>
            <li>If you have a sewing machine, save yourself some $ and buy some soft vinyl (perhaps oilcloth), sew the edges together and add handles.  </li>
            <li>and I am completely moisturized.  </li>
            <li>This really helps me put moisture on my back.</li>
            <li>Not sure if a more liquid lotion would stay on the vinyl without dripping as you place the applicator on your back.  </li>
            <li>We have tried many different applicators to get at those hard to reach places, but nothing has worked well until we tried the body buddy.</li>
            <li>have enjoyed having a less dry and itchy back</li>
            <li>I like to use it all over, even on places that I can reach, it because although my hands are also dry, too much lotion makes them greasy and slippery.</li>
            <li>i use this for my tanning lotions and mousses and it works very well to get your rear shoulders and inner back.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, constantly struggeling with rashes.  </li>
            <li>But it seems well made and will hold up, and if you get the dry itchy skin on the back, it&#x27;s worth the couple extra bucks.</li>
            <li>My back feels as though a professional has applied moisturizer to it.  </li>
            <li>No waste; all product goes onto your back.</li>
            <li>too!&lt;br /&gt;It covers your back completely and where you need it.  </li>
            <li>Takes a few tries to get the hang of it, but after that, it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>The handles are elastic and can make it difficult to hit the exact place on your back but just use a scatter shot technique and it is fine.</li>
            <li>Not much to say except that this is a simple idea that really works.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>(partly because I can only move my right shoulder a little).  </li>
            <li>Other reviewers are right about the straps being too loose-</li>
            <li>Every once in a while, I quickly wash it in the sink with a little shampoo and hang to dry.</li>
            <li>It not only serves its purpose for putting lotion on my dry, itchy back, but the vinyl is very soft and soothing.  </li>
            <li>I had started with the long brush where you add lotion inside, it worked somewhat but after a time, the lotion got all caked up &amp; the inside hard to clean</li>
            <li>Too bad because, before that happened, I also bought one as a birthday present for a friend since I loved it so much.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Use any lotion you like, washes up easy.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Cleans up easily by pulling the buddy across your thigh.</li>
            <li> The plastic is easy to use and</li>
            <li> For the price and the way it&#x27;s used, this product should have strong, non-stretch rope straps.</li>
            <li> The right tools make a HUGE difference! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed it in the W/D and turns out fine.  </li>
            <li> This is fast, easy, and effective.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean</li>
            <li> and i needed to put lotion on my back  and this applicator worked great and solved my problem.</li>
            <li> It rolls it smoothly</li>
            <li> The surface is smooth material, so when you apply the lotion it runs.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and clean too.  </li>
            <li> I finally had to get rid of it and was so happy to find another one.</li>
            <li> This applicator is just fantastic.</li>
            <li> I would think you could find something in a sewing shop and make it yourself fairly cheaply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to have discovered this product on Amazon in different colors</li>
            <li> For those of us who are flexibility-challenged, this is a great tool to apply lotion or medication on your back.  </li>
            <li> This gets the job done and is easy to wipe clean and sanitize.</li>
            <li> The Body Buddy is an excellent product for people who want an easy and effective way to apply liquids, foams, or lotions to any part of their bodies that are difficult to reach.</li>
            <li> but well worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Body Buddy for seven months and loved it--until recently.  </li>
            <li> No residue is apparent after application, but if you&#x27;re a clean freak, wipe with a warm cloth after each use.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while, the applicator needs a quick wipe.  </li>
            <li> but EVERY time I apply tanning lotion to my back, back of my arms etc it is PERFECT!  </li>
            <li> With just a couple of pulls back &amp; forth, the lotion warms and it massages your back &amp; feels GREAT!</li>
            <li> My lotion goes on smoothly and pretty evenly.</li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> This is the best invention for dry back skin ever.  </li>
            <li> That being said, all in all this is a great little helper.</li>
            <li> Nothing drips; change hands and rub some more to get both sides completely.  </li>
            <li> is well worth the purchase</li>
            <li> It says machine washable, but I wash it in the sink with mild soap and warm water and hang it to dry.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a quick and effective way to spread lotion on your back!</li>
            <li> Hurray for smart products!</li>
            <li> The Body Buddy is soft and easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a month and very much</li>
            <li> Works pretty good but takes a little practice.</li>
            <li> I paid more for this than some other lotion applicators, but it is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> For the first time, I am able to moisturize all over my back.  </li>
            <li> Perfectly logical.  </li>
            <li> Shorter elastic would be better or even a different non-elastic handle.</li>
            <li> I love how I can put lotion ALL over my back all by myself.</li>
            <li> This lotion applicator works really well!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> The only thing that would be better is if it were heated.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It really does!</li>
            <li> I live alone and had to apply prescription creams and ointments to my back and this thing was simply amazing.  </li>
            <li> I live alone with nobody to help me but lotion on my back and this comes in handy.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean; just wipe it down with a mild soap and rinse.</li>
            <li> I need to really grab the ends of the actual band...but even with that I still love body buddy.</li>
            <li> Generally, this is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li> Original purchase is over six years old, so this is a very durable product.  </li>
            <li> Without a doubt, but considering how long this has lasted, I am well satisfied.  </li>
            <li> With this, you can really get around the curves of the back from the top, bottom and to the sides with no problem and it washes really.</li>
            <li> It is truly non-absorbent, easy to store (I keep mine on the door knob of the bathroom), and a simple,inexpensive answer to a universal challenge.</li>
            <li> I wash it with a load in my washing machine, then wipe it dry with a cloth (another 30 seconds at most).  </li>
            <li> It is really nothing much more than a long strip of vinyl cloth.</li>
            <li> Every winter my skin gets so dry and itchy, and I&#x27;m always trying to find a good way to moisturize my back.  </li>
            <li> ingenious little invention, purchased it for tanning lotion prior to my vacation,,, love it</li>
            <li> With this applicator, it takes literally FIVE MINUTES for a very even, smooth self-tan that reaches all across my back.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> It is very well constructed.</li>
            <li> I do not have much flexibility in one arm.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  </li>
            <li> Though it is a perfect idea to moisturize one&#x27;s back, the vinyl started cracking on each edge only five months after I got it, which means it is a bit scratchy when using now,  Not particularly comfortable.</li>
            <li> , this is legally stealing money from consumers......</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I am actually still using my original, but the straps are going to give out one of these days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to have something that soothes dry skin in the middle of my back.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to swipe the Body Buddy back and forth until my back has been thoroughly covered and the lotion is completely absorbed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough to use without using the elastic handles and it spreads lotion on my back pretty darn well.</li>
            <li> The vinyl is soft, but not absorbent, so it is very easy to wipe down or wash.</li>
            <li> The lotion is quickly all over my back</li>
            <li> Super product for applying lotions to ones back.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Still, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Sure, a little bit on the pricey side</li>
            <li> Not really a complaint.  </li>
            <li> It is made of a soft vinyl, but at first I thought it was soft leather.  </li>
            <li> It allows me to effectively lotion my back from the shoulders down with almost no effort.  </li>
            <li> With this I can apply lotion to my entire back easily.</li>
            <li> Like most people I have dry skin in the winter and of course your back is the hardest spot to reach with lotion.</li>
            <li> It is a rather unattractive color, but that minor flaw was quickly forgiven when I realized how well it works.  </li>
            <li> At first blush, the elastic handles seemed like an inconvenience, but I do notice the stretch helps when changing direction as I alternate between my right and left hands taking the high side.  </li>
            <li> I live alone</li>
            <li> I just got my new one</li>
            <li> And of course if you have super dry skin</li>
            <li> I would recommend warming up the fabric first if possible</li>
            <li> Even if you have a significant other.</li>
            <li> My back itched from dry skin all winter long as I could not apply lotion on my own</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of how this product would work, but the non-absorbent fabric is perfect.</li>
            <li> Although they are securely attached, they stretch to far making it a little awarkward to use.</li>
            <li> I dance in ballroom dance competitions and since I am very pasty-pale-skinned, I have to put self-tanner lotion all over, including my back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, yet doesn&#x27;t absorb the lotion.</li>
            <li> If you have a sewing machine, save yourself some $ and buy some soft vinyl (perhaps oilcloth), sew the edges together and add handles.  </li>
            <li> and I am completely moisturized.  </li>
            <li> This really helps me put moisture on my back.</li>
            <li> Not sure if a more liquid lotion would stay on the vinyl without dripping as you place the applicator on your back.  </li>
            <li> We have tried many different applicators to get at those hard to reach places, but nothing has worked well until we tried the body buddy.</li>
            <li> have enjoyed having a less dry and itchy back</li>
            <li> I like to use it all over, even on places that I can reach, it because although my hands are also dry, too much lotion makes them greasy and slippery.</li>
            <li> i use this for my tanning lotions and mousses and it works very well to get your rear shoulders and inner back.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, constantly struggeling with rashes.  </li>
            <li> But it seems well made and will hold up, and if you get the dry itchy skin on the back, it&#x27;s worth the couple extra bucks.</li>
            <li> My back feels as though a professional has applied moisturizer to it.  </li>
            <li> No waste; all product goes onto your back.</li>
            <li> too!&lt;br /&gt;It covers your back completely and where you need it.  </li>
            <li> Takes a few tries to get the hang of it, but after that, it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> The handles are elastic and can make it difficult to hit the exact place on your back but just use a scatter shot technique and it is fine.</li>
            <li> Not much to say except that this is a simple idea that really works.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> (partly because I can only move my right shoulder a little).  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers are right about the straps being too loose-</li>
            <li> Every once in a while, I quickly wash it in the sink with a little shampoo and hang to dry.</li>
            <li> It not only serves its purpose for putting lotion on my dry, itchy back, but the vinyl is very soft and soothing.  </li>
            <li> I had started with the long brush where you add lotion inside, it worked somewhat but after a time, the lotion got all caked up &amp; the inside hard to clean</li>
            <li> Too bad because, before that happened, I also bought one as a birthday present for a friend since I loved it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use it to apply regular lotion to my back when my skin gets dry.</li>
            <li> This is better than no help at all, but it is difficult to get the cream or lotion to stay on the produce without slipping off before you get it over and onto your back.</li>
            <li> This is not a major issue</li>
            <li> Folds up small to fit in a small space like luggage for traveling too.</li>
            <li> My only complaint with this is that the handles are too elastic and stretch too much.  </li>
            <li> Living alone and not being double-jointed, I suffered for years from dry spots on my back.  </li>
            <li> like I do you really have very few options other than the Body Buddy.  </li>
            <li> The winter makes my skin so itchy and dry.  </li>
            <li> Applied cream unevenly to the back and left blobs in places that I had to remove by hand.</li>
            <li> I do not use this every single day</li>
            <li> I think because the surface that makes contact with your back is slight textured -- and it HAS to be textured to hold the lotion --</li>
            <li> I put a blob of Aveeno lotion on the strip (any brand will do), move it around a little, then flop it over onto my back.  </li>
            <li> I apply the lotion to the Body Buddy and then smear it a little with my hands before applying it to my back.  </li>
            <li> Something like this should last at least a year with regular use without the vinyl cracking.</li>
            <li> and I also smeared the lotion in the center before using it.</li>
            <li> I use a rather thick lotion; apply it in a few spots in the middle of the applicator; grab it with both hands, maneuver to my back and start pulling back and forth.</li>
            <li> I struggled for years with little applicators attached to long handles.  </li>
            <li> - I must definitely recommend it to all who have dry skin &amp; those hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> Theres not many applicators out there for applying cream to your back.</li>
            <li> and I did not want to be without this extremely practical item.  </li>
            <li> your back and hard to reach areas lotioned up with ease.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works well for what it is supposed to do- put lotion on the hard to reach spots on your back.</li>
            <li> While some reviewers have complained about the elastic straps, I actually like them.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s just a little cold when you put it on your back if you live in a cooler climate or are in an air-conditioned room)</li>
            <li> No more dry itchy skin that I can&#x27;t reach to scratch!</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but it does the trick and should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and have difficult time reaching some parts on my back.</li>
            <li> Run from this product, it is a scam product, it does not work, does not hold its shape, rolls up into a thread like form as you pull it back and forth across your back, you will kick yourself if you order this product, and the price is ridiculous for this lousy piece of dog-dung, Amazon should be ashamed of itself for even allowing this product to be purchased thru their site, the trouble it takes to re-package and return is not worth it, AND THA&#x27;S WHAT THEY ARE COUNTING ON, they had to have known this does not work</li>
            <li> Before I got this applicator, it used to take hours of painstaking reaching and the tanner ended up all streaky and uneven.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble applying lotion</li>
            <li> I can now reach the spots I was missing.</li>
            <li> If not, enjoy the Body Buddy...</li>
            <li> Every winter I have such a horrible problem with dry skin on my upper back because I cannot moisturize it.</li>
            <li> They usually didn&#x27;t get the lotion where I needed it or broke after a few months.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin all the time, but winter is the worse.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive for a piece of vinyl that spreads lotion on your back.</li>
            <li> When this happens, I&#x27;m not sure if the side with the lotion is facing in or out.  </li>
            <li> No more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line:Great idea, but disappointing after only a few months of use.</li>
            <li> It folds compactly, and hardly takes up any space.  </li>
            <li> so I have been looking for something that would put lotion on my hard to reach places, this does it SO well.  </li>
            <li> NO MORE!  </li>
            <li> Really slick!</li>
            <li> They were less expensive, but what&#x27;s the use of that if they don&#x27;t work?</li>
            <li> if:  (1) it were a bit shorter, (2) each side of the the applicator was a different color.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a vinyl-type material, which is a little cold to start with, but warms up with your body heat.  </li>
            <li> and I hated to constantly have to call my husband to do it.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid the vinyl would be hard, but it&#x27;s not at all!  </li>
            <li> Sadly I wore it out.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the stretchy straps must go!  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this when it arrived.</li>
            <li> so there are no lines or bad spots  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was a little skeptical of how this product would work, but the non-absorbent fabric is perfect. I would recommend warming up the fabric first if possible (it&#x27;s just a little cold when you put it on your back if you live in a cooler climate or are in an air-conditioned room) and I also smeared the lotion in the center before using it. It worked great! There weren&#x27;t any areas on my back where I felt the lotion didn&#x27;t get rubbed in well. Afterwards I wiped it off and put it away. Hurray for smart products!</li>
            <li> I dance in ballroom dance competitions and since I am very pasty-pale-skinned, I have to put self-tanner lotion all over, including my back. Before I got this applicator, it used to take hours of painstaking reaching and the tanner ended up all streaky and uneven. With this applicator, it takes literally FIVE MINUTES for a very even, smooth self-tan that reaches all across my back. The right tools make a HUGE difference! :)</li>
            <li> I paid more for this than some other lotion applicators, but it is worth every penny!  For the first time, I am able to moisturize all over my back.  The winter makes my skin so itchy and dry.  I have a lot of trouble applying lotion (partly because I can only move my right shoulder a little).  This is fast, easy, and effective.  I even travel with it.  It folds compactly, and hardly takes up any space.  The elastic loops look like they might stretch out, but I don&#x27;t use them... I just hold the ends.  The lotion doesn&#x27;t absorb into the fabric at all.  Every once in a while, the applicator needs a quick wipe.  I love it!! EDITED........ This is the 4th winter I&#x27;ve been using this applicator.  It has held up very nicely over time.  Granted... I do not use this every single day and I don&#x27;t use the elastic loops, but I just thought I&#x27;d share that it&#x27;s still getting the job done!</li>
            <li> The Body Buddy is an excellent product for people who want an easy and effective way to apply liquids, foams, or lotions to any part of their bodies that are difficult to reach.It is truly non-absorbent, easy to store (I keep mine on the door knob of the bathroom), and a simple,inexpensive answer to a universal challenge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to have something that soothes dry skin in the middle of my back.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the handles didn&#x27;t stretch.  Not perfect, but it does the trick and should last a long time.</li>
            <li> The elastic hand grips hinder the application process. Non-elastic would change my rating to 5*s I use Albolene I can&#x27;t imagine how to use a liquid without it spilling off the applicator.</li>
            <li> i use this for my tanning lotions and mousses and it works very well to get your rear shoulders and inner back. i have used it many times with great results for self tanning!</li>
            <li> I works so well!! I can now reach the spots I was missing. I was afraid the vinyl would be hard, but it&#x27;s not at all!  My lotion goes on smoothly and pretty evenly. I love that it doesn&#x27;t absorb the lotion. Elastic handles work well, esp. when I&#x27;m switching shoulders. And it&#x27;s very easy to clean. Every once in a while, I quickly wash it in the sink with a little shampoo and hang to dry. So glad I found this!</li>
            <li> Works well enough for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> i use this to put Vanicream lotion or Eucerin cream on my back.  I do seem to go through a lot more lotion when I use it.  I think because the surface that makes contact with your back is slight textured -- and it HAS to be textured to hold the lotion -- not all the lotion you put on it actually makes it onto your skin.  Perfectly logical.  Not really a complaint.  And of course if you have super dry skin like I do you really have very few options other than the Body Buddy.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve strugged with moisturizing my back and have tried several of the \\&quot;back scrubber\\&quot; types of lotion applicators. They usually didn&#x27;t get the lotion where I needed it or broke after a few months. They were less expensive, but what&#x27;s the use of that if they don&#x27;t work? The Body Buddy is perfect! I don&#x27;t even mind the stretchy straps. I just hold the ends while I use it. The vinyl doesn&#x27;t feel like vinyl at all. It&#x27;s soft, yet doesn&#x27;t absorb the lotion. The Body Buddy is also very easy to clean. It says machine washable, but I wash it in the sink with mild soap and warm water and hang it to dry.</li>
            <li> I have been seeking something for awhile. After many sunburns on my back, I am so happy to find this. Allows for easy application of sunscreen. Other reviewers are right about the straps being too loose- I need to really grab the ends of the actual band...but even with that I still love body buddy.</li>
            <li> Works as promised. A bit expensive for a piece of vinyl that spreads lotion on your back. But it seems well made and will hold up, and if you get the dry itchy skin on the back, it&#x27;s worth the couple extra bucks. I have not tried the lotion pad style applicators.</li>
            <li> Works very nicely.  I live alone and had to apply prescription creams and ointments to my back and this thing was simply amazing.  It cleans up very easily also.  It is made of a soft vinyl, but at first I thought it was soft leather.  A must have for applying creams to the back and have no one to help you out.</li>
            <li> Not much to say except that this is a simple idea that really works.&lt;br /&gt;Keep your back and hard to reach areas lotioned up with ease.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, constantly struggeling with rashes.  This has been a life saver for my back.  Very easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li> This is better than no help at all, but it is difficult to get the cream or lotion to stay on the produce without slipping off before you get it over and onto your back.</li>
            <li> I use this for applying self-tanner and the occasional lotion. It&#x27;s really good. I swear.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone. Even if you have a significant other.</li>
            <li> Applied cream unevenly to the back and left blobs in places that I had to remove by hand.</li>
            <li> I live alone and i needed to put lotion on my back  and this applicator worked great and solved my problem.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my wife who applies several creams or lotions.  The product is well made but also well overpriced.  If you have a sewing machine, save yourself some $ and buy some soft vinyl (perhaps oilcloth), sew the edges together and add handles.  If not, enjoy the Body Buddy...they both will do a good job.  No residue is apparent after application, but if you&#x27;re a clean freak, wipe with a warm cloth after each use.</li>
            <li> This is the best invention for dry back skin ever.  I struggled for years with little applicators attached to long handles.  NO MORE!  I put a blob of Aveeno lotion on the strip (any brand will do), move it around a little, then flop it over onto my back.  The lotion is quickly all over my back and I am completely moisturized.  Magic!  My back feels as though a professional has applied moisturizer to it.  I wash it with a load in my washing machine, then wipe it dry with a cloth (another 30 seconds at most).  F. Parker</li>
            <li> This works much better than the long-handled lotion applicator I had been using. With this, you can really get around the curves of the back from the top, bottom and to the sides with no problem and it washes really. I use it to apply self-tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this when it arrived. It does have a vinyl-like texture to it and I was expecting more of a sponge BUT I tried it and it works Great!  I don&#x27;t know why or how but EVERY time I apply tanning lotion to my back, back of my arms etc it is PERFECT!  When I use the spongy applicator mitt it is hit or miss.  I guess this vinyl-like substance is better at rubbing the lotion in without globbing it is spots.  It rolls it smoothly so there are no lines or bad spots  I want to find an applicator mitt made of the same thing!!  I recommend trying it.  I also use it to apply regular lotion to my back when my skin gets dry. I LOVE THIS THING!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Easy to use and easy to clean</li>
            <li> Works pretty good but takes a little practice. The handles are elastic and can make it difficult to hit the exact place on your back but just use a scatter shot technique and it is fine. I use it for pain relief creams and sunblock lotions an it works well.</li>
            <li> This applicator did not work well at all.  The surface is smooth material, so when you apply the lotion it runs.&lt;br /&gt;Will have to look for something else.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  My back itched from dry skin all winter long as I could not apply lotion on my own and I hated to constantly have to call my husband to do it.  I now use it after every shower and my back has stopped itching.  Not sure if a more liquid lotion would stay on the vinyl without dripping as you place the applicator on your back.  I use a rather thick lotion; apply it in a few spots in the middle of the applicator; grab it with both hands, maneuver to my back and start pulling back and forth. Nothing drips; change hands and rub some more to get both sides completely.  The vinyl is soft, but not absorbent, so it is very easy to wipe down or wash. I do find that the vinyl applicator can twist a bit as you apply the lotion or maneuver it around to each side of your back.  When this happens, I&#x27;m not sure if the side with the lotion is facing in or out.  This is not a major issue but I&#x27;d like to suggest that each side of the Body Buddy be a different color so you could always know that you have lotion facing toward you back.  I would easily give it five stars if:  (1) it were a bit shorter, (2) each side of the the applicator was a different color.  Still, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This item is great.  Use any lotion you like, washes up easy.  Makes a great gift too. Folds up small to fit in a small space like luggage for traveling too.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Finally I can apply lotion and sunscreen to my entire back with ease. The material is great as the product does not absorb into it. No waste; all product goes onto your back. Easy to clean; just wipe it down with a mild soap and rinse. It is very well constructed. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the elastic handles. Although they are securely attached, they stretch to far making it a little awarkward to use. I just hold it by the ends; problem solved. Shorter elastic would be better or even a different non-elastic handle. That being said, all in all this is a great little helper. I recommend it to everyone and I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have dry skin all the time, but winter is the worse. With this I can apply lotion to my entire back easily. No more dry itchy skin that I can&#x27;t reach to scratch! The Body Buddy is soft and easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li> This product is a lifesaver.  I live alone with nobody to help me but lotion on my back and this comes in handy.  It works great too!&lt;br /&gt;It covers your back completely and where you need it.  Easy to put on and clean too.  I am going to buy some as gifts also.&lt;br /&gt;This is well worth the purchase</li>
            <li> ingenious little invention, purchased it for tanning lotion prior to my vacation,,, love it my back was as tan as my front and it works like a charm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviewers.  Generally, this is a fabulous product.  It not only serves its purpose for putting lotion on my dry, itchy back, but the vinyl is very soft and soothing.  Unfortunately, the stretchy straps must go!  For the price and the way it&#x27;s used, this product should have strong, non-stretch rope straps. I, too, hold the ends of the vinyl instead of the straps to get the job done.  I&#x27;d give 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the straps...</li>
            <li> Good product, but like others, I think the straps should not stretch.</li>
            <li> My only complaint with this is that the handles are too elastic and stretch too much.  It&#x27;s easy enough to use without using the elastic handles and it spreads lotion on my back pretty darn well.</li>
            <li> I got a body buddy years ago and loved it. Sadly I wore it out. I just got my new one and it is AWESOME! I love how I can put lotion ALL over my back all by myself. I apply suntan lotion in a snap and don&#x27;t have to have sandy hands all over me. Everyone should have one of these!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and love it. Like most people I have dry skin in the winter and of course your back is the hardest spot to reach with lotion. This comes through 100%. It&#x27;s made out of a vinyl so it won&#x27;t absorb any lotion and help to spread it all over and has handles that stretch to allow you to move it back and forth to apply lotion. I highly recommend getting one.</li>
            <li> Every winter my skin gets so dry and itchy, and I&#x27;m always trying to find a good way to moisturize my back.  Now I have Body Buddy, and it&#x27;s great!  I&#x27;ve washed it in the W/D and turns out fine.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Bought one of these around 15 years ago and loved it. I finally had to get rid of it and was so happy to find another one. I have extremely dry skin and have difficult time reaching some parts on my back. This applicator is just fantastic. Sure, a little bit on the pricey side but well worth it! So happy to have found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I am on my second one. Ordered another. I truly love it. Why I need it? I do not have much flexibility in one arm. Trust me, you will like it.</li>
            <li> Works well for what it is supposed to do- put lotion on the hard to reach spots on your back. It is really nothing much more than a long strip of vinyl cloth. I would think you could find something in a sewing shop and make it yourself fairly cheaply. However, I don&#x27;t sew and was not about to figure out where to get the material. I think it is well made and will last. I&#x27;ve had it a month and very much have enjoyed having a less dry and itchy back</li>
            <li> This lotion applicator works really well!  It&#x27;s a vinyl-type material, which is a little cold to start with, but warms up with your body heat.  I like to use it all over, even on places that I can reach, it because although my hands are also dry, too much lotion makes them greasy and slippery. TMI? :)</li>
            <li> This is the greatest product ever for easy, thorough application of lotion to my back!  Easy to use.  You can use the stretch straps or just hold the ends.  Cleans up easily by pulling the buddy across your thigh.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Living alone I find this is a perfect way to apply lotion to my back.  The plastic is easy to use and application is simple.&lt;br /&gt;A very good value...</li>
            <li> Living alone and not being double-jointed, I suffered for years from dry spots on my back.  No more.  This applicator is effective, easy to use and conveniently folds into a corner of my suitcase.  I wish I&#x27;d found this years ago!</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  It allows me to effectively lotion my back from the shoulders down with almost no effort.  It is a rather unattractive color, but that minor flaw was quickly forgiven when I realized how well it works.  I apply the lotion to the Body Buddy and then smear it a little with my hands before applying it to my back.  It is easy to swipe the Body Buddy back and forth until my back has been thoroughly covered and the lotion is completely absorbed.  At first blush, the elastic handles seemed like an inconvenience, but I do notice the stretch helps when changing direction as I alternate between my right and left hands taking the high side.  I simply grip the handles closer when applying lotion and relax my grip to the ends of the handles when changing position. I&#x27;m happy to have discovered this product on Amazon in different colors and I&#x27;ve given them as gifts to close friends. All in all, the Body Buddy is easy to manipulate, easy to clean up, and is a wonderful aid for those of us who either prefer or need to apply lotion to our own backs.</li>
            <li> For those of us who are flexibility-challenged, this is a great tool to apply lotion or medication on your back.  Takes a few tries to get the hang of it, but after that, it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> Once I ordered this for myself, I&#x27;ve been ordering them as gifts for anyone I know that uses body lotion! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was hoping it would make lotioning my back (especially between my shoulder blades) easier.  What I DIDN&#x27;T expect was that it would FEEL GOOD!  With just a couple of pulls back &amp; forth, the lotion warms and it massages your back &amp; feels GREAT! I used to dread lotioning my back &amp; shoulders &amp; now I look forward to it!</li>
            <li> We love the body buddy lotion applicator. We have tried many different applicators to get at those hard to reach places, but nothing has worked well until we tried the body buddy. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a quick and effective way to spread lotion on your back! It really works!!</li>
            <li> Works well and gets the lotion on my back without me bothering anyone else to do it.  The only thing that would be better is if it were heated.  ;)</li>
            <li> Product is good. After a year it&#x27;s is starting to rip. I would buy another one</li>
            <li> Super product for applying lotions to ones back.  Have used this product for years and it is durable and effective</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Body Buddy for seven months and loved it--until recently.  Though it is a perfect idea to moisturize one&#x27;s back, the vinyl started cracking on each edge only five months after I got it, which means it is a bit scratchy when using now,  Not particularly comfortable. Too bad because, before that happened, I also bought one as a birthday present for a friend since I loved it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:Great idea, but disappointing after only a few months of use. Something like this should last at least a year with regular use without the vinyl cracking.</li>
            <li> Run from this product, it is a scam product, it does not work, does not hold its shape, rolls up into a thread like form as you pull it back and forth across your back, you will kick yourself if you order this product, and the price is ridiculous for this lousy piece of dog-dung, Amazon should be ashamed of itself for even allowing this product to be purchased thru their site, the trouble it takes to re-package and return is not worth it, AND THA&#x27;S WHAT THEY ARE COUNTING ON, they had to have known this does not work that&#x27;s why I label it A SCAM PRODUCT, this is legally stealing money from consumers......</li>
            <li> I needed something to apply gels and lotions to my back, and this is a satisfactory solution.  I had to order a second, because the straps will stretch out, and the plastic will crack.  Since I need to apply a prescription lotion, I&#x27;ll probably be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with the straps.  It works as advertised land I can at last put lotion on my back</li>
            <li> Body Buddy works great when you live alone.</li>
            <li> This really helps me put moisture on my back. The straps stretch out a bit but it covers well ..</li>
            <li> Theres not many applicators out there for applying cream to your back. This gets the job done and is easy to wipe clean and sanitize. Non porous.</li>
            <li> This item works as advertised. Smooth and easy to use and my backside sez: U da MAN! Three more words required.</li>
            <li> I love this! I use baby oil from a spray bottle to get my back, and it works well! Really slick! The oil doesn&#x27;t run off the applicator like I thought it would. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with itchy back since I started using this.</li>
            <li> It does the trick, but I agree with most reviewers about the elastic handles. And I also agree with the reviewer who said it uses a lot of lotion. It really does! But it&#x27;s better than most things out there. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had started with the long brush where you add lotion inside, it worked somewhat but after a time, the lotion got all caked up &amp; the inside hard to clean so I have been looking for something that would put lotion on my hard to reach places, this does it SO well.  It is SO easy to apply, SO easy to use &amp; SO easy to clean - amazing, so glad someone came up with this product - I must definitely recommend it to all who have dry skin &amp; those hard to reach places.  Truly amazing product.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement purchase.  I am actually still using my original, but the straps are going to give out one of these days and I did not want to be without this extremely practical item.  Original purchase is over six years old, so this is a very durable product.  I have found it absolutely ideal for applying lotion to my back.  I have also used it to apply sun block.  Do I wish these were cheaper?  Without a doubt, but considering how long this has lasted, I am well satisfied.  If you have someone to tend to your back, you might not need this.  If, like me, you don&#x27;t, I am sure you would be as happy with this product as I am.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Every winter I have such a horrible problem with dry skin on my upper back because I cannot moisturize it. This product solved that problem for me. I love the fact that it is &#x27;Made In The USA&#x27;. It is a quality product &amp; comes attractively packaged. It would make a nice gift. While some reviewers have complained about the elastic straps, I actually like them. They provide a bit of give and security knowing that I won&#x27;t accidentally drop the product on the bathroom floor. I also prefer to use a thinner lotion with it. I pump out 3 squirts of Sauve lotion onto it and spread it around with my fingers. It never drips. I highly recommend this!</li>
