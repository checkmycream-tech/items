            <li>This product works amazing.  </li>
            <li>Nice skin, that comes from harmful ingredients-</li>
            <li>This product is extremely effective.  </li>
            <li>I use wonderful products that I buy from Sephora, such as Clinique and Murad.  </li>
            <li>I even saw better results from Loreal face wash that I purchased on a whim from Target.  </li>
            <li>all bottled up in most mainstream beauty products?</li>
            <li>Fantastic product !  </li>
            <li>While it was an ok cleanser, I did not notice any fading of my brown spots.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, have used it for two years.  </li>
            <li>The prices are better and you receive it quicker.</li>
            <li>I am not a R and F rep. but am very familiar with the products.</li>
            <li>I personally use Reverse and have had incredible results.  </li>
            <li>They have kept around this long, and proven to be effective for many years! :))</li>
            <li>She said to give it about 2 weeks (from when I started) and it should look good as new.  </li>
            <li>I was better off before and hope this quickly goes away.  </li>
            <li>it can&#x27;t be a few times a week, and you have to stay out of the sun as best</li>
            <li>Just give natural alternatives a fair, fighting chance.</li>
            <li>I had been looking forward to trying out this product for a couple of years and was so excited to begin using it.</li>
            <li>Rodan and Fields is a direct selling company with amazing products.  </li>
            <li>Is this true?  </li>
            <li>: made my skin noticeably softer with fewer breakouts; the sunscreen is excellent - lightweight and yet strong protection; the exfoliating wash is outstanding, it actually feels like a gentle sandpaper with enough abrasion to actually exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would make a few brown spots that I have on my cheekbones better, and now I&#x27;m cursed by my own vanity.  </li>
            <li>Why not try the usually cheaper, often diy ingredients that our great grandparents would&#x27;ve used?...</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone wanting a younger, more youthful look.</li>
            <li>Selling R and F online is not illegal.  </li>
            <li>However, if you are interested in the products, I suggest you purchase from a consultant associated with the company.  </li>
            <li>She said that it would considerably lighten the spots on my face and provide noticably smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>The first sign was scaly places and spots that did no</li>
            <li>Firstly, just try the natural, tested, and true methods-</li>
            <li>Location makes a difference: The closer to the equator you live, the more likely you are to have actinic keratoses.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Although, I cannot prove it, I believe that Rodan and Fields Reverse Regimen may have been a contributing factor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to anyone &amp; everyone!</li>
            <li>The products are very &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34; and I believe a scam.  </li>
            <li>Nothing, aside from paying for expensive laser treatments, will get rid of it 100%, but this made an incredible difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Fades my brown spots and brightens my skin better than any other product I have tried over the years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this regime consistently as directed for over a month now and the spots on my face have lightened considerably.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve half many compliments since using this product.</li>
            <li>These are the main ingredients.</li>
            <li>My consultant said that is normal and is a sign that the product is working.  </li>
            <li>and I now can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>If you are interested in the products, please contact an independent consultant to order.</li>
            <li>She said that my old skin is being replaced with the new skin, which is why it is flaking off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m embarrassed to go out like this and people from work keep commenting on my &amp;#34;sunburn&amp;#34; and how dry my face is right now.  </li>
            <li>guarantee you get directly from Rodan + Fields.</li>
            <li>It is against company policies and procedures as a direct selling company</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;People with a fair complexion, blond or red hair, and blue, green or grey eyes</li>
            <li>(Identify Your Skin Type) have a high likelihood of developing one or more of these common precancers if they spend time in the sun and live long enough.</li>

            <li> The police will not arrest you.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week now and my face is dry, flaky and red.  </li>
            <li> This advice lasted until after the 60 day return window was up, then I was basically told I was out of luck and would just have to eat the $150 I had spent on the regimen, despite the fact that during my multiple calls I was assured that the return policy would not be enforced if I had been in contact with the &amp;#34;dermatologists&amp;#34; and had been trying to acclimate my skin.</li>
            <li> this did nothing to reduce the age spots; really expensive; my boyfriend would not kiss me for an hour or so after applying the toner &amp; brightening lotions because they have a strong bitter taste.  </li>
            <li> I am only using the product once a day, every other day and am about to start week 2 where I just use it once a day.</li>
            <li> It did not make me peal or dry out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s brighter, dark spots are fading, pores are smaller.</li>
            <li> Upon the third time I used it, I began noticing dime sized scaly dry patches on my normally slightly oily face.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so tight from all the dryness/flakiness that it actually hurts.  </li>
            <li> No wonder, so many people have bad skin and hormone disruption.</li>
            <li> Unlike other skin brightening products, this did not burn, itch, or cause my skin to peel or break out or have any adverse reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was also advised to space out the usage to every other day.</li>
            <li> Now, with just a touch of concealer, the spots are not recognizable.  </li>
            <li> The products are less expensive (especially if you choose to become a PC) and there is a 60 day money back guarantee when purchased from an Independent Consultant.</li>
            <li> Beauty is not worth sacrificing safety...</li>
            <li> I hate that it has so many chemicals.  </li>
            <li> In less than a month, I could see a noticable brightening of my complexion and lessening of discoloration.  </li>
            <li> Results are seen after less than 4 weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding things that work for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Its a waste of money and does deliver results that are promised.  </li>
            <li> I still have brown spots, uneven skin, and blackheads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering with a few sun spots on my face, and had tried everything.  </li>
            <li> I wish someone had told me before I bought this product that this company is a joke (the same people behind the Proactiv Acne Regimen) and their products are nothing but overpriced toxic waste!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Obagi and I at least saw somewhat results with that.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I will not buy this again because it was not effective in reducing brown spots.</li>
            <li> Regarding the previous interview, there is a difference between illegal and against company policy.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could give these products a negative star!</li>
            <li> I used it again, and the patches became worse.  </li>
            <li> All known to be skin irritants and unhealthy for anyone.</li>
            <li> Big Pharma and Man-made crap were even invented.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this product, especially considering how expensive it</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this product, especially considering how expensive it was.</li>
            <li> It is illegal to sell Rodan + Fields Dermatologists products online.</li>
            <li> Wtf?!</li>
            <li> Holy crap</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding things that work for my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried Obagi and I at least saw somewhat results with that.  I didn&#x27;t notice anything different with this product except that my skin broke out uncontrollably.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 37 year old white girl with sensitive skin looking to get rid of some minor brown age spots.  I used this for 3+ months as directed.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: this did nothing to reduce the age spots; really expensive; my boyfriend would not kiss me for an hour or so after applying the toner &amp; brightening lotions because they have a strong bitter taste.  No kissing!!!!  Holy crap I&#x27;d rather have age spots that miss kisses!&lt;br /&gt;PROS: made my skin noticeably softer with fewer breakouts; the sunscreen is excellent - lightweight and yet strong protection; the exfoliating wash is outstanding, it actually feels like a gentle sandpaper with enough abrasion to actually exfoliate.  Unlike other skin brightening products, this did not burn, itch, or cause my skin to peel or break out or have any adverse reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I will not buy this again because it was not effective in reducing brown spots.</li>
            <li> I love this products!  It does exactly what it says.  I&#x27;ve used products prescribed and didn&#x27;t get the results that I got from Rodan and Fields Reverse Regimen.  I have recommended this products to others because of the results are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D.Y.</li>
            <li> Great product. I decided to join the team &amp; sell it myself. Highly recommend this product to anyone &amp; everyone!</li>
            <li> I wish I could give these products a negative star! Its a waste of money and does deliver results that are promised.  The products are very &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34; and I believe a scam.  R&amp;F is ripping off all of its customers especially with forcing you to get on &amp;#34;autoship&amp;#34;.  If you decline the &amp;#34;autoshipments&amp;#34; you do not receive any discounts.  Not to mention the outrageous shipping and handling.  I use wonderful products that I buy from Sephora, such as Clinique and Murad.  I even saw better results from Loreal face wash that I purchased on a whim from Target.  Stop making these ladies rich!!!! The products SUCK!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve half many compliments since using this product. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a younger, more youthful look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the products for about ten days.  Upon the third time I used it, I began noticing dime sized scaly dry patches on my normally slightly oily face.  My skin is literally peeling.  I used it again, and the patches became worse.  My skin not only was rather pink and even red in places, but I have suddenly developed dozens of pimples.  I hate that it has so many chemicals.  I thought this would make a few brown spots that I have on my cheekbones better, and now I&#x27;m cursed by my own vanity.  I was better off before and hope this quickly goes away.  I&#x27;m back to my all natural facial products.</li>
            <li> Rodan + Fields products can only be sold by direct independent consultants. Not by companies. If you are ordering R+F products from a company, you are not guaranteed the quality product nor the 60 day money back guarantee you get directly from Rodan + Fields. If you are interested in the products, please contact an independent consultant to order.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 months and have not noticed a difference at all. I still have brown spots, uneven skin, and blackheads. I contact r+f to try and get my $$ back and they never would respond to my email. I would never purchase these products again. I will stick to Obagi or Skinceuticals.</li>
            <li> This product works amazing.  The key is to use it morning and night, and to avoid the sun!  It took away my dullness and lightened my sun pigmentation spots.  Nothing, aside from paying for expensive laser treatments, will get rid of it 100%, but this made an incredible difference in my skin.  Key is, morning and night routine...it can&#x27;t be a few times a week, and you have to stay out of the sun as best you can!  Sun damage will just keep happening if you don&#x27;t avoid it!  This product works!</li>
            <li> It has now been several months I have used it every day as directed, but I do not see any difference in my skin. I am so disappointed in this product, especially considering how expensive it</li>
            <li> Sulfate, alcohol, parabens, yellow # ...Wtf?! These are the main ingredients. All known to be skin irritants and unhealthy for anyone. Who cares if it says dermatologist tested? Nice skin, that comes from harmful ingredients- all bottled up in most mainstream beauty products? No thank-you. Beauty is not worth sacrificing safety...&lt;br /&gt;Our skin is our largest organ and absorbs everything! No wonder, so many people have bad skin and hormone disruption. Just give natural alternatives a fair, fighting chance. Why not try the usually cheaper, often diy ingredients that our great grandparents would&#x27;ve used?...&lt;br /&gt;Before Big Pharma and Man-made crap were even invented. Firstly, just try the natural, tested, and true methods- They have kept around this long, and proven to be effective for many years! :))</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week now and my face is dry, flaky and red.  My consultant said that is normal and is a sign that the product is working.  She said that my old skin is being replaced with the new skin, which is why it is flaking off.  She said to give it about 2 weeks (from when I started) and it should look good as new.  Is this true?  I&#x27;m just worried that I am damaging my skin!  My skin is so tight from all the dryness/flakiness that it actually hurts.  I&#x27;m embarrassed to go out like this and people from work keep commenting on my &amp;#34;sunburn&amp;#34; and how dry my face is right now.  lol  I am only using the product once a day, every other day and am about to start week 2 where I just use it once a day.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely effective.  It is a bit pricy, which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  In less than a month, I could see a noticable brightening of my complexion and lessening of discoloration.  Regarding the previous interview, there is a difference between illegal and against company policy.  Selling R and F online is not illegal.  The police will not arrest you.  It is against company policy, but it seems to me that once someone has bought a product, what they do with it next is not up to the company that sold it to them.  I am not a R and F rep. but am very familiar with the products.</li>
            <li> I have used creams prescribed by dermatologists and nothing has worked like this. It did not make me peal or dry out.</li>
            <li> Rodan and Fields is a direct selling company with amazing products.  I personally use Reverse and have had incredible results.  However, if you are interested in the products, I suggest you purchase from a consultant associated with the company.  The products are less expensive (especially if you choose to become a PC) and there is a 60 day money back guarantee when purchased from an Independent Consultant.</li>
            <li> My skin would never tolerate the product. I don&#x27;t consider myself to have overly sensitive skin, but when using this product I had red bumps and blemishes all over my face. I kept in contact with the consultant, as well as the company product hotline and was advised multiple times to take a break from the regimen, let my skin recover, and begin again. I was also advised to space out the usage to every other day. This advice lasted until after the 60 day return window was up, then I was basically told I was out of luck and would just have to eat the $150 I had spent on the regimen, despite the fact that during my multiple calls I was assured that the return policy would not be enforced if I had been in contact with the &amp;#34;dermatologists&amp;#34; and had been trying to acclimate my skin. In addition to all the issues the product caused me to have with my skin, I never saw ANY EVIDENCE of lightening. I wish someone had told me before I bought this product that this company is a joke (the same people behind the Proactiv Acne Regimen) and their products are nothing but overpriced toxic waste!! SAVE YOUR SKIN, DO NOT USE THESE PRODUCTS!!!</li>
            <li> Recommended by a friend and I now can&#x27;t live without it.  Fades my brown spots and brightens my skin better than any other product I have tried over the years.  Just have to be sure and use that sun screen!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering with a few sun spots on my face, and had tried everything.  A friend of mine recommended this line from Rodan + Fields.  She said that it would considerably lighten the spots on my face and provide noticably smooth skin.  I&#x27;ve been using this regime consistently as directed for over a month now and the spots on my face have lightened considerably.  Now, with just a touch of concealer, the spots are not recognizable.  I will definitely recommend this product to friends and family!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product !  Really helps lighten the dark spots.  Must use product.  Results are seen after less than 4 weeks</li>
            <li> My face is covered with keratosis after six months of use of Rodan and Fields Reverse Regimen. The first sign was scaly places and spots that did no heal.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;People with a fair complexion, blond or red hair, and blue, green or grey eyes (Identify Your Skin Type) have a high likelihood of developing one or more of these common precancers if they spend time in the sun and live long enough. Location makes a difference: The closer to the equator you live, the more likely you are to have actinic keratoses.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Although, I cannot prove it, I believe that Rodan and Fields Reverse Regimen may have been a contributing factor.</li>
            <li> While it was an ok cleanser, I did not notice any fading of my brown spots.  I&#x27;ll not purchase again and will stick to proactive.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results of this product. I can tell a difference in my skin. It&#x27;s brighter, dark spots are fading, pores are smaller. Will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It is illegal to sell Rodan + Fields Dermatologists products online. It is against company policies and procedures as a direct selling company</li>
            <li> Love this product, have used it for two years.  Works great, also the hand care products are great.  I would suggest buying from a R&amp;F rep.  The prices are better and you receive it quicker.</li>
            <li> I had been looking forward to trying out this product for a couple of years and was so excited to begin using it. It has now been several months and I have used it every day as directed, but I do not see any difference in my skin. I am so disappointed in this product, especially considering how expensive it was.</li>
