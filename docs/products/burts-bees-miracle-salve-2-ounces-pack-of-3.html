            <li>Best decision I&#x27;ve ever made for my dreadies</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s very good for it.</li>
            <li>Good !</li>
            <li>and this is a great product for it.  </li>
            <li>Works great on the beard and hair.</li>
            <li>lol...</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>This product was listed on EWG.org -Environmental Working Grp&#x27;s website- as a very safe HAIR CONDITIONER.  </li>
            <li>My beard stays nicely conditioned and appears well groomed.</li>
            <li>Instructions say to warm up in palm of hand</li>
            <li>the very best for the very dryest desert in a drought conditions.</li>
            <li>This product Burt Bee&#x27;s is nice.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>and I feel it makes it more healthy.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products.  </li>
            <li>I wish more products had re-usable packaging like this.</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard from drying and keeps it more manageable.</li>
            <li>The Salve is not as grease as the day goes on, like most salve&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for my husband because someone said that it would help his beard be shiny and grow!</li>
            <li>Also excellent for dry hands... use this instead of using slimy lotions.</li>
            <li>:P Keep it natural.</li>
            <li>This product uses beeswax and olive oil primarily.  </li>
            <li>Great product - my wife uses it on her hands; I use it on my facial hair.</li>
            <li>The only issue is that it does not have a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Makes my beard soft, love this stuff!</li>
            <li>but as a hair conditioner it is too solid and does not dissolve easily even in warm water.</li>
            <li>We also use the Green Tea and Lemongrass hand soap by Burt&#x27;s Bees and it&#x27;s awesome with a light scent and does not dry out your hands.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I use it to tame my beard, and I love it!</li>
            <li>It has a very neutral smell and doesn&#x27;t interfere with the scent of my cologne or lotion products.</li>
            <li>This really is miracle salve.  </li>
            <li>Michigan winters are so drying, and this really works well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or it will be oily.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have much of a smell, which I prefer.  </li>
            <li>The grease does not absorb into the hair so you are really just greasing the hair not conditioning it.</li>
            <li>well it didn&#x27;t really do that</li>
            <li>On top if all the other uses, I.e. Hair, skin...</li>
            <li>so what I did was warmed in my finger tips, ran it down my dreads while finger rolling and applied heat with my hairdryer :)</li>
            <li>My beard is pretty big</li>
            <li>I use it on wounds and it is the most healing thing I&#x27;ve ever used and leaves the least amount of scarring.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW.</li>
            <li>Just a tiny bit really does do the job.</li>
            <li>price was the same as when i can find it locally, which is rarely</li>
            <li>but I put it on my dry skin and it has helped me so much.</li>
            <li>This does a good job of keeping down wild hairs without being hard like a gel product or rubbing off on my collar like other beard oils.</li>
            <li>I picked this stuff up for the first time in a little general store while on vacation.  </li>
            <li>The other brand I used - designed specifically for beards - was much greasier, and the greasiness in my beard would linger throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>This balm tames my rather wild beard and at the same time is absorbed much more quickly, not leaving behind a greasy mess.  </li>
            <li>If you use too much your hair winds up feeling greasy, so you almost have to use less.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It does not have enough hold to keep my beard flat.</li>
            <li> I also use it for the skin on the back of my hands and any dry patches the appear (Especially in winter when the heat dries out the house.)</li>
            <li> I use this every day on my long goatee beard.  </li>
            <li> It probably would get 5 stars or close as a salve for dry skin etc.</li>
            <li> I get really dry hands and feet</li>
            <li> well if the skin is really dry and itchy around the hair...just dont expect the hair to get moisture.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair or bad ends or flyaways, just a little of this stuff works like magic.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical that it would do much for my long curly hair.</li>
            <li> I apply it every night on hands and feet, especially in dry winter months.  </li>
            <li> have to disagree with a previous poster about (lack of) absorption.  </li>
            <li> When product is finished, the labels are removable which leaves a plain tin.  </li>
            <li> Went from frizzy to maintained in just a few mins!</li>

            <li> I find the Burt&#x27;s Bees balm to be a neater and much less expensive option.</li>
            <li> I have a course and very thick beard.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy $20+ cans of crap.</li>

            <li> I picked this stuff up for the first time in a little general store while on vacation.  I lent it to my mom and she never gave it back!  She used it on her skin and even her hair!  If you have dry hair or bad ends or flyaways, just a little of this stuff works like magic.  I bought a bunch of them for Christmas and used it as a stocking stuffer for all the ladies in my life.</li>
            <li> I have a course and very thick beard. This does a good job of keeping down wild hairs without being hard like a gel product or rubbing off on my collar like other beard oils. It has a very neutral smell and doesn&#x27;t interfere with the scent of my cologne or lotion products. I like this and will continue to use this stuff.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard soft, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I use it for relief of chemotherapy induced hand foot syndrome.  I think it would be perfect to prevent friction blisters while hiking.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy $20+ cans of crap. My beard stays nicely conditioned and appears well groomed. I also use it for the skin on the back of my hands and any dry patches the appear (Especially in winter when the heat dries out the house.) We also use the Green Tea and Lemongrass hand soap by Burt&#x27;s Bees and it&#x27;s awesome with a light scent and does not dry out your hands.</li>
            <li> My beard is pretty big and this is a great product for it.  It shines it up and I feel it makes it more healthy.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this to set my beard. It does not have enough hold to keep my beard flat.</li>
            <li> This really is miracle salve.  I keep a tin in 3 different rooms in the house, and one in my car.  Michigan winters are so drying, and this really works well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Been using this since my son was born which was 5 years ago. Works on all our bumps and bruises and even bug bites. Will continue using</li>
            <li> Good ! I always buy this for protecting hair and hands. It&#x27;s very good for it. I like it very much.</li>
            <li> This product uses beeswax and olive oil primarily.  I use this every day on my long goatee beard.  Helps keep it in order and controls the fly-aways.  Don&#x27;t use too much or it will be oily.  Also excellent for dry hands... use this instead of using slimy lotions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Caucasian woman and I pulled this out of my makeup box (Used to use it for my flyaways). I decided to give this a go on my dreadlocks (for the frizzy and dryness). Instructions say to warm up in palm of hand so what I did was warmed in my finger tips, ran it down my dreads while finger rolling and applied heat with my hairdryer :) Awesome results. Went from frizzy to maintained in just a few mins! Best decision I&#x27;ve ever made for my dreadies :P Keep it natural.</li>
            <li> I was using a more expensive beard wax/conditioner.  Then I read a suggestion to use this product.  Best decision ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to disagree with a previous poster about (lack of) absorption.  The other brand I used - designed specifically for beards - was much greasier, and the greasiness in my beard would linger throughout the day.  This balm tames my rather wild beard and at the same time is absorbed much more quickly, not leaving behind a greasy mess.  I find the Burt&#x27;s Bees balm to be a neater and much less expensive option.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products.  I apply it every night on hands and feet, especially in dry winter months.  I then follow it with some Burt&#x27;s Bees lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t really have much of a smell, which I prefer.  When product is finished, the labels are removable which leaves a plain tin.  I then wash thoroughly and then re-use it to store hair pins, safety pins, craft supplies, etc. I wish more products had re-usable packaging like this.</li>
            <li> This product was listed on EWG.org -Environmental Working Grp&#x27;s website- as a very safe HAIR CONDITIONER.  It does not work for that purpose.  It probably would get 5 stars or close as a salve for dry skin etc. but as a hair conditioner it is too solid and does not dissolve easily even in warm water.</li>
            <li> This product is great for everything!!!!! I use it on wounds and it is the most healing thing I&#x27;ve ever used and leaves the least amount of scarring. On top if all the other uses, I.e. Hair, skin...</li>
            <li> Works great on the beard and hair.</li>
            <li> Great product - my wife uses it on her hands; I use it on my facial hair.</li>
            <li> Miracle salve indeed! I initially bought this to treat my drum head and maybe use it on my lips and skin. I had no idea it could be used in hair until i received it. I was extremely skeptical that it would do much for my long curly hair. All I can say is WOW. This stuff is amazing! And it REALLY only takes a tiny bit. I&#x27;ve NEVER had a product say to use a tiny amount and it ended up being enough. Ever. Just a tiny bit really does do the job. If you use too much your hair winds up feeling greasy, so you almost have to use less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with Burt&#x27;s Bees products and I do like this miracle salve. I get really dry hands and feet and this seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> The best ointment for anything even the dog.</li>
            <li> the very best for the very dryest desert in a drought conditions. price was the same as when i can find it locally, which is rarely</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, and the price is right. Keeps my beard from drying and keeps it more manageable.</li>
            <li> I use it to tame my beard, and I love it! The only issue is that it does not have a pleasant smell. It smells like salve.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a leave in beard conditioner. It does not work for that purpose. The grease does not absorb into the hair so you are really just greasing the hair not conditioning it. However i think this works well if the skin is really dry and itchy around the hair...just dont expect the hair to get moisture. Also bc the grease does not absorb collared dress shirts will get it on them and need a thourogh cleaning when you wear it.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my husband because someone said that it would help his beard be shiny and grow! lol...well it didn&#x27;t really do that but I put it on my dry skin and it has helped me so much. We also put it on my daughter&#x27;s cradle cap and it has helped a lot too!</li>
            <li> This product Burt Bee&#x27;s is nice. The Salve is not as grease as the day goes on, like most salve&#x27;s. I have used Burt&#x27;s Bees products in the past and don&#x27;t know why I strayed from the path.</li>
