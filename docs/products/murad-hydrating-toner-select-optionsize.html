            <li>One of the best toners I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Now that its summer i stopped using the moisturizer and just use the toner and let me say my skin looks awesome.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good to my skin.</li>
            <li>it might be that something inside this product that I&#x27;m allergic to, or it&#x27;s just not so great to use for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a great smell, and my face does feel ...</li>
            <li>It is a great pick me up anytime</li>
            <li>Great price, great product.  </li>
            <li>Using it with a cleanser, getting great results.  </li>

            <li>It does what it says, smells good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Alternatively, it&#x27;s also a good night time cleanser substitute if you&#x27;ve just run out (speaking from experience) if you wipe off the excess moisture with a cotton wool.</li>
            <li>Good product and competitive pricing.</li>
            <li>Toners are good because, after washing your face, they restore your skin&#x27;s pH to a neutral level.</li>
            <li>Good value for the money.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing and truly hydrates while giving you that polished feel after a good face-wash.  </li>
            <li>Very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I used this once, it gave me more acne and blemishes than ever!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance and leaves my skin feeling nourished.  </li>
            <li>However, I decided to keep it because I liked the smell and the freshness it offered.</li>
            <li>She is now happy with it.it worth money we gave.</li>
            <li>However, I do not know if it is all that AMAZING as most people state.</li>
            <li>Has a very light &amp;#34;peach&amp;#34; smell to me which is no too overbearing.</li>
            <li>Always love this product.</li>
            <li>I love Murad.  </li>
            <li>I love this toner.  </li>
            <li>and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I really love Murad&#x27;s toner.  </li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, the lovely floral/citrus scent is just the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li>This Murad product, does a much better job of keeping my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>favorite thing about this toner is using it post waxing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying the toning results of the product.  </li>
            <li>Love this line of products and I love that its cheaper than Sephora.</li>
            <li>love this product my girl who does my facials recommended it.</li>
            <li>I love all things Murad.</li>
            <li>Great fast service also.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>If anyone could recommend me any products that controls facial oil that would be great!</li>
            <li>Great toner for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Anyone looking for a refreshing clean feeling product.</li>
            <li>This toner smells really great and feels fresh, but it doesn&#x27;t do much else.</li>
            <li>It arrived super quick, nice package, no problems.</li>
            <li>So, I have gradually been phasing out of the proactiv regime I&#x27;ve been using so that I try new and more effective acne products for my skin type.     </li>
            <li>This is about the best toner, cleanser I have ever used and I&#x27;ve used quite a few.  </li>
            <li>Light weight with no stickiness.</li>
            <li>Overall its a great upgrade, and I will buy the product again.</li>
            <li>This is light.</li>
            <li>Smells great, feels fresh &amp; clean, leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this toner since the reviews here on amazon was very positive.</li>
            <li>--I prefer none to clean smell--this toner smells like a light flower body spray..</li>
            <li>This toner makes my face feel hydrated and clean.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve had great results with other Murad products, this one dries out my skin, instead of hydrating.</li>
            <li>Even better, I get far fewer ingrown hairs when I use this toner after waxing-</li>
            <li>Using moisturizer after toner then increases your facial moisture to a &amp;#34;positive&amp;#34; level, whereas using it without toner attempts to bring it up from a &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; level, which isn&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li>Makes my face keep in the moisture right after my shower.</li>
            <li>Out of all the facial products I have, this one is HANDS DOWN the best.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years, but honestly can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s really doing anything, or if it&#x27;s just a part of my daily routine</li>
            <li>My &#x27;acne&#x27; has not come back in 3 months and my skin looks fresh, hydrated, and healthy.  </li>
            <li>When I first received it, I used it a couple of times, then set it aside.  </li>
            <li>I can see where people would like it, but I don&#x27;t, and I can&#x27;t understand why exactly.</li>
            <li>I will probably try a Paula&#x27;s Choice toner next, as they feel much more hydrating and are not as pricey.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it</li>
            <li>I use this all the time and love it -- really cleans my skin without drying, and leaves a nice subtle scent.</li>
            <li>Love to use toner but hate to use cotton balls to put it on - this spray-on is the best!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the real one.</li>
            <li>The product was shipped really fast.</li>
            <li>The tonic is very convenient for me because I travel a lot and also it doesn&#x27;t require cotton balls unless you really want to.</li>
            <li>Really tightens pores.</li>
            <li>or you can gently wipe it off.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>No shiny forehead and my skin looks very hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I love this toner because my skin is really dry, and I can&#x27;t handle normal toners.</li>
            <li>And it may be doing some other magical things, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>I like this product - it&#x27;s more moisturizing than other toners.  </li>
            <li>After about 2-3 mins, the toner is fully absorbed (I usually just get on with getting dressed during this time) and my skin is more supple making it easier for my moisturiser to absorb.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I can go without a moisturizer after using this (only in warm weather, in the winter it&#x27;s too dry).</li>
            <li>and I still have a decent amount of acne issues.</li>
            <li>Now the main reason I got this was just for the winter</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly to anyone who uses this type product</li>
            <li>Some other nice things about this toner is that it never burns my skin, regardless of whether I place it over a razor burn or a recently popped pimple.</li>
            <li>It does, as some reviewers have stated, make your face feel a little sticky, for the lack of a better word, immediately after you put it on, but that probably has been implemented to lock in moisture.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin clean without dry spots.</li>
            <li>I would cleanse like normal, use this toner and then also use a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I feel like every penny was well spent on not only reducing my acne and blemishes, but it has seriously made my skin look wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is the first toner I&#x27;ve found that I can spray on my face and actually have it feel hydrated.</li>
            <li>Picked it back up here recently and started using it daily, and love it.  </li>
            <li>I usually still spray it onto a cotton ball and use that instead of spraying it, because I feel like more gets on my face that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of let me start by saying I&#x27;m at 27 yo male</li>
            <li>I notice that when I spritz it on and let it air dry, it can leave kind of a sticky feel to my skin after it&#x27;s dried.  </li>
            <li>cuz I was lazy, but this spray toner makes life great for a lazy person like me.</li>
            <li>I can wear it alone on humid days and under a light moisturizer on harsh winter days.  </li>
            <li>This product seems to be old.</li>
            <li>Smelled a bit different than the real one for some reason.</li>
            <li>I had what the dermatologist coined &#x27;adult acne&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Within a week my acne was nearly all gone</li>
            <li>It gives the skin a a rather soft glowing affect.</li>
            <li>completely hydrates and improves skin in appearance and softness.  </li>
            <li>My skin gets really red and irritated, and this helps calm it down a ton.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend anyone to try this at least once, because it was definitely and still is worth my while.</li>
            <li>It does not dry my face out at all.</li>
            <li>All I know is that since I started using this the dry patches on my face have started to clear up.</li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The directions state you can spritz it directly on your face and let it air dry</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, so I normally always have to put lotion on after I wash my face or it feels dry and crackly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this once, it gave me more acne and blemishes than ever! it might be that something inside this product that I&#x27;m allergic to, or it&#x27;s just not so great to use for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Always love this product. It&#x27;s very good to my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, but honestly can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s really doing anything, or if it&#x27;s just a part of my daily routine now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a great smell, and my face does feel ... fresher I guess ... after using it, but I still have to follow it up with a moisturizer afterwards because my skin is very dry in the winter time. It&#x27;s made for dry skin, but maybe mine is just dryer than the types they are considering in the packaging. But at the end of the day something keeps me coming back to this product.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin.  Sometimes my face likes moisturizer, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.  This toner is the perfect in-between moisturizer for combination or oily skin.  I can wear it alone on humid days and under a light moisturizer on harsh winter days.  It never clogs my pores.  It does not leave any residue on my skin.  It feels like water going on and it dries within seconds.  I usually spray about four pumps into my hands and rub the toner on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time.  I love Murad.  It is the best skin care I have ever used.  I love this toner.  It is a great pick me up anytime and I love the smell.  I will order this again!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  It has a nice fragrance and leaves my skin feeling nourished.  I use this in conjunction with the cream cleanser and the night cream.  My skin feels hydrated and looks fairly radiant, but then again I also use vitamin E oil on my face.</li>
            <li> Was upset with this product it&#x27;s not the real one. But instore</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about one year now. I love it! My skin no longer gets those break outs. I use it every morning and again in the evening. It leaves my skin clean without dry spots. I also use a moisturizer on winter days but I don&#x27;t need it in summer months. Anyone looking for a refreshing clean feeling product. Try this!</li>
            <li> i went somewhere to get a facial, and when i laid down so the lady could examine my face, she was amazed at how hydrated my skin was. it works!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I never used to use toner cuz I was lazy, but this spray toner makes life great for a lazy person like me.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped really fast. I really love Murad&#x27;s toner.  I feel refreshed throughout the day. You can use this toner anytime of the day.</li>
            <li> Feels good to skin and smells great</li>
            <li> I use this all the time and love it -- really cleans my skin without drying, and leaves a nice subtle scent.</li>
            <li> It arrived super quick, nice package, no problems. The tonic is very convenient for me because I travel a lot and also it doesn&#x27;t require cotton balls unless you really want to. It does what it says, smells good. I use it when my skin is very dry, usually in winter time.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product.  Tones skin well.  Using it with a cleanser, getting great results.  Massage chain charged me 2xprice, so I returned and ordered this.  Using daily for 2 months and not even half used.</li>
            <li> I needed a non-drying toner and this product is perfect. It is truly refreshing!It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and gives it a dewy smoothness.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be old.</li>
            <li> Item as described.  Smelled a bit different than the real one for some reason.</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin.  Although I&#x27;ve had great results with other Murad products, this one dries out my skin, instead of hydrating.</li>
            <li> This toner makes my face feel hydrated and clean. I have dry skin, so I normally always have to put lotion on after I wash my face or it feels dry and crackly. This is the first toner I&#x27;ve found that I can spray on my face and actually have it feel hydrated. I use it after showers instead of lotion a few times a a week in order to give my pores a chance to air out. I have been using this for a few years.</li>
            <li> I have had acne practically all of my teen/early adulthood and this is the only product that has done wonders. I feel like every penny was well spent on not only reducing my acne and blemishes, but it has seriously made my skin look wonderful. I would highly recommend anyone to try this at least once, because it was definitely and still is worth my while.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and truly hydrates while giving you that polished feel after a good face-wash.  Really tightens pores.</li>
            <li> I came across this by accident as one of the suggested items when I was looking for a toner. I was sold on the reviews and decided to take a punt on it. And I have to sing its praises as well. I love you can just spray it on and it instantly quenches the skin. After about 2-3 mins, the toner is fully absorbed (I usually just get on with getting dressed during this time) and my skin is more supple making it easier for my moisturiser to absorb. And it may be doing some other magical things, I don&#x27;t know. All I know is that since I started using this the dry patches on my face have started to clear up. I also use this after a post-work gym workout if I wait to shower when I get home. It instantly quiches skin dried out from the salt in sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternatively, it&#x27;s also a good night time cleanser substitute if you&#x27;ve just run out (speaking from experience) if you wipe off the excess moisture with a cotton wool. I haven&#x27;t tried this on make-up since I don&#x27;t tend to wear any so can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;d get that off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the lovely floral/citrus scent is just the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> Have used for 15 years and still can feel results</li>
            <li> This is about the best toner, cleanser I have ever used and I&#x27;ve used quite a few.  I would recommend it highly to anyone who uses this type product</li>
            <li> Great toner for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I like this toner a lot because it&#x27;s slightly moisturizing, which I need after cleansing my face. Sometimes I can go without a moisturizer after using this (only in warm weather, in the winter it&#x27;s too dry). Great product.</li>
            <li> This works!  I have menopausal acne prone skin that doesn&#x27;t exfoliate well.  I use this toner in the a.m. and p.m. to help exfoliate my skin.  It does not dry my face out at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for quite a while.  When I first received it, I used it a couple of times, then set it aside.  Picked it back up here recently and started using it daily, and love it.  I&#x27;ve been spraying a tad on my neck and letting it dry prior to any moisturizer&#x27;s/creams.  Seems to be keeping my neck area moisturized.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Has a very light &amp;#34;peach&amp;#34; smell to me which is no too overbearing. Light weight with no stickiness.</li>
            <li> Did not like this at all...  I had welps on my face from this product line and had to return it.</li>
            <li> Good product and competitive pricing.</li>
            <li> Been using for 3 months and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference</li>
            <li> I like this product - it&#x27;s more moisturizing than other toners.  The directions state you can spritz it directly on your face and let it air dry or you can gently wipe it off.  I notice that when I spritz it on and let it air dry, it can leave kind of a sticky feel to my skin after it&#x27;s dried.  Otherwise, I like it.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started getting acne bumps (whiteheads, blackheads, zits, cystic acne) back in 7th grade, I have been using the three step system by Proactiv. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m now a junior in college and I still have a decent amount of acne issues. So, I have gradually been phasing out of the proactiv regime I&#x27;ve been using so that I try new and more effective acne products for my skin type.     I noticed that after I used the toner provided by proactiv, my face would get extrordinarily dry to the point where I would need to put on TONS of the repair lotion just to saturate my skin. This Murad product, does a much better job of keeping my skin hydrated. It does, as some reviewers have stated, make your face feel a little sticky, for the lack of a better word, immediately after you put it on, but that probably has been implemented to lock in moisture. Some other nice things about this toner is that it never burns my skin, regardless of whether I place it over a razor burn or a recently popped pimple. Another thing to note is that this seems to help reduce some of the redness I have in my skin (glycolic acid). Overall its a great upgrade, and I will buy the product again.</li>
            <li> I had what the dermatologist coined &#x27;adult acne&#x27;.  I had never experienced any acne as a teen and was very frustrated. After trying every type of cleanser and toner, I ran across the reviews on Murad clarifying toner and thought I would give it a try.  Within a week my acne was nearly all gone and my skin looked great.  I continued to use it for another month and then switched to the Murad hydrating toner.  My &#x27;acne&#x27; has not come back in 3 months and my skin looks fresh, hydrated, and healthy.  I am thrilled I found Murad and will continue to use thier products!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this toner because my skin is really dry, and I can&#x27;t handle normal toners. They leave me flaking. \\&quot;Dry\\&quot; or hormonal acne can be aggravated by harsher toners, but this helps mine heal instead of making it worse. I usually still spray it onto a cotton ball and use that instead of spraying it, because I feel like more gets on my face that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this toner is using it post waxing. My skin gets really red and irritated, and this helps calm it down a ton. Even better, I get far fewer ingrown hairs when I use this toner after waxing- and who doesn&#x27;t want less of those?</li>
            <li> This is light. I can see where people would like it, but I don&#x27;t, and I can&#x27;t understand why exactly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying the toning results of the product.  It gives the skin a a rather soft glowing affect. One of the best toners I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this line of products and I love that its cheaper than Sephora.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and I decided to buy a toner after getting a facial and having it recommended to me for my skin type. Toners are good because, after washing your face, they restore your skin&#x27;s pH to a neutral level. Using moisturizer after toner then increases your facial moisture to a &amp;#34;positive&amp;#34; level, whereas using it without toner attempts to bring it up from a &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; level, which isn&#x27;t as effective. This toner smells really great and feels fresh, but it doesn&#x27;t do much else. I unfortunately researched it on Beautypedia AFTER purchasing, and it was rated pretty poorly. However, I decided to keep it because I liked the smell and the freshness it offered. I will not repurchase, though - I will probably try a Paula&#x27;s Choice toner next, as they feel much more hydrating and are not as pricey.</li>
            <li> love this product my girl who does my facials recommended it. works great</li>
            <li> Love to use toner but hate to use cotton balls to put it on - this spray-on is the best! Smells great, feels fresh &amp; clean, leaves skin soft. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love all things Murad. Makes my face keep in the moisture right after my shower. Great fast service also.</li>
            <li> completely hydrates and improves skin in appearance and softness.  I use it morning and night after I cleanse, and I Love it!!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife. She tried other products before Murad. She is now happy with it.it worth money we gave.</li>
            <li> First of let me start by saying I&#x27;m at 27 yo male and I hate my combination type skin on my face.  My forehead is ALWAYS shiny and it just looks plain weird.  Now the main reason I got this was just for the winter cuz my skin tends to get dry a lot.  When I first started using it I would cleanse like normal, use this toner and then also use a moisturizer.  It helped my skin become balanced not oily in one part and not dry in the other.  Now that its summer i stopped using the moisturizer and just use the toner and let me say my skin looks awesome.  My face looks like it has a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; like another reviewer mentioned. No shiny forehead and my skin looks very hydrated.  It&#x27;s very hard to explain how it looks.  Out of all the facial products I have, this one is HANDS DOWN the best.  Im coming back on here just to buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> Great price, prompt shipping.  It&#x27;s a great product. Very refreshing. Love the scent. I use it daily. Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this toner since the reviews here on amazon was very positive. However, I do not know if it is all that AMAZING as most people state. (*Side note* Everyone has different skin types, etc. so the results will vary) Personally, I don&#x27;t like the fragrance--I prefer none to clean smell--this toner smells like a light flower body spray.. I also didn&#x27;t read carefully and found out that this toner is for people who have dry skin..I, on the other hand, have oily skin...If anyone could recommend me any products that controls facial oil that would be great! Until then, I will be using this product and will not purchase again.</li>
