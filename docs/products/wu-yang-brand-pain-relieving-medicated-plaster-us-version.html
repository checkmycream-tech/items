            <li>strong medicine smell.</li>
            <li>Works, however I have to use carefully right before shower because it does smell very strong and your skin and clothes will smell stronger the longer you wear it.</li>

            <li> This is the only product that relieves my terrible neuropathy pain. And does it immediately!</li>
            <li> Nice and fast shipping. Thanks</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my acupuncturist for back pain. Although the smell is quite strong, this product works well for back pain. I leave it on over night and I can really feel an improvement in the morning.</li>
            <li> This product i learned about on vacation in florida with my left feet hurting.  Remarkable one word. Yes i said Remarkable. ....</li>
            <li> Really helped my pain.</li>

            <li> This works and is Better than most out there, Also there is much more in this can than in others. The only drawback is that it can leave red marks after removing.</li>
            <li> This is a great medicated plaster. I have been using it for years and my clients love the results. The product arrived on time and well packaged.</li>
            <li> everything arrived as promised</li>
            <li> My back pain relieves. It is good plaster.</li>
            <li> I like that I can cut it to size. Hint. Put remainder in zip lock bag and place it back in container. By using the zip lock, the rest does not dry out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome for plantar fasciitis sore muscles and other aches and pains. I use it all the time!</li>
            <li> i really like the roll better than the individual patches... this way i can simply cut off the size i need... and of course it works like a charm... i have used them for more than 15years...</li>
            <li> I found that it did not relieve my pain.</li>
            <li> very happy with this product</li>
            <li> Helps bring down pain a little to where your pain pills will do the rest.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this brand of Medicated Plaster from a local TCM doctor. Then I discovered I could buy it at a local Asian supermarket for much less. The last time my husband tried to purchase this plaster at the supermarket, he was told the packaging had changed, but that it was the same product. This did not turn out to be accurate. The item he purchased had a seven on it and it had a MUCH stronger scent and irritated my skin. I tried to use it and like it, but then I began searching for the old stuff. I found this product on Amazon and the price was good, so I ordered it. It did ship from China and took awhile to deliver, but it is just as I remembered it! I think I used to buy it in a larger quantity, but otherwise it&#x27;s the same - the smell is much more pleasant (although still noteworthy) than the product with the seven on it and it does not irritate my skin like the other. I am about to order more of the Wu Yang Medicated Plaster, but will order a larger quantity this time since I now know it&#x27;s what I was searching for.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and it works</li>
            <li> I love this stuff its very strong</li>
            <li> The product really works and is an excellent alternative to traditional pain relief methods.  Like any pain relief medication, it is temporary but helps with minor inflammation of joints from exercise, strains, etc.</li>
            <li> The best for my bad back!</li>
            <li> The plaster in can be cut to size which is very useful and you get twice as much in can vs boxed patches.  I&#x27;ve used these plasters for over 12 years on back muscle spasms after acupuncturist gave me a box. They seem to actually pull the pain out of muscles the longer you leave it on, providing constant relief.  Friends with muscle spasms attest to this same effect.  Warning: It has a strong smell of camphor so you might want to wear at home. The warmer you get, the stronger the smell.  The sticky backing adheres to the skin tightly from body heat and has to be peeled off or comes off easily once wet. Plaster effect lasts 12 hours.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years - it really does work. This is a very good current price. It arrived  from Hong Kong in 12 days, which is very fast.</li>
            <li> Really these are the best medicated plasters. They really do help with back pain. Much better than the precut ones as you can cut exactly the length you need.</li>
            <li> Love that it comes in a roll that you can cut to any size.</li>
            <li> Helped an ugly bruise go away fast!</li>
            <li> Great product - works better than the patches prescribed by the doctor.  Love it !  Been using them for over a year and they are cheaper than purchasing from acupunturist.  My sister uses them for her fibromyalgia and is the one who suggested for back pain.</li>
            <li> the odor is overwhelming, though, I know it is medicinal, I did not expect such a strong smell from the herbs. it is offensive to those around me and therefore I can only freely use it at certain times when not offending others in spite of my pain. the quantity is sufficient for several applications, that is positive.....I will not order it again, it was recommended on the Dr Oz show</li>
            <li> Works very well for Back Pain, even if used for a short period of time. I am sensitive to any adhesive even on a Bandaid but it worked within a short amount of time!</li>
            <li> strong medicine smell. delivery was too long.</li>
