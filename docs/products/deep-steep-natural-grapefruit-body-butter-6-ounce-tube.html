            <li>I prefer more of a Bergamot scent.</li>

            <li>Hi, Only healthy ingredients.</li>

            <li>It smells amazing, and really helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase many in the future!</li>
            <li>It has a true grapefruit scent (like you just cut open a fresh grapefruit).  </li>
            <li>But this one is Fruit Loops scented, straight up.</li>
            <li>I also smells really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Especially nice for the cold winter months!</li>

            <li> LOVE this body butter! It smells amazing, and really helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love that I can pronounce EVERY ingredient, no artificial junk in these.  This lotion makes my skin feel amazing, soaks right in, no greasy after-feeling.  Even better is that my sweetie loves the citrus scent ;)</li>
            <li> Awesome. Nice after shower. If you like citrus, this does the trick. Nice in the evening before bed, relaxing scent. Love it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Hi, Only healthy ingredients. I put it on my face to try to heal glycation and more. It has awesome ingredients. I refrigerate it to keep it fresh and look forward to each time I use it knowing I am only it only helps my health/skin. Happiness....</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and need to deal with extra dry MN winter weather.  Deep Steep Body Butter does make a difference.  My skin is soft and hydrated year round.</li>
            <li> I was a little curious about using this product.  On the one hand I dearly love grapefruit in any shape  Or form.  However, I had no experience with bergomot whatsoever.  But I figured it was worth a try  Because_it smelled good and someone must think it is good for your skin.  So here goes and it makes  A great bath that i would highly recommend to anyone.  They also have some others which I just  Ordered today.  One has honey and I can&#x27;t wait for that one!!!!!</li>
            <li> Soothing cream for weary skin.</li>
            <li> I Love Taking Baths &amp; Love Bubbles.  A Good Price Bubble Bath With Long Last Bubbles &amp; Nice Relaxing Fragrance Is Hard To Find.  But This Is The Product That Delivers All O That!  Love Th Lotion To, Smell Is amaZing!  I Won&#x27;t Buy Any Other Product Now!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the scent.</li>
            <li> While visiting a friend of mine, she had this product and scent in a foaming soap in her bathroom.  I fell in love with it&#x27;s unique and fresh scent that I knew once I returned home I would purchase it.  Glad I did......Every time I use this product....the aroma makes me feel clean, fresh and revitalized!  I will certainly purchase many in the future!</li>
            <li> I bought this item along with the Bubble Bath in the same scent for a birthday gift.  I did so because I had purchased the Grapefruit Bergamot line for myself about a month ago and loved it!  It was odd how light the fragrance was in the bottle compared to how it permeated throughout my master suite as I soaked in my bubble bath.  I did not even realize how fragrant it was afterwards until I went out into the living room and returned to my bedroom.  It really surprised me.  It is a very clean and refreshing scent.  I am also able to use this product on my children who both have eczema and extremely sensitive skin.  One corner of the box was a bit smashed, but I was able to bend it back into place.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mom, since I had the lavender chamomile kind, I thought she&#x27;d love it.  When we opened it I thought that I recognized the smell, and after mulling it over a bit, I realized that it smells just like Fruit Loops.  I&#x27;m not sure if my Mom will even use it now.  I shouldn&#x27;t have said anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the other scents are great, and it is lovely and moisturizing, and has no bad junk in it.  But this one is Fruit Loops scented, straight up.</li>
            <li> This is truly a &amp;#34;deep steep&amp;#34; lotion. I also smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to buy it as my lotion of choice.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!  Made in the USA!!!</li>
            <li> I swim daily and have dry skin and this product is SO SO WONDERFUL. NOT greasy and absorbs and smooths well. GREAT ingredients and all natural. For the price, this is amazing. I even use it on my face and neck and all over. ONE little drop goes a long way. I am a fan.</li>
            <li> Love the product and love the fragrance!!</li>
            <li> I love this body butter!  It has a true grapefruit scent (like you just cut open a fresh grapefruit).  I find that it soaks in quickly and is not greasy.  The scent is subtle once applied, too.  Great product for the money.</li>
            <li> Like the smell and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Outstanding! This body butter is super moisturizing without being greasy....and the fragrance is light, but so invigorating! I have tried many products and this one is superb. Especially nice for the cold winter months!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy Deep Steep products and especially like this thick lotion- it is very effective in keeping dry skin at bay and has a wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> Scent is different from other available scents. I prefer more of a Bergamot scent.</li>
