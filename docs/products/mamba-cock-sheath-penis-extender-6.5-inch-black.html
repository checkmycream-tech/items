            <li>Good luck guys!</li>
            <li>Need lube to put on and in but works great.</li>
            <li>If it makes her happy it makes me happy.</li>
            <li>Has been a great addition to the collection.</li>
            <li>This was a great gag gift...</li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>awesome  :)  </li>
            <li>Item would be good for someone desiring an increase in length and width.</li>
            <li>Good for me</li>
            <li>Tried it and fit perfectly</li>

            <li>My girlfriend loved it.</li>
            <li>Partner loved it though.</li>
            <li>Very good , I feel happy and full</li>
            <li>Provides nice additional length and girth.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it was very good fit for me.</li>
            <li>One word for best use: lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;Not just for those receiving a pounding from this gift, but those wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;To fit in snug, lube up your penis well - too much is just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It would be best if there are items with different inner lengths and good selection guidelines for best fitting.</li>
            <li>I dont like a very smooth feel</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to think of this but added a lot of spice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, to sum up, my experience calls for lube, lube and more lube.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and lube.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Probably more suited for someone with ED.</li>
            <li>yes .........excellent fit  for him and lots of enjoyment for me !</li>
            <li>It fits perfectly w/just enough room in girth &amp; length.</li>
            <li>Pretty sturdy and fits good.</li>
            <li>The product stretchs in every directions to fit u</li>
            <li>This fit comfortably on me, however MAKE SURE you insert your penis first before putting your testicles through.</li>
            <li>Tight fit lol on both ends :)</li>
            <li>After we finished she said she wasn&#x27;t excited to use it again anytime soon.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more room but worked very well.</li>
            <li>found this to (adequately) solve the size problem some others have described - that, and squeezing the air out of the end before inserting your penis</li>
            <li>Great, but tight.  </li>
            <li>The reviews on this were great, so I went with it to do a little role playing fun with my wife.</li>
            <li>can.&lt;br /&gt;I, too, had some discomfort with the testicle ring before I found that generous use of lube makes the whole thing fit</li>
            <li>but we eventually got most of it in after watching adult videos and a LOT of lube.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a lot of fun using this.</li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>Used it right when we got it.</li>
            <li>my dick is small lol.</li>
            <li>We got the &amp;#34;fat jack&amp;#34; as well and that felt very real.</li>
            <li>but wow my wife and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>my wife was terrified of it at first</li>
            <li>Made her squirt so much we had to change the comforter.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it was real sometimes...</li>
            <li>Then the build up is intense for him...</li>
            <li>Very girth when in use, good for doggy or slow sensual sex</li>
            <li>Due to the construction with ring, it seems that this will be most beneficial for those with 4.5&amp;#34; to 5.5&amp;#34; length and 5&amp;#34; to 6&amp;#34; girth.</li>
            <li>Takes a few trys to get use to putting it on, but wow does she LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>If this were more realistic feeling, it would be 5 star, hands down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about 6.5-7 inches and decent thickness.</li>
            <li>My stamina is not what it used to be this really added fun back in bed.</li>
            <li>Material used is high quality without any odor nor grease.</li>
            <li>The ring really helped holding it in position when there is some action going on.</li>
            <li>Follow the other reviews on testicle insertion, it worked fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really adds that extra mmmpph! haha</li>
            <li>Nice.. Was skeptical at first...</li>
            <li>helps to draw the sheath as far onto you as it</li>
            <li>She said I quote &amp;#34;felt like I was giving birth over and over again.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s very realistic, has a slight plastic smell.. (Not nearly as bad as some of the reviews say) but is just as wide as the tip of a bat.</li>
            <li>it from me, unless your wife is REALLY into larger equipment.. Get something smaller.</li>
            <li>A bit big and bends since I don&amp;#34;t fill the inside up completely.  </li>
            <li>Feel is just about right, not too hard, not too soft.</li>
            <li>A little large.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Is to small</li>
            <li> Too hard.</li>

            <li> far as the ACTUAL product... Holy crap!  </li>
            <li> This thing is literally as thick as my wrist.</li>
            <li> After reading that this was difficult to get on and stay on, we were a little worried.  </li>
            <li> Ended up cutting it off.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Takes a few trys to get use to putting it on, but wow does she LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Item would be good for someone desiring an increase in length and width. It is pretty thick. Good for me but my wife did not like. There wasn&#x27;t enough details about the item to know what I was getting. The part that goes over the scrotum will probably only fot if 6&amp;#34; or less.</li>
            <li> Very girth when in use, good for doggy or slow sensual sex</li>
            <li> Putting it on takes a little work but wow my wife and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to think of this but added a lot of spice.  Need lube to put on and in but works great.</li>
            <li> Nice.. Was skeptical at first... Tried it and fit perfectly and the wife loved it ... Good size too...</li>

            <li> If you want to last forever until your women begs you to cum then this is for u. The product stretchs in every directions to fit u right.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved it. If it makes her happy it makes me happy.</li>
            <li> This is a pain in the a## to get on, but once it is the wife howls like a wolf!!!  Made her squirt so much we had to change the comforter.  Use lots of lube to squeeze into it.</li>
            <li> very big and works well</li>
            <li> save you money threw mine away</li>
            <li> A little large. Need to take your time. Once its in an she relaxed let the fire works begin</li>
            <li> A bit big and bends since I don&amp;#34;t fill the inside up completely.  Partner loved it though.</li>
            <li> This thing is BIG, but my girl took it like a champ even  though she was quite intimidated by it.</li>
            <li> Great, but tight.  I was expecting more room but worked very well.</li>
            <li> Used it right when we got it. I love it. really adds that extra mmmpph! haha</li>
            <li> It is stiff, yet still flexible and stretchable. Inside is tight and probably not recommended larger then 5&amp;#34;, but with a little lube very workable. Wife enjoys the life like feel. Provides nice additional length and girth. Probably more suited for someone with ED. Like other reviews ball strap is tight, but manageable. Can be used with or without an erection.</li>
            <li> O M G ........... yes .........excellent fit  for him and lots of enjoyment for me !</li>
            <li> Very good , I feel happy and full</li>
            <li> After reading that this was difficult to get on and stay on, we were a little worried.  Use enough lub to where you can put it on and off easier.  I dont like a very smooth feel and this has the texture that dosent make it feel so plastic.  Has been a great addition to the collection. Just what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> The reviews on this were great, so I went with it to do a little role playing fun with my wife. I&#x27;m about 6.5-7 inches and decent thickness. This fit comfortably on me, however MAKE SURE you insert your penis first before putting your testicles through. Follow the other reviews on testicle insertion, it worked fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the ACTUAL product... Holy crap!  My wife is a smaller girl.. And we were hoping for maybe just an extra inch or two of width... But dear god... This thing is literally as thick as my wrist. (I&#x27;m a 6 foot 195 pound male) my wife was terrified of it at first but we eventually got most of it in after watching adult videos and a LOT of lube. After we finished she said she wasn&#x27;t excited to use it again anytime soon. She definitely needed rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take it from me, unless your wife is REALLY into larger equipment.. Get something smaller. She said I quote &amp;#34;felt like I was giving birth over and over again.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s very realistic, has a slight plastic smell.. (Not nearly as bad as some of the reviews say) but is just as wide as the tip of a bat. Good luck guys!</li>
            <li> Ball ring way too small. Ended up cutting it off. Too hard. Not realistic.</li>
            <li> This was a great gag gift...this thing is really big, it is well made.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews complaining about the tight ring, I was hesitant but decided to take a chance. Fortunately, it was very good fit for me. The ring really helped holding it in position when there is some action going on. Feel is just about right, not too hard, not too soft. Material used is high quality without any odor nor grease. Due to the construction with ring, it seems that this will be most beneficial for those with 4.5&amp;#34; to 5.5&amp;#34; length and 5&amp;#34; to 6&amp;#34; girth. If you are shorter than that there will be non-negligible air pocket in between, and if you are longer than that it may pull your balls forward causing pain. If the girth is smaller it will feel loose and if the girth longer it can constrict too much and may become too thick for your partner. It would be best if there are items with different inner lengths and good selection guidelines for best fitting. As for me, it fits me perfectly and I am giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was real sometimes... Lol. My husband puts this on whenever we want to get freak on. It fits perfectly w/just enough room in girth &amp; length. It helps him to on holding onto his orgasim....so he&#x27;ll last longer. Then the build up is intense for him...its like 3 orgasims in one. Great addition to our collection!</li>
            <li> Tight fit lol on both ends :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a lot of fun using this. My wife loves it. If there is a con, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s really firm, not hard but very firm. We got the &amp;#34;fat jack&amp;#34; as well and that felt very real. If this were more realistic feeling, it would be 5 star, hands down.</li>
            <li> Is to small my dick is small lol. But still</li>
            <li> My stamina is not what it used to be this really added fun back in bed.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it...I guess that&#x27;s all that needs to be said!</li>
            <li> Its hard to put on.and hurts your nuts taking it off but besides that my wife likes it.</li>
            <li> Pretty sturdy and fits good. I&#x27;m 6.5 by 4.5.</li>
            <li> awesome  :)  get one...</li>
