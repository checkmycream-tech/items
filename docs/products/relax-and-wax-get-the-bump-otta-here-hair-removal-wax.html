            <li>Priceless.</li>
            <li>The BEST product on the market to combat razor burn/bumps on your bikini line.  </li>
            <li>Great for razor bumps and waxing bumps.</li>
            <li>This product works great to prevent the raised, itchy rash that accompanies waxing (and maybe shaving too, though I don&#x27;t).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy about it.</li>
            <li>Really great product</li>
            <li>This stuff is great</li>

            <li>It works just as good.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy</li>
            <li>The product isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, but it does a good job.</li>
            <li>and I use it twice a day and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product, I will never be without it!</li>
            <li>Most online retailers and skin professionals will sell this product for around $20, so this is a bargain!</li>
            <li>Works amazing.</li>
            <li>The roll on applicator is nice.</li>
            <li>It dries nicely with out a residue.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to use since it rolls on.</li>
            <li>They better not ever stop making it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t decide to return it because it saved me a lot of embarrassment.</li>
            <li>I use to spend $50 on a Bliss product that worked okay, but I was trying to reuse pads and not use it as often to not have to buy it again so soon.</li>
            <li>This stuff is wayyy better and a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have since used two full bottles and it does the job nicely.  </li>
            <li>Works much better than plum smooth for me.  </li>
            <li>I had originally bought this but wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to keep it.</li>
            <li>I get a couple but not nearly as bad or many.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin really smooth and even out.</li>
            <li>Honestly, one of my top ten beauty products of a lifetime....</li>
            <li>stopped using it when I was pregnant, because it does contain aspirin, so ladies take note.  </li>
            <li>it was worth the try since i didnt have any allergic reaction</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice part of a regimen, but not the entire thing.</li>
            <li>and it came in the mail super fast!</li>
            <li>I noticed results right away.</li>
            <li>but it does suggest you start using it a few days prior to your wax for best results.</li>
            <li>This was my first time waxing</li>
            <li>I recently started using an epilator and have been getting more ingrown hairs as a result.</li>
            <li>it was pretty fortuitous that she had the kits.  </li>
            <li>Bumps are drastically reduced, IF they even show up at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think it would work the first time I bought it</li>
            <li>This really does reduce the post epilating or waxing bumps!</li>
            <li>The only help I&#x27;ve found (this is related to epilating) is making sure to exfoliate more than normal.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much camila!</li>
            <li>Started using this about a year ago and it worked fine up until recently.</li>
            <li>Took care of my red bumps quickly and didn&#x27;t sting when I applied it!</li>
            <li>It is soothing and really does work.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t a hassle to work with and very helpful</li>
            <li>I have been going for brazilians for about a year now, and I am very prone to ingrown hairs...</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I really did not notice a difference using this product.  </li>
            <li>Gets bumps out fast and works better than other products I&#x27;ve tried before--and it&#x27;s not harsh!</li>
            <li>It worked really well although it didn&#x27;t completely eliminate all ingrown hairs, but definitely better than any of the dozen other products I had used.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, and I recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>have purchased it where I live before</li>
            <li>Well I have still had a random ingrown hair here &amp; there, but for the most part my bikini line has been bump free.</li>
            <li>I first got this product when I was getting waxed regularly at a salon.  </li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>Pretty much the only product I&#x27;ve ever used for razor burn that actually worked.</li>
            <li>I buy at least two at a time :-)</li>
            <li>and it seemed to work, even though it was only about 10-15 minutes between applying it and getting waxed (and those are some really sensitive areas).  </li>
            <li>Totally reduces bumps after waxing and completely eliminates them as a daily treatment.</li>
            <li>It smells a little medicinal at first, but that doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>

            <li> The bottle is also lasting for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long sought a product with salicylic acid that I could apply without getting it on my fingers (which makes them peel).  </li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without this product!!!</li>
            <li> All it does is make a sticky mess on my legs that I have to sit and wait to dry.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any &amp;#34;stickiness&amp;#34; other users have mentioned, but I don&#x27;t go around rubbing myself either.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but does what it says it will do -- and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin -- another plus.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it was awful or sometimes there was just one stubborn one, but it definitely didn&#x27;t make me feel sexy.</li>
            <li> I feel like it was a waste.</li>
            <li> the Get the Bump Outta Here almost every day and a few times the No Trauma Momma.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I definitely changed my mind after using it on my legs and stomach because I had bad red bumps from epilating.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin on application, even the spots that are hit really bad by redness and sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Going to have to move on to something stronger :-/</li>
            <li> After tweezing a stubborn upper lip hair, which seems to have become ingrown &amp; has formed a visible &amp; annoying bump, I had high hopes this product would help, but alas it did not.</li>
            <li> but alas it has not made any difference at all.</li>
            <li> and it really didn&#x27;t help with my awful ingrown.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say that this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> that rear their ugly heads after shaving or waxing your delicate bikini areas.  </li>
            <li> Not very good product burns badly when applied and smells disgusting.</li>
            <li> I use it in my bikini area and it cleared up bumps, ingrown hair and the ugly marks ingrown hair causes.</li>
            <li> It does leave a sticky residue on your skin until it dries which can be annoying if you need to use it on the run.</li>
            <li> Very bad product!</li>
            <li> Also, has a bad smell!!!</li>

            <li> Well I have still had a random ingrown hair here &amp; there, but for the most part my bikini line has been bump free. This was my first time waxing so I bought everything to minimize pain &amp; discomfort. I didnt read the bottle until after my wax - but it does suggest you start using it a few days prior to your wax for best results.</li>
            <li> I have long sought a product with salicylic acid that I could apply without getting it on my fingers (which makes them peel).  This is great!  It smells a little medicinal at first, but that doesn&#x27;t linger.  My KP has improved -- fewer bumps!</li>
            <li> Works amazing. Totally reduces bumps after waxing and completely eliminates them as a daily treatment.</li>
            <li> Great for razor bumps and waxing bumps. Smells like rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li> Pretty much the only product I&#x27;ve ever used for razor burn that actually worked. Very soothing and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin on application, even the spots that are hit really bad by redness and sensitivity. Will forever be buying this.</li>
            <li> This product is a must in every persons wax treatment kit. It is soothing and really does work. I also use it after shaving and epilating. It does leave a sticky residue on your skin until it dries which can be annoying if you need to use it on the run.</li>
            <li> I first got this product when I was getting waxed regularly at a salon.  It worked really well although it didn&#x27;t completely eliminate all ingrown hairs, but definitely better than any of the dozen other products I had used.  Not too long after I started using it, my husband began to shave his head and when his ingrown hairs resisted other treatments, I offered to share it with him.  It works wonders for him and his ingrown hairs!  After a couple of years of no ingrowns, he started to think he didn&#x27;t need it and after one week of not using it, begged me to order him more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it when I was pregnant, because it does contain aspirin, so ladies take note.  Otherwise it is a staple in our house.</li>
            <li> Easy people to work with great communication!! Thanks so much camila! Wasn&#x27;t a hassle to work with and very helpful</li>
            <li> This is my favorite!! Works much better than plum smooth for me.  If you wax and get those ingrown hairs and red bumps, try this!!!</li>
            <li> I recently started using an epilator and have been getting more ingrown hairs as a result. I was hoping this stuff would help but alas it has not made any difference at all. I followed the directions and nothing. I  thought maybe I need to give it some time, but it&#x27;s been over a month and it hasn&#x27;t helped at all. All it does is make a sticky mess on my legs that I have to sit and wait to dry. I would not recommend this product. I feel like it was a waste. The only help I&#x27;ve found (this is related to epilating) is making sure to exfoliate more than normal. The &amp;#34;Relax and Wax Get The Bump Otta Here!&amp;#34; was not the solution for me though.</li>
            <li> I have been going for brazilians for about a year now, and I am very prone to ingrown hairs...lots of them and they get red and sore.  My waxer had this on display in her salon when I went last month and I was reading the labels while waiting for my appointment.  I was planning on asking her about what I could do for the ingrown hairs anyhow, so it was pretty fortuitous that she had the kits.  She had me try the No-Scream Cream prior to my wax and it seemed to work, even though it was only about 10-15 minutes between applying it and getting waxed (and those are some really sensitive areas).  So I bought the kit before I left the shop and used the No Trauma Momma when I got home...didn&#x27;t burn at all.  And from then until my next appointment I used the scrub a couple times a week (including the morning of my next appt), the Get the Bump Outta Here almost every day and a few times the No Trauma Momma.  And it worked - when I was there for my appt yesterday she even remarked that I had practically no ingrown hairs and everything was a lot smoother.  So for me, this worked, and I would recommend these products.</li>
            <li> This is a must have after a wax! To avoid any skin irritation I use this 24hrs after my bikin wax. I buy at least two at a time :-)</li>
            <li> Love this product! Gets bumps out fast and works better than other products I&#x27;ve tried before--and it&#x27;s not harsh!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product, I will never be without it! I noticed results right away. I use it in my bikini area and it cleared up bumps, ingrown hair and the ugly marks ingrown hair causes. Its been 2 weeks now and I use it twice a day and am very pleased with the results. I haven&#x27;t noticed any &amp;#34;stickiness&amp;#34; other users have mentioned, but I don&#x27;t go around rubbing myself either.</li>
            <li> I forgot to use this one product time and it proved to me how absolutely necessary this product is. Priceless.</li>
            <li> This product works great to prevent the raised, itchy rash that accompanies waxing (and maybe shaving too, though I don&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> After Sally Hansen stopped making their \\&quot;no bumps\\&quot; pads for post-bikini wax issues, I had to do some searching and I found this product.  I have since used two full bottles and it does the job nicely.  It is also very easy to use since it rolls on. A little pricey, but does what it says it will do -- and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin -- another plus.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say that this product did not work for me. After tweezing a stubborn upper lip hair, which seems to have become ingrown &amp; has formed a visible &amp; annoying bump, I had high hopes this product would help, but alas it did not.</li>
            <li> Used it after waxing and got bumps still, but they didn&#x27;t last as long. I still use it even if I don&#x27;t wax and it helps prevent razor bumps. It&#x27;s good to have just in case.</li>
            <li> Not very good product burns badly when applied and smells disgusting.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I bought the product. This time, it was sealed all the way and there were no spills. It works just as good. I&#x27;m happy about it. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Hair follicles are what they are; we can&#x27;t help that.  Relax and Wax will help you deal with the ingrown hairs, etc. that rear their ugly heads after shaving or waxing your delicate bikini areas.  Bumps are drastically reduced, IF they even show up at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think it would work the first time I bought it but I was pleasantly surprised!  This purchase is now my third bottle. They better not ever stop making it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased it where I live before but this time I tried Amazon.  It&#x27;s a lot easier than making the one hour drive to buy it locally!</li>
            <li> I had originally bought this but wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to keep it. I definitely changed my mind after using it on my legs and stomach because I had bad red bumps from epilating. Took care of my red bumps quickly and didn&#x27;t sting when I applied it! Really great product and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t decide to return it because it saved me a lot of embarrassment.</li>
            <li> I used european wax center serum before and it really didn&#x27;t help with my awful ingrown. This stuff is great I get a couple but not nearly as bad or many. I use it daily after shower. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I use to spend $50 on a Bliss product that worked okay, but I was trying to reuse pads and not use it as often to not have to buy it again so soon. This stuff is wayyy better and a lot cheaper. Zero bumbs. Like none. Not even a tease a bumb was coming in. And I am razor bumb prone. I am sticking with this product forever! It&#x27;s reasonablly prices and works.</li>
            <li> Very bad product! Doesn&#x27;t do anything and it&#x27;s sticky!!! Also, has a bad smell!!! Does not work...don&#x27;t waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> this thing is amazing! highly recommend it. i am allergic to aspirin in the instructions it says do not use if allergic to aspirin it was worth the try since i didnt have any allergic reaction</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without this product!!! I never had a problem with ingrown hairs until I started getting waxed. Sometimes it was awful or sometimes there was just one stubborn one, but it definitely didn&#x27;t make me feel sexy. I use it every morning and night and I haven&#x27;t had one ingrown! Makes your skin really smooth and even out. Definitely a good buy and it came in the mail super fast!</li>
            <li> This really does reduce the post epilating or waxing bumps! It doesn&#x27;t sting at all either. The bottle is also lasting for a long time. I will purchase again when I run out!</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, but it does a good job. It also helps with any pain issues. I would definitely recommend it, but also remember that you have to exfoliate and moisturize as well... it&#x27;s a nice part of a regimen, but not the entire thing.</li>
            <li> The BEST product on the market to combat razor burn/bumps on your bikini line.  I no longer need to pay $85 a month at the salon for waxing -- I can shave with a disposable razor and get the same results simply by using &#x27;Get the Bump Out&#x27;.  Honestly, one of my top ten beauty products of a lifetime....</li>
            <li> I really did not notice a difference using this product.  The roll on applicator is nice. It dries nicely with out a residue.</li>
            <li> This works great for ingrown hairs and the sensitivity that goes hand-in-hand with waxing and/or shaving. I highly recommend this product, and I recommend this seller. Most online retailers and skin professionals will sell this product for around $20, so this is a bargain!</li>
            <li> Started using this about a year ago and it worked fine up until recently. Going to have to move on to something stronger :-/</li>
