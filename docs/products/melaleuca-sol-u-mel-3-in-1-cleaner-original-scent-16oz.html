            <li>Also, it smells good and doesn&#x27;t make me cough or make my eyes itch.</li>
            <li>It also is handy for removing fingerprints from my kitchen cabinets.</li>
            <li>This is really the best thing I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent Product and you could get cheaper buy it directly to the Company,</li>
            <li>I love the way this stuff works.  </li>
            <li>Sol U Mel has so many uses.</li>

            <li>I love</li>
            <li>no Monthly commiment for more info send me an email to ereyes32@yahoo.com</li>
            <li>This product is truly amazing and as a melaleuca member you can buy it made fresh monthly and delivered right to your door for cheaper than anyone can resell it to you for.</li>
            <li>If you want to know how to do this, please send me an email, I will hook you up with your own direct shopping account that will save you lots of money!</li>
            <li>I love the way this stuff smells; clean, crisp, fresh.  </li>
            <li>A fresh scent that is not overpowering and the secure feeling of knowing I&#x27;m using something that will not harm my kids or pets.</li>
            <li>I used full strength on tissue to remove the sharpie.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it full strength to remove permanent marker off kitchen counters.</li>

            <li>This is such a wonderful product, the only thing that really works to remove stains from clothes, carpet, walls.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this product and use it to clean my house plus as a stain remover.</li>
            <li>I add it to carpet shampoo for extra clean.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for an all purpose cleaner.  </li>
            <li>However, you can get it much, much cheaper by enrolling to purchase directly from Melaleuca based in Idaho Falls.  </li>
            <li>I got two bottles since I thought I would need it, but I barely used any from the first bottle.</li>
            <li>It restored the pics to new.</li>
            <li>t actually eliminates oders as opposed to masking then like normal room fresheners!!</li>
            <li>They ship directly to the customer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get, is why people don&#x27;t just buy direct from Melaleuca?</li>
            <li>The prices on here are way overpriced and if you want to save money and buy direct from the company you can.</li>
            <li>I can give you a complete overview of the company and sign you up with a membership.</li>
            <li>It gets up puppy smells, removed grape juice stains (test for color fastness), sanitizes counters and keeps my floor clean without an icky residue.</li>

            <li> It takes the odor out of smelly workout clothes and when used with a carpet cleaner it removed the smell of 5 cats.</li>

            <li> My child took a permanent black marker all over the back seat of my car.  I was heart broken thinking it was ruined.  I tried Sol-u-Mel as a \\&quot;I&#x27;ll give it a shot\\&quot; thinking nothing would help, and it came out effortlessly and didn&#x27;t leave any trace of the marker.  LOVE this stuff!!</li>
            <li> My son scribbled on photos with black sharpie. I thought they were a lost cause. The entire picture was blacked in and you could not see anything. I saved the pics and looked online for anything that might work since it was his class photo and not replaceable. The pic sat in my drawer for a good month before I found this. I ordered and used it by wiping in strokes over the pic. I wiped and waited a few sec to min and redid it. It restored the pics to new. You can not tell it ever happened. I used full strength on tissue to remove the sharpie. It did not damage the pic in any way. I got two bottles since I thought I would need it, but I barely used any from the first bottle. It will also remove other stains around the house. This is really the best thing I have ever purchased. It is amazing!</li>
