            <li>love the colors!</li>
            <li>Love the neon colors!</li>
            <li>which is pretty uncommon for me!  </li>
            <li>but takes many coats to make a brighter color!</li>
            <li>she does all kinds of nail designs on her own nails</li>
            <li>I liked You are so outta Lime.  </li>
            <li>Nice color</li>
            <li>Love trying out the colors and love everything OPI!</li>
            <li>The colors are perfect for a teenager but not to say someone older wouldn&#x27;t love them too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and she loved these bright intense colors</li>
            <li>This cute package seemed great to try all the fun colors</li>
            <li>, so applied a top coat.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE these colors.</li>
            <li>Love the colors.</li>
            <li>The Polish went on with to many streaks.</li>
            <li>OPI is the only polish I buy, and these mini sets are the perfect way to test the colors out.</li>
            <li>Love this variety pack.  </li>
            <li>The sample size is perfect for me as I never go through a big bottle.</li>
            <li>The colors are just sooo solid and the consistency iand texture is perfect, almost!</li>
            <li>so I used a glossy top coat.  </li>
            <li>It;s very easy to apply and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>Super cute and nice quality sampler set.</li>
            <li>I liked this a lot because they offer you the ability to test out these colors, without having to purchase full sized bottles.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be great as she would get so many fun vibrant colors instead of just one!</li>
            <li>It was great slightly better than the neons from last year</li>
            <li>I also find that the colors are pretty true to the bottle and apply bright.</li>
            <li>I received this set as a gift and they are my first ever own OPI nail polishes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually quite impressed because I haven&#x27;t had to touch up my manicure since I first applied it about a week ago</li>
            <li>They are matte (not what I was expecting) super cute though.</li>
            <li>I however think they would look great as a decoration after applying a white nail polish coat.</li>
            <li>Ended up giving this set to a friend that loved the neon colors, she is more patient than me with applying multiple coats of polish.</li>
            <li>I LOVE neon and was so excited that OPI finally made bright neon colors.  </li>
            <li>I love opi polish and love trying new colors in these sizes!</li>
            <li>I saw this item on another website for full price and was so excited to find it on amazon for such a great deal.</li>
            <li>But they seem to be the same good quality.  </li>
            <li>I love all the different colors I am able to try all at once.</li>
            <li>Vibrant colors love them</li>
            <li>Great little sampler set!</li>
            <li>That being said, I loved them so much that I ordered the other 4 colors.  </li>
            <li>The pigment was more sheer than I was expecting...</li>
            <li>Neon colors are very &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; and there are a lot of fun things to do with them.</li>
            <li>BUT it takes 3-4 coats to get the real look!</li>
            <li>Pictures are exactly what you get, they are the minis</li>
            <li>I put on three thick coats and it still looked cheap and kind of chalky.  </li>
            <li>so they really hold up.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and product was as described.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I am really upset I can&#x27;t return this.</li>
            <li>I am very upset about this.</li>
            <li>Loving the green and purple.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and pretty and if they&#x27;re anything like any other OPI polish, they look amazing on nails and last a lot time.  </li>
            <li>Great colors, only reason I&#x27;m giving a 4 is because the bottles are A LOT smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>Just make note that it is a set of mini bottles which are just a fraction of the size of the normal bottles of polish.</li>
            <li>The first color I tried was the yellow and after four coats it still looked streaky.  </li>
            <li>Even with the OPI Put a Coat on white base coat, it still took 4 or more coats of color to get good coverage.</li>
            <li>This is not typical opi.</li>
            <li>This polish is very thick and goes on with many streaks.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if I used a base coat it would look better but very full</li>
            <li>I bought the yellow and pink shades first.  </li>
            <li>It applied a little streaky at first but the second coat fixed that.  </li>
            <li>I will never buy another brand, as OPI color is so long lasting and vibrant.</li>
            <li>the other colors were not that unusual or different.</li>
            <li>Not happy with this set of polishes despite loving other OPI polishes.</li>
            <li>need some extra time to dry out completely as well.</li>

            <li> need some extra time to dry out completely as well.</li>
            <li> It peels right off and the color is really dull.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Staying power seems to be similar to my other OPI polishes.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of regular polishes, they do chip, but use a top &amp; base coat, and it&#x27;ll last longer.</li>
            <li> my only complaint was that no white polish was included</li>
            <li> The yellow has too much green in it.  </li>
            <li> will help when I want to replace them when empty</li>
            <li> They are right, flashy, and, uhm...neon.</li>
            <li> The yellow green is a little sheer &amp; requires extra thick coats to avoid streaks.</li>
            <li> Like any other nail paint.</li>
            <li> Yes the color variety was good but the quality of the polish was awful.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, however, these colors do stain your finger nails even if you put a base coat.</li>
            <li> They bottles seem watered down</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, down to the polish.</li>
            <li> I specifically bought the polish for my toe nails and previous little bottles that I bought</li>
            <li> had a little brush.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that the brushes in these little bottles is full size.  </li>
            <li> The colors did not look neon, they wouldn&#x27;t spread, and they looked completely uneven.</li>
            <li> My normal nail routine involves using a coat of white as the base, I find that no matter the color, it enhances it.  </li>
            <li> THe base coat that the full size collection did not do as advertised either.</li>
            <li> you definitely need to put a white base coat under it to get the color to pop.</li>
            <li> Too thick.</li>
            <li> OPI recommends layering these over a white base</li>
            <li> One of the bottles came broken</li>
            <li> Would recommend to get some thinner and put it in polish to thin it out before use.  </li>
            <li> Came late, one bottle is half-gone and dried out - lame!!</li>
            <li> Seems like a fake product</li>
            <li> Looked very uneven :(</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this choice!</li>
            <li> Without a base, these formulas are not opaque in 2 coats.  </li>
            <li> its the thinest crap i have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I used the lemon-yellow color after I put the base coat.</li>
            <li> IT IS AWFUL.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love trying out the colors and love everything OPI!</li>
            <li> great colors!  Great for summer!</li>
            <li> We picked this Christmas gift for our teenage granddaughter. She loved it! I thought it would be great as she would get so many fun vibrant colors instead of just one! The colors are perfect for a teenager but not to say someone older wouldn&#x27;t love them too.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this along with a manicure set so she and her girlfriends could paint their nails together. It was a hit. Her eyes lit up when she opened the box! Her look was priceless!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, and perfect gift for someone who love to do her nails.</li>
            <li> The pigment was more sheer than I was expecting...you definitely need to put a white base coat under it to get the color to pop.</li>
            <li> Yes the color variety was good but the quality of the polish was awful. I put on three thick coats and it still looked cheap and kind of chalky.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter she does all kinds of nail designs on her own nails and she loved these bright intense colors plus they are OPI so they really hold up.</li>
            <li> Havent used it yet but I like the smaller bottles when it comes to experimenting, especially on my toes. Neon colors are very &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; and there are a lot of fun things to do with them. Looking forward to using them. Shipping was fast and product was as described.</li>
            <li> Great neon colors for summer and excellent formula that applies super easy.  OPI recommends layering these over a white base so I used OPI My Boyfriend Scales Walls and it worked out well.  Without a base, these formulas are not opaque in 2 coats.  Polish dries to a matte finish but I like glossy, so applied a top coat.  Staying power seems to be similar to my other OPI polishes.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE these colors. They are matte (not what I was expecting) super cute though. Loving the green and purple.</li>
            <li> Love the colors. It did take multiple coats for it to stand out.</li>
            <li> The Polish went on with to many streaks. Looked very uneven :(</li>
            <li> I saw this item on another website for full price and was so excited to find it on amazon for such a great deal. I love opi polish and love trying new colors in these sizes! These are perfect for the summer!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for someone, but I am a big fan of OPI polish.  I have probably 50 different colors myself and I almost wanted to keep this package too!  The colors are vibrant and pretty and if they&#x27;re anything like any other OPI polish, they look amazing on nails and last a lot time.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money. Like any other nail paint. Seems like a fake product</li>
            <li> Colors didn&#x27;t come out well even after 5 coats.. Maybe if I used a base coat it would look better but very full finish n not as neon as I hoped...</li>
            <li> I liked You are so outta Lime.  The yellow has too much green in it.  the other colors were not that unusual or different.</li>
            <li> I love all the different colors I am able to try all at once. Then I know which ones I want to buy in the bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> These colors are definitely neon!  Just make note that it is a set of mini bottles which are just a fraction of the size of the normal bottles of polish. But they seem to be the same good quality.  The yellow green is a little sheer &amp; requires extra thick coats to avoid streaks.</li>
            <li> This cute package seemed great to try all the fun colors BUT it takes 3-4 coats to get the real look! And the nails to not often look like the bottle color! They bottles seem watered down and I just used 1/2 bottle for ONE pedicure. Save your money.  Buy ONE bottle of a color you like or try a competitor!</li>
            <li> I am really upset I can&#x27;t return this. I would never have bought it if I knew that, I don&#x27;t recall it being advertised as inreturnable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, down to the polish. IT IS AWFUL. I consider myself a np connoisseur, and I could NOT work with this. THe base coat that the full size collection did not do as advertised either. The colors did not look neon, they wouldn&#x27;t spread, and they looked completely uneven. I am very upset about this.</li>
            <li> OPI is the only polish I buy, and these mini sets are the perfect way to test the colors out. And you can&#x27;t beat the price on amazon.</li>
            <li> this cant be OPI nail polish....its the thinest crap i have ever tried.  You need 8 coats to equel to 2 coats Must be a knock off</li>
            <li> Too thick. That&#x27;s all I use is OPI but didn&#x27;t care for this nail polish.</li>
            <li> Thought the bottomless would be bigger.but will help when I want to replace them when empty</li>
            <li> Wonderful nail polish.</li>
            <li> Love this variety pack.  Give you a taste of the neon collection.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this choice!</li>
            <li> Did not deliver on time.  The first color I tried was the yellow and after four coats it still looked streaky.  I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Really nice colors and good as allways OPI is</li>
            <li> I love the colors, however, these colors do stain your finger nails even if you put a base coat. I used the lemon-yellow color after I put the base coat. Almost four days later, I removed the nail polish and my finger nails are yellowish. I however think they would look great as a decoration after applying a white nail polish coat. The solid white coat will bring the brightness and the neon quality of the colors.&lt;br /&gt;They need some extra time to dry out completely as well.</li>
            <li> Of course opi gets five stars no doubt.  Pictures are exactly what you get, they are the minis but it does state that in the description.  They are about two inches tall and the colors are absolutely beautiful I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these  for water marbling the formula is to magnificent  for that.</li>
            <li> Great color selection for summer. I will never buy another brand, as OPI color is so long lasting and vibrant. The sample size is perfect for me as I never go through a big bottle.</li>
            <li> The PRODUCT is great, but the VENDOR - no! Came late, one bottle is half-gone and dried out - lame!!</li>
            <li> I am officially hooked with OPI Nail Polishes. I received this set as a gift and they are my first ever own OPI nail polishes. The colors are just sooo solid and the consistency iand texture is perfect, almost! It;s very easy to apply and dries very quickly. It;s quite amazing! These colors, especially, is so perfect for my personality. They are right, flashy, and, uhm...neon. I can;t wait to by more OPI polishes!</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors love them</li>
            <li> Super cute and nice quality sampler set. I liked this a lot because they offer you the ability to test out these colors, without having to purchase full sized bottles. Great little sampler set! The colors go on well, and even the yellow and orange work well with two coats. I&#x27;d recommend this set. Like a lot of regular polishes, they do chip, but use a top &amp; base coat, and it&#x27;ll last longer.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles came broken</li>
            <li> This polish is very thick and goes on with many streaks.  Would recommend to get some thinner and put it in polish to thin it out before use.  I do like the colors though.</li>
            <li> Bottle size is Mini mini!!!</li>
            <li> Great colors, only reason I&#x27;m giving a 4 is because the bottles are A LOT smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> I saw these advertised at Ulta stores but were not at the 2 locations I checked. I have to say it again, I love Amazon and all their vendrs!</li>
            <li> love the colors! bottles are petite enough to hold and contain enough polish for several wears!</li>
            <li> It was great slightly better than the neons from last year my only complaint was that no white polish was included</li>
            <li> As advertised...fast shipping</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that the brushes in these little bottles is full size.  I specifically bought the polish for my toe nails and previous little bottles that I bought had a little brush.</li>
            <li> excellent , prompt service.... thank you</li>
            <li> This is not typical opi. It peels right off and the color is really dull. So disappointing.</li>
            <li> Love the neon colors! Best purchase ever :)</li>
            <li> Even with the OPI Put a Coat on white base coat, it still took 4 or more coats of color to get good coverage. Not happy with this set of polishes despite loving other OPI polishes. Ended up giving this set to a friend that loved the neon colors, she is more patient than me with applying multiple coats of polish.</li>
            <li> When I initially saw this at Sally&#x27;s I went nuts! I LOVE neon and was so excited that OPI finally made bright neon colors.  I bought the yellow and pink shades first.  My normal nail routine involves using a coat of white as the base, I find that no matter the color, it enhances it.  So I used one coat of my essie blanc, then two coats of the yellow.  It applied a little streaky at first but the second coat fixed that.  Dries somewhat matte so I used a glossy top coat.  I&#x27;m actually quite impressed because I haven&#x27;t had to touch up my manicure since I first applied it about a week ago which is pretty uncommon for me!  That being said, I loved them so much that I ordered the other 4 colors.  I also find that the colors are pretty true to the bottle and apply bright.</li>
            <li> Nice color but takes many coats to make a brighter color!</li>
