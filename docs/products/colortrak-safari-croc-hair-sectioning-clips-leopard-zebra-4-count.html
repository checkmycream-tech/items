            <li>Quick shipping</li>
            <li>they hold large amounts of locs out of the way securely without any stress, breakage or forcing.</li>
            <li>The other clips I own are rubberized, whereas these claim to be, but are just cheap plastic.</li>

            <li>They are gentle with the hair and yet hold well.</li>
            <li>ill be getting more!!</li>
            <li>This means traditional clips feel like they&#x27;re pulling at the scalp, and the hair slithers out, undermining the whole purpose of their use.</li>
            <li>Tried to manage my new hair style with traditional clips, and couldn&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>These are the only clips that hold my hair up, I now love the option of different colors because before they were only black or some other non-fashionable color.  </li>
            <li>The material seems a little cheap, I am very careful with these</li>

            <li> The material seems a little cheap, I am very careful with these</li>

            <li> Whether you&#x27;re separating hair for a style or do straighten or blow dry, these hold and do the job.</li>
            <li> Not worth it to send it back.  </li>
            <li> i have long dreadlocks and if i need to hold some out of the way for maintenance or whatever these do the job!!</li>
            <li> These are absolutely not rubberized.</li>
            <li> Finally, a clip that works with my very long and thick hair.  </li>
            <li> They slip through my wavy, long, medium thick hair and are not at all like the other Croc clips I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Get the black ones, those are rubberized as advertized</li>
            <li> These may be fine if you have low expectations but are severely disappointing if you believe this seller&#x27;s FALSE ADVERTISING or have used Croc clips in the past.</li>

            <li> I own other colortrak clips.  I believe these are not actually colortrak.  Compared to the other clips, the design of the clip itself is different, also the quality.  The other clips I own are rubberized, whereas these claim to be, but are just cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> I really like the concept, but sometime my hair falls out of the clip which is a no no. However, it doesn&#x27;t leave dents in my hair which I like.</li>

            <li> Ordered for myself &amp; my granddaughter.  Preferable to a pony tail elastic.... They grip &amp; hold up our hair in an attractive manner.  This is the 3rd set I&#x27;ve bought &amp; will probably buy more as the need arises.</li>

            <li> These clips are awesome.  They hold my hair without pinching it.  My hairstylist uses them and I had to get some for my own.</li>
            <li> Who would have thought one could love hair-styling clips? But these things are great! I have rather fine hair, and don&#x27;t like feeling anything tug on it. This means traditional clips feel like they&#x27;re pulling at the scalp, and the hair slithers out, undermining the whole purpose of their use. These clips are light, grab my hair, and hold it. Tried to manage my new hair style with traditional clips, and couldn&#x27;t do it. Now I receive a lot of compliments about how chic my hair is.</li>
            <li> The description says they are rubberized, they are not. The safari colored ones  are plastic and do not hold the hair well.  Get the black ones, those are rubberized as advertized</li>
            <li> These are the best clips ever, it hold think hair up beautifully when I do haircuts at my salon.. Highly recommend!!:)</li>
            <li> These clips have great grip and I iLove the cute animal patterns</li>

            <li> I love these clips. They are cute and a good price and they hold my thick hair perfectly while I am blow drying to ironing it. I have also used them to section my hair off while dying it and they work great</li>
            <li> Finally, a clip that works with my very long and thick hair.  I can blow out my hair with no issues now.</li>
