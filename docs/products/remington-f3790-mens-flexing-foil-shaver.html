    <ol>
            <li>and I no longer have to look for the best shaver.  </li>
            <li>If you want a recommendation for someone who doesn&#x27;t own stock in any of them, SKIP THIS ONE!!</li>
            <li>So I came online to see if others have experienced what I have.  </li>
            <li>This one does an amazing job for almost nothing!</li>
            <li>I have nothing good to say about this razor.</li>
            <li>I have found it does cut just about as good as any I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>it was much better!</li>
            <li>Called Remington, got a nice recording that I had reached their Madison, Wisconsin, headquarters, and there was not an obnoxious prompt to \\&quot;Press 1 for English\\&quot; like you so often get these days.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with the shave while the foil was still good.</li>
            <li>My new shaver, a Panasonic ES-RT51, gives the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this other shaver and am HAPPY WITH REMINGTON&#x27;S CUSTOMER SERVICE.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure thats the end of it.</li>
            <li>Since I keep my razors on the countertop, I want something a bit more stylish and not stringing all over the place, like the Braun I am replacing after many years, which has a compact coiled cord.</li>
            <li>Interestingly, the manual shows a coiled cord.</li>
            <li>given all that, four stars for the razor, and once my coiled power cord arrives, I think I will be most satisfied.</li>
            <li>So given all that, four stars for the razor, and once my coiled power cord arrives, I think I will be most satisfied.</li>
            <li>When I swapped the replacements in for the originals, the shave was 100% better.  </li>
            <li>The pop-out clipper thingy shaves better than the foil  *</li>
            <li>I have been satisfied with its service.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m REALLY glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>SO much better than my Braun.  </li>
            <li>Does it mostly do the job at a bargain entry price, yup.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to try a foil real quick.</li>
            <li>Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Shaves closely to skin and like it better than a Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco triple headers over the years and all were excellent and did the job.  </li>
            <li>But Remington did more than belch with this one.  </li>
            <li>I paid a bit more for them than this one, but they&#x27;ll be around years longer.  </li>
            <li>I  have had many Remington shavers and like them all except this one.</li>
            <li>I replaced it with an MS2 390 and love that one.</li>
            <li>This was the first time i purchased a remington product and it looks good.</li>
            <li>Nice sized screen made quick work of my beard.  </li>
            <li>did not cut very good, finally donated this to Salvation Army</li>
            <li>/&gt;i&#x27;ve had several norelco rotary and a couple of cheap panasonic screen razors that were a joy to own.</li>
            <li>More important, all the foils/cutters I have on my DA-307</li>
            <li>But for a cheap shaver, this model is fine...</li>
            <li>It felt smooth, not grabby, and did not irritate my rosacea-prone</li>
            <li>It felt smooth, not grabby, and did not irritate my rosacea-prone skin.   </li>
            <li>I may still have to return this one and go with one of the refurbished DA-307&#x27;s available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is a light duty shaver.</li>
            <li>enjoy.</li>
            <li>While I have only been using the R-4150 for about 5 weeks, I am THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED and LOVE it so far.  </li>
            <li>I got this free as the DA-307</li>
            <li>and this F3790 will fit on the electric models.  </li>
            <li>It has a great trimmer attachment which you should use to pre-trim any long hairs.</li>
            <li>It worked great but took a really long time.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s just a super cheap product meant to be sold in discount stores.</li>
            <li>If you want a super smooth shave</li>
            <li>right!</li>
            <li>A full charge will give me over a week of shaving.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
            <li>If you want a quieter razor with a more solid build-feel, spend more money.</li>
            <li>However, if it falls apart too quickly, I&#x27;ll update this post, and keep that two-year warranty and generous return policy in mind.erennial growth.</li>

            <li>Seems like I have to go over the beard more than I did with the old one to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>As to how well it shaves, I am satisfied so far.</li>
            <li>A truly useful screen cover that protects well and keeps things neat.    </li>
            <li>I am not crazy about it</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not very green and feels more like being cheated.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind spending money for quality but this inexpensive shaver does as good as any other shaver out there.  </li>
            <li>This shaver gives me a really close, clean shave.</li>
            <li>I have a full beard, so I don&#x27;t need one of those triple-headed beasts to cover acres of skin; therefore, I didn&#x27;t want to spend much money.</li>
            <li>Nice, compact,runs a long time on a charge,inexpensive and is out of production.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Remington electric shavers for many years, and when my last one wore out I bought this model, the F3790.</li>
            <li>WalMart no longer carries the model I was using, so I bought the most similar Remington product I could find.</li>
            <li>and this is the first one I&#x27;ve owned since then.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Remington product, and I feel deceived by the engineering flaw that they purposely designed into the product.  </li>
            <li>This would eliminate have so many different chargers in your travel bag.</li>
            <li>Most not have been profitable enough, my luck.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted for years.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it after the first try.  </li>
            <li>Would be nice if they come out with a shaver that can work of a USB plug like other electronics.</li>
            <li>The battery wouldn&#x27;t hold enough charge to get a good second shave on one charge.  </li>
            <li>the feeling I had was that this wasn&#x27;t the first time an irate customer had said much of what I was saying...)  </li>
            <li>but when they do, you can easily do a number on your face as the edges of the hole in the screen are similar to a jagged razor blade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had about 10 Remingtons since the 1980s, but got my first one when I graduated high school in 1965.  </li>
            <li>, it has the stainless steel blades, close shave</li>
            <li>The cost of replacing the head was almost as much as I paid for the shaver</li>
            <li>It costs as much to replace the foil as it does for the razor</li>
            <li>I was ready to give up after over 40 years of Remingtons, but I&#x27;ll give this one a chance.  </li>
            <li>I charged it up for the 24 hours recommended and really appreciated the fast close cut that it gives.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one obviously because it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i used this POS for a couple of months and was going through the hassle of trying to get reasonably shaved before i realized the foil had worn out and i was microslicing my face up.</li>
            <li>No coiled cord either; just a straight one that doesn&#x27;t pull against you.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 2 weeks, and at best it takes at least a half an hour of back-and-forth to make the job look half-a#@ed.</li>
            <li>Okay I&#x27;ve owned the razor for about a year and a half</li>
            <li>It takes longer for me to use this razor than if I use a razor &amp; shaving cream, and with this razor I have a lot more misses and skips, despite going over the same area multiple times.</li>
            <li>It works OK for the hairs on your chin and the sides of your face, but I had to go over the same area underneath my jaw and on my neck about 15 times and there are STILL hairs left that it just wont cut.  </li>
            <li>The foil on this razor lasted a little more than a month.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin much at all.</li>
            <li>product is not up to Remington&#x27;s normal standards.</li>
            <li>The cleaning brush, though, is big and stout, with two sets of bristles for cleaning different parts of the razor well, and it&#x27;s easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li>The cleaning brush, though, is big and stout, with two sets of bristles for cleaning different parts of the razor well, and it&#x27;s easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li>most definitely does not live up to the Remington name.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if there was some strange production problem that created the discontent in the other reviewers, but I&#x27;m VERY happy with my purchase.    </li>
            <li>She said I can use the razor I bought till the new one comes.</li>
            <li>...when they die you throw them away or buy new ones and you can wait hours to charge them.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>On the positive side, the 5790 recharges faster and will run either with our without the cord, whereas my old one only ran when charged up.  </li>
            <li>lightweight shaver, does a fine job (if you don&#x27;t have a heavy bread).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little noisy and light on the plastics.</li>
            <li>The trimmer doesn&#x27;t work very well, and the shaver blade can&#x27;t get even a three day old whisker(need to be really short).  </li>
            <li>and we grind the razor back and forth so much to get shaved - which of course wears the screen out faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They have no battery, instant continuous power, no waiting for charge times, and much quieter than the buzzy rechargeables like this.  </li>
            <li>Since a new shaver is about the same price as a screen and cutter set, I decided to just buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li>i have RARELY had a screen wear out on me (with other brands)</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s decent</li>
            <li>Got most of the longer facial residents without a problem, and the few it left I trimmed with scissors because I have to do that anyway around my perennial growth.</li>
            <li>I got this because it was almost the same price as new coils for my \\&quot;real\\&quot; Remington shaver.</li>
            <li>Because it was such a new purchase and still in warranty, they suggested a ROTARY replacement unit.  </li>
            <li>All other brands are nonsense, this is the real McCoy!  </li>
            <li>Very light in weight too (a little less than 5 oz on my postal scale).  </li>
            <li>They work well at first; the foil only last less than a year and replacement foils cost as much as a complete new shaver.</li>
            <li>I went over my face several times and was never able to make it feel smooth.</li>
            <li>When the microscreen wore out on my old one, I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement locally.</li>
            <li>I tried using it to cut week old facial hair</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the same quality as the old one I had.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I&#x27;m a mutant, but I have several hairs that are completely impervious to this thing.  </li>
            <li>I think I spent about as much time shaving with it as I do with a disposable blade and cream.</li>
            <li>My old Norelco finally bit the dust after years of service, so I went shopping for a replacement.  </li>
            <li>For every shave I have to complete the job properly with the trusty manual razor.</li>
            <li>This razor is not worth even five dollars because it really is a joke!  </li>
            <li>Much better than some of the flimsy little Barbie Doll brushes that have come with previous razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better than some of the flimsy little Barbie Doll brushes that have come with previous razors.   </li>
            <li>So, with my current batch of Remington rechargeables starting to die, this week I bought 2 Remington Microscreen 2 CORD ONLY shavers, brand new, factory sealed.  </li>
            <li>The motor is underpowered and bogs down on longer hairs, and in general this shaver doesn&#x27;t cut very close at all.</li>
            <li>Then, after almost no wait at all, a helpful rep speaking standard American English came on the line, quickly confirmed that the power cord was wrong for the model, and arranged to ship me a new razor package with the coiled cord, and a box for returning the old unit.</li>
            <li>The only negative thing is that it&#x27;s pretty loud, but it won&#x27;t wake up the neighbors.</li>
            <li>their greed has gotten the better of them and the screens are too thin to last long or even be manufactured reliably.</li>
            <li>Very uneven, and probably wears out quickly - I won&#x27;t be using this long enough to figure that out, though.</li>

            <li> but when they do, you can easily do a number on your face as the edges of the hole in the screen are similar to a jagged razor blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had about 10 Remingtons since the 1980s, but got my first one when I graduated high school in 1965.  </li>
            <li> , it has the stainless steel blades, close shave</li>
            <li> The cost of replacing the head was almost as much as I paid for the shaver</li>
            <li> It costs as much to replace the foil as it does for the razor</li>
            <li> I was ready to give up after over 40 years of Remingtons, but I&#x27;ll give this one a chance.  </li>
            <li> I charged it up for the 24 hours recommended and really appreciated the fast close cut that it gives.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one obviously because it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i used this POS for a couple of months and was going through the hassle of trying to get reasonably shaved before i realized the foil had worn out and i was microslicing my face up.</li>
            <li> No coiled cord either; just a straight one that doesn&#x27;t pull against you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 2 weeks, and at best it takes at least a half an hour of back-and-forth to make the job look half-a#@ed.</li>
            <li> Okay I&#x27;ve owned the razor for about a year and a half</li>
            <li> It takes longer for me to use this razor than if I use a razor &amp; shaving cream, and with this razor I have a lot more misses and skips, despite going over the same area multiple times.</li>
            <li> It works OK for the hairs on your chin and the sides of your face, but I had to go over the same area underneath my jaw and on my neck about 15 times and there are STILL hairs left that it just wont cut.  </li>
            <li> The foil on this razor lasted a little more than a month.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin much at all.</li>
            <li> product is not up to Remington&#x27;s normal standards.</li>
            <li> The cleaning brush, though, is big and stout, with two sets of bristles for cleaning different parts of the razor well, and it&#x27;s easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li> The cleaning brush, though, is big and stout, with two sets of bristles for cleaning different parts of the razor well, and it&#x27;s easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li> most definitely does not live up to the Remington name.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there was some strange production problem that created the discontent in the other reviewers, but I&#x27;m VERY happy with my purchase.    </li>
            <li> She said I can use the razor I bought till the new one comes.</li>
            <li> ...when they die you throw them away or buy new ones and you can wait hours to charge them.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> On the positive side, the 5790 recharges faster and will run either with our without the cord, whereas my old one only ran when charged up.  </li>
            <li> lightweight shaver, does a fine job (if you don&#x27;t have a heavy bread).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy and light on the plastics.</li>
            <li> The trimmer doesn&#x27;t work very well, and the shaver blade can&#x27;t get even a three day old whisker(need to be really short).  </li>
            <li> and we grind the razor back and forth so much to get shaved - which of course wears the screen out faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They have no battery, instant continuous power, no waiting for charge times, and much quieter than the buzzy rechargeables like this.  </li>
            <li> Since a new shaver is about the same price as a screen and cutter set, I decided to just buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> i have RARELY had a screen wear out on me (with other brands)</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s decent</li>
            <li> Got most of the longer facial residents without a problem, and the few it left I trimmed with scissors because I have to do that anyway around my perennial growth.</li>
            <li> I got this because it was almost the same price as new coils for my \\&quot;real\\&quot; Remington shaver.</li>
            <li> Because it was such a new purchase and still in warranty, they suggested a ROTARY replacement unit.  </li>
            <li> All other brands are nonsense, this is the real McCoy!  </li>
            <li> Very light in weight too (a little less than 5 oz on my postal scale).  </li>
            <li> They work well at first; the foil only last less than a year and replacement foils cost as much as a complete new shaver.</li>
            <li> I went over my face several times and was never able to make it feel smooth.</li>
            <li> When the microscreen wore out on my old one, I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement locally.</li>
            <li> I tried using it to cut week old facial hair</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the same quality as the old one I had.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m a mutant, but I have several hairs that are completely impervious to this thing.  </li>
            <li> I think I spent about as much time shaving with it as I do with a disposable blade and cream.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco finally bit the dust after years of service, so I went shopping for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> For every shave I have to complete the job properly with the trusty manual razor.</li>
            <li> This razor is not worth even five dollars because it really is a joke!  </li>
            <li> Much better than some of the flimsy little Barbie Doll brushes that have come with previous razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much better than some of the flimsy little Barbie Doll brushes that have come with previous razors.   </li>
            <li> So, with my current batch of Remington rechargeables starting to die, this week I bought 2 Remington Microscreen 2 CORD ONLY shavers, brand new, factory sealed.  </li>
            <li> The motor is underpowered and bogs down on longer hairs, and in general this shaver doesn&#x27;t cut very close at all.</li>
            <li> Then, after almost no wait at all, a helpful rep speaking standard American English came on the line, quickly confirmed that the power cord was wrong for the model, and arranged to ship me a new razor package with the coiled cord, and a box for returning the old unit.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing is that it&#x27;s pretty loud, but it won&#x27;t wake up the neighbors.</li>
            <li> their greed has gotten the better of them and the screens are too thin to last long or even be manufactured reliably.</li>
            <li> Very uneven, and probably wears out quickly - I won&#x27;t be using this long enough to figure that out, though.</li>
            <li> It is noisy and gives a very poor shave leaving many whiskers untouched despite multiple attempts.  </li>
            <li> It does feel much flimsier than the DA-307, so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> power button slides to the on position as opposed to clicking, which is a bit less convenient than my old Braun that had a push-button on/off.</li>
            <li> The power button slides to the on position as opposed to clicking, which is a bit less convenient than my old Braun that had a push-button on/off.</li>
            <li> it will be a long time before i touch a remington again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a long time Remington fan, and I will once again be a fan.  </li>
            <li> * Would make a good gift for someone I hate  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed on opening the box was the flimsy power cord attached to an ugly black AC brick - like something from a cheap set of speakers.</li>
            <li> when i started looking closely at one of the new razors that was STILL IN ITS SEALED BOX, THE SCREEN THERE IN THE PACKAGE ON THE RAZOR ALREADY HAD A SMALL HOLE IN IT.</li>
            <li> Use razor for 15-30 maddening minutes until your face is sore and you have less than 50 \\&quot;stubborn\\&quot; hairs that this thing has apparently signed a \\&quot;non-aggression\\&quot; treaty with.    </li>
            <li> Not a very good product as far as the foil goes.</li>
            <li> If I go a week without shaving, I have to use the trimmer to cut the hair short enough so the razor doesn&#x27;t get bogged down in longer hair.  </li>
            <li> I just spent 15 minutes trying to shave with this thing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using a regular razor, and thought with an electric razor I could get the same close shave in less time and less mess.  </li>
            <li> I used my previous razor for a year, the blades were getting dull and it is recommended you replace them every year, it is cheaper just to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> Each time I replace one, it is always a little smaller than the previously shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased the F3790 at a local store as a replacement for my second DA-307, because the battery was getting weak and the trimmer no longer worked.  </li>
            <li> Can you think of any other appliance that when you need to use it, you have to plug it in for a half hour or an hour before you can use it?     </li>
            <li> And then forced to use one of these pieces of junk as their sole means of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I went into the Wal-Mart seeking a replacement screen for my Braun, I discovered this model on sale for less that a screen/blade replacement.  </li>
            <li> Little was being cut in the thick areas of my chin and much was missed even in the thin.  </li>
            <li> Been using the little shavers for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> This Remington was a big disappointment, but was the only foil Remington the shelf at WalMart.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blond, so I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> remington tried to put the consumer back in that revenue stream and engineered the FOILS TOO THIN and that is why people are complaining of having to REPLACE THEM</li>
            <li> Then I removed the head and saw that the cutter had about half the blades, and the screen was at least 10% narrower than the SP-62 parts.  </li>
            <li> I had a Remington in the past that didn&#x27;t have any of these problems, but it died after a year of use and I threw it away about three years ago</li>
            <li> I ditto the review of Mr Flowers, except I had been buying replacement foils and blades for the past three years on-line.  </li>
            <li> Like the small size for caring in my shaving kit when I  travel.</li>
            <li> This shaver is also one of the loudest ones I have used in the past twenty years.</li>
            <li> , right, this is a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> I do know people who often press the shaver hard against their face do damage them.  </li>
            <li> and I have mixed feelings on the effectiveness of it&#x27;s cutting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised that WalMart sells such a terrible product.</li>
            <li> * Guaranteed to make you late for work  </li>
            <li> I have a thicker beard and this razor was not effective at all.</li>
            <li> All the negative reviews here are correct.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t have an excessively thick stubble.</li>
            <li> If you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> the part being sold out was definitely not a good sign.</li>
            <li> but as for now, this rotary is CUTTING CLOSER THAN ANY OTHER ROTARY I HAVE HAD</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I had to agree - the shave was awful.  </li>
            <li> This does seem like this is the weak point in the razor.  </li>
            <li> a thin screen will give a closer shave</li>
            <li> and I was never happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately its not up to Remington&#x27;s standards, cuts very poorly, the trimmer is poorly positioned, and its so lightweight if it gets knocked off the sink</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not read the reviews before I bought it.    </li>
            <li> Tonight was absolutely horrible when I tried to shave as it had been four or five days since last shave!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so bad</li>
            <li> (Too bad the thing is made in China, but what do you expect these days?)</li>
            <li> In this case all the bad reviews do justice to this piece of junk.    </li>
            <li> am disappointed every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to replace this piece of crap.</li>
            <li> I just got done trying to give myself a shave for 20 minutes with this piece of crap.  </li>
            <li> It is worthless.</li>
            <li> I called their warranty service because I thought I had a bad razor, and they told me they that this is by design!  </li>
            <li> This is the noisiest and worst shaver I have ever owned.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This shaver gives me a really close, clean shave. I have spent a lot more money on shavers before that gave me much worse shaves. This one does an amazing job for almost nothing! I&#x27;m not going to use any different shavers after this one!!</li>
            <li> Remington F3790: This is the noisiest and worst shaver I have ever owned. I have nothing good to say about this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington electric shavers for many years, and when my last one wore out I bought this model, the F3790. Unfortunately its not up to Remington&#x27;s standards, cuts very poorly, the trimmer is poorly positioned, and its so lightweight if it gets knocked off the sink I&#x27;m sure thats the end of it. Maybe its time to switch brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always like Remington products. When the microscreen wore out on my old one, I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement locally. Since a new shaver is about the same price as a screen and cutter set, I decided to just buy a new shaver. WalMart no longer carries the model I was using, so I bought the most similar Remington product I could find. It was the F3790.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several days of usage, I&#x27;m thinking of returning it. The motor is underpowered and bogs down on longer hairs, and in general this shaver doesn&#x27;t cut very close at all. It takes several passes over the same area to get satisfactory results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not up to Remington&#x27;s normal standards. They must know this, as it&#x27;s not even mentioned on their website. I think it&#x27;s just a super cheap product meant to be sold in discount stores. But it&#x27;s so bad it&#x27;s bound to hurt Remington&#x27;s reputation.</li>
            <li> I got this razor for Christmas from my girlfriend.  I don&#x27;t like using a regular razor, and thought with an electric razor I could get the same close shave in less time and less mess.  That does not happen with this razor.  If I go a week without shaving, I have to use the trimmer to cut the hair short enough so the razor doesn&#x27;t get bogged down in longer hair.  I tried using it to cut week old facial hair and it didn&#x27;t.  I had a Remington in the past that didn&#x27;t have any of these problems, but it died after a year of use and I threw it away about three years ago and this is the first one I&#x27;ve owned since then.  This isn&#x27;t the same quality as the old one I had.  It takes longer for me to use this razor than if I use a razor &amp; shaving cream, and with this razor I have a lot more misses and skips, despite going over the same area multiple times.</li>
            <li> I used my previous razor for a year, the blades were getting dull and it is recommended you replace them every year, it is cheaper just to buy a new razor. I bought this one because it is cordless, it has the stainless steel blades, close shave blah blah blah, ya, right, this is a piece of crap. I have to use a regular razor to get what this razor misses after several passes, if i still had the packaging i would take it back. You can&#x27;t even use it while it is plugged in like my last razor either. I can&#x27;t wait to replace this piece of crap.</li>
            <li> This is my first Remington product, and I feel deceived by the engineering flaw that they purposely designed into the product.  This is an appliance that will not run when it&#x27;s plugged in. The cord&#x27;s only purpose is to charge the unit. Can you think of any other appliance that when you need to use it, you have to plug it in for a half hour or an hour before you can use it?     I called their warranty service because I thought I had a bad razor, and they told me they that this is by design!  If I had realized this, I would not have purchased it -- I don&#x27;t remember any warning about this being on the packaging.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the mistake of buying this thing. I&#x27;ve had it for 2 weeks, and at best it takes at least a half an hour of back-and-forth to make the job look half-a#@ed. Very uneven, and probably wears out quickly - I won&#x27;t be using this long enough to figure that out, though.</li>
            <li> Bought my F-3790 at a local big box store. The first thing I noticed on opening the box was the flimsy power cord attached to an ugly black AC brick - like something from a cheap set of speakers. Since I keep my razors on the countertop, I want something a bit more stylish and not stringing all over the place, like the Braun I am replacing after many years, which has a compact coiled cord. Interestingly, the manual shows a coiled cord. Called Remington, got a nice recording that I had reached their Madison, Wisconsin, headquarters, and there was not an obnoxious prompt to \\&quot;Press 1 for English\\&quot; like you so often get these days. Then, after almost no wait at all, a helpful rep speaking standard American English came on the line, quickly confirmed that the power cord was wrong for the model, and arranged to ship me a new razor package with the coiled cord, and a box for returning the old unit. She said I can use the razor I bought till the new one comes. Big, big kudos to Remington for responding like that! (Too bad the thing is made in China, but what do you expect these days?) Also, Remington has a 30-day satisfaction guarantee - return to your retailer for money back if you don&#x27;t like it; and it has a two-year warranty. So, five stars for customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the razor itself: After reading the negatives here I was worried. But folks, this is one of their lower-end razors. It&#x27;s a little noisy and light on the plastics. If you want a quieter razor with a more solid build-feel, spend more money. As to how well it shaves, I am satisfied so far. I have a full beard, so I don&#x27;t need one of those triple-headed beasts to cover acres of skin; therefore, I didn&#x27;t want to spend much money. I also don&#x27;t have an excessively thick stubble. However, I had not shaved in three days, so I put this to the test, and it performed well. Got most of the longer facial residents without a problem, and the few it left I trimmed with scissors because I have to do that anyway around my perennial growth. It felt smooth, not grabby, and did not irritate my rosacea-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power button slides to the on position as opposed to clicking, which is a bit less convenient than my old Braun that had a push-button on/off. The cleaning brush, though, is big and stout, with two sets of bristles for cleaning different parts of the razor well, and it&#x27;s easy to hold onto. Much better than some of the flimsy little Barbie Doll brushes that have come with previous razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So given all that, four stars for the razor, and once my coiled power cord arrives, I think I will be most satisfied. However, if it falls apart too quickly, I&#x27;ll update this post, and keep that two-year warranty and generous return policy in mind.erennial growth.

            <li> This shaver lasted only 8 months before the screen wore out with a tear.  The battery wouldn&#x27;t hold enough charge to get a good second shave on one charge.  It is noisy and gives a very poor shave leaving many whiskers untouched despite multiple attempts.  It also gives an abrasive shave.  The cost of replacing the head was almost as much as I paid for the shaver so I abandoned it after 8 months of use.  My new shaver, a Panasonic ES-RT51, gives the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I ordered the F3790 shaver to replace the one I had been using for years.  They sent me the F5790 instead (mispick?) and It is bulkier with three blades instead of two and I have mixed feelings on the effectiveness of it&#x27;s cutting.  Seems like I have to go over the beard more than I did with the old one to get a clean shave.  On the positive side, the 5790 recharges faster and will run either with our without the cord, whereas my old one only ran when charged up.  Plugging it in didn&#x27;t help until 24 hours later.  Jury is still out on the replacement.</li>
            <li> I ditto the review of Mr Flowers, except I had been buying replacement foils and blades for the past three years on-line.  This Remington was a big disappointment, but was the only foil Remington the shelf at WalMart.  Perhaps Remington should consider not selling this model. It does not speak well of the Remington brand.</li>
            <li> I just got done trying to give myself a shave for 20 minutes with this piece of crap.  It works OK for the hairs on your chin and the sides of your face, but I had to go over the same area underneath my jaw and on my neck about 15 times and there are STILL hairs left that it just wont cut.  I&#x27;m just going to have to go to work like this.  I&#x27;m going to buy a different razor tomorrow.  I&#x27;m surprised that WalMart sells such a terrible product.</li>
            <li> The foil on this razor lasted a little more than a month. It costs as much to replace the foil as it does for the razor so I got another razor. The foil on that one only lasted a month or so too. Not a very good product as far as the foil goes. I was satisfied with the shave while the foil was still good.</li>
            <li> I purchased the F3790 at a local store as a replacement for my second DA-307, because the battery was getting weak and the trimmer no longer worked.  One reason for choosing this one was the fact that it used the same SP-62 foil and cutter, which I had recently replaced.  After purchase, I read the reviews on Amazon and questioned my purchase.  The first time I used it, I had to agree - the shave was awful.  Then I removed the head and saw that the cutter had about half the blades, and the screen was at least 10% narrower than the SP-62 parts.  When I swapped the replacements in for the originals, the shave was 100% better.  I was ready to give up after over 40 years of Remingtons, but I&#x27;ll give this one a chance.  It does feel much flimsier than the DA-307, so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last.  I may still have to return this one and go with one of the refurbished DA-307&#x27;s available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not read the reviews before I bought it.    In this case all the bad reviews do justice to this piece of junk.    I used it for 4 or 5 times and then it stopped shaving, the blades roll but no cigar...  I can only use the trimmer.    I dont know if it is a manufacturing problem or if there is a way to get it going again.    Anyway, do not bother with this shaver</li>
            <li> Pros:   * Hasn&#x27;t burst into flames yet  * Would make a good gift for someone I hate  * Guaranteed to make you late for work  * The pop-out clipper thingy shaves better than the foil  * Using it for a year will develop \\&quot;character\\&quot;    Cons:  * I just spent 15 minutes trying to shave with this thing and I look like a mangy dog.  * Perhaps I&#x27;m a mutant, but I have several hairs that are completely impervious to this thing.  * Somewhere there is a product team that allowed this thing to get to market - and that is an indictment of humanity itself      Recommendation:    If you are a glutton for punishement (like those religious zealots who self-flaggelate) and insist on using this razor, then here is the technique I suggest:    1) Use razor for 15-30 maddening minutes until your face is sore and you have less than 50 \\&quot;stubborn\\&quot; hairs that this thing has apparently signed a \\&quot;non-aggression\\&quot; treaty with.    2) Get shaving cream and a blade razor and finish the job.    3) Accidentally back over razor with car</li>
            <li> I tried going the route of buying a replacement cutter and screen for my fancier, more expensive shaver, only to find that the replacement was inferior to the OEM parts and had a very short life. For the price of replacement head you can have one or two of these models. I have been satisfied with its service.</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver...am disappointed every time I use it.  The trimmer doesn&#x27;t work very well, and the shaver blade can&#x27;t get even a three day old whisker(need to be really short).  I had a Remington shaver for approx. 25 years...it was much better!</li>
            <li> When I went into the Wal-Mart seeking a replacement screen for my Braun, I discovered this model on sale for less that a screen/blade replacement.  The Remington \\&quot;no hassle\\&quot; 30 day return it if you don&#x27;t like it guarantee along with the 2 year warranty sold made me take the chance.  And I&#x27;m REALLY glad that I did.  I charged it up for the 24 hours recommended and really appreciated the fast close cut that it gives.  SO much better than my Braun.  Very light in weight too (a little less than 5 oz on my postal scale).  Nice sized screen made quick work of my beard.  A truly useful screen cover that protects well and keeps things neat.    I&#x27;m not sure if there was some strange production problem that created the discontent in the other reviewers, but I&#x27;m VERY happy with my purchase.    -----------    Update: 5/5/11 - Okay I&#x27;ve owned the razor for about a year and a half and I&#x27;ve gone through two screens.  This does seem like this is the weak point in the razor.  Is it a premium razor?  Nope.  Does it mostly do the job at a bargain entry price, yup.</li>
            <li> I got this because it was almost the same price as new coils for my \\&quot;real\\&quot; Remington shaver. This is a light duty shaver. If you want a super smooth shave it is going to take you a while with this. I say put this in your glove compartment or keep at work for emergency purposes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used a rotary shaver but they chew up my skin so I wanted to try a foil real quick. I bought this one obviously because it was so cheap. It has a great trimmer attachment which you should use to pre-trim any long hairs. It worked great but took a really long time. I think I spent about as much time shaving with it as I do with a disposable blade and cream. It didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin much at all. Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s decent and you get what you pay for. I&#x27;m going to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco finally bit the dust after years of service, so I went shopping for a replacement.  I chose this one for two reasons...one, price and two, it is cordless.  BIG MISTAKE!!  Bottom line, it just doesn&#x27;t cut!  I have to &#x27;scrub&#x27; and &#x27;scrub&#x27;, and then it still leaves stubble.  I&#x27;m a blond, so I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard.  Yeah, it&#x27;s a bit noisy, but then that&#x27;s not a big deal.  Not cutting IS a big deal, at least for me.  If you want a recommendation for someone who doesn&#x27;t own stock in any of them, SKIP THIS ONE!!</li>
            <li> Been using the little shavers for quite a few years. Each time I replace one, it is always a little smaller than the previously shaver. A full charge will give me over a week of shaving. Like the small size for caring in my shaving kit when I  travel. Would be nice if they come out with a shaver that can work of a USB plug like other electronics. This would eliminate have so many different chargers in your travel bag.</li>
            <li> All other brands are nonsense, this is the real McCoy!  Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it. enjoy. A Great/Super Bargain. Truly.</li>
            <li> I have a thicker beard and this razor was not effective at all. I will be returning it. I do not recommend this product for men with medium-thicker beards. I went over my face several times and was never able to make it feel smooth.</li>
            <li> I SO WISH I HAD READ THESE REVIEWS HERE BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS PIECE O&#x27;DUKEY! part of the reason one buys a screen razor is to escape the oft quoted revenue stream of \\&quot;razors and razor blades.\\&quot; my guess is remington tried to put the consumer back in that revenue stream and engineered the FOILS TOO THIN and that is why people are complaining of having to REPLACE THEM TOO OFTEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i used this POS for a couple of months and was going through the hassle of trying to get reasonably shaved before i realized the foil had worn out and i was microslicing my face up. i have RARELY had a screen wear out on me (with other brands) but when they do, you can easily do a number on your face as the edges of the hole in the screen are similar to a jagged razor blade. and once a hole starts, the screen rapidly disintegrates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i went to the national retailer that i bought it from (target, wmart sells them too i think) to get a replacement screen THEY WERE SOLD OUT. the item i think was the part i needed was also $22 - ABOUT THE SAME PRICE AS THE FREAKIN&#x27; RAZOR. that&#x27;s not very green and feels more like being cheated. the part being sold out was definitely not a good sign. when i started looking closely at one of the new razors that was STILL IN ITS SEALED BOX, THE SCREEN THERE IN THE PACKAGE ON THE RAZOR ALREADY HAD A SMALL HOLE IN IT. JUNK! JUNK! JUNK! it was definitely a sealed package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my guess is their greed has gotten the better of them and the screens are too thin to last long or even be manufactured reliably. a thin screen will give a closer shave but maybe that also has something to do with why the screen isn&#x27;t &#x27;pulling up&#x27; the hairs and we grind the razor back and forth so much to get shaved - which of course wears the screen out faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve had several norelco rotary and a couple of cheap panasonic screen razors that were a joy to own. it will be a long time before i touch a remington again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;like i said, \\&quot;this isn&#x27;t therazor you&#x27;re looking for... move on...\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (2012-11-08 - 2 months after the above):  A week or two after writing the above, which was just a couple of months after the purchase, I contacted Remington and discussed the above with their customer service.  Because it was such a new purchase and still in warranty, they suggested a ROTARY replacement unit.  (FWIW, he couldn&#x27;t admit it but the feeling I had was that this wasn&#x27;t the first time an irate customer had said much of what I was saying...)  I have used both SCREEN and ROTARY razors and like them both for their different faults and strengths.  They replaced this unit with one from the rotary line they said was price equivalent:  R-4150.  While I have only been using the R-4150 for about 5 weeks, I am THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED and LOVE it so far.  I don&#x27;t know how the blades, screens, or batteries will hold up but as for now, this rotary is CUTTING CLOSER THAN ANY OTHER ROTARY I HAVE HAD AND AS CLOSE AS (OR CLOSER THAN?) ANY SCREEN I EVER HAD.  I am very happy with this other shaver and am HAPPY WITH REMINGTON&#x27;S CUSTOMER SERVICE.</li>
            <li> Nice, compact,runs a long time on a charge,inexpensive and is out of production. Most not have been profitable enough, my luck.</li>
            <li> Shaves closely to skin and like it better than a Norelco.  Have been using the F3790 Remington for 5 yrs and I no longer have to look for the best shaver.  The only negative thing is that it&#x27;s pretty loud, but it won&#x27;t wake up the neighbors.</li>
            <li> Back in the 80&#x27;s a Remington was given to me as a gift and I was never happy with it.  Just could not get a close shave with ut.  Since then I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco triple headers over the years and all were excellent and did the job.  When my last Norelco gave up the ghost a year ago I decided to try a manual razor a bit.  I am not crazy about it but it gets the job done.  Then this Christmas I received the Remington F3790 being reviewed here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Have used it four times and not once has it done the job right! For every shave I have to complete the job properly with the trusty manual razor. Tonight was absolutely horrible when I tried to shave as it had been four or five days since last shave! It was like shaving with no blades whatsoever! Little was being cut in the thick areas of my chin and much was missed even in the thin.  I don&#x27;t get it.  So I came online to see if others have experienced what I have.  Wow! All the negative reviews here are correct.  This razor is not worth even five dollars because it really is a joke!  My next razor will be a Norelco triple header.</li>
            <li> I am a long time Remington fan, and I will once again be a fan.  As soon as I can forget that I ever bought this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It most definitely does not live up to the Remington name.  Whomever on their marketing team let this shaver go to market should be deported to Siberia.  And then forced to use one of these pieces of junk as their sole means of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every company belches with a bum product now and then.  But Remington did more than belch with this one.  If you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind spending money for quality but this inexpensive shaver does as good as any other shaver out there.  My first one lasted for years. I am on number two now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had about 10 Remingtons since the 1980s, but got my first one when I graduated high school in 1965.  I got this free as the DA-307 I got was under warranty but dying.  I have found it does cut just about as good as any I&#x27;ve had.  I have had to replace foils every year or two, but I&#x27;ve never damaged a foil.  I do know people who often press the shaver hard against their face do damage them.  My only gripe is that it is a battery shaver (rechargeable)...when they die you throw them away or buy new ones and you can wait hours to charge them.  So, with my current batch of Remington rechargeables starting to die, this week I bought 2 Remington Microscreen 2 CORD ONLY shavers, brand new, factory sealed.  They have no battery, instant continuous power, no waiting for charge times, and much quieter than the buzzy rechargeables like this.  No coiled cord either; just a straight one that doesn&#x27;t pull against you.  I paid a bit more for them than this one, but they&#x27;ll be around years longer.  More important, all the foils/cutters I have on my DA-307 and this F3790 will fit on the electric models.  But for a cheap shaver, this model is fine...It is lightweight, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
            <li> did not cut very good, finally donated this to Salvation Army</li>
            <li> After a year, a piece of the metal flexing broke off which exposed the spinning razor.  This shaver is also one of the loudest ones I have used in the past twenty years.</li>
            <li> Junk. I  have had many Remington shavers and like them all except this one. You have to go over the same area multiple times to get any effect at all. It is worthless. I replaced it with an MS2 390 and love that one.</li>
            <li> This was the first time i purchased a remington product and it looks good. not faced any problems till now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> They work well at first; the foil only last less than a year and replacement foils cost as much as a complete new shaver.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd  Remington F3690 shaver. I bought this for traveling, while my 1st stays in the medicine cabinet at home.&lt;br /&gt;Good. lightweight shaver, does a fine job (if you don&#x27;t have a heavy bread).</li>
            <li> Worst shaver I have ever owned.  I stopped using it after the first try.  I paid under $20, and it was still overpriced.</li>
