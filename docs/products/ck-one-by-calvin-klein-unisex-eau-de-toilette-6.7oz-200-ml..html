            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It is amazing that we are able to get this item in a cheaper price, we also found out that the product is original and we didn&#x27;t expext to recieved it a bit sooner</li>

            <li>It is clean and refreshing and not too strong a scent.</li>
            <li>Great product, smells great, but all colognes come late from Amazon</li>
            <li>It easily fades away.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not as strong as I remember.</li>
            <li>Genuine product smells just as a remembered.</li>
            <li>I purchased through this vendor and the product seems genuine, however this does seem to be a problem (counterfeiting) that plagues Amazon vendors.  </li>
            <li>It is designed primarily for daytime wear.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I always enjoy using CK, is a old but good</li>
            <li>this is the first time I bought via Amazon because the price is very cheap.  </li>
            <li>excelente producto, 100% ORIGINAL</li>
            <li>i ordered a ck one from amazon thinking it would an original @</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;CK One has a fresh clean citrus based scent that I truly enjoy.  </li>
            <li>It adapts perfectly to your personality, I have known other people using it and it never smell even close one from the other, but all of them where nice, its notable in the person using it that it took care of itself, and is ready for the journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;im un able to cut the cost in any particular year if I choose so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it and it will always be highly recommended.</li>
            <li>She loves it very much!  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with product and delivery of same</li>
            <li>Super Fast Shipping!!</li>
            <li>like the fresh, yet elegant essences, that makes it a classic.</li>
            <li>I think I got what my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>another one of the reasons I love Amazon and its endless supply of everything so very, very much!!!</li>
            <li>So right away I went and compared the smells which lead me to write this review.</li>
            <li>had Spicebonb of Victor&amp;Rolf but the One smell very well on my skin !</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and was exactly as advertized.</li>
            <li>very affordable!</li>
            <li>I ordered this last year because I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>this perfume is great for every day use, in case I am mio strong sweat and very few perfumes that last me a full day is is one of the few enduring a strong workday</li>
            <li>It smells refreshing, lasts long enough and makes you feel light.</li>
            <li>Delivered fast and package was not broken.</li>
            <li>thanks so much and would recommend this to everyone1</li>
            <li>Item was more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Smells super light, maybe even watered down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty big bottle, worth the price.</li>
            <li>Im never disappointed been buying these for the past few years Great deal ty</li>
            <li>For the uninitiated the scent contains top notes of bergamot, cardamom, fresh pineapple, papaya and green tea accord; middle notes of hedione high Cis (derived from jasmine), violet, rose, nutmeg and green tree accord; and bottom notes of musk and amber in the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I use this daily and it is just strong enough for people to notice and ask &amp;#34;is</li>
            <li>Did not look new</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a better deal buying this instead of the small bottles at Kohls for $15.</li>
            <li>It was VERY diluted, and most likely counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt; Be careful, future shoppers.</li>
            <li>I have use it twice so far</li>
            <li>It has such a lite, fresh, just stepped out of the shower scent that you can wear daily and it not be overbearing for you or others.</li>
            <li>what I love from it is the discretion that proyects, not dominant, neither low profile, just plain balance.</li>
            <li>This cologne is the same as the one they sell in Macy&#x27;s , except no salesperson or third party or overhead fee, so the price is right..</li>
            <li>enough to last the rest of her life the first time.  </li>
            <li>Was a gift for Secret Santa and they were pleased.</li>

            <li> Was a gift for Secret Santa and they were pleased.</li>
            <li> Wal-Mart sells this co in a small bottle for too much</li>
            <li> with the scent of the original compared to what i bought from amazon, it is unmistakable that it is different, therefore a fake.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been a fan of CK One for a long time</li>
            <li> I cannot find any other place with this product cheaper and it takes only to days to arrive!</li>
            <li> Looks like an imitation.  </li>
            <li> This is an imitation.  </li>
            <li> Scent is there but looks awful light next to a bottle I purchased at department store n wears out within a couple hours.</li>
            <li> Came unsealed and with a few scratches on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than anywhere I can purchase locally.</li>
            <li> My signature scent - this is not the watered down scent that some people complained of.</li>
            <li> for a little price I will by again!</li>
            <li> The scent of the one I recieved smelled nothing like the one I buy at the store all the time (usually Kohls)</li>
            <li> I use it everyday !&lt;</li>
            <li> im not sure anymore.  </li>
            <li> this has a weird terrible scent I cant really describe and its very diluted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try and return this or at least get a refund.</li>
            <li> Some random alcoholic smell that has nothing to do with the CK One.</li>
            <li> 100% fake.</li>

            <li> Item arrived fast and in perfect condition.  Ordered for a Christmas gift and after searching was the best price I could find for the large bottle of CK1.</li>
            <li> Great size and smells great.</li>
            <li> The scent of the one I recieved smelled nothing like the one I buy at the store all the time (usually Kohls) this has a weird terrible scent I cant really describe and its very diluted. I thought I was getting a better deal buying this instead of the small bottles at Kohls for $15. But nooo. I&#x27;m going to try and return this or at least get a refund.</li>
            <li> price was unbeatable however not as strong-smelling as a store bought one.</li>
            <li> A piece of crap. 100% fake. I know because I re-bought this from a store and this smells nothing like it. No, I am not exaggerating, No, I am not making things up and no I have nothing against the retailer. The cologne smells like a blend of nail polish and vodka. Some random alcoholic smell that has nothing to do with the CK One.</li>
            <li> Great price, classic 90s  fragrance, prompt delivery....another one of the reasons I love Amazon and its endless supply of everything so very, very much!!!</li>

            <li> It arrived on time and was exactly as advertized.</li>
            <li> I remember this from years ago and thought that I would try it. It has such a lite, fresh, just stepped out of the shower scent that you can wear daily and it not be overbearing for you or others. Sure, I have &amp;#34;going out&amp;#34; cologne. I use this daily and it is just strong enough for people to notice and ask &amp;#34;is that you? you smell gooood&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love the product and the Amazon service! Can&#x27;t beat either one!</li>
            <li> Great price and smells awesome!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for years. It is clean and refreshing and not too strong a scent. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> this perfume is great for every day use, in case I am mio strong sweat and very few perfumes that last me a full day is is one of the few enduring a strong workday</li>
            <li> It is the perfect gift!!!!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Great price for a large bottle of CK One. Genuine product smells just as a remembered.</li>
            <li> I cannot find any other place with this product cheaper and it takes only to days to arrive! really, the best!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance. I love it and it will always be highly recommended. It has a nice scent and isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> good value. Good size.  Much less expensive than anywhere I can purchase locally.</li>
            <li> The smell is not as strong as I remember. Smells super light, maybe even watered down. I would not purchase this again through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a gift to my friend.  She loves it very much!  I love to see her happy smile:)</li>
            <li> Great product, smells great, but all colognes come late from Amazon</li>
            <li> this perfume is the best my favorite at all perfumes</li>
            <li> Scent is there but looks awful light next to a bottle I purchased at department store n wears out within a couple hours.</li>
            <li> All the products are very good.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter-in-law last year.  She was almost out, so the product lasts about a year.  It&#x27;s her favorite.</li>
            <li> as advertised/in perfect condition</li>
            <li> guys I gave this as a x-mass gift or b-day im not sure anymore.  why you ask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;every year it is requested by the receiving party.  that&#x27;s ok but the price keeps going up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;im un able to cut the cost in any particular year if I choose so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so what to do if you fall into this trap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buy enough to last the rest of her life the first time.  as a lot that way.</li>
            <li> Wal-Mart sells this co in a small bottle for too much $ this is a good deal. Smells good for men or woman but I do like it for a man better.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne, smells great and is very affordable.  Both my husband and I can wear it and it smells just a bit different on each of us.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a couple of weeks ago.... I have use it twice so far and I could tell the smell was not the same.... Last night I found my 3 oz bottle by miracle because I had miss place it months ago....So right away I went and compared the smells which lead me to write this review. I&#x27;m truly stunned on how AMAZON could fullfill this product without verifying it!! POINT BLANK..... DON&#x27;T BUY.... I&#x27;m going too see about a possible refund or exchange.</li>
            <li> Came unsealed and with a few scratches on the bottle. Did not look new</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product and delivery of same</li>
            <li> My favorite!  I love this stuff!! Great buying it and at a great price!  thanks so much and would recommend this to everyone1</li>
            <li> Great fragance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect for the daily use because and it does not invades your personality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fresh, yet elegant essences, that makes it a classic. It adapts perfectly to your personality, I have known other people using it and it never smell even close one from the other, but all of them where nice, its notable in the person using it that it took care of itself, and is ready for the journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also what I love from it is the discretion that proyects, not dominant, neither low profile, just plain balance.</li>
            <li> Fast service and great product!</li>
            <li> Review of: CK One by Calvin Klein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CK One has a fresh clean citrus based scent that I truly enjoy.  I purchased through this vendor and the product seems genuine, however this does seem to be a problem (counterfeiting) that plagues Amazon vendors.  For the uninitiated the scent contains top notes of bergamot, cardamom, fresh pineapple, papaya and green tea accord; middle notes of hedione high Cis (derived from jasmine), violet, rose, nutmeg and green tree accord; and bottom notes of musk and amber in the fragrance.  It is designed primarily for daytime wear.  Made for everyone.  Great!</li>
            <li> Great price  1/2 price of harmons</li>
            <li> My signature scent - this is not the watered down scent that some people complained of. It is the real thing - great price, will buy again.</li>
            <li> my hubby was wearing this when I met him....this brings back good memories!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like CK1.  It easily fades away.  Looks like an imitation.  I have been a CK1 user for more than 10 years and this is the first time I bought via Amazon because the price is very cheap.  I think I got what my money&#x27;s worth.  This is an imitation.  Buyers should be warned.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is clean and pleasant. It does not cloy or overwhelm the senses which is fantastic as I am sensitive/allergic to many products. It also lasts many hours without the need for reapplication. It works well as a unisex scent (and I still feel plenty feminine when wearing it!). I enjoy this as my go-to scent for both day and night!</li>
            <li> i ordered a ck one from amazon thinking it would an original @ such a bargain price.  after reading the views i decided to get it however to my disappointment the reviews are correct. with the scent of the original compared to what i bought from amazon, it is unmistakable that it is different, therefore a fake. i would surely return this item.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for Secret Santa and they were pleased.</li>
            <li> Very very good cologne. Although it&#x27;s unisex the smell in my opinion is more suited to males. One of the best colognes I&#x27;ve owned. By farrrrrrrrr.</li>
            <li> This is my third time to order. I still can&#x27;t believe the great price. The product is genuine and the service is great.</li>
            <li> Great size at a great price. So far so good. I would buy again. Just stated using it, let&#x27;s see if it holds.</li>
            <li> I brought this as a gift for my Mom. She&#x27;s been a fan of CK One for a long time so I decided to get this for her. She loves it, it came just in time.</li>
            <li> Me gusto mucho.. me gusto lo cumplidos que fueron con el envio! un excelente producto!Yo recomiendo que lo ordenen....Les va a gustar mucho realmente son lo que yo como comprador online esperaba.</li>
            <li> This cologne is the same as the one they sell in Macy&#x27;s , except no salesperson or third party or overhead fee, so the price is right..</li>
            <li> G-o-r-g-e-o-u-s scent. It&#x27;s clean. I just wish it lasted longer than it does--just the morning. If I call this a happy scent, it&#x27;s true that is dismisses any blah that comes my way. In contrast to the more expensive scents, this is quite affordable.</li>
            <li> I always enjoy using CK, is a old but good</li>
            <li> Arrived before schedule really happy with this product</li>
            <li> have always loved ck one!! and will forever!</li>
            <li> I love CK..have worn it for years...I will definately be ordering it again when I run out of this one.</li>
            <li> very affordable! I will never buy the ones from store again.</li>
            <li> I have to return this product. There is no spray nozzle for this product, and its scent is different from the CK one I have known before. I would caution those who are considering buying it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this last year because I love this fragrance. It was VERY diluted, and most likely counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt; Be careful, future shoppers.</li>
            <li> Great deal a lot of oz. for a little price I will by again!</li>
            <li> I love it. Nicely priced.I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Awesome price and very quick delivery</li>
            <li> Perfect for summer and day use. For work / lunch / movies / shopping</li>
            <li> Item was more than I expected.  The bottle came with a sprayer and was double the size I thought it would be.  This was a christmas gift and my mom loved it.</li>
            <li> I wanted or my husband no for me</li>
            <li> Super Fast Shipping!! Great product!</li>
