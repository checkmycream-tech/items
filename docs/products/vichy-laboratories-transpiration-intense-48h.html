            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW:</li>
            <li>This product is worth it and can change your life!</li>
            <li>the smell is very unisex which I love.</li>
            <li>Until then though, 48 is not bad.</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I bought this with the idea that it was aluminum free, but it&#x27;s not (it has 2 kinds of aluminum and not specified how much) though it is paraben free.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong, masculine scent.</li>
            <li>In my humble opinion this is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li>The 48 hr. is nice for not having to reapply constantly.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t help keeping my arm pits fresh.  </li>
            <li>There are many versions: 24 hr, 48 hr, sensitive, non-sensitive.</li>
            <li>It is pricey but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>your own personal hygiene counts.</li>
            <li>(believe me, it is), it&#x27;s not a nuisance on your clothes (It leaves stains if you use it right away</li>
            <li>Very easy to see it was not the same product.</li>
            <li>you are sensitive to strong scents/smells, this Vichy product is not for you.</li>
            <li>but they are easy to clean), it protects you from body odor for a long time (I don&#x27;t know about two days, though</li>
            <li>It is really working!</li>
            <li>In fact, they got really stinky!  </li>
            <li>I first bought this product while traveling in Spain.  </li>
            <li>I tried more than 20 different brands of deodorants.</li>
            <li>A few months before the surgery, a good friend of mine was in France and brought one for me to try on.</li>
            <li>I do believe that there are other Vichy products that are not as strong as this, but a word of warning, do not purchase this particular one if you have any sensitivities to strong</li>
            <li>You will stay dry and fresh all day!!</li>
            <li>This is crucial to those of use who use fragrance free products.</li>
            <li>very well.</li>
            <li>This antiperspirant works better than any other.</li>
            <li>: make sure your skin is clean and dry when applying and LET IT DRY before putting on your clothes.</li>
            <li>I may not be able to properly review this item for it&#x27;s effectiveness, as I&#x27;ve only had it on for 10 minutes and already have a headache from the</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Four stars out of five, though, because it&#x27;s highly scented.</li>
            <li>Fifteen dollars for a deodorant, I agree, is not a cheap price, but its better to pay $15 and stay away from an embarrassing situation than be the stink armpit lady of the group.</li>
            <li>Not Sticky, doesn&#x27;t stain clothes, dry&#x27;s quickly, last&#x27;s more then a day, washes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>I made an order on two occasions, the first time I was happy, but the second time, is totally different, no protection and no good smell.</li>
            <li>I feel like a new person.  </li>
            <li>actually keeps you fresh and dry for the whole day.</li>
            <li>so I definiteley use it daily), and it lasts a lot, from three to five months, depending on how much you use it.</li>
            <li>It has power for 48 hours and is for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>I completely agree.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time and money buying cheap deodorants.</li>
            <li>It might last for 48 hours for some people that don&#x27;t sweat as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much my style life was built around not showing my wet armpits in stressful situations.</li>
            <li>My favourite deodorant which has no harsh chemicals and actually works!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> You will stay dry and fresh all day!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. It&#x27;s just good. If this thing does not prevent you from having that awful round marks below your arm pits after a regular hot days, nothing will, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has the plus it does not have any kind of smell, it&#x27;s antiallergic (believe me, it is), it&#x27;s not a nuisance on your clothes (It leaves stains if you use it right away but they are easy to clean), it protects you from body odor for a long time (I don&#x27;t know about two days, though, anyhow, I take a shower at least once a day so I definiteley use it daily), and it lasts a lot, from three to five months, depending on how much you use it.</li>
            <li> This is basically the same formula as every $3.00 PER L6 OZ. OUT THERE.....it works ok...but you might as well use Ban or something if the status quo isnt suiting you because this is the same thing, except it NEVER dries....after 10 min and a blow dryer, I am still sitting here waiting.</li>
            <li> it does the job and also does not irritate skin and does not stain close</li>
            <li> I bought this in Spain and have used it for 9 months. That&#x27;s amazing for its longevity and it works great for me. The 48 hr. is nice for not having to reapply constantly. So glad you are carrying this product!</li>
            <li> I tried everything out there and nothing was as good as this one. This is the best deodorant I ever had. No white marks on clothes and the smell is very unisex which I love. Fresh and clean. I have dry armpits now all day long. Love it! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this years ago in Europe. Can&#x27;t find it in ANY stores in the US. So happy I found it here. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I may not be able to properly review this item for it&#x27;s effectiveness, as I&#x27;ve only had it on for 10 minutes and already have a headache from the scent.&lt;br /&gt;If you are sensitive to strong scents/smells, this Vichy product is not for you. It has a very strong, masculine scent. I do believe that there are other Vichy products that are not as strong as this, but a word of warning, do not purchase this particular one if you have any sensitivities to strong odors.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to need to take off deodorant before I can even test it&#x27;s effectiveness, before I pass out!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite anti perspirant. Easy to wash off and protects great from odor.</li>
            <li> Have to say it is a good product.  Sorry to say that it is way overpriced in my opinion.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Vichy Deodorant Roll-on Anti-perspirant Intense, 48 Hour is the best what I ever had :-) It is really working!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t help keeping my arm pits fresh.  In fact, they got really stinky!  Sorry - was really looking forward to using it.</li>
            <li> I made an order on two occasions, the first time I was happy, but the second time, is totally different, no protection and no good smell.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product while traveling in Spain.  Though  more expensive than over-the-counter products, this works and I never have to worry in the 110 degree AZ summer heat.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: BUY FROM SELLER SIMPLYBEAUTIFUL AT YOUR OWN RISK. They are selling and sending a SCENTED VERSION of this listing. They are not selling this listing. Product description specifies FRAGRANCE FREE. This is crucial to those of use who use fragrance free products. What they sent smelled strongly of cologne, had added scent in the ingredients, did not specify fragrance free. Very easy to see it was not the same product. I will only trust Omorfia.    ORIGINAL REVIEW: I am loving this! I didn&#x27;t realize how much my style life was built around not showing my wet armpits in stressful situations. Now I am amazed that I don&#x27;t have to worry. I&#x27;m regretting not saving my clothes by buying this sooner. I feel like a new person.  This is one of my favorite things. 2 tips though: make sure your skin is clean and dry when applying and LET IT DRY before putting on your clothes. It will not work if it isn&#x27;t allowed to dry.     Also, one gripe with ordering, is nowhere online can you see the Vichy products&#x27; ingredients. There are many versions: 24 hr, 48 hr, sensitive, non-sensitive. I bought this with the idea that it was aluminum free, but it&#x27;s not (it has 2 kinds of aluminum and not specified how much) though it is paraben free. I&#x27;d like to compare ingredients of the 48 hr versions.</li>
            <li> horrible and not worth the money</li>
            <li> The very best, most effective deodorant ever!</li>
            <li> This antiperspirant works better than any other. Four stars out of five, though, because it&#x27;s highly scented.</li>
            <li> In my humble opinion this is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;Works very well. Not Sticky, doesn&#x27;t stain clothes, dry&#x27;s quickly, last&#x27;s more then a day, washes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;No Scent.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is the best that I&#x27;ve tried so far. I will definitely continue to use it in future. It is pricey but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I go into a lot of combat situations and international dance parties whose lengths are difficult to predict ahead of time. Ideally I would like to have a deodorant that I can rely on for 72 hours or more. Until then though, 48 is not bad. Kudos to France for delivering this innovation in personal hygiene to the world.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. This is one of the few places where you&#x27;ll find Vichy deodorant.</li>
            <li> I tried this product to see if it works as well as the Vichy 72H and I wasn&#x27;t impressed. Not as strong for me. I will recommend the 72H over this.</li>
            <li> great product, after this NO SWEAT! no fragrance just perfect, defnitely recommend to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;Will going to order more...</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this deodorant/antiperspirant when I was in Europe two years ago and my bags were lost.  Unbelievably, I did not have an allergic reaction to it - everything I had been purchasing in the US I had been reacting to.  It&#x27;s the only deodorant/antiperspirant that I buy now.</li>
            <li> Went through many deodorants and I must say this is great. It has power for 48 hours and is for sensitive skin like mine. I go to the gym and feel great, love thats its roll on.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, does not build up and it works!  Has a clean feel and a great product.  I recommend buying</li>
            <li> Odorless.  Was looking for the one I purchase overseas.  Nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;Why don&#x27;t they sell that one here?</li>
            <li> Its just awesome. No smell, do not cause allergy (and I am extremely allergic to deodorants) actually keeps you fresh and dry for the whole day. I use this deodorant and only this one for 3 years now.</li>
            <li> I found this in France while traveling.  It is the best deodorant I have ever used. I am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> My favourite deodorant which has no harsh chemicals and actually works!</li>
            <li> will re order this,,,works perfect</li>
            <li> The Vichy deodorant changed my life. For more than 10 years I suffered bullying from my friends and family because of the way my underarms used to smell. I tried more than 20 different brands of deodorants. Anything people recommended to use to resolve my \\&quot;problem\\&quot; I did. Nothing worked. I decided to have surgery to reduce my glandules under my arms. A few months before the surgery, a good friend of mine was in France and brought one for me to try on. I can say that it was the best gift ever! I gave up on having surgery and I found out why 80% of the people who already used this specific deodorant would buy it again. The good ones show that most of the women who use this product experienced no odor at all after a long day at work or exercising. I completely agree. I can stay hours at the gym, go to parties with my friends, stay overtime at work during the weekends and It&#x27;s amazing that you still smell like your original cologne! Of course your own personal hygiene counts. Remember ladies that showering is essential. It&#x27;s a fantastic deodorant, but it won&#x27;t do miracles. Also, after waxing, it&#x27;s no irritation! The product carries proline cutei, an anti-irritation agent. Few reviews say that is expensive. Fifteen dollars for a deodorant, I agree, is not a cheap price, but its better to pay $15 and stay away from an embarrassing situation than be the stink armpit lady of the group. Like I said before, confidence is the word. Do your part and this deodorant is going to do the rest. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money buying cheap deodorants. This product is worth it and can change your life!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a deodorant, not an anti-perspirant. It works for about a day but there is some odor so I shower at night. It might last for 48 hours for some people that don&#x27;t sweat as much as I do.  But it does work better than most deodorants you buy at the drug store, Walmart, etc.</li>
            <li> Love how this smells!</li>
