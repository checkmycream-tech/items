            <li>Here&#x27;s what I do to get perfect results with this awesome brand!  </li>
            <li>Happy dyeing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since February of this year (2015) and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li>I am a happy customer!</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>Product is very good</li>
            <li>Great Shipping and great product!!!</li>
            <li>To a bright orange!</li>
            <li>Once it looked good, we put in the purple and it came out perfectly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased!  </li>
            <li>so I purchased Splat because the box has great graphics and it comes with the bleach.  </li>
            <li>Happy dyeing!or</li>
            <li>(I buy it at CVS, but Amazon&#x27;s the best for reviews :) )to towel off -</li>

            <li>Also, get some good gloves.  </li>
            <li>It began as a purpley-blue color, which I loved.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love this color!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love Splat!</li>
            <li>Honestly, if you&#x27;re going to use hair dye...go with Manic Panic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Not the cheap kind that comes with the dye, but some gloves for washing dishes.  </li>
            <li>This allows you to get better coverage and ensure that all the dye is used.  </li>
            <li>I still like the color, but perhaps reapplication will bring out more purple.  </li>
            <li>It did pull out some more color, and maybe that&#x27;s why I got the magenta...  </li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;m probably going to bleed off some more dye tonight in the shower.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.airline and get it into your hair, that part of your hair won&#x27;t take.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This color is more indigo than purple.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you could get more even results with more patience, but I like the randomness :)</li>
            <li>Much better than the salon-done purple streaks</li>
            <li>but I actually don&#x27;t care :D</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll probably take more care/</li>
            <li>and it also keeps my roots looking fresh since my hair is light brown, so the dye works perfectly on unbleached light hair to make it really pop.</li>
            <li>The color was very pigmented and yes my hair is a gorgeous purple.</li>
            <li>Dark ones are the best.  </li>
            <li>but once I blow dryed my hair, it had a purple tint in the light.</li>
            <li>if I used too much bleach my hair turned sort of orange (oops), otherwise it was perfect straw-colored blonde.</li>
            <li>bought this for a young lady that had long hair, I should have bought 2 boxes for better coverage, however, she was very happy with the color</li>
            <li>First let me say that when I bought it, the box says &amp;#34;long lasting&amp;#34; and at a glance I mistook that for permanent.. which I&#x27;m sure is what they intended..</li>
            <li>They use Dawn to clean the feathers of birds after they&#x27;ve been in an oil spill.  </li>
            <li>(this step is super important), and I pour it all over my head.  </li>

            <li>I love how vibrant this color is!</li>
            <li>I have a lot of silver hair around my face, and that came out looking blue-ish, but it looks cool.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked it because my hair didn&#x27;t look much different at all</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SUPER</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil might help get rid of stains/spots on the skin, (I use it as an antiseptic and if I get it too near my dyed hair, off comes the purple) - but really just patience, time &amp; good</li>

            <li>The bleach works great in my almost black hair and the color always comes out how I want.</li>
            <li>I can do it well, once, and with long hair as it grows out and shows from underneath my undyed hair, it looks bright and colorful for months.  </li>

            <li>: I&#x27;m currently reading the excellent biography &amp;#34;Mauve&amp;#34; by Simon Garfield, about the chemist who invented the first synthetic dye, mauveine .... related??</li>

            <li>I followed the directions on the bleach very carefully--which is important.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t burn, it&#x27;s mild, but you will look funny if it&#x27;s across your temple.&lt;br</li>

            <li>The purple is rich and vibrant!</li>
            <li>Get it off the shower walls right away, tho</li>

            <li>I wash, lathering up really well, rinse for a full five minutes and repeat.  </li>
            <li>Actually that makes for an easier application, but since I reapply and a bottle lasts me a good half-year I&#x27;ll keep the old lid too!</li>

            <li>Worked wonders better than when I initially had it done at the salon.</li>
            <li>I do bleach first.  </li>
            <li>how much you touch your head/neck area and get vaseline all over!).  </li>
            <li>how much you touch your head/neck area and get vaseline all over!).  </li>
            <li>I wanted to do my hair a fun color for summer and thought this was reasonably priced.</li>

            <li>old sauce jars or cheap Target plastic</li>
            <li>old sauce jars or cheap Target plastic</li>
            <li>I bleached another strip of hair, which ended more yellowy than blonde, and dyed it.</li>
            <li>The dye smells kind of like strong grape jelly and can be gross for long periods, the plastic keeps in the smell.  </li>
            <li>The dye smells kind of like strong grape jelly and can be gross for long periods, the plastic keeps in the smell.  </li>
            <li>And in those cases, it seems that having instructions for making multiple smaller batches of bleach would be a good idea.</li>
            <li>Only a few more $ to order online, got here in perfect condition and in less than a week.</li>
            <li>Originally I had her throw some blue on (Pravana brand blue), but it was more of a teal color</li>
            <li>(and it DOES apply evenly; my hair has different shades because I achieved different bleaching levels at front &amp; back, and when I apply a touch-up, I get a nice even overall bright purple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d need another jar now that they&#x27;ve stopped including &amp;#34;storage lids,&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s an easy enough fix ...</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d need another jar now that they&#x27;ve stopped including &amp;#34;storage lids,&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s an easy enough fix ...</li>
            <li>I would certainly use Splat again.</li>
            <li>The bleach didn&#x27;t do much to my hair.</li>
            <li>Which doesn&#x27;t really bleach darker hair unless you use the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use the whole bottle don&#x27;t dispose it in a bathroom trash can because it states in the instructions that the dye and bleach explode.</li>
            <li>shortly after taking a shower and when I woke up there was a fabulous tie-dye pattern shaped like my head ...</li>
            <li>Very close to the color on the box.</li>
            <li>It took approximately two or three weeks to fade, which I was happy with.</li>
            <li>My hands are constantly purple from touching my hair and even after HOURS of rinsing it never ever ever runs clear.  </li>
            <li>But as it faded more, before getting to the underlying blonde, it turned an almost hot pink color, but more red.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, me: I have long brown to light brown straight hair.  </li>
            <li>and I have long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s easy when wet, not so easy when dry!</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s easy when wet, not so easy when dry!</li>
            <li>I realize I might not have to, but i want it vibrant.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, since I transitioned into all-purple and did the front on my own and the back with the help of a friend, the purple is sort of an all-over ombr&amp;eacute;/reminiscent of a hand-dyed yarn ...</li>
            <li>I assume that with bright colors like these, it&#x27;s pretty common to only do some parts of the hair.</li>
            <li>When my roots grew out, I used blue envy all over to keep my highlights looking vibrant and fun.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I came out with a dark magenta rather than purple.  </li>
            <li>the more it will give you long lasting color.  </li>
            <li>Leave it in for 2 hours or more, expect long lasting color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally I buy Splat at Walmart but for some reason they stopped selling Purple Desire.</li>
            <li>When I get down to the last bit of dye in the bottle, I mix a splash of warm water and shake, then pour the remaining dye into the bowl.  </li>
            <li>just bought a new bottle today at CVS and they&#x27;ve stopped including screw-on lids, just the nozzles are included now.</li>
            <li>just bought a new bottle today at CVS and they&#x27;ve stopped including screw-on lids, just the nozzles are included now.</li>
            <li>I shampoo it less frequently than I used to (but still a few times a week) and it stays very nicely.</li>
            <li>(I never use enough ;)</li>
            <li>so I guess it&#x27;s pretty obvious.</li>
            <li>several so if I spatter somewhere, I can snap off a glove, clean the spot immediately, and then put gloves back on.  </li>
            <li>I used the bleach to turn my normally brown hair blonde, and realized less is more ...</li>
            <li>Also, as I said before, I didn&#x27;t use the bleach, so the purple is really only noticeable at the top of my head where the hair started to grow out and was a little lighter.</li>
            <li>I rinse for five minutes trying to get the water to run clear.  </li>
            <li>It did take about 20 min for the water to run clear, as the directions said to do, but eventually it did run clear.  </li>
            <li>I ruined towels, clothes, bedding and even my couch because this stuff NEVER rinses clear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cover the bathroom with old towels.  </li>
            <li>Leave that one open and ready to drop things into it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>keep using the old one to towel off -</li>
            <li>I used it on my hair that was lightened and on my daughters hair that is naturally blond.</li>
            <li>I have purple towels anyway, so when I switch to my new set (I&#x27;m making hot pink ones for fall)</li>
            <li>I only did one streak, the bleach worked faster than I thought, and I didn&#x27;t go the full pale blonde more of a dark blonde, as I didn&#x27;t want to damage my hair too much.  </li>
            <li>It faded, in my hair anyway, into a rich royal purple, then to a pale lavender.</li>
            <li>After washing with my normal shampoo (this is three weeks after the last application of dye)  </li>
            <li>I washed and showered as normal, but used a deep conditioner because I was worried about having bleached my hair.  </li>
            <li>The first application was really dark--</li>
            <li>The bleach barely bleached my hair, so we had to apply it twice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing, not a lot, barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided to try to a different brand that offers a permanent purple dye.</li>
            <li>I used very little of the bleach, but it got my hair from a medium-light brown to a nice blonde in about half an hour, maybe 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>And so long as your hair is wet, it can stain clothes (in the first few days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down side: color stains, runs in the shower for a week or two (I wash my hair every day, if you wash less, i&#x27;m sure it might run a bit longer?).</li>
            <li>Vibrant, long lasting color.  </li>

            <li>Vibrant, long lasting color.  </li>
            <li>The only issue with the process was the gloves are HUGE and hard to reuse for future/secondary applications.</li>
            <li>and I wanted something more dramatic.  </li>
            <li>I have used the bleach it comes with, which works fine - I just find that doing it myself with very long hair gets tedious, first doing the bleach then the color.  </li>
            <li>The bleach kicks butt and worked very well on my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>so if you really want it tight to your head...</li>
            <li>so if you really want it tight to your head...</li>
            <li>I have a few large chunks of hair that I will bleach</li>
            <li>Basically every 6-8 weeks, whenever it&#x27;s more plum than violet (and it fades very slowly!)</li>

            <li> I bleached another strip of hair, which ended more yellowy than blonde, and dyed it.</li>

            <li> And in those cases, it seems that having instructions for making multiple smaller batches of bleach would be a good idea.</li>
            <li> Only a few more $ to order online, got here in perfect condition and in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Originally I had her throw some blue on (Pravana brand blue), but it was more of a teal color</li>
            <li> (and it DOES apply evenly; my hair has different shades because I achieved different bleaching levels at front &amp; back, and when I apply a touch-up, I get a nice even overall bright purple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d need another jar now that they&#x27;ve stopped including &amp;#34;storage lids,&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s an easy enough fix ...</li>

            <li> I would certainly use Splat again.</li>
            <li> The bleach didn&#x27;t do much to my hair.</li>
            <li> Which doesn&#x27;t really bleach darker hair unless you use the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use the whole bottle don&#x27;t dispose it in a bathroom trash can because it states in the instructions that the dye and bleach explode.</li>
            <li> shortly after taking a shower and when I woke up there was a fabulous tie-dye pattern shaped like my head ...</li>
            <li> Very close to the color on the box.</li>
            <li> It took approximately two or three weeks to fade, which I was happy with.</li>
            <li> My hands are constantly purple from touching my hair and even after HOURS of rinsing it never ever ever runs clear.  </li>
            <li> But as it faded more, before getting to the underlying blonde, it turned an almost hot pink color, but more red.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, me: I have long brown to light brown straight hair.  </li>
            <li> and I have long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s easy when wet, not so easy when dry!</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s easy when wet, not so easy when dry!</li>
            <li> I realize I might not have to, but i want it vibrant.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, since I transitioned into all-purple and did the front on my own and the back with the help of a friend, the purple is sort of an all-over ombr&amp;eacute;/reminiscent of a hand-dyed yarn ...</li>
            <li> I assume that with bright colors like these, it&#x27;s pretty common to only do some parts of the hair.</li>
            <li> When my roots grew out, I used blue envy all over to keep my highlights looking vibrant and fun.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I came out with a dark magenta rather than purple.  </li>
            <li> the more it will give you long lasting color.  </li>
            <li> Leave it in for 2 hours or more, expect long lasting color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally I buy Splat at Walmart but for some reason they stopped selling Purple Desire.</li>
            <li> When I get down to the last bit of dye in the bottle, I mix a splash of warm water and shake, then pour the remaining dye into the bowl.  </li>
            <li> just bought a new bottle today at CVS and they&#x27;ve stopped including screw-on lids, just the nozzles are included now.</li>

            <li> I shampoo it less frequently than I used to (but still a few times a week) and it stays very nicely.</li>
            <li> (I never use enough ;)</li>
            <li> so I guess it&#x27;s pretty obvious.</li>
            <li> several so if I spatter somewhere, I can snap off a glove, clean the spot immediately, and then put gloves back on.  </li>
            <li> I used the bleach to turn my normally brown hair blonde, and realized less is more ...</li>
            <li> Also, as I said before, I didn&#x27;t use the bleach, so the purple is really only noticeable at the top of my head where the hair started to grow out and was a little lighter.</li>
            <li> I rinse for five minutes trying to get the water to run clear.  </li>
            <li> It did take about 20 min for the water to run clear, as the directions said to do, but eventually it did run clear.  </li>
            <li> I ruined towels, clothes, bedding and even my couch because this stuff NEVER rinses clear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cover the bathroom with old towels.  </li>
            <li> Leave that one open and ready to drop things into it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> keep using the old one to towel off -</li>
            <li> I used it on my hair that was lightened and on my daughters hair that is naturally blond.</li>
            <li> I have purple towels anyway, so when I switch to my new set (I&#x27;m making hot pink ones for fall)</li>
            <li> I only did one streak, the bleach worked faster than I thought, and I didn&#x27;t go the full pale blonde more of a dark blonde, as I didn&#x27;t want to damage my hair too much.  </li>
            <li> It faded, in my hair anyway, into a rich royal purple, then to a pale lavender.</li>
            <li> After washing with my normal shampoo (this is three weeks after the last application of dye)  </li>
            <li> I washed and showered as normal, but used a deep conditioner because I was worried about having bleached my hair.  </li>
            <li> The first application was really dark--</li>
            <li> The bleach barely bleached my hair, so we had to apply it twice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing, not a lot, barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to try to a different brand that offers a permanent purple dye.</li>
            <li> I used very little of the bleach, but it got my hair from a medium-light brown to a nice blonde in about half an hour, maybe 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> And so long as your hair is wet, it can stain clothes (in the first few days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down side: color stains, runs in the shower for a week or two (I wash my hair every day, if you wash less, i&#x27;m sure it might run a bit longer?).</li>
            <li> Vibrant, long lasting color.  </li>

            <li> The only issue with the process was the gloves are HUGE and hard to reuse for future/secondary applications.</li>
            <li> and I wanted something more dramatic.  </li>
            <li> I have used the bleach it comes with, which works fine - I just find that doing it myself with very long hair gets tedious, first doing the bleach then the color.  </li>

            <li> My hair was so fragile and dry that I used extra deep conditioning after the third application.    </li>

            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again. I did exactly what the instructions said and my hair turned out bad. The bleach didn&#x27;t do much to my hair. The color turned out splotchy.  Some areas were pink, magenta, faded purple, etc. But not the purple it was supposed to be. It was a waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> After the third hair washing of the third application of Splat&#x27;s Purple Desire, I&#x27;ve had enough.  There&#x27;s purple on my pillow, purple on the collars of my clothes and my hands stain purple when I style my hair!  After washing with my normal shampoo (this is three weeks after the last application of dye)  I rinse for five minutes trying to get the water to run clear.  Then I run to the kitchen, leaving purple puddles through the house, and grab the Dawn dish liquid.  They use Dawn to clean the feathers of birds after they&#x27;ve been in an oil spill.  I wash, lathering up really well, rinse for a full five minutes and repeat.  Still when I step out I&#x27;m dripping purple.  Purple is all over my towels and the floor and the bath mat.    Here&#x27;s what happened:  I wanted purple streaks on the underside of my black hair so I purchased Splat because the box has great graphics and it comes with the bleach.  I followed the directions carefully, drying my hair in between applications.  The first application was really dark--my son and his wife didn&#x27;t even notice anything different when we met later that day.  After washing it twice, they noticed as the color grew lighter and lighter until it was pink.  I thought I must not have left it on long enough, perhaps I hadn&#x27;t rinsed the bleach out fully or had purchased the lusty lavender by mistake.  So I went through the process again.    I did not use the bleach on the second application or on the third when it came to that.  I applied the dye, sat under a shower cap for an hour before rinsing it out.  But I got the same results--dark almost black at first and slowly lightening to pink and yellow where It&#x27;s just the bleached out hair.  My hair was so fragile and dry that I used extra deep conditioning after the third application.    It must have been the deep conditioning that caused my hands and collars to turn purple because I had not experienced that after the first two applications.  I visited a beauty supply store and am now prepared to try another brand.  I cannot recommend Splat.</li>
            <li> Honestly, if you&#x27;re going to use hair dye...go with Manic Panic. Splat is not for everyone, especially people with darker hair. It comes with hair bleach. Which doesn&#x27;t really bleach darker hair unless you use the whole bottle. If you don&#x27;t use the whole bottle don&#x27;t dispose it in a bathroom trash can because it states in the instructions that the dye and bleach explode. And it gets everywhere! The upside of Splat is that it does make your hair the color you want it for a few weeks. My experience with Splat was I did everything the instructions said to do. The bleach barely bleached my hair, so we had to apply it twice. Once it looked good, we put in the purple and it came out perfectly. Well after a couple weeks of washing my hair and what not, the purple faded... To a bright orange! It literally looked like my hair was on fire. So if you&#x27;re going to use anything Splat (because the hair chalk is no better) just be careful.</li>
            <li> My hair is currently dyed black with some bleached highlights that I got done at my hairstylist in January. Originally I had her throw some blue on (Pravana brand blue), but it was more of a teal color and I wanted something more dramatic.  When my roots grew out, I used blue envy all over to keep my highlights looking vibrant and fun.  The second time I used purple desire and I absolutely love this color!  I get a few compliments a week on it!  I now do this every 3-4 weeks or so and it also keeps my roots looking fresh since my hair is light brown, so the dye works perfectly on unbleached light hair to make it really pop. I have perfected working with this brand of color to minimize color bleeding!  Here&#x27;s what I do to get perfect results with this awesome brand!  I wash my hair with clarifying shampoo to cut all of the oil, you can also use dish soap.  I fully blow dry my hair and coat my entire face/neck and arms with vaseline.  I put down saran wrap on my counters to protect them from dye splatters.  I use a dye brush and a little bowl like they use in the salons and I carefully brush on the color but am careful not to touch my scalp with the color because it WILL stain your scalp instantly and will be like that for like a week.  The first time I used blue envy and I had a huge dark blue spot on my head for the longest time because I didn&#x27;t realize it would stain so bad.  Also, get some good gloves.  Not the cheap kind that comes with the dye, but some gloves for washing dishes.  My finger poked through the hole on the gloves it came with and I had a dark blue finger--so don&#x27;t use those crappy gloves!  When I get down to the last bit of dye in the bottle, I mix a splash of warm water and shake, then pour the remaining dye into the bowl.  This allows you to get better coverage and ensure that all the dye is used.  I leave the color on for a few hours, and then I rinse in COLD water.  Leave the Vaseline on your face otherwise it could stain.  Leave the gloves on or your hands will be smurf blue.  I use color safe shampoo and scrub my head to get some of the color off my head and then rinse again in COLD water.  Then I take plain white vinegar (this step is super important), and I pour it all over my head.  This seals the cuticle and in my opinion makes the color last longer.  I leave on for a few minutes and rinse.  Careful not to get that in your eyes-ow!  It&#x27;s stinky but when you rinse out again in COLD water, you will notice very minimal bleeding and the water will almost be clear when you rinse it out.  If you do not do this step, you will have a blue neck/blue hands/blue rings on the neck of your shirts.  Happy dyeing!or your hands will be smurf blue.

I leave on for a few minutes and rinse.  Careful not to get that in your eyes-ow!  It&#x27;s stinky but when you rinse out again in COLD water, you will notice very minimal bleeding and the water will almost be clear when you rinse it out.  If you do not do this step, you will have a blue neck/blue hands/blue rings on the neck of your shirts.  Happy dyeing!</li>
            <li> Worked wonders better than when I initially had it done at the salon.</li>
            <li> I tried this last night and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I came out with a dark magenta rather than purple.  I still like the color, but perhaps reapplication will bring out more purple.  I only did one streak, the bleach worked faster than I thought, and I didn&#x27;t go the full pale blonde more of a dark blonde, as I didn&#x27;t want to damage my hair too much.  After washing and drying and application of the dye I wrapped the streak in plastic wrap and tied it up.  After about half an hour I hopped in the shower.  It did take about 20 min for the water to run clear, as the directions said to do, but eventually it did run clear.  I washed and showered as normal, but used a deep conditioner because I was worried about having bleached my hair.  It did pull out some more color, and maybe that&#x27;s why I got the magenta...  Not sure.  I blow dried my hair before I went to bed, so no streaks on my pillow or skin.  I&#x27;m very pleased!  *******Update...  I did find a very very little bit of purple rubbed on the collar of the white shirt I&#x27;m wearing, not a lot, barely noticeable.  Guess I&#x27;m probably going to bleed off some more dye tonight in the shower.</li>
            <li> Just wish it would stop running after a month.</li>
            <li> Product is very good but when you wash color remains on scalp</li>
            <li> bought this for a young lady that had long hair, I should have bought 2 boxes for better coverage, however, she was very happy with the color</li>
            <li> If you want that crazy, ultraviolet purple/blue, this is for you.  From what I understand, this is like a tint not a dye... the LONGER you leave it on, the more it will give you long lasting color.  Do this for 20-40 mins - expect it to wash out in a month.  Leave it in for 2 hours or more, expect long lasting color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, me: I have long brown to light brown straight hair.  I&#x27;m not a hair dresser, and have none of the &#x27;add conditioner to this bottle&#x27; advice that makes things confusing.  I have gotten results from this stuff that last for months.  MONTHS.  I do bleach first.  I realize I might not have to, but i want it vibrant.  I have a few large chunks of hair that I will bleach so it is in streaks.  I have used the bleach it comes with, which works fine - I just find that doing it myself with very long hair gets tedious, first doing the bleach then the color.  So sometimes I go to my hair dresser and ask her to bleach those chunks and then I do the rest at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover the bathroom with old towels.  Dark ones are the best.  Cover your counter, the sink, the floor.  This stuff STAINS.  I have a box of latex gloves at home so I grab several so if I spatter somewhere, I can snap off a glove, clean the spot immediately, and then put gloves back on.  Stains left to dry will be permanent.  Easier to apply with salon applicator brush and a disposable bowl.  Last, I get two plastic bags - one small one with handles, another large one for garbage.  Leave that one open and ready to drop things into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover your hairline, neck, face, arms with Vaseline.  The last time I wore an old long sleeve black shirt I don&#x27;t like.  I put gloves over the ends of the sleeves.  That way it protected my arms and shoulders from dye and it didn&#x27;t matter if I stained it. Don&#x27;t forget your ears and chin.  If you have long hair, manipulating strands around will slap your face and stain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning - the dye won&#x27;t stick to vaseline, so if you do your hairline and get it into your hair, that part of your hair won&#x27;t take.  On the flip side, with vigorous scrubbing it comes off your scalp in a few days... so if you really want it tight to your head... it doesn&#x27;t burn, it&#x27;s mild, but you will look funny if it&#x27;s across your temple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply to sections, twist them into little buns, and once done cover my head with the small plastic bag and use the handles to tie it 1950&#x27;s style over my head.  The dye smells kind of like strong grape jelly and can be gross for long periods, the plastic keeps in the smell.  I wait 2 hours if I can (it&#x27;s a hard wait, you have no idea how much you touch your head/neck area and get vaseline all over!).  IF YOU DON&#x27;T WAIT THAT LONG IT WILL NOT LAST.  Unfortunately this stuff requires time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To rinse, we have one of those hose attachments for the shower tub to wash our dog.  I use that to bend over the side of the tub and rinse.  IT WILL CONTINUE TO RUN.  It runs less with cold water.  You can rinse nearly clear with cold, switch to hot, and it will run again.  It will run in the shower for a few days.  And so long as your hair is wet, it can stain clothes (in the first few days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down side: color stains, runs in the shower for a week or two (I wash my hair every day, if you wash less, i&#x27;m sure it might run a bit longer?). Stains clothes when wet for first few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up side: Vibrant, long lasting color.  While the initial shocking purple might fade, it fades to a still-dark bright purply pink that stays for the life of the hair follicle.  I can do it well, once, and with long hair as it grows out and shows from underneath my undyed hair, it looks bright and colorful for months.  I love this stuff.airline and get it into your hair, that part of your hair won&#x27;t take.

            <li> Great Shipping and great product!!!</li>
            <li> This color is more indigo than purple.  I have a lot of silver hair around my face, and that came out looking blue-ish, but it looks cool. From about an inch back, the color turns to dark purple (indigo) and the underneath is so dark it&#x27;s almost black. My hair is long-ish, so I&#x27;m probably going to do it again soon.</li>
            <li> I wanted to do my hair a fun color for summer and thought this was reasonably priced. The bleach kicks butt and worked very well on my dark brown hair. The color was very pigmented and yes my hair is a gorgeous purple. Why the one star rating?? Every single time you shower, go out in the rain or sweat this drips. I ruined towels, clothes, bedding and even my couch because this stuff NEVER rinses clear. I would never repurchase or recommend. My hands are constantly purple from touching my hair and even after HOURS of rinsing it never ever ever runs clear.  I wanted a fun color, not a constant project of worrying about ruining things :(</li>
            <li> I love it! I wanted purple hair, as in violet - dark, luxurious purple. Not lavender. I&#x27;ve been using this since February of this year (2015) and it works perfectly. Back in Feb/March I used the bleach to turn my normally brown hair blonde, and realized less is more ... if I used too much bleach my hair turned sort of orange (oops), otherwise it was perfect straw-colored blonde. Anyway, since I transitioned into all-purple and did the front on my own and the back with the help of a friend, the purple is sort of an all-over ombr&amp;eacute;/reminiscent of a hand-dyed yarn ... I&#x27;m sure you could get more even results with more patience, but I like the randomness :) (and it DOES apply evenly; my hair has different shades because I achieved different bleaching levels at front &amp; back, and when I apply a touch-up, I get a nice even overall bright purple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve just been doing touch-ups since the initial bleachings! Basically every 6-8 weeks, whenever it&#x27;s more plum than violet (and it fades very slowly!) I reapply just the dye. I shampoo it less frequently than I used to (but still a few times a week) and it stays very nicely. Much better than the salon-done purple streaks I did a few years ago, which faded in 2 (!!!) weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: I agree with what everybody else says - Vaseline !! everywhere! (I never use enough ;) but I find that skin streaks usually come off in one to two showers). I comb the dye through after applying it with my fingers .... then let it sit anywhere from 1/2 - 1 1/2 hours, depending on how distracted I get ;) It&#x27;s SUPER easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stains? - yes ... but I actually don&#x27;t care :D Once I fell asleep on my yellow pillow (rhymes, oops) shortly after taking a shower and when I woke up there was a fabulous tie-dye pattern shaped like my head ... but like I said - it doesn&#x27;t bother me! I have purple towels anyway, so when I switch to my new set (I&#x27;m making hot pink ones for fall), I&#x27;ll probably take more care/keep using the old one to towel off - but I like having purple hair enough that I&#x27;m not OCD about stains. Get it off the shower walls right away, tho - it&#x27;s easy when wet, not so easy when dry! Tea tree oil might help get rid of stains/spots on the skin, (I use it as an antiseptic and if I get it too near my dyed hair, off comes the purple) - but really just patience, time &amp; good humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought a new bottle today at CVS and they&#x27;ve stopped including screw-on lids, just the nozzles are included now. Actually that makes for an easier application, but since I reapply and a bottle lasts me a good half-year I&#x27;ll keep the old lid too! And they just renamed the dye, on the bottle only (not the box), Purple Desire *Mauve*!!! Coincidence: I&#x27;m currently reading the excellent biography &amp;#34;Mauve&amp;#34; by Simon Garfield, about the chemist who invented the first synthetic dye, mauveine .... related?? Not sure, but this hair dye is no faded-out, 1990&#x27;s definition of mauve - it&#x27;s the extravagant Victorian violet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine you could use the bleach multiple times just by only adding a little powder to the solution, and by portioning out the liquid. You&#x27;d need another jar now that they&#x27;ve stopped including &amp;#34;storage lids,&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s an easy enough fix ... old sauce jars or cheap Target plastic containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: easy-to-use, deep violet, inexpensive dye/bleach combo!

            <li> The only issue with the process was the gloves are HUGE and hard to reuse for future/secondary applications. I love how vibrant this color is!</li>
            <li> S*** does not work refuses you a refund</li>
            <li> I bought one box from Walmart and I have long, fine hair. One box was enough to cover all my hair. I did not use the bleach that came with it because I wanted a very subtle purple. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked it because my hair didn&#x27;t look much different at all but once I blow dryed my hair, it had a purple tint in the light. I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  Edit: I took away one star. First let me say that when I bought it, the box says &amp;#34;long lasting&amp;#34; and at a glance I mistook that for permanent.. which I&#x27;m sure is what they intended.. but it does rinse out. I guess my main complaint is that the dye stains your scalp. It&#x27;s been over a week since I used the color and I&#x27;m still trying to scrub it off my scalp. I regularly dye my hair black or dark brown and I haven&#x27;t run into this problem before. My boyfriend and a coworker have actually noticed it so I guess it&#x27;s pretty obvious. Also, as I said before, I didn&#x27;t use the bleach, so the purple is really only noticeable at the top of my head where the hair started to grow out and was a little lighter. The dye made the rest of my hair look darker but its hard to see purple in it.  I&#x27;ve decided to try to a different brand that offers a permanent purple dye.</li>
            <li> I only used Splat on one piece of hair, not my entire head. I used very little of the bleach, but it got my hair from a medium-light brown to a nice blonde in about half an hour, maybe 45 minutes. I followed the directions on the bleach very carefully--which is important. As the bleach and powder react, the formula expands, and the bleach becomes less and less potent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color stayed quite a while. It began as a purpley-blue color, which I loved. Very close to the color on the box. It faded, in my hair anyway, into a rich royal purple, then to a pale lavender. I bleached another strip of hair, which ended more yellowy than blonde, and dyed it. It again began dark purple, almost blue, then faded to a royal purple color. But as it faded more, before getting to the underlying blonde, it turned an almost hot pink color, but more red. It took approximately two or three weeks to fade, which I was happy with. I would certainly use Splat again. My only complaint is that the bleach doesn&#x27;t come with instructions for multiple bleach jobs. I assume that with bright colors like these, it&#x27;s pretty common to only do some parts of the hair. And in those cases, it seems that having instructions for making multiple smaller batches of bleach would be a good idea.</li>
            <li> Bedt over the counter color kit  need two pairs of gloves</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!! The purple is rich and vibrant! And Splat stays in her hair longer than any other color tried. Absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love Splat! The bleach works great in my almost black hair and the color always comes out how I want. Normally I buy Splat at Walmart but for some reason they stopped selling Purple Desire. Only a few more $ to order online, got here in perfect condition and in less than a week. I am a happy customer!</li>
            <li> This products absolutely sucks. I used it on my hair that was lightened and on my daughters hair that is naturally blond. On my hair it turned so dark that it Looks black and on my daughters hair it barely showed purple and then washed out after two washes leaving her hair looking dark grey. And it leaks color if it gets wet. Not Happy with it at all.</li>
