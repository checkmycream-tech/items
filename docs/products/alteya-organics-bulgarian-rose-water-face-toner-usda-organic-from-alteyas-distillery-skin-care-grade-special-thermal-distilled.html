            <li>Wonderfully refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Love to use after I&#x27;ve applied my make up for the day, or</li>
            <li>I used Proactive for many years and thought I had to accept my skin for what it was.</li>

            <li>Makes my skin so soft and healthy looking!!</li>
            <li>The one thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that when I first received it, the scent was really nice</li>
            <li>This is my first time using rose water</li>
            <li>Nice product, shipped fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a great purchase, I would love to use this again and try other products from Alteya.</li>

            <li>I loved using this every morning and evening, what a simple luxury.</li>
            <li>I use my Bulgarian Rose Water Organic Toner multiple times a day and thanks to their outstanding customer service</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I spray a few pumps all over my face and hair and its a great toner and make up setter.</li>
            <li>Keeps it fresh looking and can set make-up.</li>
            <li>and I can tell a different when I do use this Bulgarian Rose Water Organic&lt;br /&gt;Toner</li>
            <li>I spray it on my face before I go to bed and it leaves it feeling fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, most likely not the fault of the seller due to the care they take to package their product, my most recent order arrived in pieces (the box it arrived in smelled great).</li>
            <li>The first bottle I received was cracked, but customer service sent me a new one free of charge.</li>
            <li>Overall mood booster too :)</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and pure, so there is no irritation.</li>
            <li>I recently changed my skin regiment up and started using raw honey along with Bulgarian Rose Water Organic Toner, and as a result I am beyond satisfied with my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty decent</li>
            <li>Very cooling</li>
            <li>this is obviously chemical free.</li>

            <li>Most definitely a difference than other rosewater.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a different brand of rose water toner than the usual brand I use</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that this company uses dark glass bottles and features a pretty design on the label...</li>

            <li> /&gt;After using this for a few days, I had to order a back up one</li>
            <li> hands down.</li>
            <li> i am gonna buy your other organic products too!</li>
            <li> No need for my previous nightly moisturizing regimen.</li>
            <li> Takes a little time getting use to&lt;br /&gt;the smell....</li>
            <li> Even on the days when my skin is totally acting CRAZY, this product soothes and calms my skin so that in just a few minutes after application, my skin glows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was sad because I was running out of my product.</li>
            <li> but after a few days the smell is nasty.</li>

            <li> Wonderfully refreshing.  Very mild rose scent.  Very happy with the purchase !</li>
            <li> Best Toner EVER!! Makes my skin so soft and healthy looking!!</li>
            <li> The best skin toner ever!!!</li>
            <li> Love to use after I&#x27;ve applied my make up for the day, or mid day if I need a spruce up at work. I spray a few pumps all over my face and hair and its a great toner and make up setter. Overall mood booster too :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, use it everyday after washing my face, after putting on makeup, or even just to refresh my skin. Will continue buying.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much! It smells amazing and is so cooling. One of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a different brand of rose water toner than the usual brand I use so I bought this. It&#x27;s pretty decent but I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in comparison to the Heritage Store brand I usually use. The one thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that when I first received it, the scent was really nice but after a few days the smell is nasty.</li>
            <li> Greatest rose water toner ever! hands down. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice product, shipped fast</li>
            <li> Great product.. and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!!  Even on the days when my skin is totally acting CRAZY, this product soothes and calms my skin so that in just a few minutes after application, my skin glows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!!&lt;br /&gt;ka</li>
            <li> I order this product regularly. Unfortunately, most likely not the fault of the seller due to the care they take to package their product, my most recent order arrived in pieces (the box it arrived in smelled great). I was sad because I was running out of my product. However, I contacted the seller and told them my predicament and they promptly sent me two new ones at no extra cost to me. I use my Bulgarian Rose Water Organic Toner multiple times a day and thanks to their outstanding customer service I will continue to treat my face and hair to this amazing product. I plan to be a lifetime customer. I have oily skin and I am prone to breakouts. I used Proactive for many years and thought I had to accept my skin for what it was. I recently changed my skin regiment up and started using raw honey along with Bulgarian Rose Water Organic Toner, and as a result I am beyond satisfied with my face. I am no longer as oily as I use to be. I use this product multiple times per day. I use it as a toner after I wash my face, to set my makeup, to rejuvenate my face and hair after a workout, and to boost my mood after a long day at work. I will continue to order this product and recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> this product is very nice.  It&#x27;s refreshing and helps soothe my skin.  Keeps it fresh looking and can set make-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 40s and I have had acne since I was 10 years old. Rose water has been a godsend to my skin. I use it just after cleansing as a toner on my face, back and chest. It really calms my skin and helps clear acne. This brand smells and works great. I tried another brand (much more expensive) that had very little rose water, and a ton of other crap added to it. It was horrible--nothing like Alteya. Alteya Bulgarian Rose Water Organic brand is excellent and pure. This is my new beauty staple for life!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS....So refreshing and does put a Glow to your face...Takes a little time getting use to&lt;br /&gt;the smell....Very cooling and I can tell a different when I do use this Bulgarian Rose Water Organic&lt;br /&gt;Toner...Planning to place another order soon...</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this Bulgarian Rose Water. I spray it on my face before I go to bed and it leaves it feeling fresh and moisturized. No need for my previous nightly moisturizing regimen.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using rose water and I love it. I always use organic and natural products this is obviously chemical free. I have sensitive skin this is gentle the smell is beautiful will buy again, package well. I like that it&#x27;s actually made in Bulgaria you get the real thing. Comes in a nice glass bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a few days, I had to order a back up one this product is really great and fairly priced fast shipping both times packaging is perfect.</li>
            <li> i bought this a while ago ,it is amazing ! i love it,i told my friend about this great product.and i am gonna buy your other organic products too!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful, my skin texture has improved dramatically, it&#x27;s glowing I wish I knew about it years ago I would definitely have used it.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality rosewater, beautiful delicate scent, great for refreshing your skin and toning. I loved using this every morning and evening, what a simple luxury. It is very gentle and pure, so there is no irritation. The first bottle I received was cracked, but customer service sent me a new one free of charge.
