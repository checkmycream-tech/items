            <li> I was looking for a description of what this scent is.....so I found this one....Dark tales of vampires are the inspiration behind the heady floral scent of Body Fantasies Vampire by Parfums de Coeur. The rich fragrance opens with a touch of clementine and plum blossom as its top notes, which dry down to reveal a heart of violets, Mexican chocolate, and wisteria. The blend is kept fresh and long-lasting with a base that includes the subtle scent of amber. Released for women in 2011, this perfume is designed for casual use.  It smells really good, and the little traveling one is perfect to take with you when you are out.</li>
            <li> fantasy and vampire junkies rejoice for this is the product for you. plus it has a pleasant fragrance that makes you want to apply more</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance, and fast shipping. Just wish the bottle was bigger. I am already out of it. I wore it almost every day</li>
            <li> This is a gift to a  16 year old  who placed her wishes on a Mitten Tree. I am sure she will be very happy!!</li>
            <li> I first bought this perfume on sale at rite-aid. I usually don&#x27;t buy perfumes without smelling them first, but for 8 bucks it was worth a try. I fell in love with the smell! It&#x27;s light and fruity. I can&#x27;t believe how good it smells. The amazing part is how long lasting it is.</li>

She fell in love with it. I also needed the bottles for a photo shoot for Halloween so this serves a two perpers deal for me picking it up. I myself wear a different brand, but find this one smells very nice and would recommend it to the younger generation such as my 34 year old daughter.&lt;br /&gt;Dawn</li>
