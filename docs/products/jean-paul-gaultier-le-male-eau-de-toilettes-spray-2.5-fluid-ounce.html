            <li>Muy bueno el producto original y sin demoras, llego bien y sin fracturas,</li>
            <li>I will be back for more!</li>
            <li>In addition to the natural Provencal scent of lavender in the air, a gorgeous and chic French man walked passed me and wafted this fresh and clean scented cologne into my nose.  </li>
            <li>And in the first whiff I decided that I&#x27;m gonna buy it.</li>
            <li>so far the males I know love it, including our animals, who are usually very sensitive to perfumes.</li>

            <li>Shipping was fast and efficient and the product was received in mint condition.</li>
            <li>Based on very positive feed backs on this page, and the fact that it is sold directly by Amazon, I was convinced that the product is going to be original.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for any guy</li>
            <li>very very early package was as of picture product</li>
            <li>To put the plastic wrap together, they have used clear tape.</li>
            <li>and I saw The clear tape all around the seal covering the razor cut.</li>
            <li>Very subtle smell-especially to be kind to those in an elevator.  </li>
            <li>I found the same thing here for less and it was available.</li>
            <li>Would recomend, Not a strong oder mild and pleasing</li>
            <li>It also has a (tiny) little hint of mint, and is VERY slightly sweet.</li>
            <li>It last a LONG time and projects really well.  </li>
            <li>The first time I smelled this heavenly cologne, I was walking down the streets of Southern France.  </li>

            <li> BE AWARE OF THIS FAKE LA MALE.</li>
            <li> now he said he want other one</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try the other products!  </li>
            <li> so i sold to my friend for less price than i bought, because i had to get rid from this fragrance</li>
            <li> Leaves the kitchen smelling like a strip club for up to 8 hours after a heavy application.</li>
            <li> It is not a strong perfume at all.</li>
            <li> FAKE Le Male, BE AWARE.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have ordered this on 9/18/2014 knowing that Le Male should be ordered from a trusted source to avoid fake ones.</li>
            <li> day, 9/24/2014, I have received my Le Male and It is obviously FAKE.</li>
            <li> As I reached that point I found out something is wrong because the tape was preventing me from tearing the seal.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a perfume expert, but the fragrance: It has a musky base, but it&#x27;s not really strong.</li>
            <li> Very expensive compared to RAID, but it seems to do the job well.  </li>

            <li> lo que esperaba 100 % recomendado, el articulo totalmente nuevo, y sin problemas, el tiempo de entrega fue en el lapso programado poara el envio, personas responsables</li>
            <li> Good price for the cologne, smells amazing</li>
            <li> The first time I smelled this heavenly cologne, I was walking down the streets of Southern France.  In addition to the natural Provencal scent of lavender in the air, a gorgeous and chic French man walked passed me and wafted this fresh and clean scented cologne into my nose.  It smelled so incredibly good, that I had to stop him and ask what it was he was wearing.  Now my husband wears it, and sometimes I spritz it onto my curtains to make my home smell like France.</li>
            <li> It was a Father&#x27;s Day gift and my dad loves it....great cologne</li>
            <li> Love it ,smells great on my husband .will order more when this is finished and by the way ....great bottle ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> Great price, great product, great customer service!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this, bought it for my boyfriend and it smells amazing!  I would highly recommend this for any guy</li>
            <li> He loves it, so does his girlfriend!  Spray it in the air and walk through the mist so it doesn&#x27;t smell too strong.</li>
            <li> Have used this product before and I saved some money by ordering it on line, which I will do again.</li>
            <li> But i can only say&lt;br /&gt;this is an Original Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;because it&#x27;s long lasting so i sold to my friend for less price than i bought, because i had to get rid from this fragrance&lt;br /&gt;so now he said he want other one but i wont buy more for him</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas gift and is a lot cheaper than in the stores. Great Buy! I would recommend this for any male</li>
            <li> I had a sample in  a Men Mag, and really like the smell So i look it up and purhased a bottle. Would recomend, Not a strong oder mild and pleasing</li>
            <li> I din&#x27;t buy this product from amazon, but this is so good that I feel compelled to write about it. I literally just happened to smell this one in the perfume shop, just because the shape of the bottle was peculiar. And in the first whiff I decided that I&#x27;m gonna buy it. I&#x27;m not a perfume expert, but the fragrance: It has a musky base, but it&#x27;s not really strong. It also has a (tiny) little hint of mint, and is VERY slightly sweet. It is not a strong perfume at all. But it is so good I wish it were</li>
            <li> I have been using Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male for years. I tried purchasing through a perfume website that I have used before and was repeatedly told it was sold out. I found the same thing here for less and it was available. Shipping was fast and efficient and the product was received in mint condition. It was a pleasure to find it here and have such great service. I will be back for more!</li>
            <li> great stuff great price smells great came very very early package was as of picture product like i said before can&#x27;t beat the price buy it!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband! He loved it! Smells so good! I&#x27;m so happy! Great packing! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> ITS JEAN PAUL!  NO REVIEW NEEDED!</li>
            <li> FAKE Le Male, BE AWARE.&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered this on 9/18/2014 knowing that Le Male should be ordered from a trusted source to avoid fake ones. Based on very positive feed backs on this page, and the fact that it is sold directly by Amazon, I was convinced that the product is going to be original.&lt;br /&gt;To day, 9/24/2014, I have received my Le Male and It is obviously FAKE. I did not even need to open the plastic wrap completely!&lt;br /&gt;The plastic wrap was cut with something like a razor blade all around! To put the plastic wrap together, they have used clear tape. The result: It looks perfectly original until I teared the sealed plastic wrap to the point of clear tape. As I reached that point I found out something is wrong because the tape was preventing me from tearing the seal.&lt;br /&gt;Just a glance and I saw The clear tape all around the seal covering the razor cut. I do not know what they have done to the bottle (swapped it with something else? messed with the juice?) because I do not intend to open the can so that I can return it. BE AWARE OF THIS FAKE LA MALE.</li>
            <li> This is a great summer fragrance that has a \\&quot;clean and fresh\\&quot; smell.  I receive many compliments when I wear this.</li>
            <li> Muy bueno el producto original y sin demoras, llego bien y sin fracturas, era lo que yo esperaba y volvere a comprar aqui, gracias desde caracas Venezuela</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes at a great price!</li>
            <li> This works great for killing ants and roaches in the kitchen.  Very expensive compared to RAID, but it seems to do the job well.  Leaves the kitchen smelling like a strip club for up to 8 hours after a heavy application.</li>
            <li> Love the package.  Very subtle smell-especially to be kind to those in an elevator.  Can&#x27;t wait to try the other products!  I am female. so far the males I know love it, including our animals, who are usually very sensitive to perfumes.</li>
