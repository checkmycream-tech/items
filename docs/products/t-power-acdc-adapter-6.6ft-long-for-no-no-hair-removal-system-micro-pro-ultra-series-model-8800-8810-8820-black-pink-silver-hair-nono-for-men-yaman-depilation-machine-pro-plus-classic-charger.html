            <li> So go glad I was able to find the cord I needed. Very fast delivery</li>
            <li> Works well with the No-No.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  I lost the adapter to my No!No! and this works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great cable.  Works perfectly. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a charger for the no!no! It is merely a power cord so you can use it while plugged in (hence the 6.6 ft cord) which is OK except that the word &amp;#34;charger&amp;#34; is in the description of the item. I was looking for a replacement charger, so this wasn&#x27;t what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This product performs as expected.  I lost my charger for my No! No!, and it was expensive to replace at their website.  This purchase was more affordable and works just as well.</li>
            <li> No problems at all work perfectly, I have it for two weeks</li>
            <li> This T-Power will not charge my NO NO!  I charged this for 2 days and it will not hold a charge.  I would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> Fast service and attaches perfectly to my no no hair remover.  Lost mine when we moved, and it was very reasonably good price.</li>
            <li> The adapter worked great, however, the NONO doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Tip was not as pictured. Does not plug all the way in.</li>
            <li> Works for my NoNo 880 silver.</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose perfectly. Just as good as the original cord/cable.</li>
            <li> Finally--amazing how good my No No works with an adapter that works!!</li>
            <li> Does not charge, only able to use if plugged in. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> It was exactly the right one and works great!  I had misplaced my charger and was worried it would cost a lot to replace but this was a great price!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> My No No will not charge with the charger I bought...  :(</li>
            <li> Thought it was a battery charger.  Not.  Useful only if plugged in while using and cord is not long enough for that.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was just what we needed to make the no-no work again.  The description made the selection easy.</li>
            <li> Lost my charger for my nono and couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere to fit it that didn&#x27;t cost a fortune and this worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> works like it should. what else can I say</li>
            <li> Item was received in good packaging. Power cord worked as advertised.</li>
