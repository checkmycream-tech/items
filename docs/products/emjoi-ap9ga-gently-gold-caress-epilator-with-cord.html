    <ol>
            <li>It really is a great product!</li>
            <li>Well, it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Try it for yourself, though, if you&#x27;ve got the time and the pain threshold. :D</li>
            <li>And the skin looked great!  </li>
            <li>This product is best suited to:    1.</li>
            <li>I have tried, rotating head epilators worked the best.  </li>
            <li>All in all I am impressed and like the product for the value.  </li>
            <li>Works great!  </li>
            <li>I love this appliance!!!!</li>
            <li>is superb.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this one.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s not my no.1 choice for hair removal but AWESOME to have on the side!</li>
            <li>I took it abroad with me, it worked perfectly with adapters too.</li>
            <li>In the end, you will be glad you did!!!  </li>
            <li>I bought this epilator thinking I would have beautiful, hairfree underarms, legs and bikini line.</li>
            <li>It really is a great product!roducts</li>
            <li>This product works great for me.</li>
            <li>I have read great reviews of Emjoi epilators.</li>
            <li>LOL.  </li>
            <li>Gold Caress Epilator worked great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been working great for three years and counting.</li>
            <li>Great for traveling</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that I have found my beloved Emjoi!</li>
            <li>but I rubbed in some good lotion and within 3 hours the spots were gone.</li>
            <li>This Epilator is good.  </li>
            <li>Got a good deal at Amazon and thought \\&quot;what the heck\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It is a good idea to follow the recommendations that come with the product about exfoliation and how to hold the skin, etc.</li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>Because when I first used mine, I was having those problems as well, but once I got the hang of it, it worked wonderfully!  </li>
            <li>I bought it in 2001 and it is still working, and I love it!</li>
            <li>Although this is not for the feint of heart, it does an amazing job.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the very best hair removal tool I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Once in a very great while something comes along that really does what it says.</li>
            <li>I also am vexed by hair breakage on the legs, leaving them sandpapery-stubbly (not knife-point-stubbly) but looking nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Actually, this product is good and it is better than shaving.  </li>
            <li>My advice is, have a warm bath, use the loofa that comes with the epilator, put on your ipod, and then have a go at it.</li>
            <li>Because it is so effective.  </li>
            <li>would recommend this product to anyone looking for an effective hair removal system.</li>
            <li>I used to own an Epilady (the oldest model), which was truly a torture device.  </li>
            <li>- good job for most of the legs.  </li>
            <li>cost effective.  </li>
            <li>The Emjoi Gently Gold Caress Epilator with Cord is awesome!!  </li>
            <li>The Emjoi also works best if you keep it very clean--don&#x27;t let hairs build up in it.</li>
            <li>Remove hair on your own time &lt;br</li>
            <li>Just follow the instructions and make sure to use a very good lotion right after use.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I am fair complected with light hair.  </li>
            <li>The best thing that I have found so far is that I don&#x27;t have to take a bath after each session.  </li>
            <li>I got for my wife, She said its nice and better than waxing.</li>
            <li>and I stress that it is VERY IMPORTANT TO SHOWER AND EXFOLIATE before you use the Emjoi.</li>
            <li>I love this product to death.  </li>
            <li>Finer, lighter, and for some reason more evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>This morning my legs look better than they have in years.</li>
            <li>but most of it was just cut off.  </li>
            <li>and I wont be able to show off my legs how I wanted to.  </li>
            <li>It would hurt more to eplilate longer hair than shorter.  </li>
            <li>I never used anything that did a better job of removing unwanted hair.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t understand why so many people think doing the legs is painless, comparatively to the armpits.  </li>
            <li>It hurts more than waxing.</li>
            <li>If you can stand waxing, though, you should be able to stand this pain.</li>
            <li>If you can stand waxing, though, you should be able to stand this pain.</li>
            <li>The product itself was in great condition and does really work.  </li>
            <li>And I sure do love my skirts.</li>
            <li>It is simply the best thing for me.</li>
            <li>and I love this thing.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off exfoliating more often of course, but this is the minimum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased to be free of prickly nubs on my legs!</li>
            <li>BTW, it&#x27;s even better with use of Kalo hair inhibitor spray or cream.</li>
            <li>Now I miss it more than ever.</li>
            <li>It does work in this situation, but it takes a lot more effort to flatten out the area so it can grab the hair.</li>
            <li>and oh so hair free!</li>
            <li>It works better if you follow the instructions to the T.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels fantastic!</li>
            <li>I read many reviews before purchasing.</li>
            <li>I can not express how pleased I was with the results.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, I have been Waxing for years, so I may be more used to the \\&quot;pull it by the roots\\&quot; feel.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>more I use it, the more I like it.  </li>
            <li>make sure the epilator is going in the correct direction and be sure you use it at a 90 degree angle to your skin.  </li>
            <li>(I find a fine-grade foot file works better than a loofah for exfoliation, by the way).</li>
            <li>Much better than others I have used.</li>
            <li>Many more ingrowns then waxing or shaving  &lt;</li>
            <li>Yes, the first time you use it, you may feel some discomfort, but walk it off!!!  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive my Emjoi as we were going on a cruise</li>
            <li>, i ended up shaving because this epilator didn&#x27;t get my legs smooth even after i went over the same area alot of times, so in all fair judgement i need to get brave and try to use the epilator again, hope this helps.</li>
            <li>I also figured out that it may be a good idea to use Veet or Nair first</li>
            <li>(hey the silky-mit things are pretty good, still).</li>
            <li>(hey the silky-mit things are pretty good, still).</li>
            <li>Even for the face it works pretty good</li>
            <li>I found that the emjoi arrived quickly and in good condition and tried it out right away.</li>
            <li>After testing couple of other epllitor, I think I found the best one.</li>
            <li>and you can get those again so easily that its a non issue.</li>
            <li>and you can get those again so easily that its a non issue.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to get it to pull all my leg hair without breaking a great deal off in the process, and so had delegated it to getting strays after a leg wax and for my upper leg and bikini.</li>
            <li>If you do get though, make sure you clean it after each use because it&#x27;ll be a lot easier that way.</li>
            <li>otherwise I thing it would still be going strong.</li>
            <li>and It is very easy right now to take out the hair.   </li>
            <li>you want a quick and painless fix for your hair removal needs, this is probably not the product for you (but how many products are painless?</li>
            <li>It works best on the legs if you have the time and patience to pull every little hair out.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;naturally smooth&#x27; likeness - definite win.</li>
            <li>Yes the Emjoi has a &amp;quot;curve&amp;quot; to fit the shape of a womans needs</li>
            <li>I was indeed happy with the spots it DID get because the hair didnt grow back for some time</li>
            <li>the whole I liked the machine.</li>
            <li>Even under my arms I am smooth, and stubble/raizor burn free.  </li>
            <li>I just upgraded to the Emjoi after a not so great wax experience and have not looked back since.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands and models, from the old Epilady to Phillips to Braun, and every time the product seemed to get better and better.</li>
            <li>My legs are so smooth</li>
            <li>I can tolerate them because I have finaly have smooth legs.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s convinient to just plug it in and get comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I could not get the skin taut enough, so of course it hurt alot, and i am unexperienced at using this, so i can not give a fair opinion until i have used it more</li>
            <li>Though I was pretty scared of the pain, I was even more aggravated with shaving.   </li>
            <li>It took me a week to get through my underarms, but the smoothness was absolutely worth it!  </li>
            <li>I am so excited about the results I got from the Emjoi.</li>
            <li>I broke it attempting to take it apart to clean it out</li>
            <li>But I find waxing a pain to set up, clean the strips, and the &#x27;putty&#x27; wax the salons</li>
            <li>Not on the legs, but mostly on the face area where the hair is more sensitive.</li>
            <li>Not on the legs, but mostly on the face area where the hair is more sensitive.</li>
            <li>Waxing was quick and easy, but it hurt, had leftover mini-hairs, and the wax and wax papers ran out quickly.  </li>
            <li>I especially love that there&#x27;s NO mess like with waxing...same diff&#x27;, only quicker &amp; cleaner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced, and more importantly, if you want smooth, touchable legs for longer, it is totally worth both the pain and the time.</li>
            <li>and my legs are full of ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>Its true, it does hurt.</li>
            <li>Then I use it the next day, it pulls some more, and I repeat a couple more days until smooth.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well, and on top of that, it hurts like hell to use it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it compares to the other brands, but I&#x27;m very very happy with this particular brand.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it compares to the other brands, but I&#x27;m very very happy with this particular brand.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s just the hairs being quickly plucked out.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure that you have proper lighting so that you are able to see when all the hair is gone.  </li>
            <li>(mild tingling effect).  </li>
            <li>I chose this one over the others because it had a curved tweezer bit, (unlike the Braun, which has a flat top), but truthfully, I have</li>
            <li>I chose this one over the others because it had a curved tweezer bit, (unlike the Braun, which has a flat top), but truthfully, I have</li>
            <li>Works great for bikini area with little pain but</li>
            <li>Definitly Good deal for this price .I am not giving it all 5 because it makes noise and is having curve that can make her press hard on skin to get better results.</li>
            <li>and it comes back without the stubble being sharp-tipped, which is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d always dreamed of being able to have soft, touchable legs.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the money and will probably save you some on all of the hair removal products you buy</li>
            <li>I understand all of the gripes about the pain that this causes, but in the end it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>(I think its worth the pain, though).</li>
            <li>(I think its worth the pain, though).</li>
            <li>yes it can be time consuming, but it is well worth the time saved in the shower every day.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t be fooled-it hurts A LOT.The results are worth it.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend starting out with long hair, about a day or 2 growth seems to be the best, so for the first use, shave, wait a day or 2 depending on your hair growth, then go for it.  </li>
            <li>I use regularly on my bikini line and on my underarms and can report that the results are smooth and fabulous!  </li>
            <li>so long it is shocking!I am really in love with this thing!</li>
            <li>right beneath the knee, for instance.  </li>
            <li>At a minimum, you must exfoliate the day before and right after you&#x27;re done epilating.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the nerve to use it on more sensitive areas, but thats ok, because smaller more sensitive areas can be tweezed or shaved in no time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best fifty I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.</li>
            <li>I avoided talking to someone in bright sunlight for fear that my \\&quot;beard\\&quot; was showing or I had missed a black one on my neck.</li>
            <li>Once I&#x27;m done my skin does mostly feel almost baby smooth, and it roughly lasts about a week.</li>
            <li>maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t gotten brave enough to epilate the bikini area, but it&#x27;s definitely next.</li>
            <li>Suddenly, I am feeling free and light</li>
            <li>my old one works so much better than this Gently gold caress.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised at how easy &amp; \\&quot;almost\\&quot; painless this device was.  </li>
            <li>When I got it about a month ago I didn&#x27;t have very much hair to use it on.  </li>
            <li>The Emjoi magically combines the disadvantages of waxing and shaving, being time-consuming (much more than any other epilator I&#x27;ve owned) and highly ineffective as a longish-term hair removal method.</li>
            <li>It take out the hair very easy and fast since I took practice of it for several days.  </li>
            <li>Hurts like hell the first time (so take</li>
            <li>This was my first epilator.</li>
            <li>I have had Emjoi for a couple of months...and to tell you frankly, after my first use it was sitting on the shelf.</li>
            <li>first time users</li>
            <li>Years ago I got one of the first Epilady models.  </li>
            <li>one the first one lasted for 5 years with weekly use.</li>
            <li>Firstly, why I got to this point.</li>
            <li>The first time I turned this product on, and heard the whirring, I literally yelled for my mother.</li>
            <li>And the first time shaving was a trial.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because you need to attack the hairs while they&#x27;re still short and mostly sparse in the area you&#x27;re working on.  </li>
            <li>I agree that it does take some creative movement to get all the hair around the knees and ankles, but that is the same with any removal product.  </li>
            <li>After the first couple of uses, the first thing I noticed was NO  </li>
            <li>But I have the feeling that it&#x27;s actually ripping more hair than pulling it out.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product about 7 years ago after seeing it in an airline magazine (you know, one of those things on every plane in the pocket on the seat in front of your cramped-up legs).</li>
            <li>MUCH cheaper! &lt;</li>
            <li>It does a great job in getting even the shortest of hairs and afterwards it was red, but using a product such as tend skin or any product designed to prevent razor burn it helped a great deal and after a few hours my skin was not red at all.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does miss some hair and break some others, (resulting in a bit of stubble in parts), but the good news is that it works on next day stubble, even though they&#x27;re short--</li>
            <li>Yes, it does miss some hair and break some others, (resulting in a bit of stubble in parts), but the good news is that it works on next day stubble, even though they&#x27;re short--</li>
            <li>She was using Philips for last 7 years , and compared to that its good or same.</li>
            <li>I admit that the first time I used it the pain was a bit much for the first minute or so</li>
            <li>I could never have worn a skirt and felt comfortable more than 3 days after I shaved, but now I can go up to a week and half in a short skirt and feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>and will certainly buy another one.</li>
            <li>Will have pain and redness for a short time, but everything is fine after a night.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a small brush so that you can clean off the top area.  </li>
            <li>works great for very thick hairs.</li>
            <li>Its cheaper in the long run, not messy, very quick (about as quick as shaving)</li>
            <li>Its cheaper in the long run, not messy, very quick (about as quick as shaving)</li>
            <li>This a HUGE and VAST improvement to the EpiLady!!  </li>
            <li>Still a HUGE improvement on my daily plucking before!!</li>
            <li>Now, I fit very neatly into the above categories, and so for me this product is a God-send.</li>
            <li>I have been using my Emjoi for several months now, and have noticed a huge difference in the number of hairs and the hair texture on my legs.  </li>
            <li>I have to say I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It hurt like hell, but it worked really well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had this problem, and it&#x27;s very iritating to see these hairs.  </li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>After seeing my result with the Emjoi, my mother wants to get a Braun to try (as the instructions say not to share the depilator for hygiene reasons), and she wants to change brands just to see.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After seeing my result with the Emjoi, my mother wants to get a Braun to try (as the instructions say not to share the depilator for hygiene reasons), and she wants to change brands just to see.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really learned to use it</li>
            <li>This device help me to keep a smooth skin for several days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never had such smooth skin on my legs before.</li>
            <li>Still, I would say if you&#x27;re a hairy person, you really oughta get this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it really reduces the number of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I really like this product(after 5 years of using Nad&#x27;s \\&quot;wax\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li>If you are concerned about the price of the Emjoi, just think about how much you spend for disposable razors or wax.</li>
            <li>But I was disturbed by how much money I was spending on razor blades and shave gel</li>
            <li>However, I really got this for my chin.  </li>
            <li>The Emjoi Gently</li>
            <li>Legs look much cleaner and feel softer without them.</li>
            <li>Although they say if you scrub with a loofa it helps, I don&#x27;t really feel that it helps all that much.</li>
            <li>But after several usages, all but the most sensitive skin gets used to it.  </li>
            <li>This is most appreciated in the armpit area, which at least for me, is the most sensitive area.</li>
            <li>I am already planning how to introduce epilating to my daughter when she is old enough to do it in the hopes that she will never have to shave because the truth is that my hair is finer and more sparse than before waxing and epilating.</li>
            <li>It does sting a little when you first start to use it, but as you use it more often, you get used to it</li>
            <li>I then attempted to do the underarms in which the pain was definitely strong (and I mean strong).  </li>
            <li>In answer to the criticisms I&#x27;ve read so far, yes it&#x27;s noisy, yes it hurts, but not very bad,</li>
            <li>It leaves them silky smooth and entirely too sexy to be armpits, and after only 3 epilations, much of the hair is NOT growing back.  </li>
            <li>Since the beginning the rechargeable battery would not hold a charge, which I figured was no big deal since the cord is nice and long.</li>
            <li>You may get little red dots on your skin after epilating, so I would recommend doing it in the evening or on a day when you won&#x27;t show off you gorgeous legs.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong: epilators are great, and that&#x27;s what most of the other reviewers found out.</li>
            <li>I had to spend two days doing it (one on both of my lower legs, another on the top half).  </li>
            <li>Even super short hairs were pulled out, and I have no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I thought that the idea was good, but I have never used anything more painful in my life.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if this is for you, but if your story is similar to mine, it definitely could be. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if this is for you, but if your story is similar to mine, it definitely could be. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I used it on my legs next, and it worked okay, but it left a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li>Plucking became something I had to do every day in bright daylight to catch the one or two rogue black hairs on my chin and neck, cream removers worked well but the long term affects worried me,</li>
            <li>It is definitely more sensitive around the ankles and front of the shins but other than that it does not bother me anymore (like plucking your eyebrows-</li>
            <li>And, for me, I only have smooth legs for about two weeks (though the new hairs are not terribly noticeable, and I usually wait about 4 weeks between uses.)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a person who doesn&#x27;t mind too much pain, so when it hurt like it did it surprised me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shaved my whole adult life.  </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m having more trouble with ingrown hairs on the legs--</li>
            <li>As someone with quite sensitive skin, I have had reactions to waxing, razors are a nightmare and to top it off having course dark hair</li>
            <li>So, using the Emjoi Epilator was not painful because not my hair is more sparce and thin.  </li>
            <li>Using the epilator is more convenient and does not leave the messy residue that waxing did.  </li>
            <li>Because you are attacking each area when there are fewer and shorter hairs, all you feel are just a few quick tugs that feel more like minor pinpricks.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the Emjoi because not only was the pain bearable, I actually quickly got used to it.  </li>
            <li>When I finally received it, I tried it right away.  </li>
            <li>My other half even commented that it looked good.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I ordered my first, wore it out after 4 years, am now wearing out a second!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using epilators for 10 years and was searching for a new one as my 6 year old braun silk epil is wearing out.</li>
            <li>The key seems to be turning the machine to the fast speed, moving very very sloooooowly and in VERY short strokes.  </li>
            <li>Being somewhat pale with strong coarse leg hairs, of course the first thing I did was shave  at a young age.</li>
            <li>Pros: generally no stubble for a week, no dark spots that can be seen through the skin, and getting to be smooth without having to do daily hair removal and maintenance.</li>
            <li>I have found that three days in a row of use gets me smooth for about a two week period, then the little persistant hairs start again.  </li>
            <li>I grabbed my 6 year old Braun and it worked so much better with hardly any pain.</li>
            <li>I have very dark and coarse hair, so I have tried many things to get rid of unwanted hairs, but nothing has ever gotten them under control like this.  </li>
            <li>I shaved regularly, but my hair grows so fast</li>
            <li>The reason being, if you are a first time user, your hair are probably quite long.</li>
            <li>(Thanks to my German grandmother!).</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>It really works and I wont be going back to razors ever again!</li>
            <li>I really like using it on the armpit area, and after the second time the pain is not a factor.  </li>
            <li>I will tell you that I have tried it on my upper lip, but it stings too much.  </li>
            <li>though I&#x27;d invest a few more dollars and get the reviewer-acclaimed Emjoi, after I&#x27;d left my four-year-old Braun in some trip.</li>
            <li>my hairs were just too dark, too coarse and too strong.</li>
            <li>that my review be useful for other customers who want to buy this product and for manufacturer to improve this product.</li>
            <li>No mess (besides for the hairs your&#x27;re pulling out) &lt;</li>
            <li>and I have to go left to right or right to left instead of up or down the leg.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, my next day stubble is highly visible--</li>
            <li>and now I have to wait until my legs are back to normal.  </li>
            <li>Those were very unsightly and difficult to deal with until I just decided to give in and pull out my trusty razor once more.</li>
            <li>The reviews so far have been terrific guides: this spiffy little machine DOES hurt, it DOES sound like an outboard motor, and it DOES take a long time to use...</li>
            <li>Smooth legs for at least a week</li>
            <li>it barely removed anything because</li>
            <li>It is saving me so much money and time spent in salons waxing.</li>
            <li>, however they&#x27;re so minor, it&#x27;s not really a negative for me.</li>
            <li>have wavy hair - not tight curls, but a definite wave.  </li>
            <li>I have not tried the other models in the Emjoi line, so I have no means of comparison, but this seems to work very well for me.  </li>
            <li>First timers:pop a Tylenol and keep the skin pulled tight.  </li>
            <li>The new thing here is that I can do it over and be done without waiting for them to grow for another two weeks to get long enough to wax.  </li>
            <li>but I prefer to keep waxing and keep this on the side for those days when I&#x27;m away from home, for general touch ups (especially those summer days),</li>
            <li>The only reason why I cannot give it 5 stars is because I find it hard to clean.  </li>
            <li>Every person can have sensitivity in a different area, and mine is apparently under my arms.  </li>
            <li>I should have listened to the negative ones as what they said proved to be true.  </li>
            <li>after the first few uses this thig dont hert</li>
            <li>This epilator is so easy to use and while it hurts a bit, waxing hurts worse.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> It really is a great product!</li>
            <li> Well, it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s wonderful!  </li>
            <li> Try it for yourself, though, if you&#x27;ve got the time and the pain threshold. :D</li>
            <li> And the skin looked great!  </li>
            <li> This product is best suited to:    1.</li>
            <li> I have tried, rotating head epilators worked the best.  </li>
            <li> All in all I am impressed and like the product for the value.  </li>
            <li> Works great!  </li>
            <li> I love this appliance!!!!</li>
            <li> is superb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this one.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s not my no.1 choice for hair removal but AWESOME to have on the side!</li>
            <li> I took it abroad with me, it worked perfectly with adapters too.</li>
            <li> In the end, you will be glad you did!!!  </li>
            <li> I bought this epilator thinking I would have beautiful, hairfree underarms, legs and bikini line.</li>
            <li> It really is a great product!roducts</li>
            <li> This product works great for me.</li>
            <li> I have read great reviews of Emjoi epilators.</li>
            <li> LOL.  </li>
            <li> Gold Caress Epilator worked great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working great for three years and counting.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling</li>
            <li> I am thrilled that I have found my beloved Emjoi!</li>
            <li> but I rubbed in some good lotion and within 3 hours the spots were gone.</li>
            <li> This Epilator is good.  </li>
            <li> Got a good deal at Amazon and thought \\&quot;what the heck\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It is a good idea to follow the recommendations that come with the product about exfoliation and how to hold the skin, etc.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!</li>
            <li> Because when I first used mine, I was having those problems as well, but once I got the hang of it, it worked wonderfully!  </li>
            <li> I bought it in 2001 and it is still working, and I love it!</li>
            <li> Although this is not for the feint of heart, it does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the very best hair removal tool I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Once in a very great while something comes along that really does what it says.</li>
            <li> I also am vexed by hair breakage on the legs, leaving them sandpapery-stubbly (not knife-point-stubbly) but looking nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually, this product is good and it is better than shaving.  </li>
            <li> My advice is, have a warm bath, use the loofa that comes with the epilator, put on your ipod, and then have a go at it.</li>
            <li> Because it is so effective.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this product to anyone looking for an effective hair removal system.</li>
            <li> I used to own an Epilady (the oldest model), which was truly a torture device.  </li>
            <li> - good job for most of the legs.  </li>
            <li> cost effective.  </li>
            <li> The Emjoi Gently Gold Caress Epilator with Cord is awesome!!  </li>
            <li> The Emjoi also works best if you keep it very clean--don&#x27;t let hairs build up in it.</li>
            <li> Remove hair on your own time &lt;br</li>
            <li> Just follow the instructions and make sure to use a very good lotion right after use.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I am fair complected with light hair.  </li>
            <li> The best thing that I have found so far is that I don&#x27;t have to take a bath after each session.  </li>
            <li> I got for my wife, She said its nice and better than waxing.</li>
            <li> and I stress that it is VERY IMPORTANT TO SHOWER AND EXFOLIATE before you use the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> I love this product to death.  </li>
            <li> Finer, lighter, and for some reason more evenly distributed.</li>
            <li> This morning my legs look better than they have in years.</li>
            <li> but most of it was just cut off.  </li>
            <li> and I wont be able to show off my legs how I wanted to.  </li>
            <li> It would hurt more to eplilate longer hair than shorter.  </li>
            <li> I never used anything that did a better job of removing unwanted hair.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t understand why so many people think doing the legs is painless, comparatively to the armpits.  </li>
            <li> It hurts more than waxing.</li>
            <li> If you can stand waxing, though, you should be able to stand this pain.</li>
            <li> If you can stand waxing, though, you should be able to stand this pain.</li>
            <li> The product itself was in great condition and does really work.  </li>
            <li> And I sure do love my skirts.</li>
            <li> It is simply the best thing for me.</li>
            <li> and I love this thing.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off exfoliating more often of course, but this is the minimum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased to be free of prickly nubs on my legs!</li>
            <li> BTW, it&#x27;s even better with use of Kalo hair inhibitor spray or cream.</li>
            <li> Now I miss it more than ever.</li>
            <li> It does work in this situation, but it takes a lot more effort to flatten out the area so it can grab the hair.</li>
            <li> and oh so hair free!</li>
            <li> It works better if you follow the instructions to the T.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels fantastic!</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I can not express how pleased I was with the results.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, I have been Waxing for years, so I may be more used to the \\&quot;pull it by the roots\\&quot; feel.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> more I use it, the more I like it.  </li>
            <li> make sure the epilator is going in the correct direction and be sure you use it at a 90 degree angle to your skin.  </li>
            <li> (I find a fine-grade foot file works better than a loofah for exfoliation, by the way).</li>
            <li> Much better than others I have used.</li>
            <li> Many more ingrowns then waxing or shaving  &lt;</li>
            <li> Yes, the first time you use it, you may feel some discomfort, but walk it off!!!  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive my Emjoi as we were going on a cruise</li>
            <li> , i ended up shaving because this epilator didn&#x27;t get my legs smooth even after i went over the same area alot of times, so in all fair judgement i need to get brave and try to use the epilator again, hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I also figured out that it may be a good idea to use Veet or Nair first</li>
            <li> (hey the silky-mit things are pretty good, still).</li>
            <li> (hey the silky-mit things are pretty good, still).</li>
            <li> Even for the face it works pretty good</li>
            <li> I found that the emjoi arrived quickly and in good condition and tried it out right away.</li>
            <li> After testing couple of other epllitor, I think I found the best one.</li>
            <li> and you can get those again so easily that its a non issue.</li>
            <li> and you can get those again so easily that its a non issue.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to get it to pull all my leg hair without breaking a great deal off in the process, and so had delegated it to getting strays after a leg wax and for my upper leg and bikini.</li>
            <li> If you do get though, make sure you clean it after each use because it&#x27;ll be a lot easier that way.</li>
            <li> otherwise I thing it would still be going strong.</li>
            <li> and It is very easy right now to take out the hair.   </li>
            <li> you want a quick and painless fix for your hair removal needs, this is probably not the product for you (but how many products are painless?</li>
            <li> It works best on the legs if you have the time and patience to pull every little hair out.  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;naturally smooth&#x27; likeness - definite win.</li>
            <li> Yes the Emjoi has a &amp;quot;curve&amp;quot; to fit the shape of a womans needs</li>
            <li> I was indeed happy with the spots it DID get because the hair didnt grow back for some time</li>
            <li> the whole I liked the machine.</li>
            <li> Even under my arms I am smooth, and stubble/raizor burn free.  </li>
            <li> I just upgraded to the Emjoi after a not so great wax experience and have not looked back since.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands and models, from the old Epilady to Phillips to Braun, and every time the product seemed to get better and better.</li>
            <li> My legs are so smooth</li>
            <li> I can tolerate them because I have finaly have smooth legs.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s convinient to just plug it in and get comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I could not get the skin taut enough, so of course it hurt alot, and i am unexperienced at using this, so i can not give a fair opinion until i have used it more</li>
            <li> Though I was pretty scared of the pain, I was even more aggravated with shaving.   </li>
            <li> It took me a week to get through my underarms, but the smoothness was absolutely worth it!  </li>
            <li> I am so excited about the results I got from the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> I broke it attempting to take it apart to clean it out</li>
            <li> But I find waxing a pain to set up, clean the strips, and the &#x27;putty&#x27; wax the salons</li>
            <li> Not on the legs, but mostly on the face area where the hair is more sensitive.</li>
            <li> Not on the legs, but mostly on the face area where the hair is more sensitive.</li>
            <li> Waxing was quick and easy, but it hurt, had leftover mini-hairs, and the wax and wax papers ran out quickly.  </li>
            <li> I especially love that there&#x27;s NO mess like with waxing...same diff&#x27;, only quicker &amp; cleaner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced, and more importantly, if you want smooth, touchable legs for longer, it is totally worth both the pain and the time.</li>
            <li> and my legs are full of ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> Its true, it does hurt.</li>
            <li> Then I use it the next day, it pulls some more, and I repeat a couple more days until smooth.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well, and on top of that, it hurts like hell to use it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it compares to the other brands, but I&#x27;m very very happy with this particular brand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it compares to the other brands, but I&#x27;m very very happy with this particular brand.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s just the hairs being quickly plucked out.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure that you have proper lighting so that you are able to see when all the hair is gone.  </li>
            <li> (mild tingling effect).  </li>
            <li> I chose this one over the others because it had a curved tweezer bit, (unlike the Braun, which has a flat top), but truthfully, I have</li>
            <li> I chose this one over the others because it had a curved tweezer bit, (unlike the Braun, which has a flat top), but truthfully, I have</li>
            <li> Works great for bikini area with little pain but</li>
            <li> Definitly Good deal for this price .I am not giving it all 5 because it makes noise and is having curve that can make her press hard on skin to get better results.</li>
            <li> and it comes back without the stubble being sharp-tipped, which is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d always dreamed of being able to have soft, touchable legs.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the money and will probably save you some on all of the hair removal products you buy</li>
            <li> I understand all of the gripes about the pain that this causes, but in the end it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> (I think its worth the pain, though).</li>
            <li> (I think its worth the pain, though).</li>
            <li> yes it can be time consuming, but it is well worth the time saved in the shower every day.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t be fooled-it hurts A LOT.The results are worth it.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend starting out with long hair, about a day or 2 growth seems to be the best, so for the first use, shave, wait a day or 2 depending on your hair growth, then go for it.  </li>
            <li> I use regularly on my bikini line and on my underarms and can report that the results are smooth and fabulous!  </li>
            <li> so long it is shocking!I am really in love with this thing!</li>
            <li> right beneath the knee, for instance.  </li>
            <li> At a minimum, you must exfoliate the day before and right after you&#x27;re done epilating.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the nerve to use it on more sensitive areas, but thats ok, because smaller more sensitive areas can be tweezed or shaved in no time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best fifty I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.</li>
            <li> I avoided talking to someone in bright sunlight for fear that my \\&quot;beard\\&quot; was showing or I had missed a black one on my neck.</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;m done my skin does mostly feel almost baby smooth, and it roughly lasts about a week.</li>
            <li> maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t gotten brave enough to epilate the bikini area, but it&#x27;s definitely next.</li>
            <li> Suddenly, I am feeling free and light</li>
            <li> my old one works so much better than this Gently gold caress.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised at how easy &amp; \\&quot;almost\\&quot; painless this device was.  </li>
            <li> When I got it about a month ago I didn&#x27;t have very much hair to use it on.  </li>
            <li> The Emjoi magically combines the disadvantages of waxing and shaving, being time-consuming (much more than any other epilator I&#x27;ve owned) and highly ineffective as a longish-term hair removal method.</li>
            <li> It take out the hair very easy and fast since I took practice of it for several days.  </li>
            <li> Hurts like hell the first time (so take</li>
            <li> This was my first epilator.</li>
            <li> I have had Emjoi for a couple of months...and to tell you frankly, after my first use it was sitting on the shelf.</li>
            <li> first time users</li>
            <li> Years ago I got one of the first Epilady models.  </li>
            <li> one the first one lasted for 5 years with weekly use.</li>
            <li> Firstly, why I got to this point.</li>
            <li> The first time I turned this product on, and heard the whirring, I literally yelled for my mother.</li>
            <li> And the first time shaving was a trial.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because you need to attack the hairs while they&#x27;re still short and mostly sparse in the area you&#x27;re working on.  </li>
            <li> I agree that it does take some creative movement to get all the hair around the knees and ankles, but that is the same with any removal product.  </li>
            <li> After the first couple of uses, the first thing I noticed was NO  </li>
            <li> But I have the feeling that it&#x27;s actually ripping more hair than pulling it out.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product about 7 years ago after seeing it in an airline magazine (you know, one of those things on every plane in the pocket on the seat in front of your cramped-up legs).</li>
            <li> MUCH cheaper! &lt;</li>
            <li> It does a great job in getting even the shortest of hairs and afterwards it was red, but using a product such as tend skin or any product designed to prevent razor burn it helped a great deal and after a few hours my skin was not red at all.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does miss some hair and break some others, (resulting in a bit of stubble in parts), but the good news is that it works on next day stubble, even though they&#x27;re short--</li>
            <li> Yes, it does miss some hair and break some others, (resulting in a bit of stubble in parts), but the good news is that it works on next day stubble, even though they&#x27;re short--</li>
            <li> She was using Philips for last 7 years , and compared to that its good or same.</li>
            <li> I admit that the first time I used it the pain was a bit much for the first minute or so</li>
            <li> I could never have worn a skirt and felt comfortable more than 3 days after I shaved, but now I can go up to a week and half in a short skirt and feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> and will certainly buy another one.</li>
            <li> Will have pain and redness for a short time, but everything is fine after a night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a small brush so that you can clean off the top area.  </li>
            <li> works great for very thick hairs.</li>
            <li> Its cheaper in the long run, not messy, very quick (about as quick as shaving)</li>
            <li> Its cheaper in the long run, not messy, very quick (about as quick as shaving)</li>
            <li> This a HUGE and VAST improvement to the EpiLady!!  </li>
            <li> Still a HUGE improvement on my daily plucking before!!</li>
            <li> Now, I fit very neatly into the above categories, and so for me this product is a God-send.</li>
            <li> I have been using my Emjoi for several months now, and have noticed a huge difference in the number of hairs and the hair texture on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> It hurt like hell, but it worked really well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this problem, and it&#x27;s very iritating to see these hairs.  </li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> After seeing my result with the Emjoi, my mother wants to get a Braun to try (as the instructions say not to share the depilator for hygiene reasons), and she wants to change brands just to see.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After seeing my result with the Emjoi, my mother wants to get a Braun to try (as the instructions say not to share the depilator for hygiene reasons), and she wants to change brands just to see.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really learned to use it</li>
            <li> This device help me to keep a smooth skin for several days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never had such smooth skin on my legs before.</li>
            <li> Still, I would say if you&#x27;re a hairy person, you really oughta get this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it really reduces the number of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I really like this product(after 5 years of using Nad&#x27;s \\&quot;wax\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li> If you are concerned about the price of the Emjoi, just think about how much you spend for disposable razors or wax.</li>
            <li> But I was disturbed by how much money I was spending on razor blades and shave gel</li>
            <li> However, I really got this for my chin.  </li>
            <li> The Emjoi Gently</li>
            <li> Legs look much cleaner and feel softer without them.</li>
            <li> Although they say if you scrub with a loofa it helps, I don&#x27;t really feel that it helps all that much.</li>
            <li> But after several usages, all but the most sensitive skin gets used to it.  </li>
            <li> This is most appreciated in the armpit area, which at least for me, is the most sensitive area.</li>
            <li> I am already planning how to introduce epilating to my daughter when she is old enough to do it in the hopes that she will never have to shave because the truth is that my hair is finer and more sparse than before waxing and epilating.</li>
            <li> It does sting a little when you first start to use it, but as you use it more often, you get used to it</li>
            <li> I then attempted to do the underarms in which the pain was definitely strong (and I mean strong).  </li>
            <li> In answer to the criticisms I&#x27;ve read so far, yes it&#x27;s noisy, yes it hurts, but not very bad,</li>
            <li> It leaves them silky smooth and entirely too sexy to be armpits, and after only 3 epilations, much of the hair is NOT growing back.  </li>
            <li> Since the beginning the rechargeable battery would not hold a charge, which I figured was no big deal since the cord is nice and long.</li>
            <li> You may get little red dots on your skin after epilating, so I would recommend doing it in the evening or on a day when you won&#x27;t show off you gorgeous legs.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong: epilators are great, and that&#x27;s what most of the other reviewers found out.</li>
            <li> I had to spend two days doing it (one on both of my lower legs, another on the top half).  </li>
            <li> Even super short hairs were pulled out, and I have no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I thought that the idea was good, but I have never used anything more painful in my life.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if this is for you, but if your story is similar to mine, it definitely could be. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if this is for you, but if your story is similar to mine, it definitely could be. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I used it on my legs next, and it worked okay, but it left a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li> Plucking became something I had to do every day in bright daylight to catch the one or two rogue black hairs on my chin and neck, cream removers worked well but the long term affects worried me,</li>
            <li> It is definitely more sensitive around the ankles and front of the shins but other than that it does not bother me anymore (like plucking your eyebrows-</li>
            <li> And, for me, I only have smooth legs for about two weeks (though the new hairs are not terribly noticeable, and I usually wait about 4 weeks between uses.)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person who doesn&#x27;t mind too much pain, so when it hurt like it did it surprised me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved my whole adult life.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m having more trouble with ingrown hairs on the legs--</li>
            <li> As someone with quite sensitive skin, I have had reactions to waxing, razors are a nightmare and to top it off having course dark hair</li>
            <li> So, using the Emjoi Epilator was not painful because not my hair is more sparce and thin.  </li>
            <li> Using the epilator is more convenient and does not leave the messy residue that waxing did.  </li>
            <li> Because you are attacking each area when there are fewer and shorter hairs, all you feel are just a few quick tugs that feel more like minor pinpricks.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the Emjoi because not only was the pain bearable, I actually quickly got used to it.  </li>
            <li> When I finally received it, I tried it right away.  </li>
            <li> My other half even commented that it looked good.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> I ordered my first, wore it out after 4 years, am now wearing out a second!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for 10 years and was searching for a new one as my 6 year old braun silk epil is wearing out.</li>
            <li> The key seems to be turning the machine to the fast speed, moving very very sloooooowly and in VERY short strokes.  </li>
            <li> Being somewhat pale with strong coarse leg hairs, of course the first thing I did was shave  at a young age.</li>
            <li> Pros: generally no stubble for a week, no dark spots that can be seen through the skin, and getting to be smooth without having to do daily hair removal and maintenance.</li>
            <li> I have found that three days in a row of use gets me smooth for about a two week period, then the little persistant hairs start again.  </li>
            <li> I grabbed my 6 year old Braun and it worked so much better with hardly any pain.</li>
            <li> I have very dark and coarse hair, so I have tried many things to get rid of unwanted hairs, but nothing has ever gotten them under control like this.  </li>
            <li> I shaved regularly, but my hair grows so fast</li>
            <li> The reason being, if you are a first time user, your hair are probably quite long.</li>
            <li> (Thanks to my German grandmother!).</li>
            <li> Wow...</li>
            <li> It really works and I wont be going back to razors ever again!</li>
            <li> I really like using it on the armpit area, and after the second time the pain is not a factor.  </li>
            <li> I will tell you that I have tried it on my upper lip, but it stings too much.  </li>
            <li> though I&#x27;d invest a few more dollars and get the reviewer-acclaimed Emjoi, after I&#x27;d left my four-year-old Braun in some trip.</li>
            <li> my hairs were just too dark, too coarse and too strong.</li>
            <li> that my review be useful for other customers who want to buy this product and for manufacturer to improve this product.</li>
            <li> No mess (besides for the hairs your&#x27;re pulling out) &lt;</li>
            <li> and I have to go left to right or right to left instead of up or down the leg.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my next day stubble is highly visible--</li>
            <li> and now I have to wait until my legs are back to normal.  </li>
            <li> Those were very unsightly and difficult to deal with until I just decided to give in and pull out my trusty razor once more.</li>
            <li> The reviews so far have been terrific guides: this spiffy little machine DOES hurt, it DOES sound like an outboard motor, and it DOES take a long time to use...</li>
            <li> Smooth legs for at least a week</li>
            <li> it barely removed anything because</li>
            <li> It is saving me so much money and time spent in salons waxing.</li>
            <li> , however they&#x27;re so minor, it&#x27;s not really a negative for me.</li>
            <li> have wavy hair - not tight curls, but a definite wave.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried the other models in the Emjoi line, so I have no means of comparison, but this seems to work very well for me.  </li>
            <li> First timers:pop a Tylenol and keep the skin pulled tight.  </li>
            <li> The new thing here is that I can do it over and be done without waiting for them to grow for another two weeks to get long enough to wax.  </li>
            <li> but I prefer to keep waxing and keep this on the side for those days when I&#x27;m away from home, for general touch ups (especially those summer days),</li>
            <li> The only reason why I cannot give it 5 stars is because I find it hard to clean.  </li>
            <li> Every person can have sensitivity in a different area, and mine is apparently under my arms.  </li>
            <li> I should have listened to the negative ones as what they said proved to be true.  </li>
            <li> after the first few uses this thig dont hert</li>
            <li> This epilator is so easy to use and while it hurts a bit, waxing hurts worse.</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to get it right</li>
            <li> I have always had coarse, dark hair on my legs, thanks to my dad&#x27;s genetic contribution to my body, and in summer had to shave nearly every day--literally a pain, as I&#x27;m of little use with a razor.</li>
            <li> Epilating my armpits doesn&#x27;t hurt much at all, so long as the skin is pulled tight in the path of the machine.  </li>
            <li> I found I was tweezing everyday and never able to make the area completely smooth.   </li>
            <li> I have blonde hair that was getting coarse and long along my jawline, chin and neck</li>
            <li> I am utterly addicted: I think it&#x27;s much nicer than using a razor, and frankly, the pain is not much worse than a chili-burn from hot food and leaves me dazzled with minor, slow endorphin</li>
            <li> I might try a step up next time, or a flat head to see if it makes a difference, but I won&#x27;t go back to waxing or shaving for the long haul.  </li>
            <li> I used a home wax with strips, it worked, and it was satisfying ripping the little suckers out!</li>
            <li> I only used it once, and probably will NOT use it again, even on a less sensitive area.</li>
            <li> Now as someone who&#x27;s went from shaving to waxing, using this epilator gets you almost the same results as waxing and lasts just as long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thought about professional waxing, but it costs around $100 for half of a leg at the salon.  </li>
            <li> I read some positive ones and also read some negative ones.  </li>
            <li> All epilators are painful, but this one is cute and gets the job done well!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have model legs, (those are airbrushed anyway), but it works so much better than all the other methods put together that I feel like an absolute moron for having gone through so many failed methods and not just buying one of these 7 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Yes--</li>
            <li> Like other reviews, I did notice that the Gently Gold Caress Epilator does skip a few hairs</li>
            <li> Some areas are sensitive and a little bothersome, but compared to waxing its a breeze.  </li>
            <li> perhaps they&#x27;re just harder to exfoliate properly in preparation and</li>
            <li> It lasts about as long as shaving does, but I do recommend it after you&#x27;ve missed bits or the day after stubble of shaving or waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, it takes a long time.  </li>
            <li> Sounds strange I know, but this has a concave curve to the blades - they curve in.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love baths, but it is difficult with 2 small children, to find the time to wax and then to bathe:)  </li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d bought one a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I bought the one with the cord because I didn&#x27;t want to have to worry about constatnly changing the batteries, plus the cord is quite long</li>
            <li> When used regularly, there is minimal discomfort for maximum results.  </li>
            <li> I had tears rolling down my face, but the hair didn&#x27;t come back until now (about 4 weeks later).  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, do NOT hesitate to get this -- it will change your life, save you time, give you freedom, save you money, and improve your appearance tremendously -- just do exfoliate like they say cuz you can get ingrown hairs (they don&#x27;t hurt, you just need to pluck them with tweezers occasionally).  </li>
            <li> It takes a long time!</li>
            <li> There were little red spots immediately following, but they disappeared within the hour.  </li>
            <li> For one thing, it didn&#x27;t hurt NEARLY as bad as the reviews warned -- I have incredibly sensitive skin and thought I would need vitamin E immediately afterwards, but there was no bad aftereffect whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> The only problem with this is that this is not cord less.</li>
            <li> I had a ton of little red spots on my legs after using this</li>
            <li> It did hurt on some spots but for the most part it was not too bad.  </li>
            <li> that was more painful than my legs, but nothing compared to my underarms.  </li>
            <li> This is because you have to go back and forth over one area quite a few times to get all the hairs out    2.</li>
            <li> Although it removed most of the hair, I developed red bumps (think: terrible acne or measles!)all over the areas where I used the epilator.  </li>
            <li> This product performs exactly as it is expected.</li>
            <li> I think it works well on legs also, but I am too impatient to use regularly here.  </li>
            <li> It hurts much less than waxing and is not messy, it picked up even small hairs and it took maybe five minutes to do my legs.</li>
            <li> This is as good as conventional waxing, but suprisingly, not as painful!</li>
            <li> I hated the mess, the hassle and the cuts, plus replacing razors so much, I let it go (becoming like the yeti and permanently wearing pants!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t normally mind the discomfort of epilating, torturing me by yanking on the same hair several times it just WRONG!</li>
            <li> The Emjoi was less painful than the waxing and way more</li>
            <li> the other hand, my legs...</li>
            <li> In fact other cremes don&#x27;t work well on my legs at all (and they stink afterwards).</li>
            <li> I never experienced this with a normal shaving.</li>
            <li> No more gross bathing suit surprises!</li>
            <li> I use an exfoliator in the shower every other day, and it keeps the ingrowns to a minimum.  </li>
            <li> I use Lac Hydrin Five lotion with alpha hydroxy every other day.  </li>
            <li> After researching other epilators I am going to order a Braun and throw this one out.</li>
            <li> I was fed up with all other hair removal methods and decided to give this gadget a try.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I bought one and used an epilator for the first time.</li>
            <li> First, the Emjoi&#x27;s poorly design tip makes it hard to do more than half an inch at once - and almost impossible to do some areas on the knees.</li>
            <li> As someone who has a very very high tolerance to pain, (and loves pulling out the hairs because I hate them so much); it hurts me even.</li>
            <li> Shaving made my legs itch like mad and the hair grew back sooo fast.</li>
            <li> Well, my underarm curves in too and no matter how hard I try, I cannot flatten the area enough to get the concave blades to grab hair there.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to remove hair from my face and neck, as I have a lot of blond and dark hair on those areas.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The curve of this model is very difficult to use since you need to really press the product against your skin and the curvature prevents you from getting close enough.</li>
            <li> but MAN don&#x27;t go down there,</li>
            <li> have told four other people who bought this product and all are raving about the results!</li>
            <li> first time I did my legs, it was a little uncomfortable, and I did get the little bumps -</li>
            <li> For years I have avoided being seen in a bathing suit because of excessive hair in the bikini line area, shaving was painful, itchy, and left me covered in red marks and bumps as I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> In less that half-an-hour I had silky legs</li>

            <li> I take about an hour and a half to shave both my legs.</li>

            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a year and a half now.</li>
            <li> It will be painful, you basically have a bunch of tweezers all working at the same time at a high speed removing the hair.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> My mom calls me obsessed with the hair on my body because I&#x27;m always trying to find new hair removal things that work.  </li>
            <li> So I used it on a little of my arm hair.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little while to do</li>
            <li> Is a little expensive&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ingrown hairs given are not worth it!  </li>
            <li> The dark little follicle marks you can see after shaving are no longer a part of my life!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they&#x27;re not really reusable and it takes forever to do your entire leg.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried those messy dipilatory creams that didn&#x27;t remove all of my hair</li>
            <li> The same as with tweezing, there are stubborn hairs, broken hairs, and ingrowns.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well for very short or thin hairs.</li>
            <li> waxing was messy and time consuming.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been game enough to rip out my bikini line or underarms yet, because I know its going to hurt like hell.</li>

            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months, it&#x27;s not a problem at all.  </li>
            <li> Now, by this time, there will be hair there, but it will be relatively sparse and thin.    </li>
            <li> Second, even when you do get to the hair, it gets broken instead of being pulled out at the root, for which reason in a couple of days you&#x27;re even hairier than before.</li>
            <li> Now I won&#x27;t have to worry about them for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I am going to state a few facts.</li>
            <li> I did find that you have to do it for a few days in a row</li>
            <li> (killed all your nerves by then).  </li>
            <li> I have used Emjoi products for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Less painful and messy than waxing, and much faster!  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind a little pain, a little time, and like me, want the hair to be gone awhile, get this!  </li>

            <li> I even went so far as to purchase an epilator at a local retailer, only to return it after reading horrible reviews.</li>
            <li> You know the whole point where it would be almost impossible to give yourself a tattoo b/c of the pain factor well apply that to pulling out your unsightly hairs.  </li>
            <li> MORE  IRRITATING  STUBBLE!!!!  </li>
            <li> Honestly, at first, I was having flashbacks of the \\&quot;Epi Lady\\&quot; days, but it really is NOT that bad!</li>

            <li> , I usually do it once every 10 days.</li>
            <li> I have only ever used the epilady years ago when it first came out and that was terrible.  </li>
            <li> After a few times, it&#x27;s a breeze!</li>
            <li> Use the brush or a small pipe-cleaner each time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the purpose of having two speeds is, but I have nothing but praise to offer.</li>

            <li> can&#x27;t believe I was chicken for so long.  </li>
            <li> There is a little unpleasant sting while using it and it can take a little time to get it done to your satisfaction, but</li>
            <li> Every time I use it I have to go trough the initial shock, but then it isn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> My few random chin hairs have multiplied over the years.  </li>
            <li> Waxing this area did no good at all.  </li>
            <li> I have been sooo unhappy with the results of other products.</li>
            <li> The first time around was the worst, but now it is virtually pain-free (yes, even on the armpits!)</li>
            <li> I have owned this epilator for only 6 months, and have to say I am very unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> I do biweekly maintenance for those broken and stubborn hair bits.</li>

            <li> it is too time consuming for the legs, irritates my face, and leaves a lot of hair behind.</li>
            <li> I have read that emjoi is less painful and quicker</li>
            <li> was disappointed with the product in that I needed to go repeatedly over my hairy legs to pull all those little hairs out.</li>
            <li> , the Emjoi Gold Caress looks and sounds like some sort of torture tool, but after a few passes on my neck and chin, it was baby-booty smoothe!!!!</li>
            <li> I have a couple little \\&quot;zones\\&quot; on them that just hate to be epilated:</li>
            <li> underarm is painful and sporadic with hair removal because it is hard to pull the skin taut.</li>
            <li> I tried doing one leg for an hour, it was quite painful and hardly picked up any hair at all.</li>
            <li> Boy was I WRONG.</li>
            <li> meaning I don&#x27;t have to skip deoderant while I go through the difficult stubble</li>
            <li> (so I believed the adverts, is that so wrong?)</li>
            <li> I found that I became addicted and was disappointed when I ran out of hairy places on my body</li>
            <li> After a while i guess my underarms became numb to the pain</li>
            <li> they get numb to it over time).</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was disappointed that my hairgrowth pattern is not compatible with the use of this tool.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical before I bought this epilator -- I had been a shave-every-day kinda gal ever since I was 11 and was hesitant to give that up.  </li>
            <li> and once you get the hang of how to use it, it was not all that bad.</li>
            <li> As for pain, it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> I started on my legs on which it was not as painful as I thought.  </li>
            <li> dont need to get waxed and spend all the money on those painful salon visits</li>
            <li> My husband would not agree on this count as he found it to be quite painful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too painful to use on the underarms,though.</li>
            <li> I used to go every 3-4 weeks for leg waxing which, to me, was painful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have to say I really like this product.  My mom calls me obsessed with the hair on my body because I&#x27;m always trying to find new hair removal things that work.  I&#x27;ve tried waxing, shaving, and all the dipilatories out there.  Waxing was quick and easy, but it hurt, had leftover mini-hairs, and the wax and wax papers ran out quickly.  I&#x27;ve thought about professional waxing, but it costs around $100 for half of a leg at the salon.  I shaved regularly, but my hair grows so fast it cam back the same night. I&#x27;ve even tried those messy dipilatory creams that didn&#x27;t remove all of my hair and I got the same results as if I had shaved.  I&#x27;d always dreamed of being able to have soft, touchable legs.  Then I found Emjoi.  I love this product to death.  When I got it about a month ago I didn&#x27;t have very much hair to use it on.  So I used it on a little of my arm hair.  It hurt like hell, but it worked really well.  I&#x27;m a person who doesn&#x27;t mind too much pain, so when it hurt like it did it surprised me.  I used it on my mustache area next (I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that).  I had tears rolling down my face, but the hair didn&#x27;t come back until now (about 4 weeks later).  I used it on my leg hair next.  It hurt a lot, and I would recommend taking some pain pills or like an aspirin before you do it. I had to spend two days doing it (one on both of my lower legs, another on the top half).  But I&#x27;m still waiting for my hair to grow in so I can do it again (this is 4 weeks later).&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s a summary:&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Hurts like hell the first time (so take an aspirin)&lt;br /&gt;2.  Takes a little while to do&lt;br /&gt;3.  Is a little expensive&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Totally worth the money and will probably save you some on all of the hair removal products you buy&lt;br /&gt;2.  My hair is still gone 4 weeks later&lt;br /&gt;3.  Hurts, but I have the feeling I&#x27;ll get used to it after a while&lt;br /&gt;If you want a quick and painless fix for your hair removal needs, this is probably not the product for you (but how many products are painless? You get a rash from dep., nick yourself while shaving, and pain while waxing anyways).  If you don&#x27;t mind a little pain, a little time, and like me, want the hair to be gone awhile, get this!  It really is a great product!roducts are painless? You get a rash from dep., nick yourself while shaving, and pain while waxing anyways).

            <li> It is, basically, tweezing. The same as with tweezing, there are stubborn hairs, broken hairs, and ingrowns. Once I&#x27;m done my skin does mostly feel almost baby smooth, and it roughly lasts about a week. I do biweekly maintenance for those broken and stubborn hair bits. Pros: generally no stubble for a week, no dark spots that can be seen through the skin, and getting to be smooth without having to do daily hair removal and maintenance. The hair growing back? Finer, lighter, and for some reason more evenly distributed. The &#x27;naturally smooth&#x27; likeness - definite win.</li>
            <li> I ordered this so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep shelling out the money for waxing. I was unsure how well it would work and a little scared that it would be worse that waxing. Boy was I WRONG. This epilator is so easy to use and while it hurts a bit, waxing hurts worse. Just follow the instructions and make sure to use a very good lotion right after use. I had a ton of little red spots on my legs after using this but I rubbed in some good lotion and within 3 hours the spots were gone. This morning my legs look better than they have in years.</li>
            <li> Waxing hurts, plucking is irritating for my skin.  This was my first epilator. I had it for three years.  It will be painful, you basically have a bunch of tweezers all working at the same time at a high speed removing the hair.&lt;br /&gt;It works great for very thick hairs. It doesn&#x27;t work as well for very short or thin hairs. Thin hair is removed without the roots and you will probably have to pluck some of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a small brush so that you can clean off the top area.  The cord does get away at times, next time I might just invest in a cordless one as well as a removable head so that I could rinse it off.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews on here before I recently ordered this Emjoi.  I read some positive ones and also read some negative ones.  I should have listened to the negative ones as what they said proved to be true.  I did everything according to the instructions.  I started on my legs on which it was not as painful as I thought.  It did hurt on some spots but for the most part it was not too bad.  It did pull out some of the hair but most of it was just cut off.  I then attempted to do the underarms in which the pain was definitely strong (and I mean strong).  After a while i guess my underarms became numb to the pain but I could not get all the hair.  Yes the Emjoi has a &amp;quot;curve&amp;quot; to fit the shape of a womans needs but it did not allow me to get every spot.  I was indeed happy with the spots it DID get because the hair didnt grow back for some time but I could not wear shirts that exposed my underarms because of the hair it left.  Now its been some time after I did this and my legs are full of ingrown hairs.  I&#x27;ve never had this problem, and it&#x27;s very iritating to see these hairs.  I&#x27;ve tried everything and now I have to wait until my legs are back to normal.  This is VERY inconvenient as it is spring already and I wont be able to show off my legs how I wanted to.  I will not use the Emjoi again on my legs because the results are not what I thought they were at all.  I&#x27;m not happy at all with what it has done to me and what it can do for you.  I rather have saved my money and bought some wax.  The ingrown hairs given are not worth it!  I would rather shave (which i hate) but atleast I dont have this problem.</li>
            <li> I have had Emjoi for a couple of months...and to tell you frankly, after my first use it was sitting on the shelf. It hurts!! But two months ago I read a review which suggested of take a painkiller. Well, it worked wonderfully. In less that half-an-hour I had silky legs and I did not feel the pain!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For first time users I have a suggestion. If you are unsure of your pain tolerance level, take a painkiller. I also figured out that it may be a good idea to use Veet or Nair first, wait for two weeks and then epilate. The reason being, if you are a first time user, your hair are probably quite long. It would hurt more to eplilate longer hair than shorter.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the whole I liked the machine. I gave four stars because even though they suggest that one can use it for underarms, I have found it hurting even after taking a painkiller.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the very best hair removal tool I have ever used.  Quicker cleaner and easier than waxing.  Even super short hairs were pulled out, and I have no irritation.  Even under my arms I am smooth, and stubble/raizor burn free.  I will never ever shave or wax again.</li>
            <li> Once in a very great while something comes along that really does what it says. This product has changed my life. I have blonde hair that was getting coarse and long along my jawline, chin and neck (Thanks to my German grandmother!). Laser was out because of cost and it doesn&#x27;t work on blonde hairs. Plucking became something I had to do every day in bright daylight to catch the one or two rogue black hairs on my chin and neck, cream removers worked well but the long term affects worried me, waxing was messy and time consuming. I avoided talking to someone in bright sunlight for fear that my \\&quot;beard\\&quot; was showing or I had missed a black one on my neck. I was a slave to my facial hair! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Okay, the Emjoi Gold Caress looks and sounds like some sort of torture tool, but after a few passes on my neck and chin, it was baby-booty smoothe!!!! If you can handle the sting of waxing and plucking, you can handle this. It&#x27;s a bit startling at first, almost like a small electric shock...that&#x27;s just the hairs being quickly plucked out. I tried it on one leg and it worked just as well, haven&#x27;t tried pits or (EEEEGAD!) bikini line. DO exfoliate the face before using to prevent ingrown hairs and the annoying pimples they cause. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have told four other people who bought this product and all are raving about the results! I never knew anything like this was out there...the wicked step-sister EpiLady was the last epilator I tried and promptly threw it away. This a HUGE and VAST improvement to the EpiLady!!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you struggle with unwanted hair, Emjoi it and relax...I don&#x27;t know about 4-6 weeks, I usually do it once every 10 days. Still a HUGE improvement on my daily plucking before!!</li>
            <li> I understand all of the gripes about the pain that this causes, but in the end it is worth it.  I never used anything that did a better job of removing unwanted hair.  I have very dark and coarse hair, so I have tried many things to get rid of unwanted hairs, but nothing has ever gotten them under control like this.  Years ago I got one of the first Epilady models.  I thought that the idea was good, but I have never used anything more painful in my life.  It just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  I was pleasantly surprised with the Emjoi because not only was the pain bearable, I actually quickly got used to it.  Every time I use it I have to go trough the initial shock, but then it isn&#x27;t too bad.  The added bonus is that I find that some of the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back at all.  The only reason why I cannot give it 5 stars is because I find it hard to clean.  I would definitely recommend this model to anyone looking for an epilator.</li>
            <li> The reviews so far have been terrific guides: this spiffy little machine DOES hurt, it DOES sound like an outboard motor, and it DOES take a long time to use... but it&#x27;s wonderful!  I am utterly addicted: I think it&#x27;s much nicer than using a razor, and frankly, the pain is not much worse than a chili-burn from hot food and leaves me dazzled with minor, slow endorphin rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why so many people think doing the legs is painless, comparatively to the armpits.  Epilating my armpits doesn&#x27;t hurt much at all, so long as the skin is pulled tight in the path of the machine.  It leaves them silky smooth and entirely too sexy to be armpits, and after only 3 epilations, much of the hair is NOT growing back.  That which is coming back is now finer than before and it comes back without the stubble being sharp-tipped, which is amazing.  And I have no stubble irritation or razor rash, which used to be a regular feature of my life-- meaning I don&#x27;t have to skip deoderant while I go through the difficult stubble period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, my legs... oooh, that smarts.  I have a couple little \\&quot;zones\\&quot; on them that just hate to be epilated: right beneath the knee, for instance.  I also am vexed by hair breakage on the legs, leaving them sandpapery-stubbly (not knife-point-stubbly) but looking nice.  The key seems to be turning the machine to the fast speed, moving very very sloooooowly and in VERY short strokes.  Also, I&#x27;m having more trouble with ingrown hairs on the legs-- perhaps they&#x27;re just harder to exfoliate properly in preparation and maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t gotten brave enough to epilate the bikini area, but it&#x27;s definitely next.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on bikini and underarm area.  Works great for bikini area with little pain but underarm is painful and sporadic with hair removal because it is hard to pull the skin taut.</li>
            <li> dont need to get waxed and spend all the money on those painful salon visits &lt;br /&gt;this is my secand one the first one lasted for 5 years with weekly use. I broke it attempting to take it apart to clean it out otherwise I thing it would still be going strong. after the first few uses this thig dont hert I use it even on my underarms</li>
            <li> Firstly, why I got to this point. Being somewhat pale with strong coarse leg hairs, of course the first thing I did was shave  at a young age. Unfortunately, my next day stubble is highly visible-- bleurgh. And then the ingrowns came-- double bleurgh. I hated the mess, the hassle and the cuts, plus replacing razors so much, I let it go (becoming like the yeti and permanently wearing pants!)&lt;br /&gt;After this, I tried waxing. I used a home wax with strips, it worked, and it was satisfying ripping the little suckers out! But I find waxing a pain to set up, clean the strips, and the &#x27;putty&#x27; wax the salons use kept burning my skin.&lt;br /&gt;After years of waxing, I tried Veet hair removing mousse-- (so I believed the adverts, is that so wrong?) Maybe-- it barely removed anything because (I think) my hairs were just too dark, too coarse and too strong. In fact other cremes don&#x27;t work well on my legs at all (and they stink afterwards). My mother loves them though, so go figure.&lt;br /&gt;After this, I began using a silky-mit. This is a &#x27;mit&#x27; you rub in circular motions on your leg. The friction cuts the hair in a painless, non-wet removal system. It really does work. Unfortunately, they&#x27;re not really reusable and it takes forever to do your entire leg. It lasts about as long as shaving does, but I do recommend it after you&#x27;ve missed bits or the day after stubble of shaving or waxing.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my mother succumbed to my whining and bought me the emjoi (gold because I have allergic reactions to metal or nickel). It was a life-saver. It was not a miracle. I don&#x27;t have model legs, (those are airbrushed anyway), but it works so much better than all the other methods put together that I feel like an absolute moron for having gone through so many failed methods and not just buying one of these 7 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Yes-- Its true, it does hurt. It hurts more than waxing. As someone who has a very very high tolerance to pain, (and loves pulling out the hairs because I hate them so much); it hurts me even. Not on the legs, but mostly on the face area where the hair is more sensitive. I haven&#x27;t been game enough to rip out my bikini line or underarms yet, because I know its going to hurt like hell. Maybe in summer i&#x27;ll have a go. (I think its worth the pain, though). Its cheaper in the long run, not messy, very quick (about as quick as shaving) and you can use it again and again for all the hair you missed the day after, or for just a touch up. Yes, it does miss some hair and break some others, (resulting in a bit of stubble in parts), but the good news is that it works on next day stubble, even though they&#x27;re short-- and you can get those again so easily that its a non issue. It misses very few hairs. The only con I would say is the pain-- if you have a low tolerance to pain, give it a miss. It is not painless like it claims! If you can stand waxing, though, you should be able to stand this pain. If I had to change something about it, I&#x27;d make it rechargable so I could take it with me for overnight (they do sell rechargable ones, so my bad, really). I don&#x27;t know how it compares to the other brands, but I&#x27;m very very happy with this particular brand. I chose this one over the others because it had a curved tweezer bit, (unlike the Braun, which has a flat top), but truthfully, I have *no* idea if the curve makes any difference. After seeing my result with the Emjoi, my mother wants to get a Braun to try (as the instructions say not to share the depilator for hygiene reasons), and she wants to change brands just to see.&lt;br /&gt;Since getting the EG Gold, I have thrown everything but my silky-mit away (hey the silky-mit things are pretty good, still). I never use razors if I can help it, now. I can&#x27;t say if this is for you, but if your story is similar to mine, it definitely could be. &#x3D;)t hurts me even. Not on the legs, but mostly on the face area where the hair is more sensitive. I haven&#x27;t been game enough to rip out my bikini line or underarms yet, because I know its going to hurt like hell. Maybe in summer i&#x27;ll have a go. (I think its worth the pain, though).

Yes, it does miss some hair and break some others, (resulting in a bit of stubble in parts), but the good news is that it works on next day stubble, even though they&#x27;re short-- and you can get those again so easily that its a non issue. It misses very few hairs. The only con I would say is the pain-- if you have a low tolerance to pain, give it a miss. It is not painless like it claims! If you can stand waxing, though, you should be able to stand this pain. If I had to change something about it, I&#x27;d make it rechargable so I could take it with me for overnight (they do sell rechargable ones, so my bad, really). I don&#x27;t know how it compares to the other brands, but I&#x27;m very very happy with this particular brand. I chose this one over the others because it had a curved tweezer bit, (unlike the Braun, which has a flat top), but truthfully, I have *no* idea if the curve makes any difference. After seeing my result with the Emjoi, my mother wants to get a Braun to try (as the instructions say not to share the depilator for hygiene reasons), and she wants to change brands just to see.&lt;br /&gt;Since getting the EG Gold, I have thrown everything but my silky-mit away (hey the silky-mit things are pretty good, still). I never use razors if I can help it, now. I can&#x27;t say if this is for you, but if your story is similar to mine, it definitely could be. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This Epilator is good.  It take out the hair very easy and fast since I took practice of it for several days.  I really learned to use it and It is very easy right now to take out the hair.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have a problem after using this spilation system.  Days later after my epilation, I got some hair that visible come out under the skin of my legs.  I mean it is visible and under the skin.  It is imposible for me to take this hair out with my epilator so I use a knife to uncover the hair from the skin so I can take out the hair with the epilator.  I don&#x27;t know if this hair that grow visible under the skin was caused by the epilation with this device.  I never experienced this with a normal shaving. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also have another problem with this product.  It is that after epilating for days, my legs got a lot of point marks.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Actually, this product is good and it is better than shaving.  With shaving, I often get irritated and sometime cutted skin.  This device help me to keep a smooth skin for several days. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For everything, I give this product 3 stars. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hope that my review be useful for other customers who want to buy this product and for manufacturer to improve this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive my Emjoi as we were going on a cruise and I wanted to be as hairless as possible. I found that the emjoi arrived quickly and in good condition and tried it out right away. Some people have complained about the pain, however, I did not find this to be a problem. My husband would not agree on this count as he found it to be quite painful so it depends on one&#x27;s pain tolerance.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed with the product in that I needed to go repeatedly over my hairy legs to pull all those little hairs out. It ended up being rather time consuming. Also, I did have the issues with in-grown hairs that have been mentioned. Those were very unsightly and difficult to deal with until I just decided to give in and pull out my trusty razor once more. Needless to say, I was disappointed that my hairgrowth pattern is not compatible with the use of this tool.</li>
            <li> The product itself was in great condition and does really work.  I hardly use it though b/c the reality is that it hurts like heck.  You know the whole point where it would be almost impossible to give yourself a tattoo b/c of the pain factor well apply that to pulling out your unsightly hairs.  It works best on the legs if you have the time and patience to pull every little hair out.  Even for the face it works pretty good but MAN don&#x27;t go down there, if you know what I mean.  Yikes!  Anyways, I don&#x27;t know how the words \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; and \\&quot;caress\\&quot; can be tied in to this product, that&#x27;s a bit misleading.  Try it for yourself, though, if you&#x27;ve got the time and the pain threshold. :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved my whole adult life.  No matter what strategy I chose, I&#x27;d have stubble the moment I stepped out of the shower.  I decided to give epilators a try.  Though I was pretty scared of the pain, I was even more aggravated with shaving.   &lt;br /&gt;The first time I did my legs, it was a little uncomfortable, and I did get the little bumps - but they went away within a couple of hours.  The next time I used it on my legs, it was a breeze.  And the softness!  Wow...I&#x27;d never had such smooth skin on my legs before. &lt;br /&gt;Then I decided to try my underarms - that was a trial.  Every person can have sensitivity in a different area, and mine is apparently under my arms.  Man, it hurt big.  I could only tap my skin once and have to stop.  But I wanted that baby-smooth skin, so I kept after it.  It took me a week to get through my underarms, but the smoothness was absolutely worth it!  The next time I did my underarms, it was painful, but not nearly as bad.  Now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months, it&#x27;s not a problem at all.  AND I&#x27;ve got the smoothest underarms of my life!  My skin looks almost like there are no huge-hair-folicles under there at all.  I wish I&#x27;d bought one of these years ago. &lt;br /&gt;I tried the epilator on my bikini area too - that was more painful than my legs, but nothing compared to my underarms.  And the skin looked great!  No more gross bathing suit surprises! &lt;br /&gt;I have wavy hair - not tight curls, but a definite wave.  Even with shaving I&#x27;d have occasional ingrown hairs.  I have them with the epilator too, but the number is the same.  I use an exfoliator in the shower every other day, and it keeps the ingrowns to a minimum.  Again, every person is different - you just won&#x27;t know until you give it a try. &lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I was chicken for so long.  I love this thing!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a year and a half now. This product is best suited to:    1. People who are too hairy to shave with a razor, and so would have to either shave every day, or have cheese-grater legs within 2 days of shaving  2. People who don&#x27;t have the money to wax their legs every month or so    Now, I fit very neatly into the above categories, and so for me this product is a God-send. I could never have worn a skirt and felt comfortable more than 3 days after I shaved, but now I can go up to a week and half in a short skirt and feel comfortable. Now, by this time, there will be hair there, but it will be relatively sparse and thin.    There are some cons to this product, though:    1. It takes a long time! I take about an hour and a half to shave both my legs. This is because you have to go back and forth over one area quite a few times to get all the hairs out    2. It&#x27;s painful! The first time I turned this product on, and heard the whirring, I literally yelled for my mother. And the first time shaving was a trial. You do get accustomed to the pain after a while though (it never goes away - you just get accustomed to it), but it takes some practice. My advice is, have a warm bath, use the loofa that comes with the epilator, put on your ipod, and then have a go at it. Soon, you won&#x27;t even think about the pain.    Still, I would say if you&#x27;re a hairy person, you really oughta get this product. It&#x27;s reasonably priced, and more importantly, if you want smooth, touchable legs for longer, it is totally worth both the pain and the time. And I sure do love my skirts.</li>
            <li> I hate to shave and always have.  Shaving is so disdainful to me that it simply is not an option.  The razor-burn, the itching, the stubble: forget it.  I have tried almost every form of home hair removal over the course of about ten years.  Of all forms of hair removal I have tried, rotating head epilators worked the best.  Of the rotating head epilators I&#x27;ve tried, I like the Emjoi the most.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it hurts.  But after several usages, all but the most sensitive skin gets used to it.  Yes, it takes a long time.  It takes me about an hour to do legs, bikini, and underarms.  Yes, it causes ingrown hairs.  So I use a washcloth when I wash my legs.  And, for me, I only have smooth legs for about two weeks (though the new hairs are not terribly noticeable, and I usually wait about 4 weeks between uses.)  Underarms I do about every two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;And, don&#x27;t expect these things to last a lifetime.  Both my Braun and my Emjoi died after 4 years.  But I have grown so dependent on my Emjoi that I will replace it.&lt;br /&gt;So, why use it?  Because it is so effective.  I just use it and forget about it for a month.  No sores, no itches, and no stubble.  It is simply the best thing for me.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving and I love this thing. I am kicking myself for not buying this sooner. For years I have avoided being seen in a bathing suit because of excessive hair in the bikini line area, shaving was painful, itchy, and left me covered in red marks and bumps as I have very sensitive skin. Waxing doesn&#x27;t work well for me, neither does Nair. In answer to the criticisms I&#x27;ve read so far, yes it&#x27;s noisy, yes it hurts, but not very bad, yes you will get ingrown hairs if you don&#x27;t exfoliate, yes it can be time consuming, but it is well worth the time saved in the shower every day. Not to mention the ability to go swimming or wear short shorts without fear of embarassment.</li>
            <li> Although this is not for the feint of heart, it does an amazing job. As someone with quite sensitive skin, I have had reactions to waxing, razors are a nightmare and to top it off having course dark hair I am always trying out a product to see if it might help and I think I have found my miracle product with this one! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I wont lie it does hurt when trying it out but I found after a while and once you get the hang of how to use it, it was not all that bad. It does a great job in getting even the shortest of hairs and afterwards it was red, but using a product such as tend skin or any product designed to prevent razor burn it helped a great deal and after a few hours my skin was not red at all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an effective hair removal system. It really works and I wont be going back to razors ever again!</li>
            <li> The Emjoi does what it says!It pulls out almost all hairs on my legs.But don&#x27;t be fooled-it hurts A LOT.The results are worth it.Weeks go by without having to shave my legs.It&#x27;s too painful to use on the underarms,though.I have to shave there.There&#x27;s redness where I do use it for only one day (where the hairs were pulled out)then smoothness.AHHH !It works on facial hair, too.We can take it,ladies!Try it!</li>
            <li> I could not get the skin taut enough, so of course it hurt alot, and i am unexperienced at using this, so i can not give a fair opinion until i have used it more, i ended up shaving because this epilator didn&#x27;t get my legs smooth even after i went over the same area alot of times, so in all fair judgement i need to get brave and try to use the epilator again, hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I used to own an Epilady (the oldest model), which was truly a torture device.  I just upgraded to the Emjoi after a not so great wax experience and have not looked back since.  I have not tried the other models in the Emjoi line, so I have no means of comparison, but this seems to work very well for me.  I use it on my armpits, legs, and arms (and occasionally above the lip).  The first time around was the worst, but now it is virtually pain-free (yes, even on the armpits!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These are the tricks that I&#x27;ve learned along the way:   &lt;br /&gt;(1) You need to use it once a week to get that pain-free experience.  That&#x27;s because you need to attack the hairs while they&#x27;re still short and mostly sparse in the area you&#x27;re working on.  The claim about being hair-free for 6 weeks is bogus.  Some of your hairs will be snapped off rather than pulled out of the roots, so you do need to use it once a week as those will start growing back.  Because you are attacking each area when there are fewer and shorter hairs, all you feel are just a few quick tugs that feel more like minor pinpricks.  This is most appreciated in the armpit area, which at least for me, is the most sensitive area. &lt;br /&gt;(2) At a minimum, you must exfoliate the day before and right after you&#x27;re done epilating.  You&#x27;re better off exfoliating more often of course, but this is the minimum.  I don&#x27;t use the scratchy pad that came with this device since I don&#x27;t agree with mechanical exfoliants that tear up the skin.  I use Lac Hydrin Five lotion with alpha hydroxy every other day.  I&#x27;ve found it really reduces the number of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> After testing couple of other epllitor, I think I found the best one. The only problem with this is that this is not cord less. Except that this is a gr8 epillator.</li>
            <li> This product works great for me. The effectiveness in removing hair on my legs is about 95%. This is as good as conventional waxing, but suprisingly, not as painful! I don&#x27;t have the nerve to use it on more sensitive areas, but thats ok, because smaller more sensitive areas can be tweezed or shaved in no time. I&#x27;m so pleased to be free of prickly nubs on my legs! BTW, it&#x27;s even better with use of Kalo hair inhibitor spray or cream.</li>
            <li> I come from a family of epilator-lovers. I&#x27;ve tried many brands and models, from the old Epilady to Phillips to Braun, and every time the product seemed to get better and better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So I though I&#x27;d invest a few more dollars and get the reviewer-acclaimed Emjoi, after I&#x27;d left my four-year-old Braun in some trip. Now I miss it more than ever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I religiously followed their instructions but to no avail. First, the Emjoi&#x27;s poorly design tip makes it hard to do more than half an inch at once - and almost impossible to do some areas on the knees. Second, even when you do get to the hair, it gets broken instead of being pulled out at the root, for which reason in a couple of days you&#x27;re even hairier than before. The Emjoi magically combines the disadvantages of waxing and shaving, being time-consuming (much more than any other epilator I&#x27;ve owned) and highly ineffective as a longish-term hair removal method. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I had to send the thing back. Don&#x27;t get me wrong: epilators are great, and that&#x27;s what most of the other reviewers found out. But amongst them, Emjoi is probably the worst.</li>
            <li> Sounds strange I know, but this has a concave curve to the blades - they curve in.  Well, my underarm curves in too and no matter how hard I try, I cannot flatten the area enough to get the concave blades to grab hair there.  I have the same problem in parts of the bikini area. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Legs - good job for most of the legs.  Except where my hair grows in multiple directions (thighs) and I have to go left to right or right to left instead of up or down the leg.  It does work in this situation, but it takes a lot more effort to flatten out the area so it can grab the hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator thinking I would have beautiful, hairfree underarms, legs and bikini line. No such luck. This product HURTS! And to make matters worse I began getting ingrown hairs. Then the ingrown hairs got infected and now my underarms and bikini line are hairy AND have scars. Don&#x27;t get this product!</li>
            <li> I waited several weeks for my Emjoi.  When I finally received it, I tried it right away.  I used to go every 3-4 weeks for leg waxing which, to me, was painful.  The Emjoi was less painful than the waxing and way more cost effective.  I have only ever used the epilady years ago when it first came out and that was terrible.  I actually dont mind the Emjoi. Some areas are sensitive and a little bothersome, but compared to waxing its a breeze.  I recommend the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> I have tried it all...razors, depilatories, waxes, electric shavers, bladeless razors...you name it, Ive bought it. I have been sooo unhappy with the results of other products. NOTHING was working for me. Shaving made my legs itch like mad and the hair grew back sooo fast. Waxes were messy, painful, and time consuming with mixed results,and depilatories never removed my hair. Needless to say, I have been very frustrated. Suddenly, I am feeling free and light and oh so hair free! I am thrilled that I have found my beloved Emjoi! It took me a few tries to get it right and I stress that it is VERY IMPORTANT TO SHOWER AND EXFOLIATE before you use the Emjoi. It works better if you follow the instructions to the T. My legs are so smooth, I thought that I was hallucinating. The dark little follicle marks you can see after shaving are no longer a part of my life! My skin looks and feels fantastic! There is a little unpleasant sting while using it and it can take a little time to get it done to your satisfaction, but wow! And the results last so long it is shocking!I am really in love with this thing! I wholeheartedly recommend giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I am fair complected with light hair.  I have a LOW tolerence for pain!!  I really like this product(after 5 years of using Nad&#x27;s \\&quot;wax\\&quot;).  The best thing that I have found so far is that I don&#x27;t have to take a bath after each session.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love baths, but it is difficult with 2 small children, to find the time to wax and then to bathe:)  I agree that it does take some creative movement to get all the hair around the knees and ankles, but that is the same with any removal product.  I really like using it on the armpit area, and after the second time the pain is not a factor.  That brings me to the second think that I like about this product... if it hurts, stop for a bit and come back. The bikini area is a bit dicey, and I think it will be easier with hubby&#x27;s help to pull the skin taut.  I would not recommend starting out with long hair, about a day or 2 growth seems to be the best, so for the first use, shave, wait a day or 2 depending on your hair growth, then go for it.  I have found that three days in a row of use gets me smooth for about a two week period, then the little persistant hairs start again.  That is about the time I had with Nad&#x27;s.  The new thing here is that I can do it over and be done without waiting for them to grow for another two weeks to get long enough to wax.  All in all I am impressed and like the product for the value.  I might try a step up next time, or a flat head to see if it makes a difference, but I won&#x27;t go back to waxing or shaving for the long haul.  I am already planning how to introduce epilating to my daughter when she is old enough to do it in the hopes that she will never have to shave because the truth is that my hair is finer and more sparse than before waxing and epilating. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Works great!  Less painful and messy than waxing, and much faster!  Wish I&#x27;d bought one a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I have owned this epilator for only 6 months, and have to say I am very unhappy with it. Since the beginning the rechargeable battery would not hold a charge, which I figured was no big deal since the cord is nice and long. But over the last month I noticed that it is not pulling out the hair anymore. I have never been able to get it to pull all my leg hair without breaking a great deal off in the process, and so had delegated it to getting strays after a leg wax and for my upper leg and bikini. Now however, it pulls on the hairs several times before actually pulling them out taking quite a bit longer to remove the hair than it did before. While I don&#x27;t normally mind the discomfort of epilating, torturing me by yanking on the same hair several times it just WRONG! After researching other epilators I am going to order a Braun and throw this one out.</li>
            <li> I bought an epilator 10 years ago (I think it was a Braun) and it was noisy, took forever and it HURT. I was fed up with all other hair removal methods and decided to give this gadget a try. This is nothing like the epilator from 10 years ago! I am so excited about the results I got from the Emjoi. It hurts much less than waxing and is not messy, it picked up even small hairs and it took maybe five minutes to do my legs. Now I won&#x27;t have to worry about them for a few weeks. You may get little red dots on your skin after epilating, so I would recommend doing it in the evening or on a day when you won&#x27;t show off you gorgeous legs. Also, make sure that you have proper lighting so that you are able to see when all the hair is gone.  If you are concerned about the price of the Emjoi, just think about how much you spend for disposable razors or wax.</li>
            <li> I bought this to remove hair from my face and neck, as I have a lot of blond and dark hair on those areas.  Although it removed most of the hair, I developed red bumps (think: terrible acne or measles!)all over the areas where I used the epilator.  I used it on my legs next, and it worked okay, but it left a lot of hair.  I had to go over areas several times to get all the hair.  Overall, I would not recommend this product- it is too time consuming for the legs, irritates my face, and leaves a lot of hair behind.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before purchasing. I even went so far as to purchase an epilator at a local retailer, only to return it after reading horrible reviews. Got a good deal at Amazon and thought \\&quot;what the heck\\&quot;. Needless to say I bought one and used an epilator for the first time. I have a fuzzy face and neck area. I can not express how pleased I was with the results. My other half even commented that it looked good. Mind you, I expressly warned him never to let me go out in public if he noticed a granny hair on my chin or I would use said epilady on his chest. I am going to state a few facts. 1. Hurts like hell on the upper lip. Be prepared for the sneeze factor. 2. Takes awhile to get used to. You DO have to spend some time adjusting to it. 3. Do not understand why people had a problem with the cord. I did not. Hope this is of help to you.</li>
            <li> I got for my wife, She said its nice and better than waxing. She was using Philips for last 7 years , and compared to that its good or same. Definitly Good deal for this price .I am not giving it all 5 because it makes noise and is having curve that can make her press hard on skin to get better results.</li>
            <li> I have read great reviews of Emjoi epilators. I&#x27;ve been using epilators for 10 years and was searching for a new one as my 6 year old braun silk epil is wearing out. I have read that emjoi is less painful and quicker so I decided to give this model a try.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The curve of this model is very difficult to use since you need to really press the product against your skin and the curvature prevents you from getting close enough. I tried doing one leg for an hour, it was quite painful and hardly picked up any hair at all. I grabbed my 6 year old Braun and it worked so much better with hardly any pain. I cannot wait to get a newer braun model. I can&#x27;t even imagine how well an updated model will work for me considering my old one works so much better than this Gently gold caress.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised at how easy &amp; \\&quot;almost\\&quot; painless this device was.  Honestly, at first, I was having flashbacks of the \\&quot;Epi Lady\\&quot; days, but it really is NOT that bad! (mild tingling effect).  Keep in mind, I have been Waxing for years, so I may be more used to the \\&quot;pull it by the roots\\&quot; feel.  First timers:pop a Tylenol and keep the skin pulled tight.  After a few times, it&#x27;s a breeze! (I&#x27;ve only used on the legs, no pits or bikini yet).  I especially love that there&#x27;s NO mess like with waxing...same diff&#x27;, only quicker &amp; cleaner.  It&#x27;s the best fifty I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical before I bought this epilator -- I had been a shave-every-day kinda gal ever since I was 11 and was hesitant to give that up.  But I was disturbed by how much money I was spending on razor blades and shave gel so when my friend recommended this I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I LOVE IT.  For one thing, it didn&#x27;t hurt NEARLY as bad as the reviews warned -- I have incredibly sensitive skin and thought I would need vitamin E immediately afterwards, but there was no bad aftereffect whatsoever.  There were little red spots immediately following, but they disappeared within the hour.  I did find that you have to do it for a few days in a row just so every hair (even the slow growers) is captured.  I found that I became addicted and was disappointed when I ran out of hairy places on my body LOL.  Needless to say, do NOT hesitate to get this -- it will change your life, save you time, give you freedom, save you money, and improve your appearance tremendously -- just do exfoliate like they say cuz you can get ingrown hairs (they don&#x27;t hurt, you just need to pluck them with tweezers occasionally).  GO FOR IT -- you won&#x27;t regret it!!!</li>
            <li> I was already waxing my legs and arms, because I never had smoothness when shaving.  By the end of the day I would have stubble. If I shaved to often I got bumps.  So, using the Emjoi Epilator was not painful because not my hair is more sparce and thin.  Using the epilator is more convenient and does not leave the messy residue that waxing did.  I do get some ingrown hairs (I get this with waxing).  I can tolerate them because I have finaly have smooth legs.  However, I really got this for my chin.  My few random chin hairs have multiplied over the years.  I found I was tweezing everyday and never able to make the area completely smooth.   Waxing this area did no good at all.  The Emjoi Gently Gold Caress Epilator worked great.  In a couple of minutes all of the hair was gone.  It didnt hurt at all.  I would feel an occational pull or sting but no pain.  I will tell you that I have tried it on my upper lip, but it stings too much.  I will keep waxing that area.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It is saving me so much money and time spent in salons waxing. I admit that the first time I used it the pain was a bit much for the first minute or so but I had read the reviews so I pulled my skin taught and kept going and guess what?! It stopped hurting. It is definitely more sensitive around the ankles and front of the shins but other than that it does not bother me anymore (like plucking your eyebrows- they get numb to it over time). If you get red bumps after, try Benadryl- it&#x27;s a histimine reaction, which I always get from waxing (and from this). I use the ointment. I have also been thinking of trying no scream cream- a topical numbing agent I used when I waxed. It may help.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi Gently Gold Caress Epilator with Cord is awesome!!  I bought the one with the cord because I didn&#x27;t want to have to worry about constatnly changing the batteries, plus the cord is quite long so it&#x27;s convinient to just plug it in and get comfortable.  I have been using my Emjoi for several months now, and have noticed a huge difference in the number of hairs and the hair texture on my legs.  After the first couple of uses, the first thing I noticed was NO  MORE  IRRITATING  STUBBLE!!!!  For that reason alone I was sold!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The more I use it, the more I like it.  It does sting a little when you first start to use it, but as you use it more often, you get used to it and it&#x27;s not bad (killed all your nerves by then).  Like other reviews, I did notice that the Gently Gold Caress Epilator does skip a few hairs, however they&#x27;re so minor, it&#x27;s not really a negative for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For those people who have tried it and it didn&#x27;t work as well, make sure the epilator is going in the correct direction and be sure you use it at a 90 degree angle to your skin.  Because when I first used mine, I was having those problems as well, but once I got the hang of it, it worked wonderfully!  Smooth legs for at least a week (actually longer because there is no stubble!). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product was alright. As for pain, it&#x27;s not that bad. But I have the feeling that it&#x27;s actually ripping more hair than pulling it out. If you do get though, make sure you clean it after each use because it&#x27;ll be a lot easier that way. If you let it build up, that hair isn&#x27;t coming out.</li>
            <li> This works for me to reduce the ouch - I shave in the shower and the next day I use the epilator.  It pulls the longer hairs I missed or that have grown in 24 hr.  Then I use it the next day, it pulls some more, and I repeat a couple more days until smooth.  Then I touch up about once a week.  I love this appliance!!!!</li>
            <li> I first tried this product about 7 years ago after seeing it in an airline magazine (you know, one of those things on every plane in the pocket on the seat in front of your cramped-up legs). I have always had coarse, dark hair on my legs, thanks to my dad&#x27;s genetic contribution to my body, and in summer had to shave nearly every day--literally a pain, as I&#x27;m of little use with a razor. I ordered my first, wore it out after 4 years, am now wearing out a second! and will certainly buy another one. What I am finding wears out is the power adaptor. It is a good idea to follow the recommendations that come with the product about exfoliation and how to hold the skin, etc. (I find a fine-grade foot file works better than a loofah for exfoliation, by the way). The Emjoi also works best if you keep it very clean--don&#x27;t let hairs build up in it. Use the brush or a small pipe-cleaner each time.</li>
            <li> This product performs exactly as it is expected. Yes, the first time you use it, you may feel some discomfort, but walk it off!!!  In the end, you will be glad you did!!!  When used regularly, there is minimal discomfort for maximum results.  I use regularly on my bikini line and on my underarms and can report that the results are smooth and fabulous!  I think it works well on legs also, but I am too impatient to use regularly here.  In my opinion, this is a godsend for bikini line and underarms!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s painful. All epilators are painful, but this one is cute and gets the job done well! I&#x27;m not sure what the purpose of having two speeds is, but I have nothing but praise to offer. It&#x27;s been working great for three years and counting.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this brand for over a decade and it&#x27;s reliability is superb. Much better than others I have used.</li>
            <li> I have used Emjoi products for a few years now. I&#x27;m very happy with this one. My only criticism is their claim that hair does not grow back for 6 weeks. I find I need to do a &#x27;touch up&#x27; every week or so. The hair grows back at different times, so it&#x27;s a constant process to keep it all gone!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use to remove excess facial hair.  It doesn&#x27;t work very well, and on top of that, it hurts like hell to use it.  I only used it once, and probably will NOT use it again, even on a less sensitive area.</li>
            <li> In comparison to waxing: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros:  &lt;br /&gt;1. Takes out the smallest hairs &lt;br /&gt;2. Great for traveling &lt;br /&gt;3. No mess (besides for the hairs your&#x27;re pulling out) &lt;br /&gt;4. MUCH cheaper! &lt;br /&gt;5. Remove hair on your own time &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;1. Many more ingrowns then waxing or shaving  &lt;br /&gt;2. 70% the hairs are cut instead of pulled out by the root &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased this epilator back in July and I&#x27;ve been using it every since. Now as someone who&#x27;s went from shaving to waxing, using this epilator gets you almost the same results as waxing and lasts just as long. If you can stand the pain of waxing then you can stand the pain of using an epilator (if you shave be prepared, it will hurt!). The reason I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because my problem is I CAN&#x27;T STAND the ingrowns and it makes a difference in over all appearances. Legs look much cleaner and feel softer without them. Although they say if you scrub with a loofa it helps, I don&#x27;t really feel that it helps all that much. I don&#x27;t regret purchasing this product but I prefer to keep waxing and keep this on the side for those days when I&#x27;m away from home, for general touch ups (especially those summer days), laziness to wax myself or to save some $$ on getting waxed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall: It&#x27;s not my no.1 choice for hair removal but AWESOME to have on the side! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Will have pain and redness for a short time, but everything is fine after a night.</li>
            <li> I bought it in 2001 and it is still working, and I love it! I took it abroad with me, it worked perfectly with adapters too.</li>
