            <li>Good?</li>
            <li>great buy, excellent service, fast shipping, came in 3 days even with the super saver shipping, no damage, smells great!</li>
            <li>It is one of three of my very favorite scents.</li>
            <li>A lovely frosted glass bottle containing a delightful, light floral scent.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I have to say, I love this perfume!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bvlgari are famous for some of the most beautiful perfumes and</li>
            <li>Inside the outer packaging, the perfume was in its own orignal box which was wrapped in cellephane.  </li>
            <li>She liked it.</li>
            <li>This smells so good, I can&#x27;t understand why you can not find it in stores any more.  </li>
            <li>Many people ask what are you wearing you smell so good?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it a 3-star review, does that sound fair?</li>
            <li>I love jasmine, which is the predominant element in this perfume.</li>
            <li>This scent gets better as the day goes on.</li>
            <li>So glad to find this on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>It is more like a splash than a perfume.</li>
            <li>Ok then.</li>
            <li>Sure, \\&quot;Eau de toilette\\&quot; is the weaker sister among the fragrance forms.  </li>
            <li>I could not say more about this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is an every day scent you can wear and feel fresh and lovely!</li>
            <li>I liked the smell very much and that&#x27;s why I bought it.</li>
            <li>The bottle came with its top on just as pictured here on Amazon; it&#x27;s exactly what one would get in the department store.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Bvlgari Jasmin for years, and now it has discontinued because the company launched Bvlgari Jasmin Noir that I don&#x27;t like, hence my attempt to purchase the original Jasmin from the Internet rather than stores and Bvlgari, itself.</li>
            <li>By far, my favorite perfume ever!  </li>
            <li>This one is light, pretty, feminine, not too flowery or strong in scent.  </li>
            <li>I like all of the Bvlgari fragrances, but this one is really special to me.</li>
            <li>So I thought I would stock up on it, so I can give it to her for special occasions when it&#x27;s not around anymore.</li>
            <li>The bottle came full, and was exacltly how I remembered.  </li>
            <li>I feel very pretty when wearing Voile De Jasmin By Bvlari.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute must if you like lightly scented fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Ever since I stayed at a hotel that had Bvlgari products in their bathrooms for their guests to use, I liked the scent of the different items and was determined to find where I could purchase some of them for my use at home.  </li>
            <li>My 34 year old daughter loves it as well, it is her favorite.</li>
            <li>this particular one is so light and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me it was not a new perfume, so I knew I was going to love it!</li>
            <li>and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>When the item arrived at my home, it was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I love this light, delicate scent from Bvlgari.</li>
            <li>The perfume arrived very well packaged.  </li>
            <li>but it was the real deal -</li>
            <li>I DIDNT LIKE THE SMELL THAT MUCH</li>
            <li>To me it seems very deceitful not to list this in the description.  </li>
            <li>I tried it several times since it arrived yesterday, and it smells nothing like the original one.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell of this perfume but it won&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li>So pretty, so soft, so feminine.  </li>
            <li>If you like strong, long lasting scents, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>Of course, when it arrived it clearly say that it is a tester and not for sale.  </li>
            <li>I would probably order it again, but they need to clearly write that it is a tester so the customer can make an informed decision as to whether they want to buy or pass it up.</li>
            <li>quality and price was great, much less expensive than the stores and the service from the seller was first class too.</li>
            <li>the scent starts fading after one hour and completely gone in the second.</li>
            <li>, IT WAS OK BUT NOT GREAT FOR MY TASTE.</li>
            <li>I would say it may not last as long as other perfumes do, but I can smell it lightly all day and my husband can smell it hours later when he hugs me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for fragrances that are heavy, too sweet smelling, or linger too long.  </li>

            <li> I still have a little bit of my previous Bvlgari Jasmin perfume left, so I compared the scent and sprayed each on one wrist; the one I just purchased from Amazon smells like alcohol where my old one, though it has a few drops left, smells like how it supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> However, the scentbecomes faint within three to four hours.</li>
            <li> This is a flowery scent, very subtle, for women who hate leaving the elevator smelling of themselves, and prefer to be discreet.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed when Ulta stopped carrying it.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it was supposed to be like, I was looking for jasmin scent. Well - it is not. Someone wrote that it does not last long - not true. I tasted it on my sweater, did not like it, and had to throw the sweater into laundry because I still could smell it several hours later.</li>
            <li> I ordered this online for a small fraction of department store costs.  The perfume arrived very well packaged.  Inside the outer packaging, the perfume was in its own orignal box which was wrapped in cellephane.  The bottle came with its top on just as pictured here on Amazon; it&#x27;s exactly what one would get in the department store.  This is a fragrance I&#x27;ve worn for several years and I like it very much. I was sorry to see that it has become difficult to find now.  I don&#x27;t care for fragrances that are heavy, too sweet smelling, or linger too long.  This one is light, pretty, feminine, not too flowery or strong in scent.  I would say it may not last as long as other perfumes do, but I can smell it lightly all day and my husband can smell it hours later when he hugs me.</li>
            <li> Ever since I stayed at a hotel that had Bvlgari products in their bathrooms for their guests to use, I liked the scent of the different items and was determined to find where I could purchase some of them for my use at home.  Before the holiday, I received an email from Amazon.com advertising products to be bought on line as gifts, etc.  I searched and found the Voile De Jasmin Eau De Toilette Spray by Bvlgari which I purchased.  When the item arrived at my home, it was exactly what I was looking for.  Also, I received the item in a short amount of time which also is a plus especially if one is buying to give as a gift for the holiday.  Thank you Amazon.com for the advertisement you sent me.</li>
            <li> This is a flowery scent, very subtle, for women who hate leaving the elevator smelling of themselves, and prefer to be discreet.  I love jasmine, which is the predominant element in this perfume. If you like strong, long lasting scents, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I was worried it would be fake but it was the real deal - if it is not, I would not know the difference.  That perfect scent that I can wear day or night.  I hope BVLGARI brings it back.    Spoke too soon...I may have to take back two stars...the scent starts fading after one hour and completely gone in the second.</li>
            <li> This scent gets better as the day goes on. I like all of the Bvlgari fragrances, but this one is really special to me. One of my favorites. Can&#x27;t beat the price - I will ALWAYS shop at amazon.com for my fragrances !!!!!</li>
            <li> I DIDNT LIKE THE SMELL THAT MUCH, IT WAS OK BUT NOT GREAT FOR MY TASTE.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell very much and that&#x27;s why I bought it. But the scent goes away within less than an hour. Not worth the price...</li>
            <li> I love this light, delicate scent from Bvlgari. It is an every day scent you can wear and feel fresh and lovely!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is inviting. However, the scentbecomes faint within three to four hours. Not worth the price...</li>
            <li> great buy, excellent service, fast shipping, came in 3 days even with the super saver shipping, no damage, smells great!</li>
            <li> This is an absolute must if you like lightly scented fragrance.  Bvlgari gets a \\&quot;10\\&quot; for this incredible contribution to the wonderful world of perfumes and colognes.  I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for years.  Actually believe this is my signature scent. LOVE IT! So glad to find this on Amazon.com.  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I wish Bvlgari continued to make Voile de Jasmin. When I wear perfume, jasmine is my scent of choice. I can&#x27;t seem to find a fragrance that matches this once with a nice jasmine base scent.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell of this perfume but it won&#x27;t last too long. After about an hour, the smell is gone. It is more like a splash than a perfume.</li>
            <li> This is my very first TERRIBLE experience purchasing from Amazon; I have shopped here for numerous years and had never had this issue.&lt;br /&gt;This is a Bvlgari Jasmin perfume; it smells like industrial alcohol. I tried it several times since it arrived yesterday, and it smells nothing like the original one. I have used the Bvlgari Jasmin for years, and now it has discontinued because the company launched Bvlgari Jasmin Noir that I don&#x27;t like, hence my attempt to purchase the original Jasmin from the Internet rather than stores and Bvlgari, itself. I still have a little bit of my previous Bvlgari Jasmin perfume left, so I compared the scent and sprayed each on one wrist; the one I just purchased from Amazon smells like alcohol where my old one, though it has a few drops left, smells like how it supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;D.D.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I love this perfume!  The bottle came full, and was exacltly how I remembered.  My only issue is that I did not want to order a \\&quot;tester\\&quot; bottle and as the description did not say that it was, I went ahead and ordered.  Of course, when it arrived it clearly say that it is a tester and not for sale.  To me it seems very deceitful not to list this in the description.  I would probably order it again, but they need to clearly write that it is a tester so the customer can make an informed decision as to whether they want to buy or pass it up.</li>
            <li> She liked it. Whatever. I don&#x27;t go out with her anymore so there&#x27;s not much to be said. I&#x27;ll give it a 3-star review, does that sound fair? Good? Ok then.</li>
            <li> A lovely frosted glass bottle containing a delightful, light floral scent.  So pretty, so soft, so feminine.  But it has no staying power whatsoever.  Sure, \\&quot;Eau de toilette\\&quot; is the weaker sister among the fragrance forms.  But this one is flat zippo. Gone in 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> For me it was not a new perfume, so I knew I was going to love it! The fragrance is very delicate but persistent.</li>
            <li> It has been used by my friends before, and they keep on buying the Voile de Jasmine. Long lasting scent. Real nice.</li>
            <li> By far, my favorite perfume ever!  I was disappointed when Ulta stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> I could not say more about this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bvlgari are famous for some of the most beautiful perfumes and this particular one is so light and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality and price was great, much less expensive than the stores and the service from the seller was first class too.</li>
            <li> This smells so good, I can&#x27;t understand why you can not find it in stores any more.  I feel very pretty when wearing Voile De Jasmin By Bvlari. It is one of three of my very favorite scents. Many people ask what are you wearing you smell so good?  My 34 year old daughter loves it as well, it is her favorite. We both have worn this sent since 2006 So I thought I would stock up on it, so I can give it to her for special occasions when it&#x27;s not around anymore. Thank You Amazon!</li>
            <li> Received in perfect condition....excellent produce</li>
