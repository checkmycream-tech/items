            <li>;D.I use every sing one my favorite is the soft top one :D and the Fan SOOOO SOFT SOFTTTTTTTTTT :3 would recommend this to Everyone</li>
            <li>nice brushes for the price deffanetly worth it.</li>
            <li>I was most excited for the stippling brush and it exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>You will love the fan brush, its great to apply highlight on  upper part of your cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The case the brushes com in is also well made and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have just received my \\&quot;cheeky\\&quot; brushes today and they seem to be really good quality so far!</li>
            <li>It was easy for me to clean them but on one or two brushes  the hair would fall out.</li>
            <li>Not only are these brushes great quality</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft,don&#x27;t shed and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Good price and soft brush..  </li>
            <li>However, I searched forever to find the best brush set I could possibly find at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My friend is also a makeup artist and he uses these all the time on clients and they continue to to stay in original form.</li>
            <li>I am really excited to try all of these out</li>
            <li>Also the shipping was super quick!</li>
            <li>The flat bronzer I love, love, love.</li>
            <li>The handles are nice and sturdy and seem to be able to last for a while.</li>
            <li>but Finally I got good one.  </li>
            <li>Bought for my discerning teenage daughter who seems delighted with the quality.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I can say enough good things about these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers have mentioned, it would be great if a leaflet saying what each brush is for was included.</li>
            <li>If you go to the Coastal Scents website, they tell you what the brushes are good for, but I feel like it wouldn&#x27;t be hard for them to engrave the kind of brush on the side.</li>
            <li>I feel like the quality of this brush set is adequate for the money.</li>
            <li>but It went away quickly.</li>
            <li>but she thinks this brush set is very good value and loves the fact that they can all be stored neatly in the roll up pouch provided rather than losing them all over the house, which is what usually happens at my place.</li>
            <li>it was more of just a new plastic smell.</li>
            <li>Like many, I was pretty skeptical from buying these from a company I had never heard of; however, this is the best make up brush purchase I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li>its worth..</li>
            <li>brush set is worth of this price.</li>
            <li>agree a pamphlet would be useful to know which brushes can be used for what,</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t used most of them.</li>
            <li>other than that I love them!</li>
            <li>There are a lot of YouTube videos that show proper brush cleaning and storage you should watch to get the most out of your purchase.</li>
            <li>;D Thank you for the brushes Cheeky.</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE make-up enthusiast and after reading that several professional make-up artists LOVE these, I couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li>Let me just say that I have gotten so much use from these, and I feel like there is a brush for EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li>but I feel like most of them are pretty obvious if you&#x27;ve ever used brushes before.</li>
            <li>They have very soft and full they pick up the color as needed.</li>
            <li>but it was black and appeared to be some kind of angled thing.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li>My first impression of this set was better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Good brush set - a few hairs have come out of the brushes but I expect that to settle down once they&#x27;ve been used a bit more.</li>
            <li>None of them arrived brokes, loose, etc., and even months later, they&#x27;re still holding up good as new.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very flimsy brushes.  </li>
            <li>case is very</li>
            <li>nice.&lt;br /&gt;-The angled eyeliner brushes are very sleek and work beautifully.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Not too much shedding after washing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>High quality for the price!</li>
            <li>It buffs out my foundation very well.</li>
            <li>They both have the same amount of brushes and the same kind of brushes included in the set.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-There are more good brushes in the set than bad.</li>
            <li>She is particular about cleaning and storing.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and apply the make up very well I did notice some shedding on a couple brushes but nothing to drastic.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>and some of these brushes are AMAZINGLY soft!!</li>
            <li>You definitely get your moneys worth with these babies.</li>
            <li>In reality, it was just the case, and after a few days, the smell dissolved.&lt;br /&gt;The quality and ability of these brushes is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Case has that new case smell but went away in a day.</li>
            <li>After one year they still look like new.</li>
            <li>Stipling brush is VERY soft.</li>
            <li>It is very soft on my face; use it for applying foundation.</li>
            <li>Exactly like the coastal scents set, only cheaper.</li>
            <li>This brush set seemed to be the exact same set as the coastal scents brush set.</li>
            <li>The plastic smell that people are talking about is really not noticeable at all and quickly goes away.</li>
            <li>These are fine, but I have a few comments:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br</li>
            <li>The flat top face brush didn&#x27;t last a long time, after a year the handle fell off</li>
            <li>No shedding so far.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and dense.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re High quality brushes for a low price.</li>
            <li>Shedding to the bare minimum I haven&#x27;t use all the brushes yet</li>
            <li>/&gt;-A few brushes were pretty crappy, so they got tossed immediately.&lt;br /&gt;-For</li>
            <li>There was only little to no shedding when I first washed these brushes out, and have not had any concern after that.</li>

            <li> There was only little to no shedding when I first washed these brushes out, and have not had any concern after that.</li>
            <li> Brushes came in on time they didn&#x27;t smell funny nor will any of the bristles hard.</li>
            <li> This was bought on the testimony of my other teenage daughter who bought one last year.</li>
            <li> it has been long time ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional</li>
            <li> The shipping came a day earlier that expected so that was a plus.</li>
            <li> My less expensive brushes are much better.</li>
            <li> brush,(the one with black, rounded, stubby bristles, the one I was really looking forward to having) seemed to be missing most of its bristles and would have been painful to use, given the amount of metal I could feel scraping my hand upon inspection.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The only down fall is</li>
            <li> Two teenagers can&#x27;t be wrong - right?</li>
            <li> At first, I was somewhat skeptical to buy these brushes because I have never heard of the brand \\&quot;cheeky\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I washed them a soon as they arrived, and to my surprise, there was very minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> sponge tip smudger was so very hard and crusty feeling, I would never want it anywhere near my eyes for fear of permanent damage.</li>
            <li> They washed well as instructed to do so before use but the dome eyeshadow brush with black bristles was leaking out black dye as I washed it;</li>
            <li> They had a slight plasticy smell to them, but it wasn&#x27;t like a fowl smell</li>
            <li> I have washed them like instructed and there was a little shedding, but nothing too drastic.</li>
            <li> The person I got this for uses them everyday without any problems what so ever.</li>
            <li> the brushes are not named, not a huge problem</li>
            <li> example, one looked like it had been cut up by a small child.</li>
            <li> but these brushes have exceeded my expectations at an unbelievable price for the quality, variety, and quantity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased some in the past, yet continue to use these exclusively.</li>
            <li> very soft except one it sheds really bad</li>
            <li> horrible cheaply made</li>
            <li> Same brush is now shedding like crazy on 1st use so that went in the trash.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I wasted my rewards points on them.</li>
            <li> Not good quality</li>
            <li> The bad ones were SO bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly very shocked.</li>

            <li> Great quality brushes! Especially for the cost. I&#x27;m a proffesional makeup artist so I needed something durable and of great quality. You definitely get your moneys worth with these babies. I would definitely recommend buying the Cheeky 22 pc brush set. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! I was looking for a good set that had the eyeshadow brushes and stipling brush I wanted. Stipling brush is VERY soft. No shedding so far. Case has that new case smell but went away in a day. Love these brushes and will be ordering more from them when the time comes!</li>
            <li> I was looking good brushes for makeup..  it has been long time ago but Finally I got good one.  I love this brushes.  Good price and soft brush..  its worth..</li>
            <li> Bought for my discerning teenage daughter who seems delighted with the quality. I&#x27;m no expert in these things but she thinks this brush set is very good value and loves the fact that they can all be stored neatly in the roll up pouch provided rather than losing them all over the house, which is what usually happens at my place. This was bought on the testimony of my other teenage daughter who bought one last year. Two teenagers can&#x27;t be wrong - right?</li>
            <li> Very flimsy brushes.  Disappointed.  My less expensive brushes are much better. Sorry I wasted my rewards points on them. Not good quality</li>
            <li> Brushes came in on time they didn&#x27;t smell funny nor will any of the bristles hard. They have very soft and full they pick up the color as needed. Shedding to the bare minimum I haven&#x27;t use all the brushes yet but they all seem amazing I love them and I&#x27;ll probably order another set if they come in a different color.</li>
            <li> I feel like the quality of this brush set is adequate for the money. I&#x27;m not a professional and I don&#x27;t have a lot to spend on brushes, so I wanted to get a variety of good brushes for a value. These are fine, but I have a few comments:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The case is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;-The angled eyeliner brushes are very sleek and work beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;-Not too much shedding after washing.&lt;br /&gt;-There are more good brushes in the set than bad. They hold and distribute makeup well and blend well, too. The bad ones were SO bad. (See below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I would love if the brushes had their purposes written on them, so I would know when to use which brush.&lt;br /&gt;-A few brushes were pretty crappy, so they got tossed immediately.&lt;br /&gt;-For example, one looked like it had been cut up by a small child. Couldn&#x27;t tell what it was for but it was black and appeared to be some kind of angled thing.&lt;br /&gt;-The smudge brush,(the one with black, rounded, stubby bristles, the one I was really looking forward to having) seemed to be missing most of its bristles and would have been painful to use, given the amount of metal I could feel scraping my hand upon inspection.&lt;br /&gt;The sponge tip smudger was so very hard and crusty feeling, I would never want it anywhere near my eyes for fear of permanent damage.</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous buying these brushes because of some of the reviews and I have never heard of the brand Cheeky. They arrived when they were supposed to. When I opened the package it did have a smell but It went away quickly. There was some fall out from the brushes but I washed them before use and it got most of them out. Over all I am very pleased with my purchase and I will recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I love the product! The only down fall is the brushes are not named, not a huge problem but since I am not the savviest when it comes to brushes it would have been a plus. The brushes are very soft and apply the make up very well I did notice some shedding on a couple brushes but nothing to drastic. other than that I love them!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t for me but once she showed it to a couple of her friends they both bought one. From what I understand it is a very good quality brush set for the price. The person I got this for uses them everyday without any problems what so ever. She is particular about cleaning and storing. There are a lot of YouTube videos that show proper brush cleaning and storage you should watch to get the most out of your purchase.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the coastal scents set, only cheaper. High quality for the price!</li>
            <li> horrible cheaply made</li>
            <li> High quality. Sturdy handles and brushes. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase. I would definitely suggest this seller and product to others.</li>
            <li> some brushes were good quality some not...</li>
            <li> Very nice to deal with will deff deal with again. Received item quicker than I had thought I would have.</li>
            <li> I love them :3 very soft except one it sheds really bad but I don&#x27;t use it anyhow but not because it sheds but because it dose not blend well,I give it a 5 star because it got here extremely fast very happy about that ;D.I use every sing one my favorite is the soft top one :D and the Fan SOOOO SOFT SOFTTTTTTTTTT :3 would recommend this to Everyone ;D Thank you for the brushes Cheeky.</li>
            <li> I like this brushes because they look and feel nice. After one year they still look like new. It was easy for me to clean them but on one or two brushes  the hair would fall out. The flat top face brush didn&#x27;t last a long time, after a year the handle fell off so I had to use supper clue. It came with a case, but I never used it. You will love the fan brush, its great to apply highlight on  upper part of your cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush set is worth of this price.</li>
            <li> Good brush set - a few hairs have come out of the brushes but I expect that to settle down once they&#x27;ve been used a bit more. Like other reviewers have mentioned, it would be great if a leaflet saying what each brush is for was included. All in all happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE make-up enthusiast and after reading that several professional make-up artists LOVE these, I couldn&#x27;t resist. Let me just say that I have gotten so much use from these, and I feel like there is a brush for EVERYTHING! I haven&#x27;t had any hair fall out and some of these brushes are AMAZINGLY soft!! I don&#x27;t think I can say enough good things about these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree a pamphlet would be useful to know which brushes can be used for what, but I feel like most of them are pretty obvious if you&#x27;ve ever used brushes before. If you go to the Coastal Scents website, they tell you what the brushes are good for, but I feel like it wouldn&#x27;t be hard for them to engrave the kind of brush on the side.</li>
            <li> My products came in a timely manner and everything was wrapped and put together nicely. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the brushes at all. I would recommend these to everyone.</li>
            <li> At first, I was somewhat skeptical to buy these brushes because I have never heard of the brand \\&quot;cheeky\\&quot;. However, I searched forever to find the best brush set I could possibly find at a reasonable price. This brush set seemed to be the exact same set as the coastal scents brush set. They both have the same amount of brushes and the same kind of brushes included in the set. My first impression of this set was better than I expected. When I opened up the nicely packaged item, I felt the brushes and immediately knew they were great quality. They are so soft and dense. Not only are these brushes great quality but they have a great variety in this set. I was most excited for the stippling brush and it exceeded my expectations. It buffs out my foundation very well. These brushes are great for blending. The big blush brush gives almost an air brushed effect when I blended out my bronzer. There was only little to no shedding when I first washed these brushes out, and have not had any concern after that. The handles are nice and sturdy and seem to be able to last for a while. There may be better brushes out there but these brushes have exceeded my expectations at an unbelievable price for the quality, variety, and quantity. I would defiantly recommend this set to anyone.</li>
            <li> Like many, I was pretty skeptical from buying these from a company I had never heard of; however, this is the best make up brush purchase I&#x27;ve made. I washed them a soon as they arrived, and to my surprise, there was very minimal shedding. They had a plastic, almost musty smell, and I thought it was the brushes. In reality, it was just the case, and after a few days, the smell dissolved.&lt;br /&gt;The quality and ability of these brushes is phenomenal. I&#x27;m honestly very shocked. None of them arrived brokes, loose, etc., and even months later, they&#x27;re still holding up good as new.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about these is that they don&#x27;t have the name or type of brush written on the handles. The only decals on them is the word \\&quot;CHEEKY\\&quot; for the company. Otherwise, I recommend these one hundred percent.&lt;br /&gt;-Mr. Hart&#x27;s daughter</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t used most of them. They washed well as instructed to do so before use but the dome eyeshadow brush with black bristles was leaking out black dye as I washed it; had to wash it thoroughly. Same brush is now shedding like crazy on 1st use so that went in the trash.  The flat bronzer I love, love, love. It is very soft on my face; use it for applying foundation. BTW, this set is THE SAME as Coastal Scents brand. I am not lying! Check it out!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite makeup brush set.  I&#x27;ve purchased some in the past, yet continue to use these exclusively.</li>
            <li> These are honestly the best makeup brushes iv&#x27;e had in a long time and i do makeup for a living. They&#x27;re High quality brushes for a low price. They&#x27;re soft,don&#x27;t shed and are easy to clean. The shipping came a day earlier that expected so that was a plus. My friend is also a makeup artist and he uses these all the time on clients and they continue to to stay in original form. The plastic smell that people are talking about is really not noticeable at all and quickly goes away. The case the brushes com in is also well made and easy to use. I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> I have just received my \\&quot;cheeky\\&quot; brushes today and they seem to be really good quality so far! I have washed them like instructed and there was a little shedding, but nothing too drastic. They had a slight plasticy smell to them, but it wasn&#x27;t like a fowl smell it was more of just a new plastic smell. I am really excited to try all of these out and I would recommend these for sure! Also the shipping was super quick! I ordered these on a Friday and they were in my mailbox on Monday, so thumbs up on that! :)</li>
            <li> nice brushes for the price deffanetly worth it. I have washed them a handfull of time no problem with any bristles falling out</li>
