            <li>It&#x27;s better than nothing</li>
            <li>I automatically fell in love.</li>
            <li>This is the shade I always use, I love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite foundation.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation, however this bottle was defective.</li>
            <li>I got it at Sephora for a better price than what is being offered here.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the coverage</li>
            <li>and I love the color.</li>
            <li>Good coverage, however it looks very cakey.</li>
            <li>This foundation is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Smooth, matte finish covers all flaws in one dab.</li>
            <li>It has a light hazelnut smell to it.</li>
            <li>My color is light 48</li>
            <li>Sometimes I will use 1.5-2 pumps if I&#x27;m really getting &amp;#34;made-up&amp;#34;, but for &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; one pump is PERFECT and it ends up going quite a long way!  </li>
            <li>but, this is the only one I have found to truly live up to it, so happy!</li>
            <li>Like this product, the powder is available for much cheaper at Sephora where I now get most of my products.</li>
            <li>It is a full coverage foundation .</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF IS FULL COVERAGE, a lot of products claim to be full coverage</li>
            <li>Super coverage.</li>
            <li>Also this is the first makeup that is actually light is color and not orange.</li>
            <li>I expected this to be good and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I got this product at Sephora for a great deal less than the price shown here.</li>
            <li>- they usually have good pricing :)</li>
            <li>By far, my favorite foundation of all time.</li>
            <li>This foundation is incredibly pigmented and rather heavy, so I would advise users to apply it lightly at first before gently building it up until you reach your desired coverage.</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t use too much your makeup should look flawless and last almost all day.</li>
            <li>its simply amazing and keeps you matte all day long!</li>
            <li>Very fast shipment for item</li>
            <li>it last a long time, as you dont need much for a good full coverage!</li>
            <li>FAST shipping, very fast, and product exactly as described!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t already have a favorite powder I also definitely recommend using the Kat Von D Lock-It Tattoo powder.</li>
            <li>so I constantly felt like I had to check it over and over again to make sure it didn&#x27;t rub off</li>
            <li>I use Benefit POREfessional primer first then using a Beauty Blender sponge &#x27;pounce&#x27; this over my face a section at a time until I have the coverage desired.  </li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by a few people at Sephora and I love it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-this is HUGE and the reason for my low rating..</li>
            <li>I have VERY oily skin, so oily it&#x27;s to the point</li>
            <li>Covers really well</li>
            <li>other then that fantastic coverage and this one bottle will most likely last me a while because you literally need only a drop or two for full coverage!</li>
            <li>and it has never let me down and continues to work its magic today.</li>
            <li>but I suggest you get it at Sephora and save over $20 to spend on something else, like a new lipstick!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>It is high coverage for spots, blemishes, etc., and it leaves a matte surface.</li>
            <li>I also have suffered from severe acne for years, and this not only covered my acne and acne scars beautifully, I honestly do believe it has calmed my acne down a TON.</li>
            <li>But, if you have large pores and red splotches on your face, this foundation really does the job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several colors and can&#x27;t find one that is light enough or doesn&#x27;t look orange!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-easily accessible- can be purchased from a variety of sources, unlike some other products.&lt;br /&gt;-does</li>
            <li>High coverage foundation, found its best to apply with a wet sponge so it doesn&#x27;t look so thick throughout the day, won&#x27;t be buying any other brand any time soon!</li>
            <li>I have a large ankle tattoo and this works well enough to go to work without nylons.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t get it here, clearly.  </li>
            <li>A complete waist of money so thank you for that.</li>
            <li>I used a large fluffy brush to apply the first time and it was very thick and cakey, I now use a smaller concealer brush with light, short and circular strokes and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve only had to purchase this twice in the past 6-9 mos! :)  </li>
            <li>I am sure a second layer would completely cover my dark spots, but, I am too lazy to apply twice .</li>
            <li>Did not dry 100% ever</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker and heavier because its full coverage, so a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I bought this for this first time a little over a year ago at Sephora in Times Square.</li>
            <li>It has a very pretty matte finish, and I do NOT go out in public without at least foundation and powder on and just one bottle of this lasts me 6 months.</li>
            <li>It does not settle into fine lines/wrinkles, and only needs one thin layer</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was looking on here to see if I could find it cheaper, but apparently not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it was an old bottle or something because it smelled horrible and the texture was waxy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really, that&#x27;s the only con but holy cow</li>
            <li> /&gt;-lasts forever as only a few drops are needed.&lt;br /&gt;-lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it lasts me for months!</li>
            <li> This was the lightest color and it was still WAY too dark</li>
            <li> a foundation that makes the dark marks on my face less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy but nothing too extreme.</li>
            <li> probably half a pump.</li>
            <li> seriously lasts all day, and i will never use a different foundation!</li>
            <li> but just go to sephora and get it for less $38</li>
            <li> I have freckles and green eyes and reddish blonde/brown hair ;</li>
            <li> It takes VERY little to cover my face.</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic, but the price is horrible.</li>
            <li> Duh....</li>
            <li> but with it being so thick it does have a tendency to clog pores</li>
            <li> I mean everything.</li>
            <li> I get my tattoo covered but have a big freaky looking patch of orange crap on my leg!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase at all..</li>
            <li> It is expensive but I always find a way to pay for this one thing.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product, but do see some benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Color description way off better to either request sample or go get shade matched</li>
            <li> FINALLY..... a foundation that makes the dark marks on my face less noticeable. It takes VERY little to cover my face. probably half a pump. I am sure a second layer would completely cover my dark spots, but, I am too lazy to apply twice . I WILL be purchasing again. Also this is the first makeup that is actually light is color and not orange.</li>
            <li> I got this product at Sephora for a great deal less than the price shown here. This foundation is incredibly pigmented and rather heavy, so I would advise users to apply it lightly at first before gently building it up until you reach your desired coverage. I used a large fluffy brush to apply the first time and it was very thick and cakey, I now use a smaller concealer brush with light, short and circular strokes and it looks fantastic. If you don&#x27;t already have a favorite powder I also definitely recommend using the Kat Von D Lock-It Tattoo powder. This is a foundation that must have some sort of powder to set it. Like this product, the powder is available for much cheaper at Sephora where I now get most of my products. But, if you have large pores and red splotches on your face, this foundation really does the job.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have gotten one shade darker but other then that fantastic coverage and this one bottle will most likely last me a while because you literally need only a drop or two for full coverage! Matte finish, I spray with Urban Decay&#x27;s setting spray and it looks great!</li>
            <li> seriously lasts all day, and i will never use a different foundation! it last a long time, as you dont need much for a good full coverage! its simply amazing and keeps you matte all day long!</li>
            <li> This foundation is fantastic. I have been using it since 2012 and it has never let me down and continues to work its magic today. This foundation gives a nice smooth mattifying canves to help you to create a flawless face. It does not settle into fine lines/wrinkles, and only needs one thin layer and it covers up everything, and I mean everything. It is a full coverage foundation . Also, all you need is one pump and that&#x27;s it. It will cover your entire face, and will cover anything from acne, to age/sun spots and will even out your skin tone. I am so impressed with this foundation and it will always be one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product, but do see some benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-easily accessible- can be purchased from a variety of sources, unlike some other products.&lt;br /&gt;-does cover up tattoos fairly well. I have a large ankle tattoo and this works well enough to go to work without nylons.&lt;br /&gt;-lasts forever as only a few drops are needed.&lt;br /&gt;-lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-this is HUGE and the reason for my low rating.. It looks orange!! I&#x27;ve tried several colors and can&#x27;t find one that is light enough or doesn&#x27;t look orange! I get my tattoo covered but have a big freaky looking patch of orange crap on my leg!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, that&#x27;s the only con but holy cow it&#x27;s a big one! It&#x27;s better than nothing and I have used it, but have given up on it and am now looking for another brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would call it &amp;#34;better than nothing&amp;#34; and probably works for bright orange skin tones</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS FULL COVERAGE, a lot of products claim to be full coverage but, this is the only one I have found to truly live up to it, so happy!</li>
            <li> I bought this for this first time a little over a year ago at Sephora in Times Square. I automatically fell in love. I have VERY oily skin, so oily it&#x27;s to the point my makeup literally just slides off my face within four hours. This doesn&#x27;t last the fully claimed 24 hours, but I would say it lasts around 16. I also have suffered from severe acne for years, and this not only covered my acne and acne scars beautifully, I honestly do believe it has calmed my acne down a TON. It has a very pretty matte finish, and I do NOT go out in public without at least foundation and powder on and just one bottle of this lasts me 6 months. I will never even consider switching foundations ever again.</li>
            <li> The ideal cover up foundation! Smooth, matte finish covers all flaws in one dab. Great performance makeup as well. I expected this to be good and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Good foundation but just go to sephora and get it for less $38</li>
            <li> This is the shade I always use, I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite foundation. It has a light hazelnut smell to it. It provides 24 hour coverage. I would recommend using only one coat of this for your face. Washes off with soap and water though. It is expensive but I always find a way to pay for this one thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase at all.. I should have driven 30 minutes to sephora to buy it instead of ordering it. I love this foundation, however this bottle was defective. I&#x27;m pretty sure it was an old bottle or something because it smelled horrible and the texture was waxy. A complete waist of money so thank you for that.</li>
            <li> GO TO SEPHORA.COM this product is only like $34 there. This foundation is amazing and my favorite and I would give it 5 stars but I just don&#x27;t want people to get ripped off by buying it on here.</li>
            <li> Good coverage, however it looks very cakey.</li>
            <li> Did not dry 100% ever so I constantly felt like I had to check it over and over again to make sure it didn&#x27;t rub off</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic, but the price is horrible. I was looking on here to see if I could find it cheaper, but apparently not. I got it at Sephora for a better price than what is being offered here.</li>
            <li> High coverage foundation, found its best to apply with a wet sponge so it doesn&#x27;t look so thick throughout the day, won&#x27;t be buying any other brand any time soon!</li>
            <li> Love this foundation it is AMAZING! THE BEST! FAST shipping, very fast, and product exactly as described! I recommend!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a few people at Sephora and I love it!  Foundation that can cover tats....interesting...!  That said, it IS gonna be a &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; coverage. Duh.... ;o)  I LOVE the coverage just ONE pump of this gives me!  Sometimes I will use 1.5-2 pumps if I&#x27;m really getting &amp;#34;made-up&amp;#34;, but for &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; one pump is PERFECT and it ends up going quite a long way!  I think I&#x27;ve only had to purchase this twice in the past 6-9 mos! :)  If you&#x27;d pay for Lancome, or MAC, etc... then I&#x27;d spring for this!  Check out Sephora, also - they usually have good pricing :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI I have freckles and green eyes and reddish blonde/brown hair ;o)  Fair skinned.  This shade is PERFECT for me!</li>
            <li> Super coverage. Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> I began using this yesterday and I&#x27;m loving it!  My color is light 48 so I didn&#x27;t get it here, clearly.  This IS a full coverage foundation that dries down to a matt finish; meaning a little goes a long way.  I use Benefit POREfessional primer first then using a Beauty Blender sponge &#x27;pounce&#x27; this over my face a section at a time until I have the coverage desired.  Love the finish!  Contour and blush glide on like a dream.  I highly recommend this product but I suggest you get it at Sephora and save over $20 to spend on something else, like a new lipstick!</li>
            <li> This was the lightest color and it was still WAY too dark</li>
            <li> By far, my favorite foundation of all time. A little goes a long way and it lasts me for months! It is high coverage for spots, blemishes, etc., and it leaves a matte surface. It is a bit heavy but nothing too extreme.</li>
            <li> I love the coverage! It&#x27;s thicker and heavier because its full coverage, so a little goes a long way! As long as you don&#x27;t use too much your makeup should look flawless and last almost all day. Would buy again</li>
            <li> Very fast shipment for item and I love the color. Very happy with it</li>
            <li> Covers really well but with it being so thick it does have a tendency to clog pores</li>
