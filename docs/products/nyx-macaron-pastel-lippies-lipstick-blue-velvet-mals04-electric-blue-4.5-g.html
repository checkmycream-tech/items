            <li>Great color and great to do with a pink inside as well</li>
            <li>Lovely summer color.</li>
            <li>but you just have to layer it on more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more on the pastel color side</li>
            <li>and I was hoping it would be more metallic</li>
            <li>Thank you :)</li>
            <li>It got here in good time and it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Still am going to enjoy wearing it from time to time though. :)</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t look good on me - no matter how much I try to blend it</li>
            <li>Applies easily.</li>
            <li>Comes off easy.</li>
            <li>The shade is a very bright but amazingly still very wearable blue.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good color to shock people, or one to just go with a very light blue outfit, this is for you!</li>
            <li>This is actually kinda great.</li>
            <li>This particular color &amp;#34;Blue Velvet&amp;#34; is  amazing.</li>
            <li>The blue stayed bright.</li>
            <li>It provides full opaque color coverage.</li>
            <li>Same day delivery and in good condish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly like the picture and doesn&#x27;t wipe off too easily, though I&#x27;d still watch rubbing it since it is lipstick and all.</li>
            <li>The color is vibrant beautiful blue</li>
            <li>Bold and creamy.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Color is pretty accurately depicted.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>only needed it for a costume but fit for what i needed it for :)</li>
            <li>Fun color.</li>
            <li>The blue is vibrant and surprisingly wearable.</li>
            <li>and if I play the rest of my makeup colors just right it makes everything pop.</li>
            <li>Toooooooooo Bright ... not for dark skin unless your making a statement .</li>
            <li>I hope that NYX comes out with more colors in the future!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it at first</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>The only thing that bothers me is that it comes off quite easily when eating/drinking, when I&#x27;m aware of others being smear-resistant.</li>
            <li>but it is better quality than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>but the lipstick doesnt hold very well.</li>
            <li>It wears off fast, it leaves lines in your lips where the pigment settles...</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast</li>
            <li>but I decided to try it, the whole store was on sale anyway.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping (:</li>
            <li>Bought for my daughter, she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I originally wanted a darker blue</li>
            <li>This item was as expected, a nice blue color.</li>
            <li>nyx always has high quality products.</li>
            <li>but, wow I like it anyway!</li>
            <li>However, when I decided to try it on, it actually was a very pretty blue.</li>
            <li>so I was a little upset when I realize how light this color was.</li>
            <li>(Maybelline makes a clear one I am going to try.)  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t venture too far from neutral colors</li>
            <li>This lipstick is so unique and stays on all day without making a mess</li>
            <li>I will try this before I completely give up.</li>
            <li>Very pastel blue brightness!</li>
            <li>A pretty blue still want a blue lip liner to pair with.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really stay on that long</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the world of makeup, so someone else would probably write a different review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably too old to wear blue lipstick</li>
            <li>it wears off a little fast</li>

            <li> Love this color on me!!</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t look that good on me. In fact a guy said I look scary.  I&#x27;m okay with that.  It doesn&#x27;t really stay on that long but it is better quality than I expected for the price. I like the color.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE COLOR! nyx always has high quality products.</li>
            <li> Its comes a lot brighter and I do not like it</li>
            <li> This item was as expected, a nice blue color.</li>
            <li> This is such a shocking blue and it&#x27;s perfect! It&#x27;s exactly like the picture and doesn&#x27;t wipe off too easily, though I&#x27;d still watch rubbing it since it is lipstick and all. It got here in good time and it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. If you&#x27;re looking for a good color to shock people, or one to just go with a very light blue outfit, this is for you! It&#x27;s very easy to apply, though two swipes is the best for results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably too old to wear blue lipstick but, wow I like it anyway! Good coverage and stay power.</li>
            <li> Bold and creamy. My daughter wore it to school (best teachers ever) and it stayed on till lunch. Don&#x27;t need to go over it too many times. The blue stayed bright. No bleeding, either. Removes easily with a make-up wipe or cold cream. I&#x27;m going to buy more colors.</li>
            <li> This was a gift. She liked it.</li>
            <li> All&#x27;s I can say is I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of makeup, so someone else would probably write a different review. I really love the color, even though I thought it would be lighter. The only thing that bothers me is that it comes off quite easily when eating/drinking, when I&#x27;m aware of others being smear-resistant. Still, I was happy to have bought it and have since ordered another color.</li>
            <li> I wanted a blue lippie and didn&#x27;t want to dish out $20 for a novelty color. This is actually kinda great. I would only wear it once in a while but when I wear it, I feel like a snow queen. It&#x27;s THAT blue.</li>
            <li> Nice color but the lipstick doesnt hold very well. Still am going to enjoy wearing it from time to time though. :)</li>
            <li> Great color, goes on nice and even. Wipes off a bit easily, but does not stain! Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Great color and great to do with a pink inside as well</li>
            <li> It wears off fast, it leaves lines in your lips where the pigment settles...I wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
            <li> The crazy colored lipstick trend is red hot right now. This product is a great way to experiment without breaking the bank.  These lipsticks can vary a great deal in opacity and consistency depending on the color. This particular color &amp;#34;Blue Velvet&amp;#34; is  amazing. It applies very smoothly and has a gorgeous and creamy texture. It provides full opaque color coverage. The shade is a very bright but amazingly still very wearable blue. I tried it on without a lipliner but I definitely think it would benefit from one (Maybelline makes a clear one I am going to try.)  I have several shades of the macaron lippies and this one is one of my favorites. The only downside is that this did linger on my lips after I removed it. I had to scrub it off with a little baby oil but nothing terrible. The retail price for these is about $6 which is far less expensive than other lipsticks of this type.  I hope that NYX comes out with more colors in the future!</li>
            <li> The color is vibrant beautiful blue it wears off a little fast it&#x27;s a matte finish but this is beautiful for the price</li>
            <li> Toooooooooo Bright ... not for dark skin unless your making a statement . Lovely summer color. Stays on well. Shipping was fast</li>
            <li> While replenishing my makeup over the holidays I picked up an eye shadow in this color and the MUA suggested I also try a lipstick in that color. I don&#x27;t venture too far from neutral colors but I decided to try it, the whole store was on sale anyway. I didn&#x27;t like it at first but I saw it&#x27;s potential and now I&#x27;m a blue velvet lip color girl. It&#x27;s great quality, doesn&#x27;t have that sticky feel and if I play the rest of my makeup colors just right it makes everything pop. Awesome advice that I&#x27;m glad I took.</li>
            <li> only needed it for a costume but fit for what i needed it for :)</li>
            <li> Same day delivery and in good condish. Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Loved it ! + Fast shipping (:</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color with smooth application.&lt;br /&gt;Package came ahead of time and had a personal feel.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be so transparent but you just have to layer it on more. It&#x27;s more on the pastel color side and I was hoping it would be more metallic but it&#x27;s all good. Thank you :)</li>
            <li> This lipstick is so unique and stays on all day without making a mess</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because I absolutely love it; the rich color, the smooth application, it&#x27;s beautiful!!! However, it doesn&#x27;t look good on me - no matter how much I try to blend it, I look like an character in Avatar! Nevertheless, I&#x27;m not giving up. My hair stylist told me I need to blend it with a white lipstick in the center of my lip and a dark blue liner. I will try this before I completely give up.</li>
            <li> Very pastel blue brightness! Color is pretty accurately depicted. I looked at Instagram pics before purchasing. Fun color.</li>
            <li> I originally wanted a darker blue so I was a little upset when I realize how light this color was. However, when I decided to try it on, it actually was a very pretty blue. Not many people I know where &amp;#34;colored&amp;#34; lipsticks so of course people were shocked to see it. Then again on the other hand, they know I&#x27;m different so its shock value wasn&#x27;t that shocking! lol I received a lot of comments...I also have the Pistachio...can&#x27;t wait to try that one out!</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter, she absolutely loves it.  Great color to go with her Dr Who cosplay.</li>
            <li> The formula glides on perfectly, lasts fairly long, and has a great color payoff!</li>
            <li> The blue is vibrant and surprisingly wearable. Applies easily.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Arrived quickly.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> A pretty blue still want a blue lip liner to pair with. Comes off easy.</li>
