            <li>Fair warning: this eyeliner is for advanced liquid liner users.</li>

            <li>The brush allows me to make very accurate lines</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many options before this.</li>
            <li>Considering its a liquid liner, it stays on most of the day and is waterproof.</li>
            <li>Love love love this eyeliner</li>
            <li>One of my favorite eyeliners.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>so it makes application precise!</li>
            <li>It just seems like you spread it around more when you try to remove it.</li>
            <li>love it, no smearing</li>
            <li>oh my line might be better for you.</li>
            <li>But love the product.</li>
            <li>u&#x27;ll love this</li>
            <li>easy to draw ,Love it</li>
            <li>lasts all day, and also comes off easy at night.</li>
            <li>but, I like how it&#x27;s easy to take off.</li>
            <li>I also like/dislike that it removes easily with just water.  </li>
            <li>Easy strokes, doesn&#x27;t break off in chunks.</li>
            <li>This is easy to apply and dries almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush makes it easy to apply and is a visible eye liner.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to over do it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still going strong in January.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply, dries quick, and is smooth when you put it on.</li>
            <li>love it been using it for many year ;)</li>
            <li>I guess there&#x27;s a reason this was so cheap...</li>
            <li>Liquid, pencil, gel...expensive and cheap.</li>
            <li>I found one that I liked but for ever day use it was too much money (20 dollars a pop)</li>
            <li>It stays all day without smearing and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove, but super flaky.</li>
            <li>Easy application, dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t smudge on my hooded eyelids.</li>
            <li>Bits of it usually come off after 6+ hours, but it&#x27;s still a great product!</li>
            <li>it arrived fast and looks cute.</li>
            <li>It actually feels good ha.</li>
            <li>Flakes pretty easily if you rub your eyes.</li>
            <li>Better quality than many american drugstore eyeliners.</li>
            <li>Dryes fast, no smudges, fine precision</li>
            <li>but this eyeliner (and [[ASIN:B00WQAWD52 CoverGirl Super Sizer by Lashblast Mascara, Very Black, 0.40 Ounce]]) give me a great look that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Very black &amp; great to do winged eyeliner</li>
            <li>but i feel like there is not enough in the bottle, other than that its great!</li>
            <li>The tip gets very saturated and once the liner sets, you can&#x27;t clean it off with a water-moistened q-tip.</li>
            <li>The color is very deep black, just perfect.</li>
            <li>I have used numerous American brand eyeliners and none worked as great as this one.</li>
            <li>The brush is very sturdy and thin, and flows wonderfully.</li>
            <li>and they fixed it quickly!</li>
            <li>I really believe Korean products can do no wrong!</li>
            <li>But this eyeliner held up very well!</li>
            <li>I love that its an actual brush applicator and not a felt tip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even been able to do different designs with it.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this. :)</li>
            <li>this stuff is actually very work !</li>
            <li>I love this but the end of the applying stick was a little beat up when I got it, the eyeliner dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries pretty fast and is smudge proof.</li>
            <li>Dark, opaque color and honestly does not smudge or wear off.</li>
            <li>Longer lasting than Marc Jacobs and Kat Von D if you don&#x27;t touch the eye area because it comes off easily.</li>
            <li>very smooth to apply and the brush handle is very thick which allows better handling in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will probably keep using this eyeliner until they discontinue the product, haha.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really explain it, but it just sorta sticks to your skin in a way.</li>
            <li>Liner is very liquid based</li>
            <li>I have really oily eyelids and geliner,pencil eyeliner never works for me.</li>
            <li>It has a matte finish, easy to apply, and stays on all day long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really black, has a thin line :) and very cute packaging!</li>
            <li>mainly bc</li>
            <li>I love doing a daily wing liner look, so this product is now a daily staple for me.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to try a new eyeliner!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from a $6 eyeliner, but I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>anyway highly recommended with the price why not try this ?</li>
            <li>Good pigment and lasts long if you don&#x27;t mess it up.</li>
            <li>I love the product, but if you have brown eyes and dark hair and tan skin dont buy it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m bad with liquid eyeliners but this one is excellent!</li>
            <li>In a normal day, my lids get oily by the end of the day and it always smudges my makeup.</li>
            <li>noticed when I was taking it off that it doesn&#x27;t smear like normal liquid eye-liner.</li>
            <li>It arrive fairly fast and when I tried it I could barely feel the brush on my eye lid.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin and even if my eye shadow has creased, my eyeliner hasn&#x27;t moved all day until either I peel it off or use a makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Soft brush.</li>
            <li>Even with the extra international shipping this is still worth it.</li>
            <li>You may want to practice on your hand a few times before you go full cat-eye.</li>
            <li>and I generally don&#x27;t believe in drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>once i open up my eye normally, it&#x27;ll leave a mark on the upper part of my eyelid.  </li>
            <li>I love how the brush is very sleek and soft compared to american brands where the brush is kinda painful when you&#x27;re putting it on.</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of the big handle and brush tip size as it does not really give me a lot of steady control when using the product, but it&#x27;s not that big of a problem.</li>
            <li>Less is more thick coats burned my eyes and instantly flaked.</li>

            <li> Less is more thick coats burned my eyes and instantly flaked.</li>
            <li> I like this property because removing it is not very difficult or messy.</li>
            <li> kind of had a tiny burning feeling to it when I applied it which is really weird!</li>
            <li> I leave early in the morning and do not come back until sun down.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner, the line and product it delivers is very dark and uniform, unlike the really thin and transparent eyeliners ive gotten in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> at times it can dry slowly, especially since I have a hooded eyelid,</li>
            <li> never smuge and also water proof and actually become a film layer when it dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to work with, and you can control the brush to make thin or thick streaks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how long this has lasted me.</li>
            <li> I will never purchase another liquid eyeliner as long as Etude House is still making this.</li>
            <li> I know this sounds confusing, but I feel that the other eyeliners previously mentioned wear out within a few hours w/o even touching your face.    </li>
            <li> and so I&#x27;ll just go back to the other one I had.</li>
            <li> I have very long days at work.</li>
            <li> I use this eyeliner everyday with multiple applications...</li>
            <li> It is a very black back,</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t wear any shimmery powder or blend, smokey-eye style or whatever with it or it looked caked and synthetic (moreso than other liners)</li>
            <li> This is one of the very few eyeliners that I&#x27;ve used that actually stays on my oily lids.</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I can think of about this is that it kinda gets stuck in my eyelashes when I&#x27;m applying the eyeliner.</li>
            <li> would reccomend this to those who want dark eyeliner that has a brush that wont hurt you when you apply it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t as dark as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li> It makes you look dark.</li>
            <li> Also in comparison to some other liquid liners I&#x27;ve used in the past, this definitely compares to some of the $20 liquid liners I&#x27;ve used from Sephora in the past.</li>
            <li> As someone who has problems with applying liquid eyeliner without shaking, making a mess, and making uneven lines-</li>
            <li> I figured it would be done in a few weeks when I received this product in November</li>
            <li> ........... Is not easy to use</li>
            <li> Hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> I adore this eyeliner, the brush is very small</li>
            <li> I like how thin or thick of a line you can make with the brush, but I didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li> Very slow shipping.</li>
            <li> You ca tell it&#x27;s fake because it doesn&#x27;t come with the box.</li>
            <li> Also has a weird texture when it dries..</li>
            <li> I had s problem with the wrong quantity getting delivered</li>
            <li> The brush is very thin but not flappy</li>
            <li> It kinda flakes off when you use makeup wipes which I like because I HATE taking off liquid eye-liner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrible at eyeliner application.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a beginner at makeup like myself, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this but I can use this product for practice and get better.</li>
            <li> Good product. Very slow shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this product. This is one of the very few eyeliners that I&#x27;ve used that actually stays on my oily lids. In a normal day, my lids get oily by the end of the day and it always smudges my makeup. But this eyeliner held up very well! It is a very black back, if that makes any sense lol! The only complaint that I can think of about this is that it kinda gets stuck in my eyelashes when I&#x27;m applying the eyeliner. But it won&#x27;t stop me from ordering more! I ordered 1 and I loved it, so I just ordered 2 more! I ordered on 5/29/13 and I received it in Texas in a week (they ship from Korea!!).</li>
            <li> Better quality than many american drugstore eyeliners. Longer lasting than Marc Jacobs and Kat Von D if you don&#x27;t touch the eye area because it comes off easily. I know this sounds confusing, but I feel that the other eyeliners previously mentioned wear out within a few hours w/o even touching your face.    Update: I still love it. I&#x27;m amazed at how long this has lasted me. I figured it would be done in a few weeks when I received this product in November but it&#x27;s still going strong in January. I use this eyeliner everyday with multiple applications...mainly bc I&#x27;m terrible at eyeliner application. Always fixing my wings</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this liner! it goes on liquid and turns into a non-smearing gel. lasts all day, and also comes off easy at night. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it!</li>
            <li> Love love love!! I&#x27;m bad with liquid eyeliners but this one is excellent!</li>
            <li> love the way the liner works on this</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner, the line and product it delivers is very dark and uniform, unlike the really thin and transparent eyeliners ive gotten in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its very smooth to apply and the brush handle is very thick which allows better handling in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomend this to those who want dark eyeliner that has a brush that wont hurt you when you apply it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the pictures, the left two swatches are from Elf, the last two are from etude&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It comes off when you rub your eyes and it isn&#x27;t as dark as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li> This is the eyeliner that I&#x27;ve using for about 4 years now. I love how the brush is very sleek and soft compared to american brands where the brush is kinda painful when you&#x27;re putting it on. The brush allows me to make very accurate lines and i just love it. It&#x27;s not waterproof but, I like how it&#x27;s easy to take off. I will probably keep using this eyeliner until they discontinue the product, haha.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from a $6 eyeliner, but I was very pleasantly surprised! Bits of it usually come off after 6+ hours, but it&#x27;s still a great product! The brush is very thin but not flappy so you have control over what you&#x27;re doing. I wear it every day but there&#x27;s still a lot of product left (I&#x27;ve had it for over 5 months). I definitely recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product</li>
            <li> You ca tell it&#x27;s fake because it doesn&#x27;t come with the box. It should also have a sticker on the bottom of the bottle. Also the writings weren&#x27;t the same as the picture</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this would be THE liquid eyeliner for me, but it wasn&#x27;t. I like how thin or thick of a line you can make with the brush, but I didn&#x27;t like that at times it can dry slowly, especially since I have a hooded eyelid, once i open up my eye normally, it&#x27;ll leave a mark on the upper part of my eyelid.  I also like/dislike that it removes easily with just water.  Easy to remove, but super flaky.</li>
            <li> I love this but the end of the applying stick was a little beat up when I got it, the eyeliner dries very quickly. Easy strokes, doesn&#x27;t break off in chunks. The problem with it that I would like to say is I wouldn&#x27;t want to keep ordering it (Because it only lasts for about 4 weeks maybe not even that) and so I&#x27;ll just go back to the other one I had.</li>
            <li> Love it. Applys very easy. Very black &amp; great to do winged eyeliner</li>
            <li> I guess there&#x27;s a reason this was so cheap...it arrived fast and looks cute. I&#x27;m just not a fan of this eyeliner...kind of had a tiny burning feeling to it when I applied it which is really weird! Also has a weird texture when it dries..</li>
            <li> good brush,, easy to draw</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really black, has a thin line :) and very cute packaging! I will purchase this again &amp;#60;3 it stays on! I have allergies during summer, so I tear up, and it still stays on for me! So yay &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I have used numerous American brand eyeliners and none worked as great as this one. My eyelids are oily therefore my eyeliner doesn&#x27;t last all day. However, the Etude House Oh My Eye Line lasts all day. This product does everything that it says and I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply, dries quick, and is smooth when you put it on. It actually feels good ha.</li>
            <li> I liked how it felt when it went on but I couldn&#x27;t wear any shimmery powder or blend, smokey-eye style or whatever with it or it looked caked and synthetic (moreso than other liners)</li>
            <li> I will never purchase another liquid eyeliner as long as Etude House is still making this. I have tried so many options before this. Liquid, pencil, gel...expensive and cheap. I found one that I liked but for ever day use it was too much money (20 dollars a pop) Then I found this gem. Even with the extra international shipping this is still worth it. This eyeliner goes on beautifully and doesn&#x27;t move. I have naturally oily skin and even if my eye shadow has creased, my eyeliner hasn&#x27;t moved all day until either I peel it off or use a makeup remover. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I love that its an actual brush applicator and not a felt tip. Considering its a liquid liner, it stays on most of the day and is waterproof. Also in comparison to some other liquid liners I&#x27;ve used in the past, this definitely compares to some of the $20 liquid liners I&#x27;ve used from Sephora in the past. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Love love love this eyeliner and I generally don&#x27;t believe in drugstore brands. But this one is the winner. Dryes fast, no smudges, fine precision brush+ the price is great!</li>
            <li> Was going to give it 4 stars, but I&#x27;m feeling nice. Overall, I like the formula because it doesn&#x27;t smear, rather it flakes. I like this property because removing it is not very difficult or messy. I tend to sweat a lot and get oily lids yet this eyeliner withstands both of these quite well. One of my favorite eyeliners. The reason I was going to give it 4 stars was for its packaging. I am not a fan of the big handle and brush tip size as it does not really give me a lot of steady control when using the product, but it&#x27;s not that big of a problem.</li>
            <li> Easy application, dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t smudge on my hooded eyelids. Best of all, it comes off easily at the end of the day without smearing everywhere.</li>
            <li> As someone who has problems with applying liquid eyeliner without shaking, making a mess, and making uneven lines- i truly like the brush of this eyeliner! It&#x27;s very easy to work with, and you can control the brush to make thin or thick streaks. I love doing a daily wing liner look, so this product is now a daily staple for me. This liner stays on for the majority of the day, it doesn&#x27;t smudge off or wear off, which I love! There&#x27;s been times where I go to bed with my eye makeup on, and wake up with this eyeliner still on. I can&#x27;t really explain it, but it just sorta sticks to your skin in a way. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to try a new eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. It arrive fairly fast and when I tried it I could barely feel the brush on my eye lid. It stays all day without smearing and it looks fantastic. I&#x27;ve even been able to do different designs with it. Definitely ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Best eye line stay on all day easy to apply.</li>
            <li> great pigmented eyeliner that stays on for a while!</li>
            <li> I adore this eyeliner, the brush is very small so it makes application precise! It dries pretty fast and is smudge proof. I definitely recommend this. :)</li>
            <li> easy to draw ,Love it</li>
            <li> I really believe Korean products can do no wrong! This is easy to apply and dries almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed when I was taking it off that it doesn&#x27;t smear like normal liquid eye-liner. It kinda flakes off when you use makeup wipes which I like because I HATE taking off liquid eye-liner. It just seems like you spread it around more when you try to remove it. But not this product!</li>
            <li> The brush makes it easy to apply and is a visible eye liner. My mom and I both use it and we love it! Will rebuy</li>
            <li> love it, no smearing but i feel like there is not enough in the bottle, other than that its great!</li>
            <li> I have very long days at work. I leave early in the morning and do not come back until sun down. I have oily hooded eyelids and have only tried this on my upper lash line. This liner kept its color depth, didn&#x27;t smudge, smear, or irritate around my eyes. Very good product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Flakes pretty easily if you rub your eyes. Good pigment and lasts long if you don&#x27;t mess it up. Less is more thick coats burned my eyes and instantly flaked. Liner is very liquid based so it&#x27;s easy to over do it. Hard to wash off. Soft brush.</li>
            <li> love it been using it for many year ;)</li>
            <li> Best liquid liner I&#x27;ve ever used! The brush is very sturdy and thin, and flows wonderfully. The color is very deep black, just perfect.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but if you have brown eyes and dark hair and tan skin dont buy it! It makes you look dark. The brown oh my line might be better for you. But love the product.</li>
            <li> Finally, an eyeliner that stays put! Dark, opaque color and honestly does not smudge or wear off. I&#x27;ve got the kind of eyes that seem to make every eyeliner or mascara give me raccoon eyes by 10 a.m. but this eyeliner (and [[ASIN:B00WQAWD52 CoverGirl Super Sizer by Lashblast Mascara, Very Black, 0.40 Ounce]]) give me a great look that lasts all day. Fair warning: this eyeliner is for advanced liquid liner users. The tip gets very saturated and once the liner sets, you can&#x27;t clean it off with a water-moistened q-tip. You may want to practice on your hand a few times before you go full cat-eye.</li>
            <li> ........... Is not easy to use</li>
            <li> Perfect eyeliner. It has a matte finish, easy to apply, and stays on all day long.</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner ever. Doesn&#x27;t smudge or fade and is very easy to take off at the end of the day. This seller is amazing too! I had s problem with the wrong quantity getting delivered and they fixed it quickly! Will buy again both because the product is amazing and also the seller is superb!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good one that I love it</li>
            <li> I have really oily eyelids and geliner,pencil eyeliner never works for me. it always smuge and make me look like panda bear.but this stuff is actually very work ! never smuge and also water proof and actually become a film layer when it dry and I can just peel it off. anyway highly recommended with the price why not try this ? u&#x27;ll love this I promise</li>
