            <li>Love it!</li>

            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love it and it works!  </li>
            <li>Love it and recommend it to anyone who loves&lt;br /&gt;beautiful nails!</li>
            <li>It dries very quickly and leaves a nice shine!</li>
            <li>, this product does nothing to strengthen my polish and it chips very easily.</li>
            <li>and this is by far the best one ever.  </li>
            <li>Works great if you are using it often right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you could even find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have used Poshe, Seche Vite, and CND top coats.</li>
            <li>This is going to be my go to top coat.</li>
            <li>I personally love it, and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>I am glad I discovered it and won&#x27;t purchase another drug store top coat ever.</li>
            <li>And thinker or not it&#x27;s still working just as great and drying just as fast.</li>
            <li>I love when companies make dependable products.</li>
            <li>harder/thicker top coats out there, but</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product from the beginning</li>
            <li>No matter what top coat I would use I would always end up messing my nails up.</li>
            <li>I love this topcoat.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>My customers love it...</li>
            <li>Out the Door is my #1 top coat.</li>
            <li>The next morning my nails are perfect (no smudges, no smears).  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have used just about every top coat there is out there</li>
            <li>This topcoat is great because it dries really fast</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t dare rely on this product to keep your nails from smudging if you need to actually use your fingers for anything; like say, unfastening your pants to use the restroom.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it would be best if you paint your nails just before</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Hands down the best top coat that has ever existed!</li>
            <li>Best part is, your nails are completely dry in about 5 mins.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to try the Seche Vite top coat (which I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good things about), and will review that, just to see if it can really compare to my long-time fav.</li>
            <li>I put designs on my nails and are fairly dry before I applied this top coat, and it made my designs smear!!!</li>
            <li>The crystal clear color is great because it won&#x27;t interfere with the color of my nails.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best fast drying top coat that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>A true product that truly works better than SEche vite .</li>
            <li>Took two minutes to dry my nails super happy!</li>
            <li>As someone who feels naked without polish on my nails, I had spent a good deal of time hunting for the perfect top coat.</li>
            <li>Also, if you&#x27;ve bumped and messed up the color polish underneath, a coat of this can help smooth out the wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This dries to a shiny, smooth finish in like literally, 45 seconds.</li>
            <li>I love it and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine tried it first and loved it so much she gave me a bottle too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and dries super fast, and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that was three years ago</li>
            <li>I can have fun painting my nails now!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t surprised to receive only 1 bottle because of the price.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I wasn&#x27;t terribly impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>yes, I would recommend it and most certainly will buy it again.</li>
            <li>Went out and bought it right away and was hooked!  </li>
            <li>Right away!</li>
            <li>The topcoat is great initially, goes on smooth, dries fast.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>I disagree with some of the reviews that said it gets thicker in the bottle quickly.</li>
            <li>INM has me as a loyal consumer now wooohhho</li>
            <li>Dries quickly leaving a salon quality shine.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, my first chip showed up after 6 days (except for a little boo-boo that was completely my fault... smashed my finger) which is awesome.</li>
            <li>I was able to do dishes, laundry, clean and still not mess up my nails.  </li>
            <li>my thumb was dry enough to use - Impressive.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It also gives my polish a great gloss/shine, and protects the color without making my nails stiff or brittle.</li>
            <li>apparently mileage depends on the nail polish you use in conjunction with this top coat.</li>
            <li>it either came out messed up because of a top coat that wouldn&#x27;t dry, or the top coat wouldn&#x27;t smooth out properly over Royal Navy.</li>
            <li>It dries super fast.</li>
            <li>Glossy finish and super fast drying.</li>
            <li>I really like this Out The Door topcoat!</li>
            <li>so i really don&#x27;t care about it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finally buying more and would pay any price for it.</li>
            <li>It drys up FAST!  </li>
            <li>Definitely a must have :)</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this polish!</li>
            <li>where I bought the first bottle.</li>
            <li>I must have done my mani different because I didn&#x27;t have any shrinkage problems with either top coats</li>
            <li>Well the first day went well.  </li>
            <li>Only happened on my hand that had Out the Door as a top coat.  </li>
            <li>top coat had cracks on the white tips.  </li>
            <li>I was disappointed and am still on the hunt for the perfect top coat.</li>
            <li>Let me say that it really dries SUPER fast and is soooo lustrous.  </li>
            <li>a major plus is the super shiny finish it gives any polish!</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is a great products.</li>
            <li>In addition to using it as my original topcoat, I like to refresh my manicure with this every few days to add more shine and protection.</li>
            <li>It works and protects the color to a certain extend, so</li>
            <li>I was looking for a fast drying top coat that wouldn&#x27;t be so sticky and take foreverrrr to dry.  </li>
            <li>I find out the door to be very shiny and it is much thinner than Seche Vite</li>
            <li>so the chipping doesn&#x27;t really bother me that much.</li>
            <li>Dries so fast and creates a high glossy shine over your polish!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
            <li>but it also dries fast.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>but it can&#x27;t really compare to Out the Door when it comes to drying power.</li>
            <li>(thanks to my impatience when incomes to my nails.)</li>
            <li>You can do a manicure or touch-up and really be &#x27;out the door.&#x27;</li>
            <li>much cheaper here then</li>
            <li>Like all quick drying top coats it only drys the top layer, while the layers underneath remain wet and still take 30-40 minutes to fully dry.</li>
            <li>Would love to get advise from other users..</li>
            <li>The price is certainly right  quick dry as promised .</li>
            <li>This could be because i live in the mountains and everything dries up fast here</li>
            <li>Not only will it leave your nails super shiny</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Some weeks are better than other as far as the chipping goes.</li>
            <li>and I used it on light pink nails</li>
            <li>All you have to do is get nail polish thinner, NOT nail polish remover, to get it to its normal consistency again.</li>
            <li>This helps my nails to dry quickly and it is a long lasting top coat.</li>
            <li>I no longer have to wait for an \\&quot;optimal\\&quot; time to paint my nails, i.e. an afternoon where I have the whole afternoon free and won&#x27;t need to put closed toed shoes on again later</li>
            <li>It dries fast and lasts long, I will absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li>It enhances your polish completely.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product professionally for 20 years on my manicure table.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s glossy , dries fast, and makes a manicure last.</li>
            <li>Never fails to dry nail polish within a minute - no smudges, no mess.</li>
            <li>Poshe and CND chipped the next day and while I really liked Seche Vite, I had serious nail polish shrinkage and lifting at the cuticles.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it the night before I went to work, the next day all of my nails hd bad chips on them(I work at a computer all day)But all in all great topcoat and</li>
            <li>and I still have more than half left; and obviously there are stretches where I&#x27;m not doing my nails).</li>
            <li>I got around this by also using OPI Drip Dry and got truly hard, glossy, perfect nails in about ten minutes (that is to say, ten minutes after I finished applying Out The Door and OPI Drip Dry, not ten minutes</li>
            <li>If you do not tightly close this bottle up you will find it becoming too thick to use.  </li>
            <li>I was able to paint my nails before going to sleep and wake up with no sheet marks or other chips when normally they would&#x27;ve been completely messed up after letting them \\&quot;dry\\&quot; for at least 4 times the amount of time I waited after using Out the Door.</li>
            <li>It works just as well as other higher priced topcoats.</li>
            <li>I spent a long time trying to find \\&quot;quick drying\\&quot; nail polish and stumbled upon this one day in the beauty store.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m generally changing my nail polish every three to four days</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still using that same (big) bottle (I actually just went to see how much I have</li>
            <li>I value &#x27;fast-drying properties&#x27; since I&#x27;m never careful while my nails are drying.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t chip like other quick dry topcoats.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot(duh) to achieve the high gloss and fast dry which should be obvious since I&#x27;ve had the same bottle for so long.</li>
            <li>First of all, it was only $3.00, maybe less.  </li>
            <li>I had many ladies recommended this to me when I complained about how long it took my nails to dry.</li>
            <li>It dried very fast (to the touch obviously.</li>
            <li>I even tried Royal Navy under \\&quot;Yoga ta get this blue\\&quot; by OPI, but that only made things worse and I ended up fudging my nails so many times that I wiped it all off and went with a different color entirely.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly - even when you put it on too thick.</li>
            <li>When it does get dull you do not need to reapply simply take an alchol pad and wipe the top of your nails down.  </li>
            <li>Your nails will be \\&quot;dry\\&quot; within a few minutes, but beware if your layers are thick or not completely dry when you use this top coat.</li>
            <li>No matter how thick I&#x27;ve laid on the nail polish, this top coat will set it and dry it faster than any other product out there.  </li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> I disagree with some of the reviews that said it gets thicker in the bottle quickly.</li>
            <li> INM has me as a loyal consumer now wooohhho</li>
            <li> Dries quickly leaving a salon quality shine.  </li>
            <li> On top of that, my first chip showed up after 6 days (except for a little boo-boo that was completely my fault... smashed my finger) which is awesome.</li>
            <li> I was able to do dishes, laundry, clean and still not mess up my nails.  </li>
            <li> my thumb was dry enough to use - Impressive.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It also gives my polish a great gloss/shine, and protects the color without making my nails stiff or brittle.</li>
            <li> apparently mileage depends on the nail polish you use in conjunction with this top coat.</li>
            <li> it either came out messed up because of a top coat that wouldn&#x27;t dry, or the top coat wouldn&#x27;t smooth out properly over Royal Navy.</li>
            <li> It dries super fast.</li>
            <li> Glossy finish and super fast drying.</li>
            <li> I really like this Out The Door topcoat!</li>
            <li> so i really don&#x27;t care about it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finally buying more and would pay any price for it.</li>
            <li> It drys up FAST!  </li>
            <li> Definitely a must have :)</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this polish!</li>
            <li> where I bought the first bottle.</li>
            <li> I must have done my mani different because I didn&#x27;t have any shrinkage problems with either top coats</li>
            <li> Well the first day went well.  </li>
            <li> Only happened on my hand that had Out the Door as a top coat.  </li>
            <li> top coat had cracks on the white tips.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed and am still on the hunt for the perfect top coat.</li>
            <li> Let me say that it really dries SUPER fast and is soooo lustrous.  </li>
            <li> a major plus is the super shiny finish it gives any polish!</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is a great products.</li>
            <li> In addition to using it as my original topcoat, I like to refresh my manicure with this every few days to add more shine and protection.</li>
            <li> It works and protects the color to a certain extend, so</li>
            <li> I was looking for a fast drying top coat that wouldn&#x27;t be so sticky and take foreverrrr to dry.  </li>
            <li> I find out the door to be very shiny and it is much thinner than Seche Vite</li>
            <li> so the chipping doesn&#x27;t really bother me that much.</li>
            <li> Dries so fast and creates a high glossy shine over your polish!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
            <li> but it also dries fast.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> but it can&#x27;t really compare to Out the Door when it comes to drying power.</li>
            <li> (thanks to my impatience when incomes to my nails.)</li>
            <li> You can do a manicure or touch-up and really be &#x27;out the door.&#x27;</li>
            <li> much cheaper here then</li>
            <li> Like all quick drying top coats it only drys the top layer, while the layers underneath remain wet and still take 30-40 minutes to fully dry.</li>
            <li> Would love to get advise from other users..</li>
            <li> The price is certainly right  quick dry as promised .</li>
            <li> This could be because i live in the mountains and everything dries up fast here</li>
            <li> Not only will it leave your nails super shiny</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Some weeks are better than other as far as the chipping goes.</li>
            <li> and I used it on light pink nails</li>
            <li> All you have to do is get nail polish thinner, NOT nail polish remover, to get it to its normal consistency again.</li>
            <li> This helps my nails to dry quickly and it is a long lasting top coat.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to wait for an \\&quot;optimal\\&quot; time to paint my nails, i.e. an afternoon where I have the whole afternoon free and won&#x27;t need to put closed toed shoes on again later</li>
            <li> It dries fast and lasts long, I will absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li> It enhances your polish completely.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product professionally for 20 years on my manicure table.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s glossy , dries fast, and makes a manicure last.</li>
            <li> Never fails to dry nail polish within a minute - no smudges, no mess.</li>
            <li> Poshe and CND chipped the next day and while I really liked Seche Vite, I had serious nail polish shrinkage and lifting at the cuticles.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it the night before I went to work, the next day all of my nails hd bad chips on them(I work at a computer all day)But all in all great topcoat and</li>
            <li> and I still have more than half left; and obviously there are stretches where I&#x27;m not doing my nails).</li>
            <li> I got around this by also using OPI Drip Dry and got truly hard, glossy, perfect nails in about ten minutes (that is to say, ten minutes after I finished applying Out The Door and OPI Drip Dry, not ten minutes</li>
            <li> If you do not tightly close this bottle up you will find it becoming too thick to use.  </li>
            <li> I was able to paint my nails before going to sleep and wake up with no sheet marks or other chips when normally they would&#x27;ve been completely messed up after letting them \\&quot;dry\\&quot; for at least 4 times the amount of time I waited after using Out the Door.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as other higher priced topcoats.</li>
            <li> I spent a long time trying to find \\&quot;quick drying\\&quot; nail polish and stumbled upon this one day in the beauty store.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m generally changing my nail polish every three to four days</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still using that same (big) bottle (I actually just went to see how much I have</li>
            <li> I value &#x27;fast-drying properties&#x27; since I&#x27;m never careful while my nails are drying.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t chip like other quick dry topcoats.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot(duh) to achieve the high gloss and fast dry which should be obvious since I&#x27;ve had the same bottle for so long.</li>
            <li> First of all, it was only $3.00, maybe less.  </li>
            <li> I had many ladies recommended this to me when I complained about how long it took my nails to dry.</li>
            <li> It dried very fast (to the touch obviously.</li>
            <li> I even tried Royal Navy under \\&quot;Yoga ta get this blue\\&quot; by OPI, but that only made things worse and I ended up fudging my nails so many times that I wiped it all off and went with a different color entirely.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly - even when you put it on too thick.</li>
            <li> When it does get dull you do not need to reapply simply take an alchol pad and wipe the top of your nails down.  </li>
            <li> Your nails will be \\&quot;dry\\&quot; within a few minutes, but beware if your layers are thick or not completely dry when you use this top coat.</li>
            <li> No matter how thick I&#x27;ve laid on the nail polish, this top coat will set it and dry it faster than any other product out there.  </li>
            <li> And I always use a blow dryer in between coats which probably speeds things up in the long run) and was very shiny, and although I used it on black, it seemed to make the color brighter.</li>
            <li> I picked it up locally because I couldn&#x27;t wait, and decided to try it out in the car at a red light (terrible decision, I know) and slapped some on my thumb over an okay polish job from the night before.</li>
            <li> Obviously I dont use it often if it&#x27;s lasted that long</li>
            <li> Anyway, I did 2 coats of Royal Navy (pretty thick coats, too</li>
            <li> Within minutes my nails are dry enough that I can go about my day.  </li>
            <li> ALL QUICK DRY TOPCOATS GET THICK AT THE BOTTOM!</li>
            <li> I work at The Home Depot, so you can imagine my surprise when I lasted an entire day without chipping a single nail!</li>
            <li> I usually use Barielle which has the loveliest high gloss shine</li>
            <li> and I am going on day 5 with one tiny little chip that is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> When the bottle is almost gone it gets goopy though, but this seems to be common amongst fast drying topcoats.</li>
            <li> a few weeks later I went back and got the bigger bottle...</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product for as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> So long as you don&#x27;t do anything too demanding you can go on about your day without worrying about smudging your polish.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even manage to get my Royal Navy to work with OPI Drip Dry, which usually helps my other polish jobs dry in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before I ordered this product since I had tried several other products from the drugstore unsuccessfully.</li>
            <li> I found that it took a lot longer to dry than Seche Vite</li>
            <li> Plus, if you throw OPI Drip Dry at Out The Door your nails get truly, deeply dry in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually dry to the touch in about a minute and fully dry in around five.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to wait for my nails to dry.  </li>
            <li> every single nail with the Out the Door</li>
            <li> I decided to put this stuff to a real test and use it over some polish I had all but given up on because of the horrific results that I get with regular OPI top coat.</li>
            <li> I have no patience to sit and wait for my nails to dry, NONE!</li>
            <li> but I sent a bottle to my mother to try and after 3 weeks hers was unuseable as she could not close it tight enough.</li>
            <li> and I usually have major shrinkage problems with Seche Vite.  </li>
            <li> I do experience some chipping and tip wear throughout the week, but I tend to be rough on my nails</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> I suggest being careful.</li>
            <li> If however, you are like me and actually use your hands, this products is a waste of time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry to the touch in less than two minutes and lasts for day without chipping.</li>
            <li> It is a very thin formula with such high shine.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, it does not seem to work very well with Butter London.</li>
            <li> so multiple coats during the week do not get too thick on the nail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously tried at least 4 different times to use this polish, but</li>
            <li> The color is Royal Navy by Butter London, an almost black blue that&#x27;s just shy of being a gel color.</li>
            <li> I bought the smaller bottle to try and needless to say,</li>
            <li> my first chip showed up after 2 days , and when used on stamping the design fades, I am disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> Since then, I never had to worry about smudging my nails after they dried again!</li>
            <li> With Out the Door I got the shine and the crazy quick drying time I so desperately need</li>
            <li> I recommend Sally Hansen Hard</li>
            <li> Unless I go to the salon, then I&#x27;ll just be forced to wait.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this, and am unhappy!</li>
            <li> and I hate waiting for my nails to dry</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t manage to get them thin) and topped it off with a coat of Out The Door - Vwala!</li>
            <li> Am I doing something wrong??</li>
            <li> So weird.  </li>
            <li> I have use every topcoat out there and one day in a nail salon the tech whiped out this bad boy and for two weeks my nails stayed glossy and chip free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I paired it with Essie&#x27;s protein base coat</li>
            <li> and I have not been disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this Out The Door topcoat! It dries very quickly and leaves a nice shine! It works just as well as other higher priced topcoats. Someone recommended this to me and told me this is what her nail lady uses on her nails. When the bottle is almost gone it gets goopy though, but this seems to be common amongst fast drying topcoats. Just add a couple of drops of nail polish thinner which is only about $5 at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and one 4oz bottle lasts forever. I&#x27;m sure you could even find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonderful!!!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  I use it after I polish my fingernails or toenails each time.  I can dig in my purse for my keys in no time.</li>
            <li> I have used Poshe, Seche Vite, and CND top coats. Poshe and CND chipped the next day and while I really liked Seche Vite, I had serious nail polish shrinkage and lifting at the cuticles. I used out the door and I am going on day 5 with one tiny little chip that is barely noticeable. I paired it with Essie&#x27;s protein base coat and I think I have finally found my base/top coat combo. I find out the door to be very shiny and it is much thinner than Seche Vite so multiple coats during the week do not get too thick on the nail. I found that it took a lot longer to dry than Seche Vite but it&#x27;s worth it. This is going to be my go to top coat. I do a lot of typing for work and I didn&#x27;t get any nail wear at the tips either - best ever...!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing the rave reviews all over the internet. I picked it up locally because I couldn&#x27;t wait, and decided to try it out in the car at a red light (terrible decision, I know) and slapped some on my thumb over an okay polish job from the night before. By the time I was home (under 10 minutes) my thumb was dry enough to use - Impressive. I decided to put this stuff to a real test and use it over some polish I had all but given up on because of the horrific results that I get with regular OPI top coat. The color is Royal Navy by Butter London, an almost black blue that&#x27;s just shy of being a gel color. I&#x27;d previously tried at least 4 different times to use this polish, but it either came out messed up because of a top coat that wouldn&#x27;t dry, or the top coat wouldn&#x27;t smooth out properly over Royal Navy. I even tried Royal Navy under \\&quot;Yoga ta get this blue\\&quot; by OPI, but that only made things worse and I ended up fudging my nails so many times that I wiped it all off and went with a different color entirely. I couldn&#x27;t even manage to get my Royal Navy to work with OPI Drip Dry, which usually helps my other polish jobs dry in a reasonable amount of time. Anyway, I did 2 coats of Royal Navy (pretty thick coats, too, I couldn&#x27;t manage to get them thin) and topped it off with a coat of Out The Door - Vwala! PERFECT NAILS! I&#x27;m so excited. Plus, if you throw OPI Drip Dry at Out The Door your nails get truly, deeply dry in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A WORD OF CAUTION - Your nails will be \\&quot;dry\\&quot; within a few minutes, but beware if your layers are thick or not completely dry when you use this top coat. You may get away with some things, but you can still cause marks in your nails. I got around this by also using OPI Drip Dry and got truly hard, glossy, perfect nails in about ten minutes (that is to say, ten minutes after I finished applying Out The Door and OPI Drip Dry, not ten minutes start to finish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHYL RECOMMEND!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately my nails MASSIVELY started chipping in 24 hours, within 36 hours I lost the tip off of all of my nails and they started peeling all over. Not so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 2:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So apparently mileage depends on the nail polish you use in conjunction with this top coat. Sadly, it does not seem to work very well with Butter London. It seems to work great with Illamasqua and OPI so just keep that in mind if you&#x27;re going to pick this up.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for YEARS. And I love it! I have no patience to sit and wait for my nails to dry, NONE! Even when I go to the salon, I have ants in my pants sitting under the dryer. I spent a long time trying to find \\&quot;quick drying\\&quot; nail polish and stumbled upon this one day in the beauty store. I bought the smaller bottle to try and needless to say, a few weeks later I went back and got the bigger bottle... I&#x27;m pretty sure that was three years ago and I&#x27;m still using that same (big) bottle (I actually just went to see how much I have and I still have more than half left; and obviously there are stretches where I&#x27;m not doing my nails). You don&#x27;t need a lot(duh) to achieve the high gloss and fast dry which should be obvious since I&#x27;ve had the same bottle for so long. Some weeks are better than other as far as the chipping goes. But I&#x27;m generally changing my nail polish every three to four days so the chipping doesn&#x27;t really bother me that much. I personally love it, and won&#x27;t use anything else. Unless I go to the salon, then I&#x27;ll just be forced to wait.</li>
            <li> good product, great deal!....whats else to say about nail polish....Dont know if it was the the best price, but I&#x27;m happy with them, so i really don&#x27;t care about it!</li>
            <li> Dries so fast and creates a high glossy shine over your polish!  I am glad I discovered it and won&#x27;t purchase another drug store top coat ever.</li>
            <li> I disagree with some of the reviews that said it gets thicker in the bottle quickly. A friend of mine tried it first and loved it so much she gave me a bottle too. That was 7 years ago and I&#x27;m still using the same bottle! Obviously I dont use it often if it&#x27;s lasted that long and yet it has only just now started to thicken up. And thinker or not it&#x27;s still working just as great and drying just as fast. I&#x27;m finally buying more and would pay any price for it.</li>
            <li> I paint my nails twice to three times a week and I hate waiting for my nails to dry so I decided to test this product out and it does what is says!! Took two minutes to dry my nails super happy! I love when companies make dependable products. INM has me as a loyal consumer now wooohhho</li>
            <li> I ordered two - one for my friend! She is so happy with it and she couldnt believe that i found this topcoat! She knows it from a us holiday!! Amazon for ever!! Thank you!! Great service!!</li>
            <li> my first chip showed up after 2 days , and when used on stamping the design fades, I am disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> As someone who feels naked without polish on my nails, I had spent a good deal of time hunting for the perfect top coat. While not as speedy as advertised, this one is inexpensive and gets the job done well. It&#x27;s usually dry to the touch in about a minute and fully dry in around five. I do experience some chipping and tip wear throughout the week, but I tend to be rough on my nails so it&#x27;s to be expected. In addition to using it as my original topcoat, I like to refresh my manicure with this every few days to add more shine and protection. Also, if you&#x27;ve bumped and messed up the color polish underneath, a coat of this can help smooth out the wrinkles. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I actually went and looked for this item on amazon so i could review it, that&#x27;s how much I like it. Out of my own experience with topcoats, this is the best I&#x27;ve tried. It dried very fast (to the touch obviously. And I always use a blow dryer in between coats which probably speeds things up in the long run) and was very shiny, and although I used it on black, it seemed to make the color brighter. I work at The Home Depot, so you can imagine my surprise when I lasted an entire day without chipping a single nail! On top of that, my first chip showed up after 6 days (except for a little boo-boo that was completely my fault... smashed my finger) which is awesome. There may be better/harder/thicker top coats out there, but i prefer one just like this.    p.s. The crystal clear color is great because it won&#x27;t interfere with the color of my nails. Once I had one that was greenish and I used it on light pink nails, it changed it just enough to look gross.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product from the beginning but as I kept using it, it grew thicker and thicker in the bottle.    Works great if you are using it often right away.</li>
            <li> I have use every topcoat out there and one day in a nail salon the tech whiped out this bad boy and for two weeks my nails stayed glossy and chip free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly this top cost is the best I have ever seen.  The shine just lasts and lasts.  When it does get dull you do not need to reapply simply take an alchol pad and wipe the top of your nails down.  It reminds me of a gel without having to sit under the heat lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside?  It drys up FAST!  If you do not tightly close this bottle up you will find it becoming too thick to use.  Not even adding a touch of polish remover saves it the only thing you van do is get another bottle.  This could be because i live in the mountains and everything dries up fast here but I sent a bottle to my mother to try and after 3 weeks hers was unuseable as she could not close it tight enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sooo happy that I found this. No matter what top coat I would use I would always end up messing my nails up. I could sit for hours and still chip them! But not with this stuff! It&#x27;s amazing and dries super fast, and a major plus is the super shiny finish it gives any polish! Definitely a must have :)</li>
            <li> I heard about this stuff from a co worker who swore by it.  Went out and bought it right away and was hooked!  This stuff is awesome!  It will literally change your life!  I no longer have to wait for my nails to dry.  Within minutes my nails are dry enough that I can go about my day.  I was able to do dishes, laundry, clean and still not mess up my nails.  I no longer have to pay a lot of $$$ for manis/pedis bec. I can do it at home for a lot cheaper and faster.  This is the best topcoat out there.  Not only will it leave your nails super shiny but it also dries fast.  You get the best of both worlds.  And if you reapply every couple of days it will extend the life of your mani/pedi.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this topcoat.I can paint my nails, go to bed and wake up with no sheet marks.  It dries super fast. It is self leveling. It doesn&#x27;t chip like other quick dry topcoats. ALL QUICK DRY TOPCOATS GET THICK AT THE BOTTOM! All you have to do is get nail polish thinner, NOT nail polish remover, to get it to its normal consistency again. Seriously, this is a great products. i can wear a manicure for a week with no chips, only tipwear (I wash dishes, do laundry, etc).</li>
            <li> I used to use the Sally Hansen Insta-Dri topcoat, but this just totally blows it out of the water. It&#x27;s dry to the touch in less than two minutes and lasts for day without chipping. Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local face values store.  First of all, it was only $3.00, maybe less.  I was looking for a fast drying top coat that wouldn&#x27;t be so sticky and take foreverrrr to dry.  Let me say that it really dries SUPER fast and is soooo lustrous.  It enhances your polish completely.  It is a very thin formula with such high shine.  It takes seconds to apply.  The day after I painted my nails and used out the door, I put another coat on after my shower and it made my mani even shinier.  I will be buying this again!!! Try it!</li>
            <li> Glossy finish and super fast drying. Does not chip either if you use a good quality color underneath it.  Great purchase. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me at a beauty supply store and I couldn&#x27;t be more greatful to the man! I usually use Barielle which has the loveliest high gloss shine but it can&#x27;t really compare to Out the Door when it comes to drying power. With Out the Door I got the shine and the crazy quick drying time I so desperately need (thanks to my impatience when incomes to my nails.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Out the Door for probably over 10 years ever since I discovered it at a Harmon&#x27;s. Since then, I never had to worry about smudging my nails after they dried again! I value &#x27;fast-drying properties&#x27; since I&#x27;m never careful while my nails are drying. This dries to a shiny, smooth finish in like literally, 45 seconds. You can do a manicure or touch-up and really be &#x27;out the door.&#x27; I&#x27;m about to try the Seche Vite top coat (which I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good things about), and will review that, just to see if it can really compare to my long-time fav.</li>
            <li> The topcoat is great initially, goes on smooth, dries fast. (Except it smudges) But once you take a shower, swim or have your hands in water in 10+ minutes or so, it chips! Right away! And then it starts peeling off. I really don&#x27;t like this polish! Don&#x27;t get it! I recommend Sally Hansen Hard As Nails instead.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before I ordered this product since I had tried several other products from the drugstore unsuccessfully. I finally ordered this and I have not been disappointed! I was able to paint my nails before going to sleep and wake up with no sheet marks or other chips when normally they would&#x27;ve been completely messed up after letting them \\&quot;dry\\&quot; for at least 4 times the amount of time I waited after using Out the Door. I no longer have to wait for an \\&quot;optimal\\&quot; time to paint my nails, i.e. an afternoon where I have the whole afternoon free and won&#x27;t need to put closed toed shoes on again later and there will be plenty of time before I go to sleep. I can have fun painting my nails now! :) It dries fast and lasts long, I will absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li> It is all it was promised it is going to be. It works and protects the color to a certain extend, so yes, I would recommend it and most certainly will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product professionally for 20 years on my manicure table. My customers love it...it&#x27;s glossy , dries fast, and makes a manicure last. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Out the Door is my #1 top coat. It dries quickly - even when you put it on too thick. It also gives my polish a great gloss/shine, and protects the color without making my nails stiff or brittle. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best top coat that has ever existed! I love it and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. Makes all my manicures look (and last) like a gel manicure without the damage. Best part is, your nails are completely dry in about 5 mins. I will continue to buy this product for as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;You can make your nails, cover them with this product then go to bed in 10 minutes and your nails are still shiney and wonderful in the morning :&#x3D;))</li>
            <li> I heard about this product and had to try it.  I love it and it works!  I can do my nails at night, wait 2 minutes, and then go to bed.  The next morning my nails are perfect (no smudges, no smears).  I&#x27;ll definitely order this again.  I also found it at Publix.  It does get thicker over time but, it doesn&#x27;t affect how the product works. I&#x27;m hoping that nail thinner will fix that problem.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best fast drying top coat that I have ever used. Love it. Everyone should try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with it!</li>
            <li> I work with my hands and often have my nails done on the way to work. This helps my nails to dry quickly and it is a long lasting top coat.</li>
            <li> Would love to get advise from other users.. I recently purchased this, and am unhappy! I put designs on my nails and are fairly dry before I applied this top coat, and it made my designs smear!!! What the heck? Am I doing something wrong??</li>
            <li> I have used just about every top coat there is out there and this is by far the best one ever.  No matter how thick I&#x27;ve laid on the nail polish, this top coat will set it and dry it faster than any other product out there.  Great purhcase.</li>
            <li> This topcoat is great because it dries really fast and it fill in any smudges you made while doing your nails(bonus). It does these great things but depending on how many coats yo put on your nails and what kind of work you doing I suggest being careful. The first time I tried it the night before I went to work, the next day all of my nails hd bad chips on them(I work at a computer all day)But all in all great topcoat and much cheaper here then where I bought the first bottle.</li>
            <li> Con este secante puedes usar tus zapatos al instante,&lt;br /&gt;Nunca podia salir de la peluqueria lista con unas pintadas,,&lt;br /&gt;Se los recomiendo</li>
            <li> The description lists this as a pack of 12, but it isn&#x27;t, you only get 1 bottle. I wasn&#x27;t surprised to receive only 1 bottle because of the price.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I wasn&#x27;t terribly impressed with this product. I had many ladies recommended this to me when I complained about how long it took my nails to dry. All the ladies told me that it was a great product that worked in seconds. Well it does that, sorta. Like all quick drying top coats it only drys the top layer, while the layers underneath remain wet and still take 30-40 minutes to fully dry. So long as you don&#x27;t do anything too demanding you can go on about your day without worrying about smudging your polish. If however, you are like me and actually use your hands, this products is a waste of time. Don&#x27;t dare rely on this product to keep your nails from smudging if you need to actually use your fingers for anything; like say, unfastening your pants to use the restroom.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it would be best if you paint your nails just before bed.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product does nothing to strengthen my polish and it chips very easily.</li>
            <li> I did my first ever french mani the other day and used both Seche Vite on one hand and Out the Door on the other.  I must have done my mani different because I didn&#x27;t have any shrinkage problems with either top coats and I usually have major shrinkage problems with Seche Vite.  Well the first day went well.  But later during the week I noticed lines on my white tips.  Later I found out that the lines were cracks!  Only happened on my hand that had Out the Door as a top coat.  By the end of the week every single nail with the Out the Door top coat had cracks on the white tips.  So weird.  I was disappointed and am still on the hunt for the perfect top coat.</li>
            <li> Great product. Dries quickly leaving a salon quality shine.  Got a dozen and shared with all of the girls.  Happy girls!</li>
            <li> A true product that truly works better than SEche vite . The price is certainly right  quick dry as promised . I love it</li>
            <li> Never fails to dry nail polish within a minute - no smudges, no mess. Love it and recommend it to anyone who loves&lt;br /&gt;beautiful nails!</li>
