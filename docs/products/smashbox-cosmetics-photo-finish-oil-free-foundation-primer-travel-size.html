            <li>It smooths out skin, decreases redness, and creates a nice matte surface for foundation.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend...the best!</li>

            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this was just a sample size....just wanted to try it out to see if it was better than what I already use, which it is not.  </li>
            <li>I love DHC Velvet Coat and just have not found a better primer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad VC is available here on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I guess I should of read the Oz better</li>
            <li>and I guess celebrities love this and famous</li>
            <li>Love the feel the softness</li>
            <li>love it,</li>
            <li>Otherwise the primer appears to be fine.</li>
            <li>Fantastic primer.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few primers, but this is the best!  </li>
            <li>and it  goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>I have since moved to Trish McEvoy makeup and products which seem to work much better and look more natural for my skin type.</li>
            <li>I would only buy it again if I got a good deal.</li>
            <li>Product was mailed to me quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially, when I first apply it, it does seem to &#x27;smooth&#x27; out my complexion (minimize pores) and give a &#x27;matte&#x27; look to my skin for about an hour or two.  </li>
            <li>By noon, I notice that I look really shiny and the primer seems to make my light makeup look heavier than if I had not used primer at all.  </li>
            <li>I love this product it gives my skin a extra smooth feel.</li>
            <li>and then you can put makeup right onto it...</li>
            <li>Bought a bigger one after trying this. :)</li>
            <li>smooth and natural.</li>
            <li>I had to clean it completely off</li>
            <li>Also, I think it was just ok, didn&#x27;t seem to help my make up last much longer.</li>
            <li>I really like Smashbox products.  </li>
            <li>I have used different primers and I was expecting this to be so much better then other ones I used</li>
            <li>The tube is marked &amp;#34;not for sale&amp;#34; and also says to follow package instructions which were not provided.  </li>

            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> What a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Did not preform as promised - hardly enough in the tube for one use much less 2 that I needed it for.  </li>
            <li> which is the size I&#x27;ve previously bought for the same price.</li>
            <li> so it was not only a waste of this product but the makeup I put over the primer.  </li>
            <li> Did not aid me in making my face a workable canvas for my other makeup.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> It was ineffective, as was the other product I tried.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that it&#x27;s so small.</li>
            <li> too bad its a real small amount but still love it!</li>
            <li> but I prefer hands down DHC&#x27;s velvet skin coat.</li>
            <li> Just a little on the costly side</li>
            <li> A LITTLE TO PRICEY FOR WHAT I GOT.</li>
            <li> Were&#x27;s well but a little Oiley.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really small</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this primer did not deliver.  </li>
            <li> but it is so expensive.  </li>
            <li> but I was disappointed that it was a sample size.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>

            <li> The best I buy this over and over again it works</li>
            <li> What a complete waste of money.  Did not preform as promised - hardly enough in the tube for one use much less 2 that I needed it for.  Did not aid me in making my face a workable canvas for my other makeup.  Photo is misleading as the tube is smaller than your pinky finger. After I put the makeup on - I had to clean it completely off so it was not only a waste of this product but the makeup I put over the primer.  Also it made me break out afterwards. Clogged my pores.</li>
            <li> Had never used it before but my sister suggested trying it.  Very happy with it.  Just a little on the costly side but I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic primer. My only qualm is the size of the container wish it were bigger!!</li>
            <li> So smooth!!! and it makes my skin feel smooth!!! I wholeheartedly recommend! You also don&#x27;t need a lot for one area of your face, the coverage is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Great primer, excellent feel on face. Very smooth. Bought a bigger one after trying this. :)</li>
            <li> I really like Smashbox products.  Unfortunately this primer did not deliver.  I bought it hoping to help control oil and make my pores appear smaller.  It did neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, when I first apply it, it does seem to &#x27;smooth&#x27; out my complexion (minimize pores) and give a &#x27;matte&#x27; look to my skin for about an hour or two.  By noon, I notice that I look really shiny and the primer seems to make my light makeup look heavier than if I had not used primer at all.  (I was applying Too Faced Milk Chocolate Bronzer and Too Faced Amazing Face SPF 15 Powder Foundation over the primer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see how this would work well for someone that isn&#x27;t overly oily.  It just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I have since moved to Trish McEvoy makeup and products which seem to work much better and look more natural for my skin type.</li>
            <li> Its a good product but i need one that helps with oily skin</li>
            <li> I have tried a few primers, but this is the best!  A little goes a long way!  Highly recommend...the best!</li>
            <li> Great product but I was disappointed that it was a sample size.</li>
            <li> THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MUCH BIGGER. DOESN&#x27;T WORK AS WELL AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD. A LITTLE TO PRICEY FOR WHAT I GOT.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff but it is so expensive.  Cheaper primers don&#x27;t cut it.  But at $44 an ounce ($11 for a quarter ounce) - ouch!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this was just a sample size....just wanted to try it out to see if it was better than what I already use, which it is not.  I love DHC Velvet Coat and just have not found a better primer so I&#x27;m going to stop even trying!  I&#x27;m glad VC is available here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Were&#x27;s well but a little Oiley.</li>
            <li> This is the second Smashbox product I&#x27;ve used. It was ineffective, as was the other product I tried.</li>
            <li> The product is as described. It&#x27;s really small so it doesn&#x27;t last long. Also, I think it was just ok, didn&#x27;t seem to help my make up last much longer. I would only buy it again if I got a good deal. Product was mailed to me quickly.</li>
            <li> i love this primer!!!!!!!!! too bad its a real small amount but still love it! got it in no time which i liked alot &amp; da price was better than in stores</li>
            <li> i love this, it feels great once applied its just as described this is a must have for anyone who loves makeup!</li>
            <li> This product arrived without its packaging.  The tube is marked &amp;#34;not for sale&amp;#34; and also says to follow package instructions which were not provided.  I believe I was sold a sample that was not supposed to be sold at all. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My number one item for makeup!!!!!!!!! The best price and I will keep reordering!</li>
            <li> If I were paying attention and not in a hurry, I would&#x27;ve realized this is .25oz for $10 and not .4oz- which is the size I&#x27;ve previously bought for the same price. Otherwise the primer appears to be fine.</li>
            <li> Great product but it is way smaller then it looked in picture.. I guess I should of read the Oz better</li>
            <li> The Smachbox photo finish foundation Primer was very smooth and helped my make look wonderful.  I really loved the primer</li>
            <li> I have used different primers and I was expecting this to be so much better then other ones I used but just did not experience these results for myself. I read the reviews and I guess celebrities love this and famous makeup artists use this but I prefer hands down DHC&#x27;s velvet skin coat. The smashbox is kind of greasy and I can feel it on my skin, the velvet skin coat blends in and leaves my skin&lt;br /&gt;feeling smooth and natural.</li>
            <li> Love the feel the softness and it  goes on smoothly and then you can put makeup right onto it...love it,</li>
            <li> Smashbox Photo Finish Primer is unparalleled. It smooths out skin, decreases redness, and creates a nice matte surface for foundation. Lots of oil control, too.</li>
            <li> I love this product it gives my skin a extra smooth feel. Only thing is that it&#x27;s so small. Need to get a larger size.</li>
