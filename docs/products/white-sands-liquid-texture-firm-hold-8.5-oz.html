            <li>The value was good buying it through Amazon and it came rather quickly even though it was not a prime product.</li>

            <li>I never tried this before and I like it better than the medium hold.</li>

            <li>I love the texture it adds to my fine hair</li>
            <li>Combs out easily.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, this will save your life.</li>
            <li>Light.</li>
            <li>Received as promised and was packed securely.</li>
            <li>But be warned - this stuff will hold your hair in place during a rain storm, but when you need to comb it out, it&#x27;s like a fine layer of super glue has been applied to your head.  </li>
            <li>I have been an avid user for more than 5 years.</li>
            <li>I first learned of it through a previous salon owner who said it was THE best product she&#x27;s ever used or recommended in her years as a shop owner.  </li>
            <li>Product is great for fine limp hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this five stars for super hold.  </li>
            <li>Best product yet for my thick straight hair!</li>
            <li>combs right through and out when you want to .  </li>
            <li>and you only need to use it once - the following day you can refresh your hair with the dryer and it will look great.  </li>
            <li>and I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>It delivers on adding soft body to my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have used Liquid Texture for several years and I love it.  </li>
            <li>stuff does absolute wonders on your hair!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this ever since it first came out and have never even considered changing.</li>
            <li>Love all of the White Sands products!</li>
            <li>This stuff is really great when you need a long lasting hair spray product.</li>
            <li>Great product - one of the few that doesn&#x27;t weight down fine hair!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I was very disaapointed with this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for several years after trying many other hair spray styling products White Sands is by far superior</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and am always reluctant to use any styling products, as they weight my hair down.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my wet hair and scrunch to give my naturally curly hair more oomph on certain days.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough positives about this product and ALL the White Sands products since I have used most of them.</li>
            <li>Liked it the first few times.........then stopped working the same!</li>
            <li>I have always had fine hair but as I have aged to 66yrs</li>
            <li>This will take your hair from little style to an over the top style and stay all day.</li>
            <li>I buy mine straight from the company/manufacturer and get the large refill bottle because I use this almost daily.</li>
            <li>I first started using White Sands Liquid Texture while living in Hawaii.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in this product that creates the magic, but whatever it is...</li>
            <li>I love White Sands sprays, but I&#x27;ve gone down to medium hold to make it easier to comb it out.</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair and use a curling iron everyday for volume and curl.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is a must have for styles that need to last the whole day.</li>
            <li>On the days I want to go straight as a board, I use this just at the crown to give it a little body right there.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;ve used cheap hairsprays in the past my hair feels &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; but with this it just feels thicker and soft.  </li>
            <li>Very much what I expected!</li>
            <li>watch how much you use - too much and it will make your hair stiff...</li>
            <li>I blow dry them down and then spray them with this magical potion and then blow dry them to the side.  </li>
            <li>White Sands is like a instant professional stylist showed up at your mirror!  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much build-up oils in my hair as much as other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Quality and worth every cent since a little product goes a long way.</li>

            <li> Finish with some White Sands Hair spray and they stay all day long.  </li>
            <li> It has given my old-fashioned stiff hairstyle new life.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heavier spray, not great for my fine hair, soI use it for a little lift only once in a while</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for people with hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li> Then I blow dry.</li>
            <li> I spray on, let it dry and use the curling iron.  </li>
            <li> The Liquid Texture (Medium or Firm) gives the hair just enough body so that you can style it with the blow dryer and/or flat iron</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this left my hair very sticky and DID NOT HOLD as it advertised it would.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my wet hair in place of mousse.</li>
            <li> This was the essential spray I was missing.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money and made my hair feel gritty.</li>
            <li> I used on wet hair, then blew dry and ended up w/ shapeless stiff hair.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair about every other day</li>
            <li> It is heat activated so if you want a little bump at your crown, spritz and hold the dryer (with a diffuser) to that area for a few seconds</li>
            <li> A hairdresser introduced me to this product a few years ago.</li>
            <li> It has a firm hold, yet you can comb through it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m past my window to return, so I&#x27;m stuck with it.  </li>
            <li> You can use it as a styling spray or a setting spray, very firm hold but not crunchy and no build up or flaking.</li>
            <li> use it before drying my hair and then spritz some on the dry  roots before I start to style with flat iron or curling iron....not even a little bit sticky!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Does not give your hair that hard look and feel.</li>
            <li> The liquid texture also doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or dull.  </li>
            <li> Though costly, I reserve it for when I go out, and save my less expensive sprays for whenever I&#x27;m doing errands, around the house, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean this!  </li>
            <li> and it can look bad sometimes</li>
    </ol>

            <li> A hairdresser introduced me to this product a few years ago. I love it. Gives my hair ots of bounce and body. Product arrived quickly and price was fair. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Great for styling hair.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and a good price through Amazon.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this spray!!! It has given my old-fashioned stiff hairstyle new life.  My hair moves and swings while still holding the style.  When I&#x27;ve used cheap hairsprays in the past my hair feels &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; but with this it just feels thicker and soft.  I love the texture it adds to my fine hair also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve started using this I&#x27;ve received many compliments on my hair.  (They weren&#x27;t coming before I started using it.)  I gave my Mom 1/2 a bottle to try and now she can&#x27;t be without it either.  We always order enough to have a spare so we are never left without it.</li>
            <li> This hair spray is the best!! It has a firm hold, yet you can comb through it. This price is the best I have ever found. I am very happy with this item.</li>
            <li> It works great with curling iron, curls stay for days. Best product yet for my thick straight hair!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product while on a vacation.  It does a GREAT job of holding my fine textured hair in place without being sticky.  I do recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I never tried this before and I like it better than the medium hold.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this is the very best Liquid Texture I have ever found. I have and will continue to recommend it.  Thank you for offering this product on Amazon.  Marianne Caldwell</li>
            <li> Takes away the frizzies, separates and gives my hair height and texture.  Moved from Florida to Colorado and the only place I could find it was on Amazon.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have used Liquid Texture for several years and I love it.  My hair is very fine and soft - Liquid Texture makes an incredible difference in adding body to my hair.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair and use a curling iron everyday for volume and curl.  This stuff is amazing.  It keeps my hair curly all day.  I would suggest using a good curling iron as well.  Sally&#x27;s has a great curling iron called Hot Shots that works amazingly.</li>
            <li> I first started using White Sands Liquid Texture while living in Hawaii.  It works great, holds wonderful and gives a nice shine.  I have recently moved to the mainland midwest and I just can&#x27;t be without this product.  So grateful that I found it on Amazon because non of the salons in the Minneapolis area seem to carry White Sands products.</li>
            <li> Best product ever, period, end of story!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now.  Years.  I first learned of it through a previous salon owner who said it was THE best product she&#x27;s ever used or recommended in her years as a shop owner.  That being said, of course, I went home with a bottle.  And yes...I have to say that it&#x27;s my very favorite hair product I&#x27;ve ever used as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does absolute wonders on your hair!  No matter how your hair looks...and it can look bad sometimes :^D  White Sands can work miracles!  It&#x27;s like gold!  Though costly, I reserve it for when I go out, and save my less expensive sprays for whenever I&#x27;m doing errands, around the house, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On those days when your styling has gone awry...White Sands is like a instant professional stylist showed up at your mirror!  I mean this!  I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in this product that creates the magic, but whatever it is...I&#x27;m a fan until the end of time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White Sands Liquid Texture.  Don&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this ever since it first came out and have never even considered changing. If you have fine hair, this will save your life. There is a learning curve though. I use this on my wet hair in place of mousse. Then I blow dry. Then I use the aerosal made by White Sands to spray the roots and lift the hair. Then I finish styling with the Liquid Texture. It&#x27;s almost like having hair like everyone else and it stays put without feeling yucky.</li>
            <li> I have always had fine hair but as I have aged to 66yrs it is now thinning as well.  this a great product for very fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;I use it before drying my hair and then spritz some on the dry  roots before I start to style with flat iron or curling iron....not even a little bit sticky!!!!!!  combs right through and out when you want to .  I have been using it for 9 months now and don&#x27;t intend to change product any time soon.</li>
            <li> I  love this product, I have been using this product for years.  I would recommend this product to everyone.  I will definitely order this product again</li>
            <li> I love this product! It gives me control, volume, and shine. I have used this product before. Very much what I expected!</li>
            <li> Great for fine, straight hair.  I spray on, let it dry and use the curling iron.  The curl stays in all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this five stars for super hold.  But be warned - this stuff will hold your hair in place during a rain storm, but when you need to comb it out, it&#x27;s like a fine layer of super glue has been applied to your head.  It does comb out without feeling sticky, but you can pull your hair out while getting the spray out.  I love White Sands sprays, but I&#x27;ve gone down to medium hold to make it easier to comb it out.</li>
            <li> watch how much you use - too much and it will make your hair stiff... otherwise - good.</li>
            <li> I love this product ! I have used it for several years after trying many other hair spray styling products White Sands is by far superior it has a wonderful style  memory without dulling or drying out my colored hair</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the best hair care products I have ever used. I have been an avid user for more than 5 years. Light. Combs out easily. Does not give your hair that hard look and feel. Perhaps one of the best products I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This is the MOST AMAZING hair product available. I buy mine straight from the company/manufacturer and get the large refill bottle because I use this almost daily. If you want to create a style that will last ALL day, this is the product to have in your regiment. It is heat activated so if you want a little bump at your crown, spritz and hold the dryer (with a diffuser) to that area for a few seconds and there it stays. This will take your hair from little style to an over the top style and stay all day. I use it on my wet hair and scrunch to give my naturally curly hair more oomph on certain days. On the days I want to go straight as a board, I use this just at the crown to give it a little body right there. I can&#x27;t say enough positives about this product and ALL the White Sands products since I have used most of them. Quality and worth every cent since a little product goes a long way. Smells delish too. :)</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Holds great!!</li>
            <li> This is a product I use all the time and I like it very much.  The value was good buying it through Amazon and it came rather quickly even though it was not a prime product.</li>
            <li> Received as promised and was packed securely.I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I just finished using this product. I am very happy with the results. It delivers on adding soft body to my fine hair. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this spray! Excellent for updo styles</li>
            <li> Liked it the first few times.........then stopped working the same!</li>
            <li> Product is great for fine limp hair.  Adds alot of body and shine.  I highly recommend this product for people with hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Holds curls!!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff for styling your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heavier spray, not great for my fine hair, soI use it for a little lift only once in a while</li>
            <li> Love all of the White Sands products! This one give me just enough lift and hold to my hair .</li>
            <li> This stuff is a must have for styles that need to last the whole day. You can use it as a styling spray or a setting spray, very firm hold but not crunchy and no build up or flaking.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great when you need a long lasting hair spray product.</li>
            <li> great product and price</li>
            <li> I bought this for my side swept bangs that despite my best efforts, never stay where I put them.  This was the essential spray I was missing.  I blow dry them down and then spray them with this magical potion and then blow dry them to the side.  Finish with some White Sands Hair spray and they stay all day long.  The liquid texture also doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or dull.  I usually wash my hair about every other day and I wake up the next morning and my bangs still look great.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and am always reluctant to use any styling products, as they weight my hair down.  My hairdresser introduced me to White Sands years ago, and I found this is actually a product I can use.  The Liquid Texture (Medium or Firm) gives the hair just enough body so that you can style it with the blow dryer and/or flat iron and you only need to use it once - the following day you can refresh your hair with the dryer and it will look great.  Great product - one of the few that doesn&#x27;t weight down fine hair!</li>
            <li> I spray this on before blow drying and styling. It helps add some body and thickness so my jaw-length hair isn&#x27;t wilty. Doesn&#x27;t take a lot. The 8.5 oz bottle will last for several months. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much build-up oils in my hair as much as other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give me texture. I used on wet hair, then blew dry and ended up w/ shapeless stiff hair.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and made my hair feel gritty.</li>
            <li> Love this spray. it is really good for styling &amp; holds well. Gives my hair a lot of extra texture.</li>
            <li> I was very disaapointed with this hairspray.  After reading the reviews, I thought that this might finally be the hairspray I was looking for.  Unfortunately, this left my hair very sticky and DID NOT HOLD as it advertised it would.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;m past my window to return, so I&#x27;m stuck with it.  Would not purchase again.</li>
