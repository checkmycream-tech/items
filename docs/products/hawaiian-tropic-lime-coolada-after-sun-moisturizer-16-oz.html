            <li>So far, I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li>Smells nice when you first but on, but gone in minutes.</li>
            <li>It is a great after sun or daily moisturizer.  </li>

            <li>It is amazing after sun lotion, really helps your tan sink in and stay.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh scent of this moisturizing lotion.  </li>

            <li>This lotion is great because it continues to make your skin feel silky and moisturized the entire day!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fit person with an athletic body type</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like many lotions seem too make you sticky when you get hot.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and thickness of it so much that I use it throughout the winter too!</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>When the original beige creme disappeared from store shelves, I was devastated.  </li>
            <li>Great moisturizer love the scent, I use it year round.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only sold locally during the warm seasons, so getting it online was great.</li>
            <li>I like the lotion but have to mention that it does have a stronger smell than anticipated - not a bad smell, just stronger.  </li>
            <li>I purchased my first bottle on vacation in the Bahamas ($19.00 at the resort!</li>
            <li>A great moisturizer, I use it year round.</li>
            <li>I have fair to medium skin, I&#x27;m in my mid fifties and don&#x27;t spend much time in the sun anymore.</li>
            <li>I am just glad that I had one plunger assembly from an old bottle to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For what its worth, I&#x27;m a man.  </li>
            <li>wish they would make it with more natural products.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to use on my face and my face breakouts with any kind of moisture.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent (takes me back to the tropics!)</li>
            <li>Reminds me of Kauai where I first bought this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it but definitely not for the &amp;#34;fragrance-free&amp;#34; set!</li>
            <li>I used almost a quarter of the bottle the first day.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and if I happen to get too much sun and burn, whether its just a little burn or very burnt, this lotion saves me every time.</li>
            <li>This a great lotion to use year round for general use, not just after sun.  </li>
            <li>I kept applying it over and over, large amounts and my skin kept taking it in.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t use alot because I was large.</li>
            <li>However now, I find that the whole family is using it.  </li>
            <li>It really softens the skin.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and hope it&#x27;s available for years to come.</li>
            <li>Smells glorious and really reduces burn.</li>
            <li>My skin was thirsty, very thirsty.</li>
            <li>and it is not irritating to my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>Like this one thick but not too thick smells good like the scent and feels good when on.</li>
            <li>The bright green of the bottle is what stopped me when I first saw this at a local mass-market retailer.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and smoothness of this lotion so much that we use it all year round, not just after being in the sun.</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a gross, sticky residue, and while I&#x27;m ordinarily sensitive to fragrances, this one doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>Amazing and hard to find.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much I will use it year round!</li>
            <li>The three pack was a good price, HOWEVER, EVERY BOTTLE&#x27;S PLUNGER ASSEMBLY WAS BROKEN UPON RECEIPT.  </li>
            <li>You see, I simply didn&#x27;t want the smell, though pleasant enough, of the green creme.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t become greasy until the last application where it took my skin longer to absorb because by then it was pretty hydrated.</li>
            <li>The lotion really helps to keep your skin soft and not dry.  </li>
            <li>however if you walk around with this aloe caked on you all day, dont be surprised if you smell beachy.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Bought this and a few other Hawaiian tropic products and as expected they were great.  </li>
            <li>When this first bottle was almost empty he asked me to see if I could find another one for him.  </li>
            <li>It really helps those &amp;#34;old guy&amp;#34; dry areas.</li>
            <li>I passed on actually purchasing it at the moment since I have a habit of buying lotions and then never using them, but I looked up the product on Amazon when I got home later that day, read the positive reviews, and wound up going back to the store and buying a bottle.</li>
            <li>I have a problem with applying lotion daily since I find it tedious and haven&#x27;t found one that I particularly like, but I actually enjoy putting this on every night!</li>
            <li>He used it daily to help with his dry skin, particularly on his face.  </li>
            <li>The scent reminds me a tropical vacation and the lotion keeps my skin hydrated and soft all day long.</li>
            <li>and I will peel a whole lot less than I would have without the lotion.</li>

            <li> My skin was thirsty, very thirsty.</li>
            <li> and it is not irritating to my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> Like this one thick but not too thick smells good like the scent and feels good when on.</li>
            <li> The bright green of the bottle is what stopped me when I first saw this at a local mass-market retailer.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and smoothness of this lotion so much that we use it all year round, not just after being in the sun.</li>
            <li> The lotion goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a gross, sticky residue, and while I&#x27;m ordinarily sensitive to fragrances, this one doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Amazing and hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much I will use it year round!</li>
            <li> The three pack was a good price, HOWEVER, EVERY BOTTLE&#x27;S PLUNGER ASSEMBLY WAS BROKEN UPON RECEIPT.  </li>
            <li> You see, I simply didn&#x27;t want the smell, though pleasant enough, of the green creme.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t become greasy until the last application where it took my skin longer to absorb because by then it was pretty hydrated.</li>
            <li> The lotion really helps to keep your skin soft and not dry.  </li>
            <li> however if you walk around with this aloe caked on you all day, dont be surprised if you smell beachy.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Bought this and a few other Hawaiian tropic products and as expected they were great.  </li>
            <li> When this first bottle was almost empty he asked me to see if I could find another one for him.  </li>
            <li> It really helps those &amp;#34;old guy&amp;#34; dry areas.</li>
            <li> I passed on actually purchasing it at the moment since I have a habit of buying lotions and then never using them, but I looked up the product on Amazon when I got home later that day, read the positive reviews, and wound up going back to the store and buying a bottle.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with applying lotion daily since I find it tedious and haven&#x27;t found one that I particularly like, but I actually enjoy putting this on every night!</li>
            <li> He used it daily to help with his dry skin, particularly on his face.  </li>
            <li> The scent reminds me a tropical vacation and the lotion keeps my skin hydrated and soft all day long.</li>
            <li> and I will peel a whole lot less than I would have without the lotion.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for year round use.</li>
            <li> Last a long time even though I use a lot.</li>
            <li> but I use it as an everyday body moisturizer &amp; it keeps my skin extremely soft &amp; supple!</li>
            <li> Does not burn when applied like some of the others after a long day in the sun.</li>
            <li> Plus, I tend to have sensitive skin (not super sensitive where I have to avoid all fragrance, but just where I have to be careful its not too harsh)</li>
            <li> My skin is a bit dry</li>
            <li> This stuff works at least as well as the old stuff;</li>
            <li> It goes on wet and stays that way and</li>
            <li> He said it was one of the only lotions he&#x27;s used over they years that didn&#x27;t make his face break out or his eyes water, and never felt sticky or heavy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick lotion (nearly cream).  </li>
            <li> I use it every day, especially now that I&#x27;m past 65.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough that it doesn&#x27;t make me feel sick or give me a headache, and it fades away after a little while (or maybe it lingers</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and these cold winter months play havoc on my skin, but I have found using this lotion on a daily basis makes my skin soft, moisturized and supple.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have the typical smell of the after sun lotions.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> I use this lotion year round.</li>
            <li> I use it all year round.</li>
            <li> This year had trouble finding it anywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as a skin cream for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> We use it year round.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this on his face year round.</li>
            <li> Went on my first cruise from NY to the Bahamas in October and was concerned about getting a painful sunburn and a ruined vacation.</li>
            <li> If my burn is pretty bad I will keep applying, GENEROUSLY, at least 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> I use it all year round!</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in my area and my daughter</li>
            <li> I have used this for at least 10 years... not greasy, does not absorb and go away.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that thick</li>
            <li> I am giving this a lower rating, not because of the lotion, but because of the broken plunger assemblies.</li>
            <li> I whined, I ranted, I wrote the company - which, I&#x27;m sorry to say, wasn&#x27;t moved.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed, to say the least.  </li>
            <li> Greasy and smells bad what else is there to say?</li>
            <li> If I got burnt badly, then I still peel, however I NEVER peel off my color</li>
            <li> Also it is not too oily and freezing cold like those aloe gels which I HATE.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like many lotions seem too make you sticky when you get hot. Like this one thick but not too thick smells good like the scent and feels good when on. Ordered more and would recommend too a friend.</li>
            <li> Greasy and smells bad what else is there to say? It goes on wet and stays that way and the smell  is over powering.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders for sunburns and isn&#x27;t greasy. Hard to find in stores so I got extras here. Fantastico!</li>
            <li> Hawaiian Tropic came out with the best moisturizing lotion on the market. I used to purchase Banana Boat after-sun lotion, but from now on it Hawaiian Tropic lime coolada. This one feels better on your skin. My husband and son love it as well. Great job Hawaiian Tropics!!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion works miracles. I am fair skinned and if I happen to get too much sun and burn, whether its just a little burn or very burnt, this lotion saves me every time. If I got burnt badly, then I still peel, however I NEVER peel off my color and I will peel a whole lot less than I would have without the lotion. TO do this I apply after getting sun generously and everywhere. If my burn is pretty bad I will keep applying, GENEROUSLY, at least 3 times a day. Works perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very nice, I&#x27;m a guy so I dont want to smell like a girl but there is nothing feminine about this smell. however if you walk around with this aloe caked on you all day, dont be surprised if you smell beachy. Last a long time even though I use a lot. Also it is not too oily and freezing cold like those aloe gels which I HATE. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now.  It is a great after sun or daily moisturizer.  I am a redhead and it is great for my skin after a day at the beach.  It truly helps my skin hold my tan in the summer months and prevents my skin from pealing. I swear by this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and smells amazing!  Not too greasy.  Great for after sun lotion leaving skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Soothing lotion with pleasant fragrance. I will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> At the beginning of summer my husband picked up a bottle of this after-sun lotion at a local drug store.  He used it daily to help with his dry skin, particularly on his face.  He said it was one of the only lotions he&#x27;s used over they years that didn&#x27;t make his face break out or his eyes water, and never felt sticky or heavy.  When this first bottle was almost empty he asked me to see if I could find another one for him.  Of course we&#x27;d never find it at this time of year because it was a summer product and stores did not stock it during the winter so I searched Amazon and found it there.  Since he uses it daily I order the 3-pack so he&#x27;d always have it available.  However now, I find that the whole family is using it.  Probably because the scent (Lime Coolada) is really refreshing and reminds everyone of summer!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Smells great and soothes your skin after a day of being in the sun.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic lotion!!  I purchased my first bottle on vacation in the Bahamas ($19.00 at the resort! Ouch!).  So happy to find it on Amazon for 1/3 the resort price.  I love the scent (takes me back to the tropics!) and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.  Great moisturizer!  It&#x27;s a thick lotion (nearly cream).  I buy it using the \\&quot;Subscribe and Save\\&quot; program -- so I&#x27;m always well-stocked!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion so much. It is amazing after sun lotion, really helps your tan sink in and stay. I love the smell and thickness of it so much that I use it throughout the winter too!</li>
            <li> This may be after sun lotion but I use it as an everyday body moisturizer &amp; it keeps my skin extremely soft &amp; supple!</li>
            <li> This is some great after sun lotion.</li>
            <li> Great lotion and great scent. Reminds me of Kauai where I first bought this.</li>
            <li> Perfect for after sunburn or just sunbathing. I have fair to medium skin, I&#x27;m in my mid fifties and don&#x27;t spend much time in the sun anymore. But from my teen years on I have used Hawaiian Tropic after sun products. Went on my first cruise from NY to the Bahamas in October and was concerned about getting a painful sunburn and a ruined vacation. Bought this and a few other Hawaiian tropic products and as expected they were great.  After coming in from sun bathing, shower and apply liberally. Not only will this soak into your skin and help the healing of the burn, use it after every shower and your tan will last longer. Also kept me from flaking and peeling.  Their products are the best.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have always liked this lotion for after sun for my family but now I have begun using it as my daily lotion foot my self.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion year round. I love the clean smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for sunburns, it also helps you keep your tan , haven&#x27;t found anything that works as well..</li>
            <li> Best lotion!!!!!!!!!  It really softens the skin.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh scent of this moisturizing lotion.  I have used it for many years and appreciate the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and smoothness of this lotion so much that we use it all year round, not just after being in the sun.</li>
            <li> Best after sun lotion I have ever used and the scent is fantastic. I love it so much I will use it year round!</li>
            <li> This is a Great Product. I have used this product for several years and hope it&#x27;s available for years to come.</li>
            <li> My wife has never looked this good after tanning as when she is using Hawaiian Tropic Lime Coolada After Sun Moisturizing Lotion.</li>
            <li> The best after sun product. I use it all year round.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent year round moisturizer. Discovered it several years ago but could only find it in the summer. This year had trouble finding it anywhere. So happy to discover it on Amazon!  Now I can have it delivered &amp; not have to worry about finding it.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizing lotion, not just for after sun, but for all year long. I have very dry skin and these cold winter months play havoc on my skin, but I have found using this lotion on a daily basis makes my skin soft, moisturized and supple. I highly recommend it for year round use.</li>
            <li> The best after sun lotion in the market!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It&#x27;s hard to find in my area and my daughter and I love it for the summer after tanning. It smells so good, like summer and it hydrates well.</li>
            <li> Found it in Maui and have been buying it since!  LOVE IT!  Great smell,</li>
            <li> Favorite after sun lotion. Smells glorious and really reduces burn. I have been using this product for over 8 years now. Well worth it!</li>
            <li> I have always liked Hawaiian Tropics stuff.  I like the lotion but have to mention that it does have a stronger smell than anticipated - not a bad smell, just stronger.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it but definitely not for the &amp;#34;fragrance-free&amp;#34; set!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells wonderful and moisturizes with great success!</li>
            <li> The scent reminds me a tropical vacation and the lotion keeps my skin hydrated and soft all day long. I&#x27;ve even use it as an eye cream to soften the lines around my eyes. You can always depend on Hawaiian Tropic to deliver great products!</li>
            <li> A great moisturizer, I use it year round.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin nice and smooth. Awesome smell too !!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is my very favorite, and I will continue to order it.  The three pack was a good price, HOWEVER, EVERY BOTTLE&#x27;S PLUNGER ASSEMBLY WAS BROKEN UPON RECEIPT.  I was extremely disappointed, to say the least.  I am just glad that I had one plunger assembly from an old bottle to use.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this is because of the three pack, or the shipping.  I know now to keep a spare plunger assembly when ordering this lotion.  I am giving this a lower rating, not because of the lotion, but because of the broken plunger assemblies.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great because it continues to make your skin feel silky and moisturized the entire day!  It also doesn&#x27;t have the typical smell of the after sun lotions.  It&#x27;s a very light lime and cucumber scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  GREAT PRICE TOO!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!!  I have been buying it for years.  It is gentle enough to use on my face and my face breakouts with any kind of moisture.  The lotion really helps to keep your skin soft and not dry.  I buy it in a three pack on subscribe and save and it saves a lot of money.  It is not in the stores during the summer, but now I never run out!! The smell is amazing too. LOVE this stuff!!</li>
            <li> The bright green of the bottle is what stopped me when I first saw this at a local mass-market retailer. I stopped and took a whiff of the scent and was hooked...it&#x27;s got a nice lime-coconut smell that isn&#x27;t overly sweet. I passed on actually purchasing it at the moment since I have a habit of buying lotions and then never using them, but I looked up the product on Amazon when I got home later that day, read the positive reviews, and wound up going back to the store and buying a bottle. So far, I&#x27;m loving it! I know it says it&#x27;s an after sun lotion, but I&#x27;ve been using it on a daily basis. The lotion goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a gross, sticky residue, and while I&#x27;m ordinarily sensitive to fragrances, this one doesn&#x27;t bother me. It&#x27;s light enough that it doesn&#x27;t make me feel sick or give me a headache, and it fades away after a little while (or maybe it lingers and I&#x27;ve just gotten used to it so it doesn&#x27;t bother me). I have a problem with applying lotion daily since I find it tedious and haven&#x27;t found one that I particularly like, but I actually enjoy putting this on every night! I&#x27;m glad that I was able to find this product on Amazon since I hope to continue using this through the winter months, at which time I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll no longer be in stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I used a tanning bed and received a burn from doing so. I burn easily so it wasn&#x27;t a surprise. I needed something with aloe and my skin hurt against clothing. I used almost a quarter of the bottle the first day. My skin was thirsty, very thirsty. I kept applying it over and over, large amounts and my skin kept taking it in. I&#x27;m a fit person with an athletic body type so I didn&#x27;t use alot because I was large. It didn&#x27;t become greasy until the last application where it took my skin longer to absorb because by then it was pretty hydrated. I don&#x27;t agree with the smell, i prefer unscented lotion myself. My skin doesn&#x27;t hurt after using it and it likes it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as a skin cream for a few years now.  My skin is a bit dry so I always put cream on my face, arms and legs after a shower.  It provides good moisturizing without feeling greasy and has a mild smell that I often get compliments on.  For what its worth, I&#x27;m a man.  The smell is pleasant without smelling like perfume.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend LOVES this stuff. It&#x27;s only sold locally during the warm seasons, so getting it online was great. Bought 3 of them so we don&#x27;t run out before summer comes.</li>
            <li> I have used this for at least 10 years... not greasy, does not absorb and go away.  I have started about 8 people using this! Smells nice when you first but on, but gone in minutes. Doesn&#x27;t clash with perfumes...I have psoriasis and this is good on that as well.  My favorite lotion ever!</li>
            <li> The best. We use it year round. Just wish there was an easier way to get the last amount out of the bottle. It&#x27;s that thick but I guess that&#x27;s a good thing!</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels so good on the skin, very refreshing and moisturizing! Just absolutely love it! Every year I buy a bottle! The best ever!</li>
            <li> love how it works. only downfall is it is a petroleum product. wish they would make it with more natural products.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this on his face year round. We always have to stock up for the winter because it gets pulled off the shelves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hawaiian Tropic After Sun since it debuted back in &#x27;69 or &#x27;70 or so.  Nothing beats it for moisturizing the skin after exposure to the sun. When the original beige creme disappeared from store shelves, I was devastated.  I whined, I ranted, I wrote the company - which, I&#x27;m sorry to say, wasn&#x27;t moved.  You see, I simply didn&#x27;t want the smell, though pleasant enough, of the green creme.  (I still can&#x27;t believe Hawaiian Tropic didn&#x27;t fawn all over themselves to cater to me!)  Anyway...This stuff works at least as well as the old stuff; what bugs me now is the seasonal availability up her in the Mid-Atlantic.  Voil&amp;agrave;!  Amazon to the rescue.  I use it every day, especially now that I&#x27;m past 65.  It really helps those &amp;#34;old guy&amp;#34; dry areas.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer love the scent, I use it year round.</li>
            <li> Best after Sun lotion on market. Smells great and prevents dryness from Sun exposure. On 3rd bottle!! Summer staple for after beach day shower.</li>
            <li> Amazing and hard to find.  This cream is great in Summer for sun burns. The only cream I use. Wow.</li>
            <li> Seasonal in the stores so glad I found it here. Does not burn when applied like some of the others after a long day in the sun.</li>
            <li> Best all around lotion for everything.</li>
            <li> The best , I am still using it after a year ! Very smooth for my skin!</li>
            <li> best lotion out there for the money.</li>
            <li> My entire family - daughters, grandchildren, friends - loves this lotion.  Just the smell takes you away to an exotic island and it&#x27;s perfect to slather all over after getting out of the pool.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  Best way to hydrate your skin after a long day in the sun.  Love the scent as well.  I use it all year round!</li>
            <li> This a great lotion to use year round for general use, not just after sun.  Its very moisturizing and smells great too!  Plus, I tend to have sensitive skin (not super sensitive where I have to avoid all fragrance, but just where I have to be careful its not too harsh) and it is not irritating to my skin at all.  Love it!!!</li>
