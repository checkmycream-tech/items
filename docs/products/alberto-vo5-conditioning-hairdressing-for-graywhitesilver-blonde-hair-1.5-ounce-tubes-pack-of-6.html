            <li>soo happy to find silver alberto VO5  </li>

            <li>Even in the winter when I wear a hat my hair looks great.     </li>
            <li>Talk with Walgreens, Albertsons, Duane Reade, CVS.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ve got a great product.</li>
            <li>Now it stays put and looks great without any hairspray.</li>
            <li>great service and product I will re order it writhing two month</li>
            <li>great.</li>
            <li>Good price and great service.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and is lightweight too.</li>
            <li>Without being too greasy, it provides good hair management.</li>
            <li>My husand has loved this product; it adds body and a nice shine.</li>
            <li>This product combats this amazingly.</li>
            <li>Then kind of work it through the rest of your hair.</li>
            <li>The nice thing about the VO5 hairdressing is that it has a purple color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve reverted to the products popular in my youth:</li>
            <li>I use and my barber always remarks how nice my hair looks.</li>
            <li>I get enthusiastic compliments about how shiny my hair is, even from strangers.</li>
            <li>so far that is the best product I have tried.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t notice the purple shade even on very light hair.</li>
            <li>pricing is super good</li>
            <li>I squeeze a pea-sized amount of VO5 hairdressing into my palms, rub them together, then smooth over my hair (be sure to get the ends to get rid of static!).</li>
            <li>Hair dye made my hair more brittle and burned my scalp, so I quit dying my hair.</li>
            <li>I now own 12 tubes of this godsend product since it was free shipping</li>
            <li>wreaks havoc on my hair and no matter how healthy and moisturized it is - it gets frizzy.</li>
            <li>product seems to work ok.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products and none could top this product.  </li>
            <li>and now I love it.</li>
            <li>but I find that VO5 has the most disagreeable smell so that I have eliminated it from the hunt.</li>
            <li>a user for many years and always satisfied  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>So glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, been using for over 30 years</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it because it made all of my hair softer, healthier and easier to manage.  </li>
            <li>Excelent product, my mother used many time and have always been satisfied with the finish it provides.</li>
            <li>compares.&lt;br /&gt;Purchasing experience could not have been better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>As I have gotten older my hair has thinned out and lost it&#x27;s body so that I get \\&quot;fly away\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li>This is inexpensive, easily available in most drugstores and discount stores (but Amazon has the best price), and will last for ages.</li>
            <li>Something with wide bristle is best.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair a great, natural looking shine.</li>
            <li>A great old time product that has been around since before my hair went silver.</li>
            <li>BUT it is rather strong, and it doesn&#x27;t go away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>when my hair is highlighted (it works like Shimmer Lights shampoo by fighting brassiness), but either type is fine.</li>
            <li>Your hair will look really great the first day, but the real payoff is day two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wish I could find the VO5 hairdressing for Fine Hair.  </li>
            <li>Use it lightly.  </li>
            <li>Use a light touch.</li>
            <li>Smooth, shiny, no frizz hair all day.</li>
            <li>This stuff really is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Comb or brush lightly and see your hair light up like a Hollywood star.  </li>
            <li>I learned to buy it in bulk to get the best price as its not &#x27;cheap&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>This product gives my gray/silver hair a bright and soft look.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s some tricks that I have come up with over the years to have beautiful grey hair.</li>
            <li>I was excited to see the delivery and put a 1/16th inch strip of \\&quot;hairdressing\\&quot; in my palms and run it through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A great product for the guys with gray hair that would like to look a little better than they do now.</li>
            <li>This version of VO5 enhances the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; of the gray and seems to also make the remaining brown dark appear healthy and bright.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be mislead by the older reputation this product has, this is a great product, especially for people with curls (whether fine or coarse) and any kind of unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s rare and their stock s always minimal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a magical, light hairdressing especially for the Silver Generation.  </li>
            <li>I love VO5 for my 70+ year old hair.  </li>
            <li>This product works even better if you apply some in your hair directly before and after washing it.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder-length blonde hair and this stuff is perfect when I dry my hair straight or flat-iron it.</li>
            <li>I use very little, about 1 /4&amp;#34;, and it works great.</li>
            <li>Grey hair looks shiny and nice</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to strong and cloying smells.</li>
            <li>After blowing my hair dry, that&#x27;s the way my salt and pepper hair looks--&amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;, until I rub into my finger tips, a dab of vo5 haiirdressing---it adds such a beautiful shine to my hair</li>
            <li>If you have a friend with white or graying hair, this makes a very nice present ... and you will be thanked a thousand times.</li>
            <li>I love Alberto V05 conditioning hairdressing because it is economical and it works better than more expensive products.  </li>
            <li>I like this product very much</li>
            <li>It actually makes my hair look healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I use only 1/4 inch, mix on my finger tips and then pull it through the top layers of hair.  </li>
            <li>you really want this product I recommend that you try a sample from walmart first; don&#x27;t have a problem with cloying odors, and don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
            <li>on much longer hair with great success - but only a little bit.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and gives body and shine to platinum white hair.</li>
            <li>I can find the VO5 conditioning hairdressing for Gray/White/Silver Blonde hair, and Normal/Dry Hair for about $4.00 a tube, but not the one for Fine Hair.</li>
            <li>it suits my particular type of haait and is not expensive to buy</li>
            <li>This product for silver hair is not always available at my local drug store ....</li>
            <li>One tiny bit of this rubbed in my hands and smoothed over the &#x27;canopy&#x27; of my style - shiny, smooth hair that looks like something out of a 40&#x27;s movie.</li>
            <li>We have been unable to find it in local stores so was happy to be able to get it online.</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>which I don&#x27;t much like because it feels sticky/gluey by comparison).  </li>
            <li>Thanks to this product</li>
            <li>Then I blow dried it and flat- ironed it, and it looked great.  </li>
            <li>and I figure I have enough of this stuff to last me many years.</li>
            <li>Flip your head back up and put whatever is left on the top layer of your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready for old age now!</li>
            <li>so I bought her a good supply as well and plan to give it to her when she comes to visit in late summer!  </li>
            <li>I have used this about a year and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I did see some on Amazon but for some reason it was priced way too high, somewhere around $18.00 a tube.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>VO5 does a great job keeping my unruly hair in place and adds a very small amount of oil or something similar to bend in the emerging gray hair.  </li>
            <li>Alberto VO5 (as my hair is now Grey), Brylcreem, Wildroot Creemoil and Groom &amp; Clean.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found much difference in the products as far as how well they hold</li>
            <li>Better to purchase a few tubes at a substantial savings.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time since you need so little at a time and it does a great job of giving life and shine to my now mostly white hair.  </li>
            <li>I should have picked that up first, and only lost 3.50 vs 19.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hard to find in many grocery stores and drug stores - CVS, Safeway, etc.  </li>
            <li>and when it is available, it is not cheap.  </li>
            <li>Fast forward to the present</li>
            <li>Think lilacs, over perfumed men or women, and old oily hair.  </li>
            <li>This smells like \\&quot;an old person\\&quot; to quote my husband.  </li>
            <li>I think it is like a mix of dying lilacs, and the head support cushions on an old persons recliner where the head has been rubbing for years.</li>
            <li>Not everyday.</li>
            <li>or just old stock ?</li>
            <li>Gotta keep it alive.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t speak to the usability but having been&lt;br /&gt;unable to find them at the small Walmart store that is available to us</li>
            <li>It makes my naturally curly gray hair manageable and soft, and --with an extra touch of olive oil-</li>
            <li>I have found no other hair dressing for men which comes even close.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not vain enough to use it just for looks, so I really appreciate that it controls occasional dandruff flakes on my shoulders, controls occasional cowlicks, and is useful for removing tape or sticker glue in addition to a bunch of other unintended uses you can find out about online.</li>
            <li>Next, put a pea size (seriously, don&#x27;t put in more) amount of VO5 hair dressing in your palm.</li>
            <li>It turns from blue to clear as you rub it between  your fingertips before applying.  </li>
            <li>My natural hair is brown with gray, white and silver around my face.</li>
            <li>lavender color is very light, and I doubt if it is actually brightening white hair, at least it is not adding to the yellow tint we are trying to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A tiny pea-sized dab of VO5 right out of the shower and my hair goes from dull gray to vibrant silver.  </li>
            <li>First blow dry your hair until its completely dry.</li>
            <li>If you put VO5 hair dressing in and just leave it, it can make your hair look a little greasy at first.</li>
            <li>Keep hair soft and manageable with just enough blue to keep your gray silver not yellow!</li>
            <li>The danger is to use too much which weighs the hair down.</li>
            <li>I am a 42 year old woman living in the dry, airy mountains of Colorado.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Alternatively, you can let your hair dry naturally, then put a pea size amount of hairdressing in your hair and sleep on it.</li>
            <li>I am a 50 year old African American male and I&#x27;ve used this product for 30 years starting back when my hair was only 2% gray.  </li>

            <li> This product for silver hair is not always available at my local drug store ....</li>
            <li> One tiny bit of this rubbed in my hands and smoothed over the &#x27;canopy&#x27; of my style - shiny, smooth hair that looks like something out of a 40&#x27;s movie.</li>
            <li> We have been unable to find it in local stores so was happy to be able to get it online.</li>
            <li> He really likes it.</li>
            <li> which I don&#x27;t much like because it feels sticky/gluey by comparison).  </li>
            <li> Thanks to this product</li>
            <li> Then I blow dried it and flat- ironed it, and it looked great.  </li>
            <li> and I figure I have enough of this stuff to last me many years.</li>
            <li> Flip your head back up and put whatever is left on the top layer of your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready for old age now!</li>
            <li> so I bought her a good supply as well and plan to give it to her when she comes to visit in late summer!  </li>
            <li> I have used this about a year and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I did see some on Amazon but for some reason it was priced way too high, somewhere around $18.00 a tube.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> VO5 does a great job keeping my unruly hair in place and adds a very small amount of oil or something similar to bend in the emerging gray hair.  </li>
            <li> Alberto VO5 (as my hair is now Grey), Brylcreem, Wildroot Creemoil and Groom &amp; Clean.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found much difference in the products as far as how well they hold</li>
            <li> Better to purchase a few tubes at a substantial savings.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time since you need so little at a time and it does a great job of giving life and shine to my now mostly white hair.  </li>
            <li> I should have picked that up first, and only lost 3.50 vs 19.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to find in many grocery stores and drug stores - CVS, Safeway, etc.  </li>
            <li> and when it is available, it is not cheap.  </li>
            <li> Fast forward to the present</li>
            <li> Think lilacs, over perfumed men or women, and old oily hair.  </li>
            <li> This smells like \\&quot;an old person\\&quot; to quote my husband.  </li>
            <li> I think it is like a mix of dying lilacs, and the head support cushions on an old persons recliner where the head has been rubbing for years.</li>
            <li> Not everyday.</li>
            <li> or just old stock ?</li>
            <li> Gotta keep it alive.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak to the usability but having been&lt;br /&gt;unable to find them at the small Walmart store that is available to us</li>
            <li> It makes my naturally curly gray hair manageable and soft, and --with an extra touch of olive oil-</li>
            <li> I have found no other hair dressing for men which comes even close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not vain enough to use it just for looks, so I really appreciate that it controls occasional dandruff flakes on my shoulders, controls occasional cowlicks, and is useful for removing tape or sticker glue in addition to a bunch of other unintended uses you can find out about online.</li>
            <li> Next, put a pea size (seriously, don&#x27;t put in more) amount of VO5 hair dressing in your palm.</li>
            <li> It turns from blue to clear as you rub it between  your fingertips before applying.  </li>
            <li> My natural hair is brown with gray, white and silver around my face.</li>
            <li> lavender color is very light, and I doubt if it is actually brightening white hair, at least it is not adding to the yellow tint we are trying to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A tiny pea-sized dab of VO5 right out of the shower and my hair goes from dull gray to vibrant silver.  </li>
            <li> First blow dry your hair until its completely dry.</li>
            <li> If you put VO5 hair dressing in and just leave it, it can make your hair look a little greasy at first.</li>
            <li> Keep hair soft and manageable with just enough blue to keep your gray silver not yellow!</li>
            <li> The danger is to use too much which weighs the hair down.</li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old woman living in the dry, airy mountains of Colorado.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Alternatively, you can let your hair dry naturally, then put a pea size amount of hairdressing in your hair and sleep on it.</li>
            <li> I am a 50 year old African American male and I&#x27;ve used this product for 30 years starting back when my hair was only 2% gray.  </li>
            <li> It is one of the only ones that does not turn silver hair a dirty white color, which many do.</li>
            <li> I researched and bought this product because not only does it make my hair glisten with shine, but it also has ingredients like biotin, panthenol and ascorbic acid (vitamin C) which helps to grow my hair long by providing elasticity.</li>
            <li> I recommend only washing grey hair once every two or three days.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere at health and beauty stores in my area and as far down as Miami Fl.  </li>
            <li> Now turn your head upside down and start putting a little on the roots first.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time--ever since my hair was salt and pepper.  </li>
            <li> is off by using a wide barrel curling iron to do just he bottom of each of my hair layers, rolling only halfway up.</li>
            <li> These can leave a yellowish color on grey hair.</li>
            <li> If your hair is grey use this</li>
            <li> It was not greasy (I have fine thin hair) or limp.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products and come back to this one.</li>
            <li> The brush out portion of styling once hair is dry</li>
            <li> Like putting a shine of oil on dry hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s naturally dry and that just causes breakage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else in it when I dry it, when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> Our hair is course and tends to dry now with age, but Silver V05 makes my gray hair sparkle with health.</li>
            <li> I used to have dry fly-away hair.</li>
            <li> A single tube lasts me forever</li>
            <li> I have used VO5 for silver hair exclusively because I now have white or silver hair which has little body, This product helps me manage my hair and it gives my hair a silver shine.</li>
            <li> Alberto VO5 hairdressing for grey hair is an exelent product, I have being using it for years, and I will keep using it, 100% recomended!!!</li>
            <li> and now I am often rolling my curls into pin curls or on sponge rollers in a wet set for vintage styles.</li>
            <li> The blowdrying sinks the hair dressing into your hair and spreads it out.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not exactly the consistency I expected ?</li>
            <li> (always wet!)</li>
            <li> The smell is extremely bothersome to me.</li>
            <li> It is made of mineral oil, and other stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 30 years - none other</li>
            <li> Now get a round brush and blow dry your hair while running the brush through.</li>
            <li> but it is really thick in the tube, so i can hardly squeeze it out; I hold the end under the hot water tap for a few seconds and that seems to help a lot.</li>
            <li> I have looked everywhere with no success.  </li>
            <li> I put it on after washing my hair while my hair was slightly damp.  </li>
            <li> The yellowing of gray hair is much less pronounced.</li>
            <li> It adds life to dull grey hair.</li>
            <li> It may take some experimenting to figure out how little to use, but err on the side of caution until you get the gist of it.</li>
            <li> Adds a little sheen to the hair witout being oily and heavy.</li>
            <li> Both myself and Mom have used it to nourish and tame stray hair.</li>
            <li> when i received this , it was a little hard when i opened it up to put on my hair.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I can articulate the smell.</li>
            <li> No more $20 teensy weensy pots of hair goo for me.</li>
            <li> I have found that it is hard to find</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find product so we order it.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man whose gray hair is dull and straw-like without this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a secret ingredient to my appearance eveyday for the past 20 years</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have been unable to find it locally</li>
            <li> My thin hair is also thicker after using this product.  </li>
            <li> am sorry I did.  </li>
            <li> It is sometimes difficult to get in stores.</li>
            <li> I did not notice this making my hair overly dirty either.    </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Just needed one tube, had to buy a bulk package of 6. should have just gone to a drugstore. Otherwise the product does what its suppose to.</li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old woman living in the dry, airy mountains of Colorado. Hair dye made my hair more brittle and burned my scalp, so I quit dying my hair. My natural hair is brown with gray, white and silver around my face. I researched and bought this product because not only does it make my hair glisten with shine, but it also has ingredients like biotin, panthenol and ascorbic acid (vitamin C) which helps to grow my hair long by providing elasticity. My thin hair is also thicker after using this product.  This violet conditioner actually took out the yellow in my white strands.  I now own 12 tubes of this godsend product since it was free shipping and I figure I have enough of this stuff to last me many years. I&#x27;m ready for old age now! Bring it on!</li>
            <li> Hard to find in many grocery stores and drug stores - CVS, Safeway, etc.  They have replaced it with more expensive products.  VO5 does a great job keeping my unruly hair in place and adds a very small amount of oil or something similar to bend in the emerging gray hair.  Buy the pack of 6 and save.</li>
            <li> This product for silver hair is not always available at my local drug store .... and when it is available, it is not cheap.  Better to purchase a few tubes at a substantial savings.  If you have a friend with white or graying hair, this makes a very nice present ... and you will be thanked a thousand times.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be mislead by the older reputation this product has, this is a great product, especially for people with curls (whether fine or coarse) and any kind of unmanageable hair. I&#x27;ve got shoulder length, baby-fine naturally spiraling, rope-like curls (3b/3c using the NaturalyCurly.com scale) and wet weather or humidity make them frizz as if I&#x27;d brushed them out. This product combats this amazingly. I used this years ago when I lived in the U.K. (always wet!) on much longer hair with great success - but only a little bit. Using a pencil eraser-sized dollop for mid-back length hair at the time made my CURLS shine. I did not notice this making my hair overly dirty either.    Fast forward to the present and now I am often rolling my curls into pin curls or on sponge rollers in a wet set for vintage styles. The brush out portion of styling once hair is dry wreaks havoc on my hair and no matter how healthy and moisturized it is - it gets frizzy. One tiny bit of this rubbed in my hands and smoothed over the &#x27;canopy&#x27; of my style - shiny, smooth hair that looks like something out of a 40&#x27;s movie. This is inexpensive, easily available in most drugstores and discount stores (but Amazon has the best price), and will last for ages. It may take some experimenting to figure out how little to use, but err on the side of caution until you get the gist of it. Smells good and is lightweight too. I use the silver version (come out of tube with a purple tint) when my hair is highlighted (it works like Shimmer Lights shampoo by fighting brassiness), but either type is fine. You won&#x27;t notice the purple shade even on very light hair.</li>
            <li> We have used this product for years.  We like the way it leaves your hair.  We have been unable to find it in local stores so was happy to be able to get it online.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time--ever since my hair was salt and pepper.  It lasts a long time since you need so little at a time and it does a great job of giving life and shine to my now mostly white hair.  I get a lot of compliments on my hair and this VO5 product is one of the reasons for that.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I just recently decided to let my silver grow out and shine.  I am always in the market for products that are wonderful with gray hair.  This is not one of them.  I was excited to see the delivery and put a 1/16th inch strip of \\&quot;hairdressing\\&quot; in my palms and run it through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry I did.  The smell is extremely bothersome to me. I am sensitive to strong and cloying smells. Think lilacs, over perfumed men or women, and old oily hair.  This smells like \\&quot;an old person\\&quot; to quote my husband.  It is made of mineral oil, and other stuff. I think it is like a mix of dying lilacs, and the head support cushions on an old persons recliner where the head has been rubbing for years. I am not sure I can articulate the smell. BUT it is rather strong, and it doesn&#x27;t go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product seems to work ok.  Like putting a shine of oil on dry hair. Use it lightly.  I wish my order was one tube, and not 6.  AFter I ordered, I did find this in the local wal mart.  I should have picked that up first, and only lost 3.50 vs 19.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lavender color is very light, and I doubt if it is actually brightening white hair, at least it is not adding to the yellow tint we are trying to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really want this product I recommend that you try a sample from walmart first; don&#x27;t have a problem with cloying odors, and don&#x27;t expect a miracle. Do use or try Clairol shimmer lights for gray hair shampoo if you want to see what a purple product can do to combat yellowing.  so far that is the best product I have tried. I have tried 4 different shampoos and conditioners for gray  hair.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s some tricks that I have come up with over the years to have beautiful grey hair. If you put VO5 hair dressing in and just leave it, it can make your hair look a little greasy at first. Here&#x27;s how I do it. First blow dry your hair until its completely dry. Next, put a pea size (seriously, don&#x27;t put in more) amount of VO5 hair dressing in your palm. Rub your hand together to spread it out. Now turn your head upside down and start putting a little on the roots first. Then kind of work it through the rest of your hair. Flip your head back up and put whatever is left on the top layer of your hair. Use a light touch. Now get a round brush and blow dry your hair while running the brush through. Something with wide bristle is best. The blowdrying sinks the hair dressing into your hair and spreads it out. I like to finish is off by using a wide barrel curling iron to do just he bottom of each of my hair layers, rolling only halfway up. Your hair will look really great the first day, but the real payoff is day two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternatively, you can let your hair dry naturally, then put a pea size amount of hairdressing in your hair and sleep on it. I recommend only washing grey hair once every two or three days. Not everyday. It&#x27;s naturally dry and that just causes breakage. Every now and then wash with a clarifying shampoo to get rid of any buildup and atmosphere contaminates. These can leave a yellowish color on grey hair. The nice thing about the VO5 hairdressing is that it has a purple color. It won&#x27;t make your hair purple, but purple helps counteract any yellow in the hair and makes it brighter.</li>
            <li> I love Alberto V05 conditioning hairdressing because it is economical and it works better than more expensive products.  It actually makes my hair look healthy and shiny.  I have tried many products and none could top this product.  I have found that it is hard to find and I hope they are not doing away with this product</li>
            <li> Grey hair looks shiny and nice</li>
            <li> soo happy to find silver alberto VO5  can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore and it&#x27;s great on my hair. very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled, this is not a hair product solely for the retiree set! I remember my grandmother using this when I was a kid and now I love it. For the record, I&#x27;m 31. I have shoulder-length blonde hair and this stuff is perfect when I dry my hair straight or flat-iron it. I don&#x27;t use anything else in it when I dry it, when I&#x27;m done I squeeze a pea-sized amount of VO5 hairdressing into my palms, rub them together, then smooth over my hair (be sure to get the ends to get rid of static!). Smooth, shiny, no frizz hair all day. Even in the winter when I wear a hat my hair looks great.     This stuff really is fabulous. A single tube lasts me forever and it&#x27;s so inexpensive! No more $20 teensy weensy pots of hair goo for me.</li>
            <li> I have used VO5 for silver hair exclusively because I now have white or silver hair which has little body, This product helps me manage my hair and it gives my hair a silver shine. I have found no other hair dressing for men which comes even close.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Easy to use and gives body and shine to platinum white hair. Best product in this category , have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown gray/white prematurely and I just thought to look up hair care for gray hair.  I ran across this and remembered that my mother used to put the regularly VO5 version on my hair when I was a child. So I decided to try it again.  I put it on after washing my hair while my hair was slightly damp.  Then I blow dried it and flat- ironed it, and it looked great.  It was not greasy (I have fine thin hair) or limp.  I will definitely be keeping a supply of this around.</li>
            <li> Alberto VO5 hairdressing for grey hair is an exelent product, I have being using it for years, and I will keep using it, 100% recomended!!!</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older my hair has thinned out and lost it&#x27;s body so that I get \\&quot;fly away\\&quot; hair. I&#x27;ve been looking for hair products to give it some body and shine and keep it in place without looking greasy. I&#x27;ve reverted to the products popular in my youth: Alberto VO5 (as my hair is now Grey), Brylcreem, Wildroot Creemoil and Groom &amp; Clean. I haven&#x27;t found much difference in the products as far as how well they hold but I find that VO5 has the most disagreeable smell so that I have eliminated it from the hunt. Wildroot has the mildest smell, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> a user for many years and always satisfied  it suits my particular type of haait and is not expensive to buy</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Unfortunately I have been unable to find it locally so I decided to try Amazon.  So glad I did.  I ordered enough tubes to last me for a while!  Hope when those run out, they will still be selling this product.  My sister who lives in another state had the same problem of not finding this product so I bought her a good supply as well and plan to give it to her when she comes to visit in late summer!  She also loves it.</li>
            <li> Not exactly the consistency I expected ? perhaps it was frozen in transit ? or just old stock ? but it is really thick in the tube, so i can hardly squeeze it out; I hold the end under the hot water tap for a few seconds and that seems to help a lot. I ordered six tubes and opened three and they are all the same ?</li>
            <li> I can just about tell you what each gray hair is tied to, so darn it - I wear mine like prizes. This version of VO5 enhances the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; of the gray and seems to also make the remaining brown dark appear healthy and bright. I&#x27;m not vain enough to use it just for looks, so I really appreciate that it controls occasional dandruff flakes on my shoulders, controls occasional cowlicks, and is useful for removing tape or sticker glue in addition to a bunch of other unintended uses you can find out about online.</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find product so we order it.  My husband has used it for years.  He really likes it.</li>
            <li> This was bought for my husband so I can&#x27;t speak to the usability but having been&lt;br /&gt;unable to find them at the small Walmart store that is available to us it is wonderful&lt;br /&gt;to find them for him at Amazon.  He thought they had stopped making it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find. Still the best. Talk with Walgreens, Albertsons, Duane Reade, CVS.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ve got a great product. Gotta keep it alive. The only place I can find it us online. Occasionally I&#x27;ll find a place that carries it. But that&#x27;s rare and their stock s always minimal.&lt;br /&gt;I use the one for silver gray hair. Gives my hair a great, natural looking shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using VO5 hairdressing for over 30 years.  It&#x27;s the only hair dressing I use and my barber always remarks how nice my hair looks.</li>
            <li> Love this product, been using for over 30 years</li>
            <li> I love this product. Ihave used it for years and nothing else works better!I know this is stocked with men hair products, but it could be merchandised in both mens and womens hair prodoucts.</li>
            <li> I have used this produce for over 25 years. It is one of the only ones that does not turn silver hair a dirty white color, which many do. I use very little, about 1 /4&amp;#34;, and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is a magical, light hairdressing especially for the Silver Generation.  It turns from blue to clear as you rub it between  your fingertips before applying.  I use only 1/4 inch, mix on my finger tips and then pull it through the top layers of hair.  Comb or brush lightly and see your hair light up like a Hollywood star.  The danger is to use too much which weighs the hair down. I have used this about a year and highly recommend it.  It is sometimes difficult to get in stores. Not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that helps me avoid brassy hair while giving it a shine. I have tried other products and come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Both myself and Mom have used it to nourish and tame stray hair. Our hair is course and tends to dry now with age, but Silver V05 makes my gray hair sparkle with health.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used VO5 Hair Dressing for years.  It makes my naturally curly gray hair manageable and soft, and --with an extra touch of olive oil- I get enthusiastic compliments about how shiny my hair is, even from strangers.</li>
            <li> La compre para mi abuelo que le gusta lucir las canas, efectivamente se notan muy brillantes cuando se aplica el producto y tiene buen aroma. El detalle es que después de un rato el brillo que da al inicio se torna como de aspecto grasoso. Habría que investigar si es por la cabellera de mi abuelo o es en si el producto.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere at health and beauty stores in my area and as far down as Miami Fl.  I like this product very much</li>
            <li> A great product for the guys with gray hair that would like to look a little better than they do now.</li>
            <li> I love VO5 for my 70+ year old hair.  Without being too greasy, it provides good hair management.</li>
            <li> I used to have dry fly-away hair. Now it stays put and looks great without any hairspray.The yellowing of gray hair is much less pronounced.</li>
            <li> I am a 50 year old African American male and I&#x27;ve used this product for 30 years starting back when my hair was only 2% gray.  I fell in love with it because it made all of my hair softer, healthier and easier to manage.  I&#x27;m now 85% gray. Over the years I have had to use different products when I ran out of this hairdressing and couldn&#x27;t find it in a store nearby because it sells out often.  I learned to buy it in bulk to get the best price as its not &#x27;cheap&#x27;.  Nothing else came close to this product - not even the VO5 &#x27;Regular&#x27; hairdressing (which I don&#x27;t much like because it feels sticky/gluey by comparison).  This product works even better if you apply some in your hair directly before and after washing it.  Works on beards and ashy skin.  I see that all the reviews on this product are 5 stars.  I doubt this product will disappoint anyone with any type of hair.</li>
            <li> great service and product I will re order it writhing two month</li>
            <li> Excelent product, my mother used many time and have always been satisfied with the finish it provides.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have been using it for 30 years - none other compares.&lt;br /&gt;Purchasing experience could not have been better. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have been using Alberto VO5 Conditioning Hairdressing for Gray/White/Silver/Blonde Hair for over 20 years.  This product gives my gray/silver hair a bright and soft look.  I always get lots of complements on how beautiful my hair looks.  Thanks to this product, I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Best stuff on the market. Good price and great service.  If your hair is grey use this and you won&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> After blowing my hair dry, that&#x27;s the way my salt and pepper hair looks--&amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;, until I rub into my finger tips, a dab of vo5 haiirdressing---it adds such a beautiful shine to my hair that often a day doesn&#x27;t go by that I don&#x27;t get a compliment from someone  about how beautiful my hair is. It adds life to dull grey hair. It&#x27;s been a secret ingredient to my appearance eveyday for the past 20 years</li>
            <li> My husband has unruly gray hair.  He finds this VO5 Conditioning Hairdressing for Gray / Silver Hair just what he needs to keep his hair in place, while conditioning his hair.  It does not look or feel greasy.</li>
            <li> when i received this , it was a little hard when i opened it up to put on my hair.</li>
            <li> great. leaves my gray hair shiny and neat.</li>
            <li> A great old time product that has been around since before my hair went silver. Adds a little sheen to the hair witout being oily and heavy. Not carried in a lot of places since the advent of styling gel and spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pricing is super good</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have been using Alberto VO5 conditioning hairdressing for over 40 years.  I just wish I could find the VO5 hairdressing for Fine Hair.  I have looked everywhere with no success.  I did see some on Amazon but for some reason it was priced way too high, somewhere around $18.00 a tube.  I can find the VO5 conditioning hairdressing for Gray/White/Silver Blonde hair, and Normal/Dry Hair for about $4.00 a tube, but not the one for Fine Hair.</li>
            <li> My husand has loved this product; it adds body and a nice shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man whose gray hair is dull and straw-like without this stuff.  A tiny pea-sized dab of VO5 right out of the shower and my hair goes from dull gray to vibrant silver.  The key is to not over do it.  I tube of this size used every day will last me over a year.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to be a &amp;#34;blue lady&amp;#34; yet? This will do the trick! Keep hair soft and manageable with just enough blue to keep your gray silver not yellow!</li>
