            <li>Absolutely a work of art.</li>
            <li>Gentle to the hair but still fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as using the styler, it heats up very fast and gives quality results every time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used my gold GHD for a bit more than 4 months and suddenly stopped working and only beeping.i purchased it from original manufacturer web site</li>
            <li>I immediately went to Amazon to purchase a new GHD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This GHD iron has a beautiful aesthetic to it, but is heavy in the hand and the ceramic plates offer heat but not much smoothing action (which is essential for someone with curly and somewhat coarse hair).  </li>
            <li>Also the case is durable and classy.</li>

            <li>I could directly place my iron back to the case without worrying.</li>
            <li>The only thing that surprised me was that it does not allow you to adjust the temp.  </li>

            <li> good product. Wish I had got them sooner than when I purchased them.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my daughter wanted.</li>
            <li> Had this product since March 2014, and now it has stopped working!!  Paid a $144.50 for it, I would think it would last longer than 10 months.  What a huge disappointment!</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes my hear super sleek &amp; shiny!whoever reading this thinking about buying it? BUY IT! u won&#x27;t regret! Once u go ghd ull never go back ;)</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order this straightener from anywhere but directly at the store, fearing that I would get a fake.

            <li> I bought this one for my daughter. The best part that it has auto shut off, the perfect feature for a teenager that forgets to turn things off. It doesn&#x27;t burn her hair and straightens very quickly. The pouch is so convenient for sleep-overs or travels. The best hair straightener out there!</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;I just got my new ghd flat iron in silver color and I absolutely love it. It makes fabulous curls in no time. Heats up fast and gives shiny look to your hair. Even my boy friend was impressed by looking at my instant curls and quick transformation from straight hair girl to flirty curly hair look. The case it came up with itself is a big plus with this purchase. I could directly place my iron back to the case without worrying. It has two compartments inside it; I used one side of it for flat iron and moved my cord to other compartment.&lt;br /&gt;I used to have chi&#x27;s flat iron in past which gave upon me within two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will highly recommend it to anyone who is in mood to make a worthy purchase and who cares about their hair.</li>
            <li> This flatiron was recommended to me and so far I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It heats up quickly and I&#x27;m able to straighten my thick hair in 20 mins (on dry hair).  The only thing that surprised me was that it does not allow you to adjust the temp.  This is a legit GHD styler and I was able to register it on their website.</li>
            <li> I got the older version of this styler more than 3 years ago for myself, I paid almost AU$300 for it,  it properly is the best styler on the market.  When I saw this on Amazon for 2/3 of the cost, I couldn&#x27;t resist to order one for my teenage daughter.  the travel bag it comes with also can be used as the heat resistance mat. Extremely practical!  For Non-US user, it works in Australia, all we needed is a travel plug to convert the US plug to Aus plug. I do hesitant with the warranty as I don&#x27;t know how it works as I am using it outside the US but for my past experience with GHD styler and low cost, I decided to got for it.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, light weight, Easy to use, Good cover to keep it in and Wifey loves it&lt;br /&gt;Original Product</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a CHI I had had for seven years. I absolutely love the GHD and won&#x27;t switch brands again any time soon. Great that it came with a protective case as well. I had no issue registering this with GHD as an official product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned GHD flat irons in the past, and was very satisfied with the performance and durability. . . that is, until I tried titanium v. ceramic plates.  There really is no going back.  This GHD iron has a beautiful aesthetic to it, but is heavy in the hand and the ceramic plates offer heat but not much smoothing action (which is essential for someone with curly and somewhat coarse hair).  Also, the carrying case seems a bit bulky for travel. . . like wedging a giant Toblerone box into your luggage!  Finally, be warned that, while the iron heats up within seconds (impressive), there&#x27;s no temp adjustment available.  Sadly, this one is going back.</li>
            <li> I had a ghd before, and when it broke after about 5 years (to my doing), I was lost.&lt;br /&gt;I went online and came across this one at a WONDEFUL price.  This is one of the best hot irons I have EVER used.&lt;br /&gt;Does not burn your hair, leaves it silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I will never use any other Flat Iron!  You wont be dissapointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so upset, I received this and I was not able to register. It was. Fake.... No DVD no booklet either! Do not buy!</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd GHD I have purchased for my wife.  She absolutely loves this model, there have been some subtle design improvements over her previous professional model that make the feel much better.  As far as using the styler, it heats up very fast and gives quality results every time.  Much better than any of the cheap drug store models!</li>
            <li> GHD will always be the king of the flat iron!  Straightens easily, glides over hair without snagging, and my hair stays straight for days!  Never again will I cheat with another brand.  Best flat iron out there.</li>
            <li> Perfect temp...heats up in seconds! Has an auto shutoff after 30 minutes so u don&#x27;t have to worry. Absolutely a work of art. Owned the ghd 2 inch for 9 years before it gave up and died. Hoping this one will do the same. Only issue is that it tends to roll when u put it down so I put it on a heat resistant pad...Also the case is durable and classy.</li>
            <li> Great product and price</li>
            <li> I have tried different hair irons over time and this has surprised me pleasantly is truly INCREDIBLE the quality of the product. The hair just looks great after use this and eventhough I have long hair I could do it much faster than with others hair straightener. I recommend it widely. And the bag is gorgeous, I love it!!.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law&#x27;s hair smoked on the first use.  Returned it in hopes of finding something better.  It was beautiful looking and packaged.  Too bad</li>
            <li> I tried my sisters and had to get one myself. I love it. Quick at heating up and doesn&#x27;t fry my hair as bad as my old ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used my gold GHD for a bit more than 4 months and suddenly stopped working and only beeping.i purchased it from original manufacturer web site so I looked at FAQ but no use. my styler was fairly used and did not fall at all. It must be manufacturer failure. but ghdhair customer service was not as supportive as suppose to be to International buyers. for an expensive item with a manufacturer failure and under full two years warranty I received terrible cooperation. I&#x27;m so disapointed</li>
            <li> This is an incredible bargain.  Have had much more &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; stylers before but bought this one for the auto shut-off feature and the great price.  Was a little worried that it&#x27;s performance would be less than what I was used to, but I have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> Its worth every penny. Heats up in 30 seconds and comes with a really nice case.</li>
            <li> I LOVE GHD flat irons. I have a GHD iron that I have had for 5 years, and it has never failed me yet. I was carrying my old iron back and forth on my boat this summer and left it there one day and had to use an old terrible flat iron I had in the closet.  I immediately went to Amazon to purchase a new GHD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No need to figure out the heat temp that won&#x27;t fry your hair off&lt;br /&gt;Heats evenly&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair shiny and manageable&lt;br /&gt;Curls (or smooth style) stay for the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Price - You get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never be without a GHD again.</li>
            <li> This is realy a professional straightener! Gentle to the hair but still fast.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s actually the second GHD I own now - one for our vacation house.&lt;br /&gt;This one came with a heat resistant mat and nice pouche.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
