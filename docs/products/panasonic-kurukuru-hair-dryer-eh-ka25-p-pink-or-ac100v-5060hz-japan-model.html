            <li>honestly its really good when you use it on the normal set</li>
            <li>Worked awesome but not high quality.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and can somehow curve your hair.</li>

            <li>Low noise good hair dryer</li>
            <li>It also seemed much more gentle on her head as well.</li>
            <li>love this tool makes my get ready time so much faster!!</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>The size is small and very good materials ..</li>
            <li>Have used this for many years and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Was looking for something exactly like this!</li>
            <li>have fine hair and find this is the tool to give me the straight look</li>
            <li>worth every penny.</li>
            <li>very quiet and handy to use as a curler.</li>
            <li>Just the right strength.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>My moms makes a popping noise and blows from high to low on its own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am sure all products Japanese</li>
            <li>But it is too hot and it scorches my hair.  </li>
            <li>Really got what I waz expecting !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna buy more as a present for my sister!</li>
            <li>It does get hot</li>
            <li>Compared with its value, I liked the small size and almost cheap and high</li>
            <li>Not exactly sure why these aren&#x27;ts sold in the States, but they seem to be a good option to have in your hair arsenal.</li>
            <li>I have thick, medium length hair and this is perfect to completely dry damp, towel-dried hair.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and arrived very promptly and packaged very well.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend this for any woman who plans to travel in Japan and wants a combinatuion hair dryer and hair curler</li>
            <li>Purchased another one of these hair dryers as the older one was dying.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Panasonic hair Dryers and the reason why is simply because they leave my hair looking healthy and shiny .&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, heat generating devices are usually pretty high wattage...meaning you&#x27;d need some pretty hefty transformers to do the job.&amp;#34;  We do have another of these dryers that&#x27;s a slightly different model that hasn&#x27;t sparked, but knowing what I know now, I wouldn&#x27;t buy another.  </li>
            <li>After few months of use, it gets over hot easily</li>
            <li>It does tend to break off the hair if you use it on high all the time.</li>
            <li>Replacing my old unit, it is a very reliable product.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer allows me to have straight hair and maintain the natural volume in my hair.  </li>
            <li>It dried my daughter&#x27;s fine hair quickly and much quieter than my wife&#x27;s standard size dryer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just quieter than normal hair dryers.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s my first time with the white one.</li>
            <li>First time using it I immediately noticed that the motor sounds different.</li>
            <li>I originally bought two different Japanese model hair dryers and returned the lower wattage one to keep this one!</li>
            <li>My 12 year old and 9 year old daughters use it</li>
            <li>Low noise and fast drying.</li>
            <li>have replaced my old ones for a newer version for years because I have not&lt;</li>
            <li>That being said, you could use a transformer for such devices if you really must have them.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had is on the very end the teeth of the comb messed up.</li>
            <li>In the past I was only able to buy this Hair Dryer from a Japanese beautician.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A friend of the family happened to drop in the same night we were washing my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Just a really minor issue - the air from the head gets really hot, need to be careful.</li>
            <li>My hair has been so easy to manage with it especially with my very very thick hair.  </li>
            <li>She used to be afraid of the normal hair dryers because of the loud noise and mighty power.</li>

            <li> She used to be afraid of the normal hair dryers because of the loud noise and mighty power.</li>
            <li> Japan&#x27;s electrical system is roughly the same as the US&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> , I blow dry my hair then use the KURUKURU after I spray my hair with a heat protector ..</li>
            <li> when you put it on the dry you might experience some sparks</li>
            <li> and I believe it is faster to dry your hair with this.</li>
            <li> creates less frizz than a standard hair blow dryer</li>
            <li> as well as I expected</li>
            <li> The shipping was faster than expected and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li> It styles my hair as I expected.</li>
            <li> bought it when my other one broke.</li>
            <li> Look at all your other hair dyers and electrical appliances.</li>
            <li> There may be other brands; just look for hair straightening dryer or something like that.  </li>
            <li> Cut down my hair routine in half.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> and I have to stop and wait until it cools down.</li>
            <li> When I say quiet, I don&#x27;t mean &amp;#34;silent&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Please be careful!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(I have black relaxed hair)</li>
            <li> The purple one sounds deeper while this one sounds like a small remote control airplane toy.</li>
            <li> The only complaint on this one would be that when drying my hair on the hottest setting, it sparks and I see a small flash.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;easier to use than using a round brush in one hand a hair dryer in the other.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but if you are medium or thin hair it is definitely the one for you</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I was never able to get the same power due to the voltage difference.</li>
            <li> They usually say 120V or 125V.    </li>
            <li> My expert opinion is I would stay away from using any appliance that generates heat...such as a hairdryer (as previously mentioned) or a kotatsu or a boiler for tea water...unless you know what you are doing!!  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick so it doesnt work</li>
            <li> so keep a continuous, slow pace as you move this throughout your hair</li>
            <li> not good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> it has something wrong!!</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that the wind is not blowing too violently.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wife love the style and performance.</li>
            <li> Replacing my old unit, it is a very reliable product. love it.</li>
            <li> Compared with its value, I liked the small size and almost cheap and high quality.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am sure all products Japanese</li>
            <li> Low noise good hair dryer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown up with the purple KuruKuru (which I love) so it&#x27;s my first time with the white one. It shipped quickly. First time using it I immediately noticed that the motor sounds different. The purple one sounds deeper while this one sounds like a small remote control airplane toy. Regardless it gets the job done and I think this one gets hotter.</li>
            <li> Works great!  My 12 year old and 9 year old daughters use it and it&#x27;s easier for them than using a regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have curly, coarse hair.  This hair dryer allows me to have straight hair and maintain the natural volume in my hair.  I ordered two, just so that I would never be without it!  Love this product!</li>
            <li> It dries so fast it is great! I had brought one over from France that my mom had gotten years and years ago but unfortunately I was never able to get the same power due to the voltage difference. I ordered this one and it is the same to the T (except color). Cut down my hair routine in half.&lt;br /&gt;It does fume and heats up A LOT so be careful!&lt;br /&gt;(I have black relaxed hair)</li>
            <li> This was a an ok product. Stopped working after about 5 months of use</li>
            <li> Purchased another one of these hair dryers as the older one was dying.  So far so good but the life of these things seems to be around 12 months.</li>
            <li> bought it when my other one broke. love it! i recommend everyone to use this product regardless of the hair type you have.</li>
            <li> love this tool makes my get ready time so much faster!! It dries and styles fast and easy! worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Low noise and fast drying. Easy to use and can somehow curve your hair. The only small issue is that it gets really hot for using a while.</li>
            <li> it has something wrong!! Graduated from spark fire</li>
            <li> it is really amazing dosnt take time to style your hair and it came in time i love it and recommended it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Panasonic hair Dryers and the reason why is simply because they leave my hair looking healthy and shiny .&lt;br /&gt;fair price and does a great job keeping my hair straight with a bounce and weight in it , I blow dry my hair then use the KURUKURU after I spray my hair with a heat protector .. P.S ( My Hair type is wavy ) :-)</li>
            <li> The idea is great.  I also like the fact that the wind is not blowing too violently.  But it is too hot and it scorches my hair.  It has to be returned.  I might try a regular Japanese hairdryer instead.</li>
            <li> Really got what I waz expecting ! Great price and straight from Japan.I&#x27;m gonna buy more as a present for my sister!</li>
            <li> Bought this combination hair dryer/ hit air curler for use when I am in Japan.  It worked perfectly for my fine hair.  Maybe I did pay a premium for buying it in the US, but I did not have take time out of my business or pleasure schedule to find one when I got to Japan.  I Highly recommend this for any woman who plans to travel in Japan and wants a combinatuion hair dryer and hair curler</li>
            <li> when you put it on the dry you might experience some sparks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but honestly its really good when you use it on the normal set</li>
            <li> In the past I was only able to buy this Hair Dryer from a Japanese beautician.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair and find this is the tool to give me the straight look that I desire.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure it works well for thicker hair too. The brush attachment makes it much&lt;br /&gt;easier to use than using a round brush in one hand a hair dryer in the other.&lt;br /&gt;I have replaced my old ones for a newer version for years because I have not&lt;br /&gt;found a better product yet.</li>
            <li> It works magic for my gf thats why I bought one for myself too. My hair is thick so it doesnt work as well as I expected but if you are medium or thin hair it is definitely the one for you</li>
            <li> I liked it so much ... The size is small and very good materials .. I strongly advice any one who is looking for hair dryer to buy it Five stars ØŒ...</li>
            <li> I like it but they only thing is that it says it is made in Japan while it is actually made in Thiland for Japanese market.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something exactly like this! I have thick, medium length hair and this is perfect to completely dry damp, towel-dried hair. creates less frizz than a standard hair blow dryer and I believe it is faster to dry your hair with this. I originally bought two different Japanese model hair dryers and returned the lower wattage one to keep this one! Just the right strength. It does get hot so keep a continuous, slow pace as you move this throughout your hair and you&#x27;ll be just fine. highly recommend!</li>
            <li> A friend of the family happened to drop in the same night we were washing my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s hair. She had a model similar to the Panasonic model, which she had got from a friend who stayed in Japan for a while and sent it to her. It dried my daughter&#x27;s fine hair quickly and much quieter than my wife&#x27;s standard size dryer. It also seemed much more gentle on her head as well. After seeing that, I ordered 2 of the Panasonic models, which have performed beautifully on my daughter&#x27;s hair and on my wife&#x27;s hair, which is quite a bit longer and thicker. Not exactly sure why these aren&#x27;ts sold in the States, but they seem to be a good option to have in your hair arsenal.</li>
            <li> Best Dryer I have ever used....Expect when it start over heating...Hope to see a fix soon....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended ... ...</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great dryer for both home and travel...This is it! I am more than satisfied with this product. In fact, I will be ordering another one because I do not want to be without it. The shipping was faster than expected and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li> Love it! Arrived just on time and don&#x27;t have to see my stylist anymore.It does a great job, salon quality hairstyle.</li>
            <li> I brought one of these for myself. Worked awesome but not high quality.  I then got one for  my mom because I thought it was a great product. My moms makes a popping noise and blows from high to low on its own. I cant return it so I just wanted to leave this  review.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. It styles my hair as I expected. I&#x27;d recommend buying it. Just a really minor issue - the air from the head gets really hot, need to be careful.</li>
            <li> Have used this for many years and can&#x27;t live without it. Happy to have found it, will continue ordering it whenever needed.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used KURUKURU and I&#x27;m glad I got it on Amazon because it works great for me right now. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it!</li>
            <li> there is Spark fire come from inside I think this is defective one</li>
            <li> Great Product. Lives up to its promise .Its been 2 months so far.&lt;br /&gt;Love my hair after I use it !</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer ever! My hair has been so easy to manage with it especially with my very very thick hair.  I would definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this and so does my daughter. She used to be afraid of the normal hair dryers because of the loud noise and mighty power. This one gets the job done yet is quiet. When I say quiet, I don&#x27;t mean &amp;#34;silent&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s just quieter than normal hair dryers. With that being said, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it in the same room as a sleeping baby or toddler. ^_^ Overall, it&#x27;s great! :)</li>
            <li> This thing had sparks coming out of it, so I called Panasonic and they said that these were made for use in Japan.  They say 100Volts on them.  Look at all your other hair dyers and electrical appliances. They usually say 120V or 125V.    I&#x27;ve copied and pasted this from a blog where someone asked if you can use Japanese appliances in the U.S.: &amp;#34;Can you use Japanse appliances in the US?  I am an electrical engineer. My expert opinion is I would stay away from using any appliance that generates heat...such as a hairdryer (as previously mentioned) or a kotatsu or a boiler for tea water...unless you know what you are doing!!  Japan&#x27;s electrical system is roughly the same as the US&#x27;s. However, the US&#x27;s voltage is 120Vac RMS (60Hz)while Japan&#x27;s is 100Vac RMS (50 or 60Hz depending on region).  So, any heat generating device from Japan that is used in the US will get 20% hotter than it&#x27;s design intended. The risk is damage to the device and/or fire...or injury of a person. Please be careful!!  That being said, you could use a transformer for such devices if you really must have them. But, heat generating devices are usually pretty high wattage...meaning you&#x27;d need some pretty hefty transformers to do the job.&amp;#34;  We do have another of these dryers that&#x27;s a slightly different model that hasn&#x27;t sparked, but knowing what I know now, I wouldn&#x27;t buy another.  I&#x27;ve put a link below to a similar dryer that&#x27;s Conair brand that we&#x27;ve bought before and which is what I&#x27;m replacing this unit with. There may be other brands; just look for hair straightening dryer or something like that.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ME2YWG/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this at the beginning.  After few months of use, it gets over hot easily and I have to stop and wait until it cools down.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter recommended this item and it works great! The only problem I had is on the very end the teeth of the comb messed up.</li>
            <li> not good! I&#x27;m sorryðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•</li>
            <li> I have bought this type of hair dryer for years.  Most of the time I have to purchase it when in Seattle, cannot find it in Michigan.  The only complaint on this one would be that when drying my hair on the hottest setting, it sparks and I see a small flash.  It does tend to break off the hair if you use it on high all the time.</li>
            <li> very quiet and handy to use as a curler.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom, she loves it!! and arrived very promptly and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> So far good and easy hair done</li>
