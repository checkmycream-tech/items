            <li>I was happy with my purchase.  </li>

            <li>I would give a better rating .</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed my paraffin bath for my hands at home.  </li>

            <li>Makes them feel much better.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I saw any instructions to do that, but if it is not done, I am sure that you would end up with wax leaking from the machine.  </li>
            <li>I have a parafin wax bath reservoir and needed more wax.</li>
            <li>So glad to know that Amazon had it offered</li>
            <li>so I purchased some and love it.</li>
            <li>the product it self is exactly as described the price is fair.</li>
            <li>I originally reviewed these paraffin pearls in 2000 and bought them again in 2003 and am still using them in 2011!</li>

            <li>i think this item is great especially if your like me and allergic to the many scented waxes out there.</li>
            <li>I noticed a really strong plastic chemical smell coming off the wax as it heated through.  </li>

            <li>not just two again I must look for the fine print</li>

            <li>The larger bricks are nice for when I need to add a lot, but these are really easy to work with!</li>
            <li>Works better if you first use your favorite&lt;br /&gt;hand lotion lathered on.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong, just a fresh clean scent even though it says unscented.</li>
            <li>Although the package was very nice - colorful box, individually shrink wrapped wax bar, and 20 bage with &amp;#34;HoMedics&amp;#34; printed all over, I was paying through the nose for nothing practical.  </li>
            <li>it is easy to use just pout in was bath machine and let it melt to the right degree of temp and them continue to dip</li>
            <li>These were good for replacing what constant usage of the bath takes away in the paraffin.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>Melts quickly and is odorless.</li>
            <li>I used the wax in my hand bath and it melted quickly and stayed liquid for a while.</li>
            <li>Works great for dry hands, thanks</li>
            <li>The beads where mostly one big block, they must have gotten overheated during transport, but they crumbled apart rather easily still.</li>
            <li>To be honest I&#x27;ve not been using my Revlon paraffin bath enough.</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>you know you have it right.</li>
            <li>Not benefitting from it right now</li>
            <li>This purchase of paraffin will last a full winter (or more).  </li>
            <li>Since it takes so long to warm up, it needs to be on a timer</li>
            <li>I could of ordered from the first company for a few dollars more and got more .</li>
            <li>Like this product very much and order it whenever I need some.</li>
            <li>This item was undamaged and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Expecially if it is the first time the consumer is replacing their wax.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find any big difference except these cost more.</li>
            <li>Packaged well and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it melt faster because of greater exposed surface, but still, no big deal if you don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Purchase was exactly what it claimed to be.</li>
            <li>It is also very affordable!</li>
            <li>and before I hit the order button, let me know I could get free shipping by ordering a few dollars more, which I did.</li>
            <li>When I want to purchase paraffin for my hand bath I always check here first because it&#x27;s so much cheaper than any retail store.  </li>
            <li>I bought this in order to help my hands/fingers feel better after a long day at work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I plugged in my paraffin bath tonight as my hands were getting dry with all the winter weather.</li>
            <li>Very high price for what u get.i thought it was 4pounds</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>so I was very grateful to locate it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>you know it will be ready for a paraffin soak in the morning.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I do not use it very often at all.  </li>
            <li>If I work too much with my hands, I put my hands in the wax, dipping</li>
            <li>It is also very oily and doesn&#x27;t make my hands/fingers feel soft/massaged as they did in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The replacements for the paraffin are just the same as the original that came with the paraffin wax unit.  </li>
            <li>The order came very quickly and was just what I expected.</li>
            <li>I have gone to several salons and paid so much for each dip, but it was well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Just the job at a realistic price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this product in the past and it had a pleasant scent and left my hands</li>
            <li>Love getting myself treated to a little mini spa once now and then and needed refills.</li>
            <li>the problem I experienced was the product was billed the wrong credit card</li>
            <li>a refill when the old paraffin is used down to the point where more is needed.  </li>
            <li>I do own the HoMedics bath and had trouble finding replacement wax locally.</li>
            <li>I ordered this item only because I was short a couple dollars to qualify for free shipping when I order six pounds of replacement paraffin wax for my wife&#x27;s wax machine.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to do this, and you will have a product that is excellent and is much less expensive than other similar paraffin baths.</li>
            <li>Sold as \\&quot;replacement paraffin\\&quot; as if this would replenish old paraffin .</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to odors, you will want to use this instead of the wax that came with your paraffin bath.</li>
            <li>Then peel the wax and the bag off, then wipe your hands with an old face cloth.  </li>
            <li>I LIKE THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT BECAUSE IT HAS PARAFFIN PEARLS AS OPPOSSED TO A SOLID CHUNK OF PARAFFIN.</li>
            <li>Really wasn&#x27;t very convenient and was quite messy to use.</li>
            <li>This set makes it really easy to add a smaller amount of wax to the paraffin bath when it is a little low.  </li>
            <li>The beads (&amp;#34;pearls&amp;#34;) break apart for safer introduction to already hot, liquid wax (less likely to splash or slosh) &amp; melt so much faster than the block form HoMedics previously sold.</li>
            <li>It also comes as little beads, instead of a large block.</li>
            <li>they do not take anytime at all to melt in, and you can add as little or as much as you want....</li>

            <li> you know it will be ready for a paraffin soak in the morning.  </li>
            <li> The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I do not use it very often at all.  </li>
            <li> If I work too much with my hands, I put my hands in the wax, dipping</li>
            <li> It is also very oily and doesn&#x27;t make my hands/fingers feel soft/massaged as they did in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The replacements for the paraffin are just the same as the original that came with the paraffin wax unit.  </li>
            <li> The order came very quickly and was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have gone to several salons and paid so much for each dip, but it was well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Just the job at a realistic price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product in the past and it had a pleasant scent and left my hands</li>
            <li> Love getting myself treated to a little mini spa once now and then and needed refills.</li>
            <li> the problem I experienced was the product was billed the wrong credit card</li>
            <li> a refill when the old paraffin is used down to the point where more is needed.  </li>
            <li> I do own the HoMedics bath and had trouble finding replacement wax locally.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item only because I was short a couple dollars to qualify for free shipping when I order six pounds of replacement paraffin wax for my wife&#x27;s wax machine.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to do this, and you will have a product that is excellent and is much less expensive than other similar paraffin baths.</li>
            <li> Sold as \\&quot;replacement paraffin\\&quot; as if this would replenish old paraffin .</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to odors, you will want to use this instead of the wax that came with your paraffin bath.</li>
            <li> Then peel the wax and the bag off, then wipe your hands with an old face cloth.  </li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT BECAUSE IT HAS PARAFFIN PEARLS AS OPPOSSED TO A SOLID CHUNK OF PARAFFIN.</li>
            <li> Really wasn&#x27;t very convenient and was quite messy to use.</li>
            <li> This set makes it really easy to add a smaller amount of wax to the paraffin bath when it is a little low.  </li>
            <li> The beads (&amp;#34;pearls&amp;#34;) break apart for safer introduction to already hot, liquid wax (less likely to splash or slosh) &amp; melt so much faster than the block form HoMedics previously sold.</li>
            <li> It also comes as little beads, instead of a large block.</li>
            <li> they do not take anytime at all to melt in, and you can add as little or as much as you want....</li>
            <li> While I am not sure if it helps this condition, it really is a luxury.  </li>
            <li> Since I am the only person using the paraffin, I don&#x27;t have to replace the wax for a long time, which is another convenience.</li>
            <li> There is a little plastic plug that comes with the machine, and it needs to be placed into a slot in the back wall near to the hinge for the door.  </li>
            <li> This will last me for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Only problem I noted is the amount provided does not adequately fill the Bath to the level I prefer as it barely covers up to my wrist when laying my hand flat in the unit.</li>
            <li> To get my feet through the long Minnesota winters, it is the ticket.  </li>
            <li> When I was going to buy the product, I noticed several widely differing reviews on Amazon.com[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Some other brands make scents such as peach, wintergreen, lavender...</li>
            <li> ESPECIALLY IF YOU ONLY NEED A LITTLE AMOUNT TO THE PARAFFIN BATH.</li>
            <li> and I no longer have to use it daily due to the benefits I have received.  </li>
            <li> This product helps my hands with arthritis and also moisturizes my hands when they tend to get dry.  </li>
            <li> It has such a strong unpleasant smell that it gave me a headache.  </li>
            <li> These are necessary to prevent a mess.</li>
            <li> Since it takes 6 lbs to fill my paraffin bath I expected each package to contain 6 lbs</li>
            <li> Other places you have to buy them separate.</li>
            <li> If I had choice of other qualified (Amazon) items that would push the order into the no shipping level, I would not have ordered this - period.</li>
            <li> Part of my dissatisfaction with this product was due to my failure to read entirely the description.  </li>
            <li> it was all melted together no pearls just a chunk of wax for the price it wax not worth it</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH OTHER WAXES.</li>
            <li> The plastic bags contain the mess and make removing the paraffin a breeze.</li>
            <li> I am unable to find it anywhere in stores near me</li>
            <li> I have bought this brand a few times, with no problem.  </li>
            <li> have used a few times since I&#x27;ve received them and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> It really helps in the healing of my bad hand I damaged from overuse.</li>
            <li> The other less expensive brand was $23+ for six pounds.  </li>
            <li> Of course, I&#x27;m an idiot and didn&#x27;t realize I had to pull it apart into the tiny beads for it to melt faster until I got to the second block.</li>
            <li> I hardly used this</li>
            <li> Cutting the replacements up in smaller pieces makes</li>
            <li> I like doing the hand spa at least once per week</li>
            <li> Every winter my hands tend to be unusually dry and often suffer painful cracks.</li>
            <li> My secret is to slather lotion onto my hands before dipping.</li>
            <li> The smell was really bad and gave me a headache along with smelling up my house.  </li>
            <li> that is how bad the smell was.  </li>
            <li> I guess I have never gotten bad wax.  </li>
            <li> When they are bad</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t endure the cold months without it!</li>
            <li> wax I received however STINKS, literally!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got it and have yet to use them, my problem</li>
            <li> When I want to purchase paraffin for my hand bath I always check here first because it&#x27;s so much cheaper than any retail store.  Even with the postage I save a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Like this product very much and order it whenever I need some. Would reccommend it to others.</li>
            <li> A wonderful way to soothe arthritic discomfort!</li>
            <li> These pearls are perfect for refreshing the paraffin in the paraffin bath.  they do not take anytime at all to melt in, and you can add as little or as much as you want....easily.</li>
            <li> I originally reviewed these paraffin pearls in 2000 and bought them again in 2003 and am still using them in 2011! To be honest I&#x27;ve not been using my Revlon paraffin bath enough. What I like about the Homedics paraffin replacement pearls is that they come with some plastic liners. These are necessary to prevent a mess. Inevitably when you dip your hands in paraffin some of the paraffin will come off and you don&#x27;t want to keep finding pieces on your carpet or bathroom floor. The plastic bags contain the mess and make removing the paraffin a breeze. I&#x27;m so glad I plugged in my paraffin bath tonight as my hands were getting dry with all the winter weather. My secret is to slather lotion onto my hands before dipping. The results last for hours if not days! So don&#x27;t run out of these pearls. I&#x27;m going to order more and try to remember to dip my hands more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review updated December 2011.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> This is the refill for the Homedics Paraffin Bath.  I have gone to several salons and paid so much for each dip, but it was well worth it.  With this purchase you can have a paraffin dip whenever you want and it is so comforting.  Great for Carpel Tunnel patients, which I am.  The only part of this refill that it doesn&#x27;t have is a scent.  Some other brands make scents such as peach, wintergreen, lavender...&lt;br /&gt;This wax is no scent.  If you coat your hands with some wonderful hand lotion and then dip them and retain the wax for 15 minutes, your hands end up silky smooth, and great for your feet too!</li>
            <li> This is a great product which goes with the Homedics Paraffin Spa.  My hands have never been in better condition.</li>
            <li> Great product. Of course, I&#x27;m an idiot and didn&#x27;t realize I had to pull it apart into the tiny beads for it to melt faster until I got to the second block.</li>
            <li> This item was undamaged and it was exactly what I wanted.Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product helps my hands with arthritis and also moisturizes my hands when they tend to get dry.  I will order more parrifin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wax!!! Exactly as described and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rate this purchase because I have not used it yet. i can rate it after I use it</li>
            <li> the product it self is exactly as described the price is fair. the problem I experienced was the product was billed the wrong credit card other wise I would give a better rating . the shipping cost was brought the cost to about $10 per 6oz package</li>
            <li> These were good for replacing what constant usage of the bath takes away in the paraffin.  I have mild to severe arthritis and found  a link that stated this paraffin bath is good for relieving the pain.  It does work to some degree.</li>
            <li> Sold as \\&quot;replacement paraffin\\&quot; as if this would replenish old paraffin . Did not cover with 2\\&quot; depth requiring additional purchase locally to fill spa to a useable level.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find this item to replace and add to the wax in my unit. Amazon.com was great to deal with and before I hit the order button, let me know I could get free shipping by ordering a few dollars more, which I did. The order came very quickly and was just what I expected. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This product was supposed to be &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34;, but arrived in several clumps.  It still melts in the machine, but leaves my hands kind of oily after using it.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING A PARAFFIN BATH FOR YEARS.  I LIKE THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT BECAUSE IT HAS PARAFFIN PEARLS AS OPPOSSED TO A SOLID CHUNK OF PARAFFIN. IT MAKES IT EASIER TO ADD TO THE PARAFFIN BATH, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ONLY NEED A LITTLE AMOUNT TO THE PARAFFIN BATH. ALSO, THE 20 PLASTIC LINERS INCLUDED IS A PLUS, AS YOU ALWAYS NEED ADDITIONAL LINERS FOR THE PARAFFIN BATH.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, but added information on the description should be provided so the customer knows how much to purchase.   There are several sizes of the baths and they all require a different amount.  Expecially if it is the first time the consumer is replacing their wax.  Otherwise it melts perfectly and has a great texture.</li>
            <li> We use this as a refill for my grandmother&#x27;s spa parafin wax machine.  It&#x27;s great that it also comes with 20 bags!</li>
            <li> This is $6.50 a pound pluss shipping. My local store sells it for $2.25 a pound.</li>
            <li> Works great for dry hands, thanks</li>
            <li> Because the bath came with enough parafin to fill the bath, and this is a personal use bath, I haven&#x27;t had the need to break into my \\&quot;parafin stash\\&quot; but I like the beads instead of the blocks.  I believe they will be easier to handle and melt faster.</li>
            <li> melted well and stays melted on warm.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use just pout in was bath machine and let it melt to the right degree of temp and them continue to dip</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, melts well and leaves your hands and feet feeling wonderful. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I used the pearls thinking they would melt faster than the blocks.  I didn&#x27;t find any big difference except these cost more.</li>
            <li> The best part of this wax replacement is that it is unscented. If you are sensitive to odors, you will want to use this instead of the wax that came with your paraffin bath. It also comes as little beads, instead of a large block. This makes it melt faster. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Works just like the paraffin that came with the HoMedics paraffin bath for hands.</li>
            <li> Packaged well and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Excellent, as expected.</li>
            <li> Came on time &amp; in perfect condition. The beads (&amp;#34;pearls&amp;#34;) break apart for safer introduction to already hot, liquid wax (less likely to splash or slosh) &amp; melt so much faster than the block form HoMedics previously sold. I bought the spa years ago &amp; could no longer find the paraffin in stores so I was very grateful to locate it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed my paraffin bath for my hands at home.  Good quality.  Makes my hands feel so smooth.  I recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> works great hands are so soft.</li>
            <li> The one personal product I have purchased that isn&#x27;t sitting on a shelf collecting dust is my paraffin bath.  To get my feet through the long Minnesota winters, it is the ticket.  This purchase of paraffin will last a full winter (or more).  Good purchase.</li>
            <li> Melts quickly and is odorless.</li>
            <li> the bath will need 4 lbs to fill bath to a good level in order to soak hand in at an appropriate level.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive replacement paraffin pearls as advertised but six one-pound paraffin blocks.</li>
            <li> The replacements for the paraffin are just the same as the original that came with the paraffin wax unit.  No change.  Why would there be.&lt;br /&gt;Just a refill when the old paraffin is used down to the point where more is needed.  Cutting the replacements up in smaller pieces makes&lt;br /&gt;it melt faster because of greater exposed surface, but still, no big deal if you don&#x27;t.  Thrown them in turn it on and let it heat all night, that&lt;br /&gt;way you know it will be ready for a paraffin soak in the morning.  How nice for sore hands.  Works better if you first use your favorite&lt;br /&gt;hand lotion lathered on.  Makes it easier to come off and the lotion will soften your hands.  Put lotion on to just above your wrists.&lt;br /&gt;That is how I do it.  See how they do it at the salon.  Same thing, follow the professionals.  I did. Check the temperature before using&lt;br /&gt;so you know you have it right.</li>
            <li> I did not Deirdre this. It was just sent and charged to my account without my authoritarian</li>
            <li> Every winter my hands tend to be unusually dry and often suffer painful cracks. To prevent this,  my paraffin bath is an almost daily winter ritual. I do own the HoMedics bath and had trouble finding replacement wax locally. This brand and in pearl form is perfect. It takes two pounds for the bath, and the box contains that amount. The price is reasonable. Since I am the only person using the paraffin, I don&#x27;t have to replace the wax for a long time, which is another convenience. This fast-melting wax is easily available from Amazon. I won&#x27;t endure the cold months without it!</li>
            <li> Item arrived in good order and as described.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot.  Since it takes so long to warm up, it needs to be on a timer but the timer did not turn it on.  I do not use it very often at all.  Not benefitting from it right now</li>
            <li> Just the job at a realistic price.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the paraffin wax I ordered for my hand waxer. I am unable to find it anywhere in stores near me and so this is the easiest, most cost effective way for me to get it. The was itself is fine and works well in my waxer.</li>
            <li> seldom needed refills</li>
            <li> Great. Love the convenient packaging</li>
            <li> Product is what I needed to refill my Paraffin Bath, it leaves my skin soft and feeling good.  Only problem I noted is the amount provided does not adequately fill the Bath to the level I prefer as it barely covers up to my wrist when laying my hand flat in the unit.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and was very nice. Melted great &amp; feels great using ig as a parafin treatment on hands. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> He was skiing at the time and really liked the paraffin bath.  Hasn&#x27;t used it in years now.  May again.</li>
            <li> I have bought this brand a few times, with no problem.  The parrafin wax always had a odorless smell.  This last time I bought it I noticed a really strong plastic chemical smell coming off the wax as it heated through.  The smell was really bad and gave me a headache along with smelling up my house.  The wax is the same as the others unscented. I had to move my parrafin wax machine outdoors that is how bad the smell was.  I beleive they have added a chemical too it and I will be looking for another brand to buy.</li>
            <li> This set makes it really easy to add a smaller amount of wax to the paraffin bath when it is a little low.  The larger bricks are nice for when I need to add a lot, but these are really easy to work with!</li>
            <li> Part of my dissatisfaction with this product was due to my failure to read entirely the description.  Since it takes 6 lbs to fill my paraffin bath I expected each package to contain 6 lbs and they contained only 2 lbs. After purchasing 2 packages, there was still not enough paraffin to refill my bath.  However the quality is excellent and melts easily.</li>
            <li> Parafin baths for the hands helps with pain of any kind, injury, arthritis, surgery.  I have used it for one year and I no longer have to use it daily due to the benefits I have received.  If I work too much with my hands, I put my hands in the wax, dipping so I get 5 layers on them and then put my hands into a grocery bag and wrap them up.  Do it while you watch TV for about 1/2 hour.  Then peel the wax and the bag off, then wipe your hands with an old face cloth.  Your hands will feel wonderful and mobile.</li>
            <li> I was happy with my purchase.  I guess it&#x27;s really good if I did not have any complaints.  I guess I have never gotten bad wax.  I really liked getting the plastic liners with the wax.</li>
            <li> Very high price for what u get.i thought it was 4pounds not just two again I must look for the fine print</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hands.  Makes them feel much better.  When they are bad I use the wax several times per day.</li>
            <li> Purchase was exactly what it claimed to be. I used the wax in my hand bath and it melted quickly and stayed liquid for a while. The beads where mostly one big block, they must have gotten overheated during transport, but they crumbled apart rather easily still. The wax was unscented, just like I wanted.</li>
            <li> I might of just as ordered just paraffin wax their was no difference it was all melted together no pearls just a chunk of wax for the price it wax not worth it I could of ordered from the first company for a few dollars more and got more . So no I would not order from them again</li>
            <li> This was the best price I&#x27;ve seen for this, and it included the plastic cover bags with it. Other places you have to buy them separate.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this paraffin bath.  A paraffin bath was recommended to me to help with arthritis in my wrist.  While I am not sure if it helps this condition, it really is a luxury.  The product lives up to its claims.  When I was going to buy the product, I noticed several widely differing reviews on Amazon.com[[ASIN:B002HEHNC0 HoMedics Paraffin Bath PAR-300-THP, Blue]].  I saw two reviews that panned the product and said that it leaked melted wax all over the place.  There is a little plastic plug that comes with the machine, and it needs to be placed into a slot in the back wall near to the hinge for the door.  I don&#x27;t think I saw any instructions to do that, but if it is not done, I am sure that you would end up with wax leaking from the machine.  Be sure to do this, and you will have a product that is excellent and is much less expensive than other similar paraffin baths.</li>
            <li> I used this wax to soak my hands in heater hand tub. It gives pain relief from joint discomfort and allows mobility of my hands. I enjoy the heat and mobility that I feel from this heated wax. Works well and provides comfort.</li>
            <li> A lot of the paraffin waxes sold here have super strong odors, this is a wonderful alternative to those headache inducing ones. It is unscented, but it smells a lot like dial or ivory soap. Not too strong, just a fresh clean scent even though it says unscented. That&#x27;s a plus to me. It is also very affordable!</li>
            <li> love these this really helps when the hands hurt and it just warms them and makes them feel so much better</li>
            <li> I wish to thank you for an excellant product.  have used a few times since I&#x27;ve received them and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Will recommend to my friends your product. thank you again.</li>
            <li> Love getting myself treated to a little mini spa once now and then and needed refills. Great item, love it.</li>
            <li> I like doing the hand spa at least once per week I think it helps if you are big on personal care try it.</li>
            <li> Enjoy how smooth my hands get</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE ONLY WAX I WILL EVER USE FROM NOW ON. I HAVE TRIED OTHERS BUT THEY ARE NOT AS WONDERFUL AS THIS PRODUCT! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH OTHER WAXES.</li>
            <li> i think this item is great especially if your like me and allergic to the many scented waxes out there.</li>
            <li> I bought this in order to help my hands/fingers feel better after a long day at work.  I&#x27;ve purchased this product in the past and it had a pleasant scent and left my hands soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax I received however STINKS, literally!  It has such a strong unpleasant smell that it gave me a headache.  It is also very oily and doesn&#x27;t make my hands/fingers feel soft/massaged as they did in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T buy it!</li>
            <li> Melted nicely and works great.</li>
            <li> Really wasn&#x27;t very convenient and was quite messy to use. I got it thinking it would relieve arthritic pain in my hand, but it was more bother than it was good.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! It makes my hands feel so silky! This wax seems to be an improvement over what I used a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li> Good refill at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I ordered this item only because I was short a couple dollars to qualify for free shipping when I order six pounds of replacement paraffin wax for my wife&#x27;s wax machine.  The other less expensive brand was $23+ for six pounds.  Here, this item only cosisted of two pounds of wax and 20 plastic bags.  Although the package was very nice - colorful box, individually shrink wrapped wax bar, and 20 bage with &amp;#34;HoMedics&amp;#34; printed all over, I was paying through the nose for nothing practical.  If I had choice of other qualified (Amazon) items that would push the order into the no shipping level, I would not have ordered this - period.</li>
            <li> La paraffin a es muy Buena y viene en abundance para 30 session  ,estoy conformed se sabe que la paraffin a es humectante  ly medicinal.</li>
            <li> I hardly used this so bought this in anticipation that I would need it.  Buy it only if you will use it and not with the intention that you will.</li>
            <li> I have a parafin wax bath reservoir and needed more wax. So glad to know that Amazon had it offered so I purchased some and love it.It really helps in the healing of my bad hand I damaged from overuse.</li>
            <li> And the price for the wax and the wrappers was great.  This will last me for a very long time.</li>
