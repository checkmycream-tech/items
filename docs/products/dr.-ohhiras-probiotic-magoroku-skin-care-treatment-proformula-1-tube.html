            <li>If you have some kind of &amp;#34;irritation&amp;#34; going on on whatever part of the body</li>
            <li>Still a nice probiotic cream.</li>
            <li>The smell is not my favorite</li>
            <li>People have commented about how lovely my skin is....  </li>
            <li>I expect more from this company that to use horse fat in a product.</li>
            <li>so i think the product could be more upfront in its labeling, because most english-speakers won&#x27;t be expecting animal fat in their lotion</li>
            <li>I love Dr. Ohira&#x27;s Kampuchu soap and thought I would like the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Even though I only had an eczema break-out, this product is still in use today because it&#x27;s so awesome.</li>
            <li>if you were that concerned with what goes in and on your body, you would research any unfamiliar ingredients to make sure they adhere to your standards before purchasing the product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried so many products.  </li>
            <li>I have even bought the lotion for many of my families members who struggle with acne because it worked so well for me.</li>
            <li>lovely product - use sparingly</li>
            <li>The ingredients such as probiotics and aloe are exceptionally healthful and are at the top of the ingredient list.   </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this with the probiotics.  </li>
            <li>First, I love Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s probiotics and have taken them for years.</li>
            <li>good news is that I contacted Essential Formulas, and they said they are making an additional formulation (vegan) for distribution in the United States that will contain shea nut butter instead of the horse emollient.  </li>
            <li>I put half a pea size (if that) under my arms as deodorant and it works great to prevent stink.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!  </li>
            <li>Also,my skin is sensitive to most skin lotions.  </li>
            <li>This stuff will fix you right up.</li>
            <li>They are hoping that this new product will be available in June 2011.</li>
            <li>I should have read closer the first time.</li>
            <li>I have fair, sensitive skin, this product was not right for my skin type.</li>
            <li>This stuff has kind of an odd smell</li>
            <li>but it makes my skin so soft and calms it down really good.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>It helps smooth away rough spots from eczema.</li>
            <li>, it makes my skin feel very smooth and takes very little per application.</li>
            <li>After applying a very small amount of Magoroku an amazing transformation seems to take place.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes my skin and leaves it very soft.</li>
            <li>I have been buying this product for a few years now and love how soft and clear my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small tube but for a lot more as in price.</li>
            <li>I suffer from mild adult acne and read about probiotics helping for it since acne creams kill good and bad bacteria.</li>
            <li>I love this as you only have to use a little</li>
            <li>I am a Natural Health Professional and this product has my endorsement.  </li>
            <li>I actually like the product so much that I am going to get it again.  </li>
            <li>So far hasn&#x27;t broke me out.</li>
            <li>I cant stop rubbing my cheeks because the are so soft.</li>
            <li>If you want to go that far,  that&#x27;s up to you.</li>
            <li>I have dry and sensitive skin, and I was looking at my face thinking the dryness really make me look</li>
            <li>And after a more careful look at the ingredients, I&#x27;m not comfortable using horse oil.  </li>
            <li>i have bought this exact product (through a different vendor) but wanted to send it back after reading the ingredient label that came on the actual tube, which alerted me to the fact that it was made with horse fat.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also quite soothing, not painful to put on a raw area like some lotions.  </li>
            <li>Some of the reviews say it is greasy and it feels that way when you first put it on but that feeling goes away within a few seconds.  </li>
            <li>It truly does nourish and condition my dry, sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> and it goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li> It is quite common to use animal fats in these products, and has been for a long time; a lot of products are going to contain such ingredients unless marked \\&quot;vegan\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t produce any results different than any other skin care product that I had used.  </li>
            <li> It looked like the bottom of a dry riverbed.  </li>
            <li> I used it for two weeks and ended up with flaky dry skin that I did not have before.  </li>
            <li> Buy it if you have dry skin.</li>

            <li> I gave my face a break and then tried again with half a pea size amount and received the same results.  </li>
            <li> The packaging explains that the oil is high in essential fatty acids (something American&#x27;s are deficient in).</li>
            <li> this last purchase however, the consistency of the product was different.&lt;br /&gt;Almost like little micro-beads that seem to dissipate with body</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my skin even if it&#x27;s really dry, and keeps working for hours beyond any other lotion.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t want any animal products in my moisturizer, especially an ingredient that requires the animal be dead.</li>
            <li> Horse oil or not, I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few months and have seen a different.</li>
            <li> This calmed down my dry parts of my face (around nose and mouth), and didn&#x27;t break me out like other creams.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference from other lotion brand.</li>
            <li> (It is interesting to note that there are things much worse than horse oil that people put on their skin that are harmful and toxic...products that are expensive and make all sorts of claims that I would not or could not use).</li>
            <li> yes, equine &#x3D; related to horses, but it could mean it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It is actually thicker than a lotion and a very small amount goes</li>
            <li> Less oily than the purple one.</li>
            <li> I received a few samples of this skin lotion and I tried it.  </li>

            <li> The product is expensive, but in a few days, the rash&lt;br /&gt;was under control.  </li>
            <li> then I read the reviews and was very disappointed to learn that there is equine (horse) oil in it, even though it is listed last in the ingredients, so it&#x27;s a small quantity.  </li>
            <li> This is disgusting and unethical.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have dry and sensitive skin, and I was looking at my face thinking the dryness really make me look older.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this cream(they call it lotion but it&#x27;s a thick cream), then bam! the look of the skin was different in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 3 days since I started using it, and although it&#x27;s still a bit dry, it&#x27;s starting to feel nourished and supple.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a fussy skin, you&#x27;ve got to try this.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion, it makes my skin feel very smooth and takes very little per application. The smell is not my favorite but it is not overly obnoxious.</li>
            <li> Gritty and greasy. Don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> This skin cream works incredibly well. It moisturizes my skin even if it&#x27;s really dry, and keeps working for hours beyond any other lotion. In case \\&quot;Equine Oil\\&quot; isn&#x27;t an obvious enough terminology for you, it means there IS oil from a horse or a related animal, in the equine family. If you&#x27;re vegan, you may not want it. The stuff works, though. It seems to repair dried-out areas and leaves my skin with a nice, dewy look for a while. It&#x27;s also quite soothing, not painful to put on a raw area like some lotions.  It&#x27;s a skin-saver in the winter. If the animal product is an issue, you may want to research your current soap, lotion, and make-up ingredients. It is quite common to use animal fats in these products, and has been for a long time; a lot of products are going to contain such ingredients unless marked \\&quot;vegan\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!  I received a few samples of this skin lotion and I tried it.  It is actually thicker than a lotion and a very small amount goes a l-o-n-g way!  I am post menopausal and on some days you could see the dryness of the skin on my face and neck.  It looked like the bottom of a dry riverbed.  Also,my skin is sensitive to most skin lotions.  The Magoroku Skin Lotion does an amazing feat of retaining moisture.  After applying a very small amount of Magoroku an amazing transformation seems to take place.  My skin is visibly different and the softness is like a babies bottom. People have commented about how lovely my skin is....  I did read the ingredients and puzzled over the use of horse oil but I am not a chemist. The packaging explains that the oil is high in essential fatty acids (something American&#x27;s are deficient in). I have looked up all the product ingredients and I feel good about using this formula.  (It is interesting to note that there are things much worse than horse oil that people put on their skin that are harmful and toxic...products that are expensive and make all sorts of claims that I would not or could not use). But, Magoroku is different!!  The ingredients such as probiotics and aloe are exceptionally healthful and are at the top of the ingredient list.   I highly recommend this product.  I have had the best results of all the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products I have tried. There is no burning or sensitivity and my skin responds beautifully, looking well hydrated and healthy. It truly does nourish and condition my dry, sensitive skin. I am a Natural Health Professional and this product has my endorsement.  Give it a try....</li>
            <li> I tried this product and loved it...then I read the reviews and was very disappointed to learn that there is equine (horse) oil in it, even though it is listed last in the ingredients, so it&#x27;s a small quantity.  I don&#x27;t think I can put it on my face again, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that I contacted Essential Formulas, and they said they are making an additional formulation (vegan) for distribution in the United States that will contain shea nut butter instead of the horse emollient.  They are hoping that this new product will be available in June 2011.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this with the probiotics.  It didn&#x27;t produce any results different than any other skin care product that I had used.  And after a more careful look at the ingredients, I&#x27;m not comfortable using horse oil.  I should have read closer the first time.</li>
            <li> First, I love Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s probiotics and have taken them for years. I expect more from this company that to use horse fat in a product. This is disgusting and unethical. It also makes me reconsider taking the probiotic from this company.I will not support a company that exploits horses.  How pathetic that it is being touted as \\&quot; not tested on animals\\&quot; when animals are in the product. Shame on Essential Formulas!!</li>
            <li> i have bought this exact product (through a different vendor) but wanted to send it back after reading the ingredient label that came on the actual tube, which alerted me to the fact that it was made with horse fat.  i didn&#x27;t want any animal products in my moisturizer, especially an ingredient that requires the animal be dead. yes, equine &#x3D; related to horses, but it could mean it&#x27;s *for* horses (like mane n tail shampoo and conditioner products that were created for horses but are now sold for human use, too) not necessarily *from* horses.  baby oil isn&#x27;t from babies...  so i think the product could be more upfront in its labeling, because most english-speakers won&#x27;t be expecting animal fat in their lotion (perhaps magoroku &#x3D; horse fat in japanese, i don&#x27;t know).  if you&#x27;re ok with this ingredient, this may be a product that you are very happy with.  i just think everyone should know what they&#x27;re buying before they buy it (my vendor did NOT allow me to return it).</li>
            <li> Horse oil or not, I really wanted to like this product.  I love Dr. Ohira&#x27;s Kampuchu soap and thought I would like the moisturizer.  I used it for two weeks and ended up with flaky dry skin that I did not have before.  I have fair, sensitive skin, this product was not right for my skin type.</li>
            <li> This product is great. It moisturizes my skin and leaves it very soft. It helps smooth away rough spots from eczema. I went on a probiotic spree when I thought my eczema attack was a candida skin infection. This was one of the items I bought. Even though I only had an eczema break-out, this product is still in use today because it&#x27;s so awesome. It does what it says it&#x27;s going to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for those who rated this product lower based on the fact that it has an ingredient that may or may not be derived from horses, if you were that concerned with what goes in and on your body, you would research any unfamiliar ingredients to make sure they adhere to your standards before purchasing the product. I almost didn&#x27;t buy this product because of the bad ratings, but after reading the reasons for the bad reviews, I laughed. It&#x27;s not Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s fault, even if the item claimed to be vegan, still do your research. This probably won&#x27;t be the last time you put something on your body that you don&#x27;t like. And if the product does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do, why rate it lower? Just inform others without taking from it&#x27;s potential to sell to those who actually need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  Some of the reviews say it is greasy and it feels that way when you first put it on but that feeling goes away within a few seconds.  I actually like the product so much that I am going to get it again.  Try it and I think you will like it.</li>
            <li> This product left dry patches on my face.  I have very oily skin so this was surprising.  I gave my face a break and then tried again with half a pea size amount and received the same results.  I am using this product on areas of my body which it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother.  For me this product did not work well and I would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because I&#x27;ve only used it for 4 days but this is the best face lotion I have ever used. I suffer from mild adult acne and read about probiotics helping for it since acne creams kill good and bad bacteria. This stuff is a blessing for me. Almost everything breaks me out. This stuff has kind of an odd smell but it makes my skin so soft and calms it down really good. Not greasy at all and my skin just eats it up. I put it on and it just disappears into my skin instantly. So far hasn&#x27;t broke me out. I cant stop rubbing my cheeks because the are so soft. Will update if it ever starts breaking me out..</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of Magoroku for a yeast infection under my breasts.  The product is expensive, but in a few days, the rash&lt;br /&gt;was under control.  I also put this on my skin tags.  Works Great!&lt;br /&gt;Cindy</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve always struggled with acne on my chin and I&#x27;ve tried so many products.  I have been using the lotion and the bar soap for &#x27;about two months now and the acne is almost all gone, even the scaring is not as severe. I have even bought the lotion for many of my families members who struggle with acne because it worked so well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few months and have seen a different. This product is oily.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for a few years now and love how soft and clear my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;On this last purchase however, the consistency of the product was different.&lt;br /&gt;Almost like little micro-beads that seem to dissipate with body heat.&lt;br /&gt;I would return, but its a pain so I will just go with it.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This calmed down my dry parts of my face (around nose and mouth), and didn&#x27;t break me out like other creams. It looks like vaseline, but isn&#x27;t greasy at all. No fragrance either.</li>
            <li> i have been using this cream for quite a while now.&lt;br /&gt;my skin looks great and very healthy</li>
            <li> Have used several tubes of these.  It has a nice consistency and I like the company.  Plan to keep using for a long time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference from other lotion brand. It&#x27;s a small tube but for a lot more as in price. Its somewhat greasy. Only use it for dry areas.</li>
            <li> lovely product - use sparingly</li>
            <li> This stuff will fix you right up. If you have some kind of &amp;#34;irritation&amp;#34; going on on whatever part of the body it&#x27;s great. I use it everywhere and I&#x27;m surprised that so little goes a long way. I was a little disappointed at first when I saw the small tube and how much it costs, but I&#x27;m still using my first tube and I&#x27;ve spread this stuff on a lot of my body. I put half a pea size (if that) under my arms as deodorant and it works great to prevent stink. I&#x27;ve also used it on my bottom parts and it straightens stuff up over night, if not immediately. Great for delicate female parts that are a little out of wack, but I wouldn&#x27;t go all the way inside (if you know what I mean), I only do an external sweep. If you want to go that far,  that&#x27;s up to you.</li>
            <li> Really like this lotion. Less oily than the purple one. But both seem equal to me. I&#x27;m combining with internal candida cleansing and probiotic + enzymes, but have actually had to do benzoyl peroxide, too. Still a nice probiotic cream.</li>
            <li> I love this as you only have to use a little and it goes a long ways.  Buy it if you have dry skin.</li>
