            <li>the length is amazing.</li>
            <li>the quality is amazing.</li>
            <li>Came with its own wig cap, so that is a plus as well.</li>
            <li>but the color is nice.</li>
            <li>I loves this as soon as  I saw it here and loved it more when I git it.</li>
            <li>It came early, soft, great color, great length, great curls!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>And I love the cream highlights.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>IT LOVE LOVE IT</li>
            <li>ask me :who does your hair&amp;#34;  :)</li>
            <li>do love the wig, but it doesnt match the picture at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>This wig is really, really cute.</li>
            <li>Five out of five stars :)</li>
            <li>I also love the length of it.</li>
            <li>All in all the wig is cute but don&#x27;t let the picture fool you.</li>
            <li>I received this wig a lot faster than expected which is awesome!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to brush and does not get tangled up easily.</li>
            <li>I wish they would make a thicker more full version of this wig.</li>
            <li>I did have a chance to comb through the hair &amp; I basically used a boar bristle brush &amp; it worked perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I think it looks great, especially with a hat or headband.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many questions on it asking if it was real!</li>
            <li>Not as full.</li>
            <li>It looks good, fits good, feels good, but it&#x27;s a tad thin at the back.</li>
            <li>Overall I really liked it for the price</li>
            <li>The wig arrived right when scheduled.</li>
            <li>So pretty and soft LOVE</li>
            <li>The quality is very good, different tones within it make it look more natural and the fiber is hard to tangle and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>all excited to try on my new hair.</li>
            <li>I would definitely pay more for it.</li>
            <li>The pigtails are one of the reasons I bought this wig in the first place.</li>
            <li>It smelled kinda funny, like plastic, but it is synthetic</li>
            <li>It is really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase from this seller again. :-)</li>
            <li>Cute, more pink than blue.</li>
            <li>the hair color is true to the photo &amp; is sooo soft..</li>
            <li>but it still feels super soft.</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable too.&lt;br /&gt;people</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>however, i decided to just straighten it out with a flat iron and not only does it look amazing now</li>
            <li>Feels very real and soft.</li>
            <li>The hair is soft and a pretty color, though.</li>
            <li>but ill start with the good first.</li>
            <li>More pink than blue.</li>
            <li>My first impression was it is very soft and easy to brush, but the fringe is a little too long for me</li>
            <li>But when I opened it, it was shinier than expected, had more pink, wasn&#x27;t very soft and did not come with the clip in pigtails.</li>
            <li>It sucks because I love the color and its so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also like to mention it got here incredibly fast, only 8 business days!</li>
            <li>After cutting off a good 6 inches or so and shaping up the bangs a little bit, I&#x27;m overall pleased with this wig.</li>
            <li>I purchased some clip in extensions in the same color to hide the netting a little better, along with a white wig cap.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how soft and long it was.</li>
            <li>I bought this wig just to try out wig wearing in general.</li>
            <li>It is more matte so it doesn&#x27;t look as fake, but very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>The only flaw is that it sheds a little bit and the hair is a little thin in the back, but it looks pretty in pictures and was a great price.</li>
            <li>The wig is the exact shade of pink shown, and really long and silky.  </li>
            <li>The back is not thin like the other reviews described, in fact the wig is quite voluminous.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s barely any blue</li>
            <li>I love that there&#x27;s very subtle highlights and different dimensions to the color.</li>
            <li>I wish I had followed another reviewer&#x27;s suggestion and purchased a white wig cap, as the wefts/netting shows in the back if you don&#x27;t part it a certain way with a black cap.</li>

            <li> own.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs were really long and come down to the middle of my nose (and I don&#x27;t have a small face), which will be easy to fix</li>
            <li> This is the first wig I have tried on since 15 years ago when they used to be shiny ( at least the ones I tried on 15 years ago).</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it is a little thin and you can see the cap through the top but some careful styling and if you can, some extra wafts, should fix the problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Personally I would sugest a white wig cap to hide all hair that is not blonde instead of the black one that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I received this wig today and was amazed at how long the hair was.</li>
            <li> This wig was realtively long (as in the picture).</li>
            <li> And it arrived way earlier than I expected!</li>
            <li> The colors are also not has vibrant and kinda dull.</li>
            <li> and it went all the way down to my lower back.</li>
            <li> kinda on the thin side but its a pretty bubblegum pink.</li>
            <li> so thats to be expected.</li>
            <li> Pale enough to wear everyday without sticking out like the brighter colored wigs.</li>
            <li> The wig arrived a little over 2 weeks after I ordered it but still 3 weeks before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that the curls were REALLY tight when the picture shows wavy.</li>
            <li> From the 78cm its supposed to be its like half.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that it is a little thin but, that&#x27;s to be expected</li>
            <li> I got this wig in the mail today and immediately put it on before I ran a few errands.</li>
            <li> It feels a little fake but doesn&#x27;t look it at all.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s also on the thin side.</li>
            <li> Its kinda on the thin side,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely thin and you can see the cap through the hair.</li>
            <li> Righr now i&#x27;m so mad</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The wig is the exact shade of pink shown, and really long and silky.  It is adjustable inside, which is great for when I store it on a mannequin head vs my own.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs were really long and come down to the middle of my nose (and I don&#x27;t have a small face), which will be easy to fix but the hair likes to cling to all of my clothes, whether it&#x27;s cotton or satin, or or or.</li>
            <li> It looks good, fits good, feels good, but it&#x27;s a tad thin at the back. These are the only complaints that I can muster. Came with its own wig cap, so that is a plus as well.</li>
            <li> I was going to return it but curiosity got the best of me and I tried it on and I LOVE IT. Pale enough to wear everyday without sticking out like the brighter colored wigs. And I love the cream highlights. You can see the white cap through the hair until you comb or brush it out.I wish they would make a thicker more full version of this wig. I would definitely pay more for it. Feels very real and soft.Personally I would sugest a white wig cap to hide all hair that is not blonde instead of the black one that comes with it. LOVE IT LOVE LOVE IT</li>
            <li> The wig arrived a little over 2 weeks after I ordered it but still 3 weeks before the expected delivery date. It feels a little fake but doesn&#x27;t look it at all. I love that there&#x27;s very subtle highlights and different dimensions to the color. The only downside is that it is a little thin and you can see the cap through the top but some careful styling and if you can, some extra wafts, should fix the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s going on? I just got home from vacation all excited to try on my new hair. Well I just found the package all torn up and retaped with duct tape in my mailbox. I opened it to find the wig allfizzed up and so obviously cut. The bangs are so short, and the sides are just hacked. Then the back is all cut up. From the 78cm its supposed to be its like half. There&#x27;s only one adjustable strap. Has thia happened to anyone? It sucks because I love the color and its so soft. Righr now i&#x27;m so mad I can&#x27;t even type ggrrrrr!!!!!!</li>
            <li> kinda on the thin side but its a pretty bubblegum pink. I like it &amp; hope to find a thicker one of the same color.</li>
            <li> I received this wig today and was amazed at how long the hair was. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8&#x27;&#x27; and it went all the way down to my lower back. The hair is soft and a pretty color, though. After cutting off a good 6 inches or so and shaping up the bangs a little bit, I&#x27;m overall pleased with this wig. I wish I had followed another reviewer&#x27;s suggestion and purchased a white wig cap, as the wefts/netting shows in the back if you don&#x27;t part it a certain way with a black cap. I purchased some clip in extensions in the same color to hide the netting a little better, along with a white wig cap. The only flaw is that it sheds a little bit and the hair is a little thin in the back, but it looks pretty in pictures and was a great price.</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised and exaclty what I wanted / needed.  Shipping and packaging was good.  Price was reasonable too.&lt;br /&gt;people ask me :who does your hair&amp;#34;  :) lol</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast. the seller went above &amp; beyond to get the wig to me asap.&lt;br /&gt;I do love the wig, but it doesnt match the picture at all. the X&amp;Y ANGEL tag is no where inside the wig. More pink than blue. Not as full. You can see the mesh through the hair when sun hits it</li>
            <li> So I purchased this about six months ago, never received so I guess I&#x27;ll never get it. would not recommend at all</li>
            <li> the colours on this wig are amazing. the length is amazing. the quality is amazing. my only complaint is that the curls were REALLY tight when the picture shows wavy. however, i decided to just straighten it out with a flat iron and not only does it look amazing now but it still feels super soft. &#x3D;) very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I was very happy when it came. But when I opened it, it was shinier than expected, had more pink, wasn&#x27;t very soft and did not come with the clip in pigtails. The pigtails are one of the reasons I bought this wig in the first place. The back is not thin like the other reviews described, in fact the wig is quite voluminous. It&#x27;s okay I guess but I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> The wig cane tangled and i wasn&#x27;t very happy with that but the color is nice.It looks great for my lolita cosplay besides the tangles tips</li>
            <li> I have a lot of complaints about this wig... but ill start with the good first. It came early, soft, great color, great length, great curls! BUT it does not come with the clip in ponytails it shows in the picture and there&#x27;s barely any blue, it&#x27;s also on the thin side. It&#x27;s a 50/50 chance with this wig some people r very pleased with it and others like me get not so great ones</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shiny, but I can just wash it in fabric softener probably. Cute, more pink than blue.</li>
            <li> The wig arrived right when scheduled. The quality is very good, different tones within it make it look more natural and the fiber is hard to tangle and easy to comb through. Personally I would trim the bangs but that is my preference. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I loves this as soon as  I saw it here and loved it more when I git it. So pretty and soft LOVE</li>
            <li> I bought this wig just to try out wig wearing in general. I was very surprised at how soft and long it was. It smelled kinda funny, like plastic, but it is synthetic so thats to be expected. Its kinda on the thin side, but like I said, you get what you paid for. Overall I really liked it for the price and it was perfect for what I was wanting. The color and style is just like the photo. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> This wig is really, really cute. It looks great on me and I never want to take it off. It is really soft and smooth. It&#x27;s easy to brush and does not get tangled up easily. I&#x27;ve gotten many questions on it asking if it was real! I really like this product and it was quicker getting here than it said it would have been. Five out of five stars :)</li>
            <li> I received this wig a lot faster than expected which is awesome! It also came with a wig cap &amp; instructions. the hair color is true to the photo &amp; is sooo soft..I also love the length of it. It reaches just below my ribcage. I did have a chance to comb through the hair &amp; I basically used a boar bristle brush &amp; it worked perfectly fine. I will definitely purchase from this seller again. :-)</li>
            <li> I often buy wigs for specific occasions. The color is spot on to the picture. My only issue is that it is a little thin but, that&#x27;s to be expected and I have no issue with it. The seller left the cutest card with the package!! And it arrived way earlier than I expected! I would definitely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the picture at all besides the colors and even then still looks nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> This wig was realtively long (as in the picture). She loves it</li>
            <li> All in all the wig is cute but don&#x27;t let the picture fool you. It&#x27;s extremely thin and you can see the cap through the hair. So if you plan on not wearing a hat with it then do not buy. The colors are also not has vibrant and kinda dull.</li>
            <li> I got this wig in the mail today and immediately put it on before I ran a few errands. My first impression was it is very soft and easy to brush, but the fringe is a little too long for me so I pushed it to the side until I can get it trimmed. This is the first wig I have tried on since 15 years ago when they used to be shiny ( at least the ones I tried on 15 years ago). It is more matte so it doesn&#x27;t look as fake, but very soft and silky. I wore it to the beauty supply place where I heard some ladies talking about how they wanted to dye their hair similar to mine, and when I checked out the clerk shyly asked how I got my hair this color. She admitted she was a hairdresser so I took that as the ultimate compliment! Some people will believe, some probably won&#x27;t. But who cares? I think it looks great, especially with a hat or headband. I posted a picture. I&#x27;d also like to mention it got here incredibly fast, only 8 business days!</li>
