            <li>This is a timeless classic, would also think that this would great to wear when near a beach.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about their customer service.  </li>
            <li>I was really concerned about dropping 70 bucks on a bottle of cologne online with as many fakes that are going around, but this seems legit.</li>
            <li>I have been satisfied, for the most part, with purchases through Amazon, but will have to rethink future purchases.</li>
            <li>I like using it during daytime because it smells cool and fresh.</li>
            <li>Smells good, lasts long, all is well.</li>
            <li>What is wonderful about this scent is that it lasts all day long and only seems to get &amp;#34;warmer&amp;#34; over the course of the day.  </li>
            <li>You might also be interested to know, that Acqua Di Gio DOES NOT COME IN A COLOGNE!  </li>
            <li>Has a nice light dry scent, with fruit and lavender tones.  </li>

            <li>like it very much.</li>
            <li>The price is much better than department stores and the product is exactly the same!</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what it was described as.</li>
            <li>This edition of the gio bottle is much better, its a vast improvement over the 3.3 ounce bottle i had.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to any guy who wants the ladies to take notice!</li>
            <li>We ordered this item pretty close to the date we needed it and just figured it wouldn&#x27;t get here in time.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last for more than couple of hours.  </li>
            <li>I go exactly what I wanted when it was promised to me.</li>
            <li>Shipped immediately, was exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>It arrived earlier than expected and in great shape.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll still smell like Acqua di Gio after a few hours of dancing and having fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cologne comes in a nice, simple, but elegant bottle and the spray mechanism doesn&#x27;t squirt out cologne at you like others do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my 3.4 oz bottle for a couple years now, and when deciding on which new cologne to purchase, I keep coming back to this one because of its captivating scent.</li>
            <li>the entire neighborhood know you have cologne on, but it&#x27;s strong and firm enough to keep you smelling attractive throughout the evening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is the real stuff.</li>
            <li>This edition is real and not a rendition.</li>
            <li>The pump sprays way too much as well.</li>
            <li>The company who shipped this product got it out fast.</li>
            <li>It was everything I thought it would be service was fast</li>
            <li>Additionally, Amazon was VERY understanding with cancelling this order.  </li>
            <li>$68 for a knock off, or $78 for the real thing in a Dept. Store.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and packed well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough that a woman could wear it if she wanted to.</li>
            <li>The bottle and box of it is a bit off from the real one also.</li>
            <li>It gives me a certain great smell only I usually have.</li>
            <li>Acqua Di Gio is hands down one of my favorite scents straight out of the bottle, but because it does not hold it&#x27;s almost like wearing nothing.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff plain and simple.</li>
            <li>Based on the bottle matching the serial number on the box I&#x27;m guessing it was authentic, but I still have a little pondering.  </li>
            <li>do not waste money on this cologne !!</li>
            <li>I like the smell of this by far, but once you put it on, you cannot smell it nor can much of anyone else.  </li>
            <li>my wife loves it&#x27;s gentle and masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>He loves it so much that when the first bottle was getting low</li>
            <li>Only a little bit of Acqua di Gio will get you smelling really nice-</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive but is worth it.</li>
            <li>This product may look similar to the real thing but, have this very diffrent smell to it.</li>
            <li>Cologne last much longer than Toilette water!  </li>
            <li>But, that being said with most fragrances I usually will experience notes of them throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Everything was going well at first, I was sitting with family in the middle of the bleachers.</li>
            <li>I looked back and saw my family trampled by stiletto heeled vixens in hot pursuit of me.</li>
            <li>I bought it at half of the original cost</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Eau De Toilette Natural Spray\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s just second to none, really.</li>
            <li>I believe most of these reviews are either by people who never owned the real Acqua Di Gio, or they are associated with the fake company selling these knock-offs.  </li>
            <li>As I barreled down the halls, I saw grandparents and babies being flung from photo ops left and right by the viscous pack of estrogen</li>
            <li>I really will by with you other product.</li>

            <li> Kind of expensive but is worth it.</li>
            <li> This product may look similar to the real thing but, have this very diffrent smell to it.</li>
            <li> Cologne last much longer than Toilette water!  </li>
            <li> But, that being said with most fragrances I usually will experience notes of them throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Everything was going well at first, I was sitting with family in the middle of the bleachers.</li>
            <li> I looked back and saw my family trampled by stiletto heeled vixens in hot pursuit of me.</li>

            <li> &lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Eau De Toilette Natural Spray\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just second to none, really.</li>
            <li> I believe most of these reviews are either by people who never owned the real Acqua Di Gio, or they are associated with the fake company selling these knock-offs.  </li>
            <li> As I barreled down the halls, I saw grandparents and babies being flung from photo ops left and right by the viscous pack of estrogen</li>
            <li> I really will by with you other product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m personally conservative about the amount of fragrance I use because so many people are sensitive and too much is just awful.  </li>

            <li> it stays on for a long time..</li>
            <li> and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This scent is somewhat foreign to my teenage friends (lady and non lady friends).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as previous bottles I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was afraid after placing the order that I would end up with an fake not the real stuff.  </li>
            <li> Acqua di gio is great, but the cologne I received was a knockoff and smelled terrible</li>
            <li> Please read the description carefully.  </li>
            <li> There ARE other Gio products listed as \\&quot;Eau De Toilette\\&quot;, but this one was not.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NOT WORTH</li>
            <li> Is it not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> nothing less than 5 stars</li>
            <li> Hordes of black robed succubi hurled themselves on to the bleachers in my direction.</li>
            <li> This was an expensive purchase on my fixed income, and I do not have the time, nor the money to replace before his b&#x27;day!  </li>
            <li> I am always a little hesitant when buying fragrances online, always worried I am going to end up with a \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; off the product I purchased; this was not the case.</li>

            <li> I bought this a few months ago and have had nothing but compliments about it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A GOOD MIX ....THE LADIES JUST LOVE THIS SMELL..&lt;br /&gt;MEN FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES WHEN WEARING THIS SENT..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONLY ONE TO WEAR......</li>
            <li> This is the only time that buying something from amazon was bad. I got a bottle of water. But that&#x27;s life I reckon.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B005IZC19K Giorgio Armani Acqua Di Gio Cologne for Men, 3.4 Fluid Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was ordering \\&quot;cologne\\&quot;--NOT Toilette spray!!!!!!  This product says to&lt;br /&gt;be cologne, but when I rec&#x27;d it (ordered for my son&#x27;s 40th B&#x27;day), the box says&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Eau De Toilette Natural Spray\\&quot;.  I double checked the site &amp; nothing in the description shows SPRAY, EXCEPT... in the smallest of letters on the picture of the&lt;br /&gt;box (I had to get my magnifying glass out) it shows to be \\&quot;Toilette Spray\\&quot;.  Extremely mis-represented!!!!!!  Nothing on the box says \\&quot;cologne\\&quot;.  There ARE other Gio products listed as \\&quot;Eau De Toilette\\&quot;, but this one was not.  I have been satisfied, for the most part, with purchases through Amazon, but will have to rethink future purchases. This was an expensive purchase on my fixed income, and I do not have the time, nor the money to replace before his b&#x27;day!  Needless to say,&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely UPSET!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The transaction was quick and easy. The product arrived as described and was properly packaged. I am always a little hesitant when buying fragrances online, always worried I am going to end up with a \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; off the product I purchased; this was not the case. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Love the fragrance of this EDT. I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of looks from the ladies as well!</li>
            <li> After trying to save money, I bought my boyfriend this cologne from ebay to replace his that was out. Turns out they sell knock offs there and it didnt smell anything close! So I went on amazon and paid a bit more but it is the real stuff. Definitely will just buy it here from now on. Love this cologne. It smells so good!</li>
            <li> My husband has worn this cologne since I met him 11 years ago. He is almost out, so I looked on Amazon to see if I could find it. The price is much better than department stores and the product is exactly the same! I&#x27;ll be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I promise you. This edition is real and not a rendition. It stays on all day and it smells great. It&#x27;s got a sweet smell to it and all the ladies love it. If you want to stand put from the crowd by smelling your best then you want this. It&#x27;s by far one of my most favorite edt&#x27;s. I use it one a daily basis and this is enough to last you 6 months with 4 to 5 sprays a day!</li>
            <li> Acqua di gio is great, but the cologne I received was a knockoff and smelled terrible it wasn&#x27;t even NIB like advertised and the moron that I bought it from refused to give me my money back. 0 stars.</li>
            <li> The top of the spray does not work effectively! The fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem the same scent as before and I have and I have used for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> When you hear the word \\&quot;classic,\\&quot; you might think \\&quot;over established,\\&quot; \\&quot;cliche,\\&quot; \\&quot;old,\\&quot; or even \\&quot;boring.\\&quot; No, not this guy. Every time I put it on, it&#x27;s still very refreshing, chic, attention-grabbing, and just plain attractive. I&#x27;ve had my 3.4 oz bottle for a couple years now, and when deciding on which new cologne to purchase, I keep coming back to this one because of its captivating scent. Not to mention, the scent actually stays on your body for quite some time if you spray it on properly, so you don&#x27;t have to keep using it throughout the night. You&#x27;ll still smell like Acqua di Gio after a few hours of dancing and having fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cologne comes in a nice, simple, but elegant bottle and the spray mechanism doesn&#x27;t squirt out cologne at you like others do. Only a little bit of Acqua di Gio will get you smelling really nice- it&#x27;s not a musky, overpowering cologne that lets the entire neighborhood know you have cologne on, but it&#x27;s strong and firm enough to keep you smelling attractive throughout the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just second to none, really.</li>
            <li> This is not cologne as described in the title of the product it is \\&quot;Eau De Toilette\\&quot;.  Cologne last much longer than Toilette water!  false advertising.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as previous bottles I have purchased. I am not sure if this is 100% Armani.</li>
            <li> i just get on the mail this pice of crap, is not even close to smell like the giorgio i dont know how or were the seller get tis product but it is a pice of crap, i´m so desapointed a waste of money and the worst is that they not acept returns. dont buy it you will end with a bottle of 5 dolars perfume.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, very good quality, exactly the same expected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Love It / Excellent / Very Good / Very Good Quality</li>
            <li> Read the 5-star reviews. Some of them sound fake to me, and they are top-recommended. I have been using this product for years, and this is the kind of rendition you&#x27;d find in the bathrooms of a nightclub (cheap knock-off). This product is watered-down, does NOT smell the same at all, and you have to spray it multiple times to even notice it&#x27;s on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon will NOT let me return this item because it is a liquid, so once you order, you are stuck unless you are able to get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the Amazon customer service numbers for anyone who makes the mistake of purchasing this knock-off:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U.S. and Canada: 1-866-216-1072&lt;br /&gt;Spanish Support: 866-749-7538&lt;br /&gt;International: 1-206-266-2992</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this by far, but once you put it on, you cannot smell it nor can much of anyone else.  The pump sprays way too much as well.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t buy fragances like this from a reputable source the, you don&#x27;t know what your are going to get. I was able to save&lt;br /&gt;15-20% and have it delivered to my door. This suff is overpriced everywhere but you can save here on Amazon. It came in&lt;br /&gt;quickly well packed and is the OEM product.</li>
            <li> This scent is somewhat foreign to my teenage friends (lady and non lady friends). That means it is both unique and good at the same time. It gives me a certain great smell only I usually have. Those Axe commercials? This will give you that confidence.</li>
            <li> Ole spice look out. There is GIO for my husband now. It has A soft smell I enjoyed the feel.</li>
            <li> si quieres impresionar a tu pareja con un perfume aqui esta lo que lo que buscabas&lt;br /&gt;yo lo he comprado 3 veces y aun sigue siendo encantador.</li>
            <li> I got mine after reading a review on top men prefume online and decided to try it. It has a light, aquatic, and teeny bit of flowery scent which I believe is jasmine. I like using it during daytime because it smells cool and fresh. Although it still can be used at night depending on your preference.</li>
            <li> Just the best smell a man can possibly have!  The ordering was simple, the packaging was easy to open and kept the bottle safe!  This is so worth the money - smells like SEX!</li>
            <li> I liked a lot this product, Thanks for all and for a faster shippment. I really will by with you other product.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what it was described as. I got this product for my boyfriend for valentines day and he loved it.</li>
            <li> This edition of the gio bottle is much better, its a vast improvement over the 3.3 ounce bottle i had.</li>
            <li> i really love this spray...i will be it over and over again...it stays on for a long time..i can even smell it on my shirt/sweater the next day...nothing less than 5 stars</li>
            <li> This has to be the best colgne on the market. I just love the smell and so does my wife.</li>
            <li> What can I say, Gio is the best. my wife loves it&#x27;s gentle and masculine scent.  this is truly one of the few really great scents for men everywhere.  I would recommend to any guy who wants the ladies to take notice!</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas gift for my son in-law. This is his favorite calonge and one of the things he asked for.</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne for everyday wear, especially sporty and/or warm weather occasions.  Has a nice light dry scent, with fruit and lavender tones.  This is a timeless classic, would also think that this would great to wear when near a beach.</li>
            <li> I have always worn either Jovan Grass Oil or Paco Rabanne.......I wear this cologne and I always have at least one comment.  They just love the smell.  What is wonderful about this scent is that it lasts all day long and only seems to get &amp;#34;warmer&amp;#34; over the course of the day.  A dear female friend gave me a hug and it lingered a lot longer then usual.....because she was &#x27;sniffing&amp;#34; me.  As I mentioned before.....colognes/scents smell different on different people.  In my case this product is a hit.  I am very happy with it.  Jon</li>
            <li> i bought this for my husband and it smells amazing, very sexy , both he and i like the smell of it and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> We ordered this item pretty close to the date we needed it and just figured it wouldn&#x27;t get here in time.  We were OK with that.  However, it actually arrived 2 days ahead of our need-by date!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to all who made that happen!</li>
            <li> I bought this product online and I received it on Nov 30.  This seem to be adulterated one.  The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last for more than couple of hours.  I am re-posting this comment because they removed my comment. The s***tiest product I ever bought in Amazon. Totally pissed off with the vendor!</li>
            <li> The company who shipped this product got it out fast. I love this smell, I buy it for my husband every time he runs out. He&#x27;s been wearing it for years.</li>
            <li> It was everything I thought it would be service was fast and I receive as stated. I bought it at half of the original cost so I am a happy shopper.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was afraid after placing the order that I would end up with an fake not the real stuff.  I am so happy to say, that it was really the GIO! Arrived on time, and the bottle was lot bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> No matter who you are how you look like.. This is a girl killer.. Girls will eat you and smell you all over.</li>
            <li> I wear this brand of cologne and went online to try to save over the costs at the mall. This was a great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Notice the description, MADE IN China.  This is a FRENCH cologne that is not made in china.  Please read the description carefully.  Beware!  Additionally, Amazon was VERY understanding with cancelling this order.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about their customer service.  I believe most of these reviews are either by people who never owned the real Acqua Di Gio, or they are associated with the fake company selling these knock-offs.  $68 for a knock off, or $78 for the real thing in a Dept. Store.  IT&#x27;S NOT WORTH IT PEOPLE!  You might also be interested to know, that Acqua Di Gio DOES NOT COME IN A COLOGNE!  It is, and has always been Eau De Toilette.  The ONLY thing close is a concentrated product re-released called \\&quot;Acqua Di Gio Essenza\\&quot;.  Once again, proving this is FAKE FAKE FAKE!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago and have had nothing but compliments about it. Great delivery time from amazon and very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne that can be worn with almost all occasions.  Definitely will continue purchasing in the future.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I smelt acqua de gio before and this does not smell anything like it! It&#x27;s obvious that this is really fake.</li>
            <li> Acqua Di Gio is hands down one of my favorite scents straight out of the bottle, but because it does not hold it&#x27;s almost like wearing nothing.  I&#x27;m personally conservative about the amount of fragrance I use because so many people are sensitive and too much is just awful.  But, that being said with most fragrances I usually will experience notes of them throughout the day.  Not with Acqua di Gio.  In fact it&#x27;s so light that I wondered if I had gotten a knock off.  Based on the bottle matching the serial number on the box I&#x27;m guessing it was authentic, but I still have a little pondering.  I guess I&#x27;ll need to get a sample from a store and see if it holds longer.  If anyone knows of a similiar scent that has more hold I&#x27;d appreciate knowing.  Cheers!</li>
            <li> I go exactly what I wanted when it was promised to me. Good stuff plain and simple. My girl loves it. Thx</li>
            <li> Company was amazing to deal with.  Great product and great packaging.  Item arrived on time.  Also item was priced at a very good price.  Will definitely deal with them again.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this cologne.  Have had multiple complements on the scent.  I would recommend this product with out hesitation!</li>
            <li> Please send help. I&#x27;m reviewing this from my mobile device. I wore this cologne to my cousin&#x27;s college graduation, and it may have been the worst mistake I&#x27;ve ever made. Everything was going well at first, I was sitting with family in the middle of the bleachers. As the ceremony began, I noticed a change in the female students. They became alert, and agitated, sniffing at the air. It was as if there was a fresh kill in the water, and the sharks were taking notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, one of them made eye contact with me and it was a chain reaction... Hordes of black robed succubi hurled themselves on to the bleachers in my direction. I panicked, and ran for the exit. I looked back and saw my family trampled by stiletto heeled vixens in hot pursuit of me. I felt a tear leave my cheek, knowing I could not help them. As I barreled down the halls, I saw grandparents and babies being flung from photo ops left and right by the viscous pack of estrogen mongers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently barricaded in a janitor&#x27;s closet. Thankfully he was in here, and able to save himself. Unfortunately, his English is very broken, and I didn&#x27;t take Ukrainian as a second language. I have 15% battery life, and low signal. Damn this wretched cologne. I fear it will be the end of me.</li>
            <li> i loved this cologne it s,ells very good and i get great reviews from it thank you for it keep it up</li>
            <li> Shipped immediately, was exactly what I was expecting.  5 stars across the board, would definitly purchase this product with them again</li>
            <li> I was really concerned about dropping 70 bucks on a bottle of cologne online with as many fakes that are going around, but this seems legit. Smells good, lasts long, all is well. Shipping was fast and packed well.</li>
            <li> This Cologne is a weak version of the original. Is it not worth the money at all. I can not believe Armani would allow illegal copycats in China to copy their fragrance, so they must be in on the scam !! do not waste money on this cologne !!</li>
            <li> I have already used this cologne which I have been told by the women I work with they like it very much. Why else get it?&lt;br /&gt;The service from the seller was good, and they sent the item out very quickly. It was well packed in order to prevent damage.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite scent and mine, too. It&#x27;s light enough that a woman could wear it if she wanted to.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s second bottle of this cologne. He loves it so much that when the first bottle was getting low he said &amp;#34;We have to get another bottle.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Order this cologne online becasue it was easier and less expensive than running to the department store.  I am very pleased with the results.  It arrived earlier than expected and in great shape.</li>
            <li> This is a great product with a long lasting unique and fresh scent. Kind of expensive but is worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 2 teenage boys. It&#x27;s not so strong and it smells clean and fresh. They love it!</li>
            <li> Best smelling cologne ever, hands down. Stays on 8+ hours, isnt overbearing or too strong.  Thats all you need to know.</li>
            <li> This product may look similar to the real thing but, have this very diffrent smell to it. I&#x27;ve tried the real one before and it have a rich smell to it and this one doesn&#x27;t that. The bottle and box of it is a bit off from the real one also.</li>
