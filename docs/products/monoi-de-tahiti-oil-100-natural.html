            <li>It smells amazing!</li>
            <li>The absolute BEST deal on the wonderful Tahitian Coconut Oil!</li>
            <li>But it feels so good on your skin.</li>
            <li>Great buy and love the product.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, hair feels great.</li>
            <li>I love it and have shared some with a good friend of mine.</li>
            <li>The absolute best moisturizing as well as sealing all-in-one product.</li>
            <li>the coconut oil is light and smooth with the infusion of tiarre flowers it is exquisite.</li>
            <li>Excellent oil, soaks right in and smells fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Just catch what leaks out and start rubbin&#x27; it in :) In the winter I would melt it and transfer it to a cosmetic jar, since it has a tendency to soilidify, even in a warm bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Will order more.</li>
            <li>Love it love it love it.</li>
            <li>but the I love the scent and it works.</li>
            <li>It would be better if it came in a jar that would allow me to use my fingers to get the oil out and then have it emulsify in my hands before applying.</li>
            <li>This oil is just lovely - I close my eyes and can easily picture being somewhere tropical.</li>
            <li>Really nice very soothing!!</li>
            <li>(like most every true oil)  I just plop the bottle with me in the shower or the bath and have no issues.</li>
            <li>Pure and lovely!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already a huge fan of coconut oil</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m getting ready, I don&#x27;t like the idea that I have to warm it up to get the oil out.</li>
            <li>The scent is beautiful and it lasts all day long without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>I will warn, however, that the scent with this particular product is very strong.</li>
            <li>and the air is full of dust.</li>
            <li>Sweet and strong at first but will mellow after you wear it for a bit.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I never liked flowery perfume, however, this stuff is so sweet and tropical and feels so good on, I love it.</li>
            <li>Letting it melt all the way would make it easy to transfer to a different container if you&#x27;re worried about being able to get to all the product there at the end.</li>
            <li>Still, I Highly recommend buying this, use it everywhere, even in your hair (way better than v05 hot oil).</li>
            <li>This is well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft and lovely scent</li>
            <li>Rich smell and real ingredients.</li>
            <li>Simply set some place warm or remove some from container and rub on, melts really fast and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I had my glass jars ready when I placed my order!</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!</li>
            <li>Scent is better when you wash with an unscented soap such as glycerine.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil!</li>
            <li>It does seem a little weaker in aroma than the first Monoi I bought elsewhere a year ago, but still nice.</li>
            <li>When looking for a true Monoi de Tahiti, you want one that has only 2 ingredients: Coconut Oil and Tiare&#x27; Flower.</li>
            <li>Not exactly as I expected as it does not liquify until you run hot water over it.  </li>
            <li>This smells amazing and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I would even describe it as cloyingly sweet when it hasn&#x27;t been diluted with other oils or carriers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, good for dry skin-but again only small amount.</li>
            <li>i have used many oils over the years; and this is my no. 1 favorite!</li>
            <li>Really helps with wintery dry skin and the winter blues because the smell is so lush and tropical.</li>
            <li>iwas just noticing today how soft my skin has gotten from using this daily for over a month!</li>
            <li>the aroma is subtle, enough to make a wonderful scent; all natural with no chemicals or artificial scents.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> You have to melt it to use it.</li>
            <li> Smells like heaven. I love this stuff. The oil is solid at room temperature but warms up in the bath. But it feels so good on your skin. Really helps with wintery dry skin and the winter blues because the smell is so lush and tropical. I want to use it every bath now.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my hair shiny all week.  I love it and have shared some with a good friend of mine.</li>
            <li> Really nice very soothing!! Will but again.</li>
            <li> Best Moisturizing oil ever!! Smells great!</li>
            <li> Not exactly as I expected as it does not liquify until you run hot water over it.  This is the nature of the product.  It works well and smells great.</li>
            <li> The absolute BEST deal on the wonderful Tahitian Coconut Oil! Hair, skin, nails. . . The absolute best moisturizing as well as sealing all-in-one product. This seller takes the cost of bringing it to you OUT! No fancy packaging. I had my glass jars ready when I placed my order! Ordering more today!!</li>
            <li> Finally, an oil like the one I purchased in Tahiti!! Rich smell and real ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal! When looking for a true Monoi de Tahiti, you want one that has only 2 ingredients: Coconut Oil and Tiare&#x27; Flower. All others are stinky imposters.  This is well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Keep in mind that Coconut oil is solid until exposed to 70+ degrees (air temp). So...if you order in the Fall or Winter, it will arrive in solid form. Simply set some place warm or remove some from container and rub on, melts really fast and absorbs quickly. If you order closer to summer it will probably arrive liquidy so be prepared for it to spill over a bit when you open it. Just catch what leaks out and start rubbin&#x27; it in :) In the winter I would melt it and transfer it to a cosmetic jar, since it has a tendency to soilidify, even in a warm bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If you have not used Monoi de Tahiti before, it smells like Gardenias; smooth,sweet, with no bite. Sweet and strong at first but will mellow after you wear it for a bit.  Personally, I never liked flowery perfume, however, this stuff is so sweet and tropical and feels so good on, I love it. And for me the scent will last for Hours and hours. Scent is better when you wash with an unscented soap such as glycerine. That way no other scent on your skin will interact with and therefor, corrupt the pure scent of this Monoi.&lt;br /&gt;  This one comes from Luxuriant-Sparkle Beauty Products. It does seem a little weaker in aroma than the first Monoi I bought elsewhere a year ago, but still nice. And that could just be me since it is spring here and the air is full of dust. Still, I Highly recommend buying this, use it everywhere, even in your hair (way better than v05 hot oil).</li>
            <li> Pure and lovely! It smells amazing! Will order more.</li>
            <li> this oil is excellant! i have used many oils over the years; and this is my no. 1 favorite! the coconut oil is light and smooth with the infusion of tiarre flowers it is exquisite. iwas just noticing today how soft my skin has gotten from using this daily for over a month! the aroma is subtle, enough to make a wonderful scent; all natural with no chemicals or artificial scents. divine! my only complaint is the plastic bottle it comes in; however i put it in the sun then transfered to a glass jar.</li>
            <li> Use it on my hair-only very small amount. Smells wonderful! Also, good for dry skin-but again only small amount. A little bit of this product goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Soft and lovely scent, I use it in my bath to help hydration of my skin and hair. Works wonders for both.</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it. Great moisturizer and the scent is divine</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and a little goes a long way.  This will now be in my regular line up.</li>
            <li> This oil is just lovely - I close my eyes and can easily picture being somewhere tropical. I&#x27;m already a huge fan of coconut oil so the combination seemed like a no-brainer for me.  I will warn, however, that the scent with this particular product is very strong. I would even describe it as cloyingly sweet when it hasn&#x27;t been diluted with other oils or carriers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the oil does solidify in cooler temperatures. (like most every true oil)  I just plop the bottle with me in the shower or the bath and have no issues. Letting it melt all the way would make it easy to transfer to a different container if you&#x27;re worried about being able to get to all the product there at the end.</li>
            <li> Great buy and love the product.  Use it sparingly as it is oil if placing it in your hair but the I love the scent and it works.</li>
            <li> This product meets my expectations. I add a small amount to other lotions ,or hair products for extra moisture and shine. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really like this oil! The scent is beautiful and it lasts all day long without being overpowering. The only thing that I don&#x27;t care for is the bottle it comes in. When I&#x27;m getting ready, I don&#x27;t like the idea that I have to warm it up to get the oil out. It&#x27;s a bit of a hassle of I don&#x27;t put it in the microwave before using it. It would be better if it came in a jar that would allow me to use my fingers to get the oil out and then have it emulsify in my hands before applying. That is, however, the only complaint that I have.</li>
            <li> Excellent oil, soaks right in and smells fabulous.  Makes my hair very healthy too!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, hair feels great.</li>
