            <li>These were perfect.  </li>
            <li>I think the size of this kit is perfect for sampling colors.</li>
            <li>It was sent in excellent packaging.  </li>
            <li>it is awesome</li>
            <li>Either way I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the colors.</li>
            <li>This was the perfect size for a stocking stuffer.  </li>
            <li>Awesome colors, I loved them all!</li>
            <li>i would say great mini set with 3 great colors!</li>

            <li>I think the sets are great for gifts or to just test out the colors.</li>
            <li>the Drama are probably great fits for you.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a great price for four MINI</li>
            <li>Great colors.</li>
            <li>OPI does really good Neutrals that work great with all skin tones.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t as good for applying the nail polish evenly.</li>
            <li>Good for taking on weekend get-a-ways</li>
            <li>She loved the names of the nailpoishes too.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try these and was delighted they came as a set of mini bottles.</li>
            <li>9 year-old daughter loved it.  </li>
            <li>She loves the Pirates of the Carribean movies and loved the color selection.</li>
            <li>Good buying experience.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this purchase, I love OPI products and was happy I didn&#x27;t have order each full size separately.</li>
            <li>The Mini&#x27;s are great for travel, but the full-size works better because of the brush design etc.</li>
            <li>, very interesting.</li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;m really glad I tried before I bought!</li>
            <li>Stayed on great after going on so easy,</li>
            <li>The product&#x27;s packaging is cute, and the colors are nice.</li>
            <li>The colors look great on me and it worked out really well!</li>
            <li>Otherwise cute product, and</li>
            <li>This was a great way to try them without having to buy a whole bottle that I may not even like.  </li>
            <li>I love this mini pack.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I also put a sparkly coat on top &amp; it looks even better.</li>
            <li>I love all the colors that came with the set.</li>
            <li>i love all of the colors in this mini set</li>
            <li>This set does not include Mermaid&#x27;s Tears, which is my favorite color from this collection.</li>
            <li>However, I bought it for my teenage granddaughter who loved it!  </li>
            <li>the colors look super cute in the bag</li>
            <li>No regrets, though, they are unique pastel shades, great for the spring and winter!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Liked the idea of getting to try different samples so I could pick out which one I really liked.</li>
            <li>FAST DELIVERY!!!</li>
            <li>The colors in this kit are pretty light, therefore, you need more than one application.   </li>
            <li>the other colors are awesome and stay on a good week with minimal touchoups over all</li>
            <li>I love OPI and I especially love these little sets they put out that let me try the most popular colors from a new line before I buy the larger size.  </li>
            <li>They are so small and cute!!!</li>
            <li>I was really glad to get this set of mini bottles from the Pirate collection, which had a number of colors I was interested in trying but wasn&#x27;t sure I could really pull off.  </li>
            <li>I even really like the \\&quot;Skull and Glossbones\\&quot; using the Shatter over the top</li>
            <li>i really loved the colors in this set except for skulls and crossbones the white polish in the set.</li>
            <li>I do not care much for the greyish color and the whitish one is okay as well.</li>
            <li>I needed something to get me out of my bold colors stage.  </li>
            <li>I did purchase the normal size bottle of Mermaid&#x27;s Tears and am in love with it still.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>This is a great little set if you want to try the nail polish on, but do not want to buy all of them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful, and as usual with OPI, the name are fun.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this for myself plus gifted it to a relative.</li>
            <li>Thanks !</li>
            <li>I am sure that I will run out of the pink and purple ones soon.  </li>
            <li>i really ended up liking the color</li>
            <li>If you want something really soft and pale (in a bubble gum kind of way), the Planks</li>
            <li>I want the most!&lt;br /&gt;The nail polish itself is thinner than average, I needed good 2 thick coats to make it look good on my nails, versus the one I usually need for my OPI nail polishes.</li>
            <li>i bought this to test out the new collection.</li>
            <li>am actually buying a full size of the purple and the pastel green, which I was not going to originally.</li>
            <li>less than two weeks)and found it to be in fantastic condition.</li>
            <li>The colors are so cool, especially with the Silver Shatter or Teenage Dream as a top-coat.</li>
            <li>i completely recommend it to any body</li>
            <li>The other two are great for neutral contrasting, although I feel strange wearing something that mimics the color of dried human bones.</li>
            <li>OPI is high quality, but I didn&#x27;t read the fine print these are very small bottles, approximately 5ml, I think, not much paint, pretty cute however.</li>
            <li>The colors are very flat and lack dimension, but I suppose that&#x27;s why they are paired with the crackle (not included in this particular set).  </li>
            <li>I almost always find at least one that I want to have, and sometimes more, but this collection is just washed out and strange to me.  </li>

            <li> Since they are mini&#x27;s they won&#x27;t last long if you wear them regulary, but since I don&#x27;t I like their size.</li>
            <li> but if she didn&#x27;t like them, they are the mini bottles, so they won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was a lot less excited about the colors...  </li>
            <li> I also decided I am not getting the pink one, and that is because I found out I have tons of shades like that.</li>
            <li> However, I do like the pink and purple colors.</li>
            <li> The only thing that was a bit of a bummer is that the small bottles come with small brushes inside of them.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering from them since they took the time to contact me and got the order figured out after the shipping was late!</li>
            <li> I like this little set and that is my point here.</li>
            <li> i though i would hate and hating the color i originally wanted.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure about stranger tides.</li>
            <li> I am not very happy and will be filing a claim with them.</li>
            <li> Colors were a little dull and disappointing.  </li>
            <li> &quot; they really mean it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to tell the difference between the Skull &amp; Crossbones and the Stranger Tides (which is a little closer to a seafoam neutral)</li>
            <li> and they both just look dirty to me.  </li>
            <li> i wont be wearing these :(</li>
            <li> but when you put them on your nails, they look bad!</li>

            <li> Awesome colors, I loved them all! Delivery was fast and easy. I suggest these colors to anyone who likes OPI</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s packaging is cute, and the colors are nice. Though when they say \\&quot;mini,\\&quot; they really mean it! The bottles are tiny: they&#x27;re about the size of a cap on the regular bottles of OPI. Otherwise cute product, and I think the sets are great for gifts or to just test out the colors.</li>
            <li> I love OPI and I especially love these little sets they put out that let me try the most popular colors from a new line before I buy the larger size.

If you want something really soft and pale (in a bubble gum kind of way), the Planks a Lot and Sparrow Me the Drama are probably great fits for you.  That said, I&#x27;m really glad I tried before I bought!</li>
            <li> i bought this to test out the new collection. i really ended up liking the color i though i would hate and hating the color i originally wanted. i dont think i&#x27;ll buy sparrow me the drama only because i have a million and one pinks already. i might buy planks a lot. i&#x27;m not sure about stranger tides. we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Liked the idea of getting to try different samples so I could pick out which one I really liked.Stayed on great after going on so easy,</li>

            <li> I ordered this product over a month ago and I still haven&#x27;t received it. I am not very happy and will be filing a claim with them.</li>
            <li> I really loved the item I received from this seller! It was sent in excellent packaging.  The polish came just as the picture showed and the description stated. The colors look great on me and it worked out really well! I will definitely be ordering from them since they took the time to contact me and got the order figured out after the shipping was late!</li>
            <li> the colors look super cute in the bag but when you put them on your nails, they look bad! especially with the silver crackle that is in the same set. i wont be wearing these :(</li>

            <li> I love all the colors that came with the set. It&#x27;s a great price for four MINI polishes(they are about the size of a thumb). I am very happy with this purchase, I love OPI products and was happy I didn&#x27;t have order each full size separately.</li>
            <li> I like this little set and that is my point here. OPI is high quality, but I didn&#x27;t read the fine print these are very small bottles, approximately 5ml, I think, not much paint, pretty cute however.</li>

            <li> I wanted to try these and was delighted they came as a set of mini bottles. Unfortunately I was a lot less excited about the colors...  They all had this dingy coloring to them. Now maybe I should have known they would be that way because they are a Pirates of the Caribbean set. Either way I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the colors.</li>
            <li> 9 year-old daughter loved it.  I know nothing about nail polish so her opinion is the one that matters.</li>
            <li> My daughter prefers OPI products.  This was the perfect size for a stocking stuffer.  She loves the Pirates of the Carribean movies and loved the color selection.</li>
            <li> Great colors. Good buying experience. Thanks !</li>
            <li> This set does not include Mermaid&#x27;s Tears, which is my favorite color from this collection. However, I do like the pink and purple colors. I do not care much for the greyish color and the whitish one is okay as well. Since they are mini&#x27;s they won&#x27;t last long if you wear them regulary, but since I don&#x27;t I like their size. I did purchase the normal size bottle of Mermaid&#x27;s Tears and am in love with it still.</li>
            <li> I thought these might be colors that would work for her but if she didn&#x27;t like them, they are the mini bottles, so they won&#x27;t last long.</li>
