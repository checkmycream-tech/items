            <li> My masseuse uses this on me at the end of my massage.  So I was happy to be able to purchase it for home use.  A little goes a long way.  It has a pleasant odor which doesn&#x27;t last very long.  However the good feeling does last a long time.  I have neck and shoulder pain as well as hip pain.  Polar Lotion does the trick and lasts all day.  It is a most excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 15 years.  The message therapist I had used this on all of her patients and felt  very beneficial over the areas she used it on.  Now, I use this every night at home for back and leg muscles and also  use some under my nose to promote easy sleeping.  Cannot do without it.</li>
