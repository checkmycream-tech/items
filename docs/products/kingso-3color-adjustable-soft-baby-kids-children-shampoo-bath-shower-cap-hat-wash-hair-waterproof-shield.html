    <ol>
            <li>and my son loved it!  </li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>We have been using it for 6 months and it is still in great condition.  </li>
            <li>He even took a cup of water and poured it over his own head!  </li>
            <li>This product makes bathing a much more pleasant experience for all!</li>
            <li>Its a good quality tho.</li>
            <li>but I was a good thought I never used it</li>
            <li>I love this visor!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and useful, great but!</li>
            <li>I could do better job making my own at home.</li>
            <li>Her son doesn&#x27;t mind it and the hat has held up for the just fine!</li>
            <li>I love that I can rise my baby off without worrying if she getting water in her ears.</li>
            <li>This visor creates a nice seal that prevents water getting in his eyes and he seems comfortable with it as he doesn&#x27;t fuss or seem to mind when I put it on him.</li>
            <li>For the most part this does its job.</li>
            <li>advise is to start using it on babies as soon as you want a very clean head with no water in the ears or eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Idk if this has anything to do with it, but since she has had this cap she is much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>BUT when she is cooperating this item works just fine.</li>
            <li>This product is cheap and buttons together to fit the head of your child which means it will never quite fit as you would need to avoid water in the eyes.</li>
            <li>I would not take it if was free.</li>
            <li>Cheap &amp; flimsy, didn&#x27;t work with my daughter, but hey it was cheap &amp; I threw it away</li>
            <li>It fastens securely around the kid&#x27;s head and doesn&#x27;t allow water to leak around the inside.  </li>
            <li>but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to be great after only paying $6.00, however this isn&#x27;t even worth $1.00.</li>
            <li>Really keeps the water out of her eyes but we were hoping to keep water away from her ears more.</li>
            <li>It was worth the buy because it was cheap</li>
            <li>Fits fine but tears easily on a 18 month old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works great but is a little flimsy.  </li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t pay much more for this item if you have a little trouble maker like us :P works fine for our friend who we also gifted this too.</li>
            <li>The water/shampoo pour right off the edge in a waterfall</li>
            <li>It allows some water to get through right by the ears (exactly what I was trying to avoid by using this product).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of a soft foam material that seems like it might be easy to tear</li>
            <li>This shower cap works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>works good for its purpose the only downfall they need to make bigger sizes</li>
            <li>I was worried about the price being so low that it would fall apart easily or just</li>
            <li>It really keeps water away.</li>
            <li>The back doesn&#x27;t secure properly and it was bent when it arrived because it is so cheap (and was shipped from China in a plastic bag.)</li>
            <li>Quality is not really good and it came bend out, but my kids loved it.</li>
            <li>band is adjustable with four strong plastic snaps although it wouldn&#x27;t fit a kid over 4 unless they had a very small head.  </li>
            <li>It does work great, just a little bit too tight for my 2 years old son&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>2 1/2 was a little head strong willed about putting it on.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using it for our 10month old daughter on a nightly basis for a couple months now.  </li>
            <li>My 7month old freaks out and flails around when he gets water in his eyes and holding a towel or my hand hand over his eyes</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s been holding up well so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft foam</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the word &amp;#34;Lifesaver&amp;#34; lightly, but when I consider the fact that in the past my 2-year-old would literally leap out of the bathtub and skid away on the floor when it was time to wash his hair, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m overstating facts.  </li>
            <li>waste of money .no use too large for my infant</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Quality is not really good and it came bend out, but my kids loved it. It really keeps water away.</li>
            <li> I guess my child has a larger than average head because this shower cap does not fit her at all. Its a good quality tho.</li>
            <li> Awful. Although it was like 2 or 3 dollars. I would not take it if was free. Did not fit my sons head even on the largest snap. Threw it away 5 mins after it was delivered.</li>
            <li> Cheap &amp; flimsy, didn&#x27;t work with my daughter, but hey it was cheap &amp; I threw it away</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works great but is a little flimsy.  I love that I can rise my baby off without worrying if she getting water in her ears.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the price being so low that it would fall apart easily or just not work but it does! We&#x27;ve been using it for our 10month old daughter on a nightly basis for a couple months now.  It keeps the soapy water out of her eyes since I can&#x27;t get her to look up from playing so i can rinse her hair. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I hate it but I was a good thought I never used it it&#x27;s a bad product what it made out of its horrible</li>
            <li> I love this visor! My 7month old freaks out and flails around when he gets water in his eyes and holding a towel or my hand hand over his eyes just does not work well. This visor creates a nice seal that prevents water getting in his eyes and he seems comfortable with it as he doesn&#x27;t fuss or seem to mind when I put it on him. This product makes bathing a much more pleasant experience for all! It&#x27;s made of a soft foam material that seems like it might be easy to tear but it&#x27;s been holding up well so far. Ships from China so it takes a little while to get to US but I definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the word &amp;#34;Lifesaver&amp;#34; lightly, but when I consider the fact that in the past my 2-year-old would literally leap out of the bathtub and skid away on the floor when it was time to wash his hair, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m overstating facts.  This shower cap works exactly as described.  It fastens securely around the kid&#x27;s head and doesn&#x27;t allow water to leak around the inside.  The water/shampoo pour right off the edge in a waterfall and my son loved it!  He even took a cup of water and poured it over his own head!  I would never give him a bath without this!&lt;br /&gt;The band is adjustable with four strong plastic snaps although it wouldn&#x27;t fit a kid over 4 unless they had a very small head.  It works for longer hair, as well.  It&#x27;s soft foam so I can&#x27;t speak for it&#x27;s durability but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> works good for its purpose the only downfall they need to make bigger sizes</li>
            <li> Fits fine but tears easily on a 18 month old. What I mean is if you have a toddler like mines she will rip it with her hulk strength when she doesn&#x27;t want it on BUT when she is cooperating this item works just fine. Really keeps the water out of her eyes but we were hoping to keep water away from her ears more. It was worth the buy because it was cheap but I wouldn&#x27;t pay much more for this item if you have a little trouble maker like us :P works fine for our friend who we also gifted this too. Her son doesn&#x27;t mind it and the hat has held up for the just fine!</li>
            <li> My boy hates it when the water runs on his face so this hat is a life saver.  We have been using it for 6 months and it is still in great condition.  It&#x27;s cute and useful, great but!</li>
            <li> Was not adjustable and rubber had a tear</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t have it!!!  It&#x27;s been six weeks.</li>
            <li> For the most part this does its job. However, the opening for the child&#x27;s head needs to be oval shaped, rather than a circle. It allows some water to get through right by the ears (exactly what I was trying to avoid by using this product). My simple solution is to hold the back where the snaps are to pull it tight to my child&#x27;s head as I pour the water. Also, getting your kid to not immediately snatch it off after you get it on is the hardest part! ;-) Good luck!</li>
            <li> I expected this to be plastic, it instead is flimsy styrofoam and took a MONTH to arrive. The back doesn&#x27;t secure properly and it was bent when it arrived because it is so cheap (and was shipped from China in a plastic bag.) I didn&#x27;t expect it to be great after only paying $6.00, however this isn&#x27;t even worth $1.00. I could do better job making my own at home. VERY disappointed- wish I could give it zero stars!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my baby because she has had two ear infections. I wanted to keep the water out of her ears and her face She loves it too. She used to be kind of afraid of the water. Idk if this has anything to do with it, but since she has had this cap she is much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> This product is cheap and buttons together to fit the head of your child which means it will never quite fit as you would need to avoid water in the eyes. Which is what you would be purchasing this product for.</li>
            <li> waste of money .no use too large for my infant</li>
            <li> It does work great, just a little bit too tight for my 2 years old son&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised.  It was packaged neatly and arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;My advise is to start using it on babies as soon as you want a very clean head with no water in the ears or eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I will have this on hand for my next grandchild and not have to go through the reason I had to search it out.&lt;br /&gt;My 2 1/2 was a little head strong willed about putting it on.</li>
