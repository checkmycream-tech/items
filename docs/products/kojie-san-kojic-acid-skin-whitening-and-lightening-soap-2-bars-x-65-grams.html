            <li>Honestly, I used this soap</li>
            <li>i like this product it smells nice</li>
            <li>When I opened it it smelled really nice, like orange pop.  </li>
            <li>Will brighten, but not whiten your skin on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>nice as well</li>
            <li>she says she dont know how my skin got liked this</li>
            <li>: smells good, good cleanser, good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and bright after using the soap.</li>
            <li>I tried another professional strength kojic soap and was not as impressed as I am with Kojie.  </li>
            <li>Im impressed so far.</li>
            <li>Found Retinal-A much more effective and did see a difference in hyper pigmentation on face.</li>
            <li>Its been a week or so and this soap is not as good as I originally thought.</li>
            <li>There was a very light peel</li>
            <li>We both absolutely love this soap.</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more and trying out the cream, lotion etc.....</li>
            <li>Despite this soap&#x27;s claim to whiten skin, my skin doesn&#x27;t look any lighter to me, and this is interesting considering that I use a fade cream.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>From the 1st use my face appeared more youthful (I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>Of course it&#x27;s not a miracle soap, I still have my spots, but my face looked whiter and more taut.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any film on your face like most cleansers.</li>
            <li>I just put it on top of a piece of aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>I love this soap and I recommend it to all of my friends and family.  </li>
            <li>As per the drying effect which many reviewer mentioned, I have combination skin (oil/dry combo), you have to se a toner</li>
            <li>and I will order more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great gentle exfoliator for me.  </li>
            <li>I will give it some more time , however still not dissatisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>okay I been using for about a mouth , on and of r</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed purchasing the soap.</li>
            <li>I always use toner after I wash my face, because I notice when I don&#x27;t, I&#x27;m prone to more breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I so love it, I&#x27;m about 2 or 3 shades lighter...</li>
            <li>I will do one more update.</li>
            <li>but It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I love this soap and will be using this soap for my lifetime.</li>
            <li>I am really satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m totally in love with this soap.</li>
            <li>I love this soap and will continue ordering it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously I wont be able to see results for a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li>I all most commited suicide because of my skin my shyness and the way people treat me</li>
            <li>worked perfectly love it, just gotta be carefull because it is strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic, my skin has gotten better.</li>
            <li>Make sure to put on moisturizer because as I said, it makes your face feel taut and squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Some brightening, but nothing too impressive.&lt;br /&gt;Also ran out very quickly.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as I thought</li>
            <li>I used it along with the piona strong bleaching cream</li>
            <li>It is a nice product so far I just need to use it more often to see the results, also smells good and very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>This soap is amazing, after the first week my face was glowing.</li>
            <li>but it did work fine.</li>
            <li>Some people just want lighter skin,and that&#x27;s absolutely fine.</li>
            <li>Good product it really lightens and makes the skin feel smooth and clean</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly drying, but this should be expected since this is a strong exfoliating soap and will make you peel/shed.</li>
            <li>It works,but don&#x27;t expect a huge over night.</li>
            <li>smooth transaction &amp; after 2 days of use it</li>
            <li>i have  already have light skin</li>
            <li>I am Kelly Rowland complexion and want to be light like Alicia Keys.</li>
            <li>I want to be really light by Decemeber.</li>
            <li>I love it really works :)</li>
            <li>I have a new love!</li>
            <li>but I do not see a significant amount of lightening under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Yesterday was my first time using this product and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>My arms are significantly darker than my chest and face</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, can&#x27;t  live without it.</li>
            <li>This soap leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean after a shower.</li>
            <li>then I  clean it with water after that</li>
            <li>This soap is awesome, At first it burned a little bit</li>
            <li>If you lather right you will be fine.</li>
            <li>I have hyperpigmentation issues and I love this soap, it really does what it says.</li>
            <li>15 uses per full bar.</li>
            <li>, bars of soap dissolve quickly so keep away from shower/sink when not in</li>
            <li>It works almost like tretinion but mild.</li>
            <li>I took a shower and the bar doesn&#x27;t dissolve quickly and makes a lot of suds and the color doesn&#x27;t stain anything and the product didn&#x27;t burn my skin when I let it sit for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>but that just my opinion because trust me you will love it and you won&#x27;t be able to imagine your daily facial/shower without it!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural and safe unlike the mercury filled &amp;#34;others&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I am a light caramel skinned AA woman ( I like to say the color of hot dog buns).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually ordering more because I don&#x27;t want to run out!</li>
            <li>This soap is freaking amazing, I&#x27;ve only been using this soap for four days</li>
            <li>I tried evening out my complexion with oils like vitamin E and almond oil, but I wasn&#x27;t honestly seeing any results; they only resulted in clogged pores!</li>
            <li>It takes more then 3 weeks to get completely clear skin....</li>
            <li>I am confident that with continued use, it will be completely faded.  </li>
            <li>It has a good smell but it actually seemed to make me darker and it really aggravated my skin.</li>
            <li>and i over here boys talking about how they want a light skinned girlfriend with a big butts and sexy legs</li>
            <li>this is just the right product.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t see a difference right now</li>
            <li>the only good thing i can say about this soap is that it makes my skin real soft</li>
            <li>Overall, using this soap give my face that natural bright look.</li>
            <li>so happy I finally found something to lighten all the darker skins as I am white.</li>
            <li>nice product i see my skin is soft and not dried out at all&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does melt very fast.</li>
            <li>I only use this three times a week, I tried using it more</li>
            <li>I just got on time and first time using it...</li>
            <li>It will turn creamy white  - love that feel.</li>
            <li>It made my face tingle for first 2 times of use.</li>
            <li>This really works and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It has cleared up my acne so much!</li>
            <li>The product came fast !</li>
            <li>so if you want to buy it make sure you try a bigger bar size</li>
            <li>( or at least I thought so, lol.)</li>
            <li>Soap leafs skin smooth and soft .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do keep my soap in individual ziplock bags so that I can get more use out of my soap.</li>
            <li>i just have to be consistent</li>
            <li>Here are some pros and cons of my first</li>
            <li>Ok so i am lightening my entire body.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth, soft and even toned.  </li>
            <li>I will say the product will dry your skin out if you don&#x27;t use a good natural moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>So far, my spots have faded significantly.</li>
            <li>I am planning to leave it on my body overnight and rinse off in the morning because I feel that if you leave it on longer (if your skin is not sensitive) then it will lighten better.</li>
            <li>Which is pretty fast, but I&#x27;m in the LA area</li>
            <li>(make sure the soap dish or container is dry).</li>
            <li>3 minutes max and use pure coco butter</li>
            <li>it certainly has met my expectation and I would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this soap</li>
            <li>I went through a whole bar and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my age spots.  </li>
            <li>For the face: I wet my face, then glide the soap on my cheeks, forehead, and chin, then using fingers massage on my face adding more water as needed.</li>
            <li>the darkening is very noticeable.</li>
            <li>this helps so much just use lotion after and don&#x27;t use it every day YOU WONT NEED TO TRUST ME.</li>
            <li>I now don&#x27;t have to apply as much concealer to hide the scars It&#x27;s also prevented me from having any breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin by nature.</li>
            <li>: did not fade anything after 3 wks of use, very drying on the skin</li>
            <li>Gentle on skin and lathers very well.</li>
            <li>It helps with my oily skin and really does lighten.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my skin&#x27;s texture, smoothness, clarity, pore shrinkage, and lightening of brown spots that were very noticeable before</li>
            <li>And shipping process was fast and on time...</li>
            <li>Lightening your skin with this really works</li>
            <li>So 35 uses for the whole package.</li>
            <li>I think this soap will really work.</li>
            <li>However I think I need to stop using this because when I used it yesterday before I took a bath it really burned my face but</li>
            <li>Really works I wash my flash with the on-air brush</li>
            <li>and I used it for week it really bbc.co works</li>
            <li>Very drying.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It really works just like it has been advertised.  </li>
            <li>I rarely ever get pimples or breakouts when using new products; I rarely ever breakout just in general</li>
            <li>I tried Maderma along with many other home remedies for scar fading (Lemon juice, honey, face scrubs).</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t work enough to see a significant amount of improvement.  </li>
            <li>I use it a couple times a week on my face to keep it fresh and bright especially after a hard gym workout.</li>
            <li>Remember this is mainly for brightening complexion.</li>
            <li>im older</li>
            <li>and I mainly use it to get rid of hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>My face has been pretty clear and my zits would dry right up after first use.  </li>
            <li>I had really high expectations for this soap</li>
            <li>Smaller bars than expected but it good overall!</li>
            <li>Also, maybe I bathe too much but my first bar was gone during my second week.</li>
            <li>I was also using another new product in conjunction with this but</li>
            <li>but it still made no change on new ones.</li>
            <li>some african american people say im light skin</li>
            <li>my sister had been using this same exact soap and broke out, I was convinced the soap was the problem.</li>
            <li>I was able to track the package as I was really anxious to receive the soap.</li>
            <li>But so far this soap is working!</li>
            <li>Would not recommend this product to those wanting a significant improvement for the reduction of dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li>product works love koji-san to brighten dull skin</li>
            <li>Little to no breakouts, my skin is smoother, my pores are shrinking, everything is relatively the same shade, and I can honestly say that my self esteem has increased.</li>
            <li>Though it dries out my skin, therefore drying out potential pimples, doesn&#x27;t really lighten or even clear out pores or anything.</li>
            <li>It has been helping me to clear the acne on my face without causing irritation.</li>
            <li>I use to clear the tan lines after beach vacation and to lighten knees and elbows.</li>
            <li>i thought the soap was going to help clear my spots.</li>
            <li>but no where near a TCA peel.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t leave it on for too long when you first start using it.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been doing this, my skin has honestly never looked better.</li>
            <li>because 1) it was an all natural product and 2)</li>
            <li>I use a vitamin c serum and sometimes  argon oil on my face to re-moisturize my face, because the soap does strip away the natural oils on my face.</li>
            <li>I only have been using it 2 weeks, so I can&#x27;t really tell if my skin is getting lighter.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe because the scars/hyperpigmentaion are old</li>
            <li>At least I know now because I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>far a s lightening  </li>
            <li>so far I like it.</li>
            <li>My skin type is sensitive</li>
            <li>skin feels smooth and a bit firm</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s about 3 uses per piece.</li>
            <li>So its going to take time for my skin to be completely lighter.</li>
            <li>but this is the only way u going to see fast results.</li>
            <li>Im 15 years old.</li>
            <li>that ship via Prime, so if you&#x27;re impatient and don&#x27;t mind paying a couple more dollars, buy it from a different vendor.</li>
            <li>Follow up with a good moisturizer and you shouldn&#x27;t have any weird dryness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American, and my the top half of my face is Beyonce shade and</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very low coast and works the best compared to any other expensive facial soaps that I have used.</li>
            <li>I only gave it a 2 because i have not seen much of a difference in my skin tone.im on my third bar of soap,i believe its working</li>
            <li>nd got rid of some major acne</li>
            <li>an african american girl and my skin tone is in between dark skin and light skin.</li>
            <li>I am a African american woman who was excited and hopeful this product would lighten my dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give that ugly bleached face look lol</li>
            <li>It dries fast on your face, so put some water (not much) on your fingers and massage in circular motion.</li>
            <li>I so far like it, only been using for about a month.</li>
            <li>therefore i waisted my money on two packs of soap i barely use</li>
            <li>The dark spots, fine wrinkles and other problems has faded.  </li>
            <li>the main reason why i bought this is because every other teenager ive seen got clear glowing skin</li>
            <li>Just got this package, super small bars.</li>
            <li>I have dark skin, it didn&#x27;t work on me that much.</li>
            <li>Bought it not long ago</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and noticed results within the first week.</li>
            <li>If your having trouble with the soap it helps to exfoliate three times and then to allow the soap to stay on ur skin for five minutes it will work just be consistent</li>
            <li>but it let me down, didn&#x27;t really see any noticeable changes with my acne or skin tone</li>
            <li>After the first use that area felt raw (compared to chaffing against tshirt without a bra on, then go jogging)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i was really hoping it would atleast lighten my complexion a little bit</li>
            <li>good but little expensive</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smells citrusy and pleasant.</li>
            <li> This soap smells great and has a nice citrus scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing good results with my skins texture.....</li>
            <li> and when I opened the mailing package the product was in good condition.</li>
            <li> Good for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Well, it smells good</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t good for me</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t good for me.</li>
            <li> Used for a week and already see and feel results, my skin looks and feels moist and healthy, great product.</li>
            <li> Love this soap!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> The saop is amazing, I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> The product is nice though.</li>
            <li> nice soap for evening out you.re skin tone ,found a gem.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I used this soap</li>
            <li> i like this product it smells nice</li>
            <li> When I opened it it smelled really nice, like orange pop.  </li>
            <li> Will brighten, but not whiten your skin on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> nice as well</li>
            <li> she says she dont know how my skin got liked this</li>
            <li> : smells good, good cleanser, good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and bright after using the soap.</li>
            <li> I tried another professional strength kojic soap and was not as impressed as I am with Kojie.  </li>
            <li> Im impressed so far.</li>
            <li> Found Retinal-A much more effective and did see a difference in hyper pigmentation on face.</li>
            <li> Its been a week or so and this soap is not as good as I originally thought.</li>
            <li> There was a very light peel</li>
            <li> We both absolutely love this soap.</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing more and trying out the cream, lotion etc.....</li>
            <li> Despite this soap&#x27;s claim to whiten skin, my skin doesn&#x27;t look any lighter to me, and this is interesting considering that I use a fade cream.</li>
            <li> I love how it feels.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> From the 1st use my face appeared more youthful (I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s not a miracle soap, I still have my spots, but my face looked whiter and more taut.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any film on your face like most cleansers.</li>
            <li> I just put it on top of a piece of aluminum foil.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and I recommend it to all of my friends and family.  </li>
            <li> As per the drying effect which many reviewer mentioned, I have combination skin (oil/dry combo), you have to se a toner</li>
            <li> and I will order more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great gentle exfoliator for me.  </li>
            <li> I will give it some more time , however still not dissatisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> okay I been using for about a mouth , on and of r</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed purchasing the soap.</li>
            <li> I always use toner after I wash my face, because I notice when I don&#x27;t, I&#x27;m prone to more breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I so love it, I&#x27;m about 2 or 3 shades lighter...</li>
            <li> I will do one more update.</li>
            <li> but It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I love this soap and will be using this soap for my lifetime.</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m totally in love with this soap.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and will continue ordering it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously I wont be able to see results for a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li> I all most commited suicide because of my skin my shyness and the way people treat me</li>
            <li> worked perfectly love it, just gotta be carefull because it is strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic, my skin has gotten better.</li>
            <li> Make sure to put on moisturizer because as I said, it makes your face feel taut and squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Some brightening, but nothing too impressive.&lt;br /&gt;Also ran out very quickly.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I thought</li>
            <li> I used it along with the piona strong bleaching cream</li>
            <li> It is a nice product so far I just need to use it more often to see the results, also smells good and very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing, after the first week my face was glowing.</li>
            <li> but it did work fine.</li>
            <li> Some people just want lighter skin,and that&#x27;s absolutely fine.</li>
            <li> Good product it really lightens and makes the skin feel smooth and clean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly drying, but this should be expected since this is a strong exfoliating soap and will make you peel/shed.</li>
            <li> It works,but don&#x27;t expect a huge over night.</li>
            <li> smooth transaction &amp; after 2 days of use it</li>
            <li> i have  already have light skin</li>
            <li> I am Kelly Rowland complexion and want to be light like Alicia Keys.</li>
            <li> I want to be really light by Decemeber.</li>
            <li> I love it really works :)</li>
            <li> I have a new love!</li>
            <li> but I do not see a significant amount of lightening under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Yesterday was my first time using this product and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> My arms are significantly darker than my chest and face</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, can&#x27;t  live without it.</li>
            <li> This soap leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean after a shower.</li>
            <li> then I  clean it with water after that</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome, At first it burned a little bit</li>
            <li> If you lather right you will be fine.</li>
            <li> I have hyperpigmentation issues and I love this soap, it really does what it says.</li>
            <li> 15 uses per full bar.</li>
            <li> , bars of soap dissolve quickly so keep away from shower/sink when not in</li>
            <li> It works almost like tretinion but mild.</li>
            <li> I took a shower and the bar doesn&#x27;t dissolve quickly and makes a lot of suds and the color doesn&#x27;t stain anything and the product didn&#x27;t burn my skin when I let it sit for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> but that just my opinion because trust me you will love it and you won&#x27;t be able to imagine your daily facial/shower without it!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural and safe unlike the mercury filled &amp;#34;others&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am a light caramel skinned AA woman ( I like to say the color of hot dog buns).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually ordering more because I don&#x27;t want to run out!</li>
            <li> This soap is freaking amazing, I&#x27;ve only been using this soap for four days</li>
            <li> I tried evening out my complexion with oils like vitamin E and almond oil, but I wasn&#x27;t honestly seeing any results; they only resulted in clogged pores!</li>
            <li> It takes more then 3 weeks to get completely clear skin....</li>
            <li> I am confident that with continued use, it will be completely faded.  </li>
            <li> It has a good smell but it actually seemed to make me darker and it really aggravated my skin.</li>
            <li> and i over here boys talking about how they want a light skinned girlfriend with a big butts and sexy legs</li>
            <li> this is just the right product.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t see a difference right now</li>
            <li> the only good thing i can say about this soap is that it makes my skin real soft</li>
            <li> Overall, using this soap give my face that natural bright look.</li>
            <li> so happy I finally found something to lighten all the darker skins as I am white.</li>
            <li> nice product i see my skin is soft and not dried out at all&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does melt very fast.</li>
            <li> I only use this three times a week, I tried using it more</li>
            <li> I just got on time and first time using it...</li>
            <li> It will turn creamy white  - love that feel.</li>
            <li> It made my face tingle for first 2 times of use.</li>
            <li> This really works and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It has cleared up my acne so much!</li>
            <li> The product came fast !</li>
            <li> so if you want to buy it make sure you try a bigger bar size</li>
            <li> ( or at least I thought so, lol.)</li>
            <li> Soap leafs skin smooth and soft .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do keep my soap in individual ziplock bags so that I can get more use out of my soap.</li>
            <li> i just have to be consistent</li>
            <li> Here are some pros and cons of my first</li>
            <li> Ok so i am lightening my entire body.</li>
            <li> My face is smooth, soft and even toned.  </li>
            <li> I will say the product will dry your skin out if you don&#x27;t use a good natural moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> So far, my spots have faded significantly.</li>
            <li> I am planning to leave it on my body overnight and rinse off in the morning because I feel that if you leave it on longer (if your skin is not sensitive) then it will lighten better.</li>
            <li> Which is pretty fast, but I&#x27;m in the LA area</li>
            <li> (make sure the soap dish or container is dry).</li>
            <li> 3 minutes max and use pure coco butter</li>
            <li> it certainly has met my expectation and I would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this soap</li>
            <li> I went through a whole bar and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my age spots.  </li>
            <li> For the face: I wet my face, then glide the soap on my cheeks, forehead, and chin, then using fingers massage on my face adding more water as needed.</li>
            <li> the darkening is very noticeable.</li>
            <li> this helps so much just use lotion after and don&#x27;t use it every day YOU WONT NEED TO TRUST ME.</li>
            <li> I now don&#x27;t have to apply as much concealer to hide the scars It&#x27;s also prevented me from having any breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin by nature.</li>
            <li> : did not fade anything after 3 wks of use, very drying on the skin</li>
            <li> Gentle on skin and lathers very well.</li>
            <li> It helps with my oily skin and really does lighten.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin&#x27;s texture, smoothness, clarity, pore shrinkage, and lightening of brown spots that were very noticeable before</li>
            <li> And shipping process was fast and on time...</li>
            <li> Lightening your skin with this really works</li>
            <li> So 35 uses for the whole package.</li>
            <li> I think this soap will really work.</li>
            <li> However I think I need to stop using this because when I used it yesterday before I took a bath it really burned my face but</li>
            <li> Really works I wash my flash with the on-air brush</li>
            <li> and I used it for week it really bbc.co works</li>
            <li> Very drying.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It really works just like it has been advertised.  </li>
            <li> I rarely ever get pimples or breakouts when using new products; I rarely ever breakout just in general</li>
            <li> I tried Maderma along with many other home remedies for scar fading (Lemon juice, honey, face scrubs).</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t work enough to see a significant amount of improvement.  </li>
            <li> I use it a couple times a week on my face to keep it fresh and bright especially after a hard gym workout.</li>
            <li> Remember this is mainly for brightening complexion.</li>
            <li> im older</li>
            <li> and I mainly use it to get rid of hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> My face has been pretty clear and my zits would dry right up after first use.  </li>
            <li> I had really high expectations for this soap</li>
            <li> Smaller bars than expected but it good overall!</li>
            <li> Also, maybe I bathe too much but my first bar was gone during my second week.</li>
            <li> I was also using another new product in conjunction with this but</li>
            <li> but it still made no change on new ones.</li>
            <li> some african american people say im light skin</li>
            <li> my sister had been using this same exact soap and broke out, I was convinced the soap was the problem.</li>
            <li> I was able to track the package as I was really anxious to receive the soap.</li>
            <li> But so far this soap is working!</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this product to those wanting a significant improvement for the reduction of dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> product works love koji-san to brighten dull skin</li>
            <li> Little to no breakouts, my skin is smoother, my pores are shrinking, everything is relatively the same shade, and I can honestly say that my self esteem has increased.</li>
            <li> Though it dries out my skin, therefore drying out potential pimples, doesn&#x27;t really lighten or even clear out pores or anything.</li>
            <li> It has been helping me to clear the acne on my face without causing irritation.</li>
            <li> I use to clear the tan lines after beach vacation and to lighten knees and elbows.</li>
            <li> i thought the soap was going to help clear my spots.</li>
            <li> but no where near a TCA peel.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave it on for too long when you first start using it.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been doing this, my skin has honestly never looked better.</li>
            <li> because 1) it was an all natural product and 2)</li>
            <li> I use a vitamin c serum and sometimes  argon oil on my face to re-moisturize my face, because the soap does strip away the natural oils on my face.</li>
            <li> I only have been using it 2 weeks, so I can&#x27;t really tell if my skin is getting lighter.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe because the scars/hyperpigmentaion are old</li>
            <li> At least I know now because I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> far a s lightening  </li>
            <li> so far I like it.</li>
            <li> My skin type is sensitive</li>
            <li> skin feels smooth and a bit firm</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s about 3 uses per piece.</li>
            <li> So its going to take time for my skin to be completely lighter.</li>
            <li> but this is the only way u going to see fast results.</li>
            <li> Im 15 years old.</li>
            <li> that ship via Prime, so if you&#x27;re impatient and don&#x27;t mind paying a couple more dollars, buy it from a different vendor.</li>
            <li> Follow up with a good moisturizer and you shouldn&#x27;t have any weird dryness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American, and my the top half of my face is Beyonce shade and</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very low coast and works the best compared to any other expensive facial soaps that I have used.</li>
            <li> I only gave it a 2 because i have not seen much of a difference in my skin tone.im on my third bar of soap,i believe its working</li>
            <li> nd got rid of some major acne</li>
            <li> an african american girl and my skin tone is in between dark skin and light skin.</li>
            <li> I am a African american woman who was excited and hopeful this product would lighten my dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give that ugly bleached face look lol</li>
            <li> It dries fast on your face, so put some water (not much) on your fingers and massage in circular motion.</li>
            <li> I so far like it, only been using for about a month.</li>
            <li> therefore i waisted my money on two packs of soap i barely use</li>
            <li> The dark spots, fine wrinkles and other problems has faded.  </li>
            <li> the main reason why i bought this is because every other teenager ive seen got clear glowing skin</li>
            <li> Just got this package, super small bars.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin, it didn&#x27;t work on me that much.</li>
            <li> Bought it not long ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and noticed results within the first week.</li>
            <li> If your having trouble with the soap it helps to exfoliate three times and then to allow the soap to stay on ur skin for five minutes it will work just be consistent</li>
            <li> but it let me down, didn&#x27;t really see any noticeable changes with my acne or skin tone</li>
            <li> After the first use that area felt raw (compared to chaffing against tshirt without a bra on, then go jogging)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i was really hoping it would atleast lighten my complexion a little bit</li>
            <li> good but little expensive</li>
            <li> It lightened my skin about a little under a half shade which is cool.</li>
            <li> As far as my face, I leave on for no more than a minute else it leaves burn like spots on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Regarding those who state that the soap doesn&#x27;t last long....  </li>
            <li> wash my face daily and no breakouts have an accord, unlike any other bar soaps  ive used, I use it twice daily, would recommend using sun screen...</li>
            <li> so i turn down every single one of them i thought the soap was going to clear my skin</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;ve known this product a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I plan to continue using as long as I can.</li>
            <li> The bars were smaller than what I have previously ordered, but I am thinking that  it was from a different distribution</li>
            <li> It definitely has brightened areas of red caused by acne and can tell that my face is getting softer and has less acne</li>
            <li> I rinse off and pat dry, do not use a rag as I feel it agitates the skin.</li>
            <li> I keep my soap dry</li>
            <li> use(keep in a dry</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin ( and I&#x27;ve been using a exfoliating cloth with it)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen anything no results nothing just dry skin</li>
            <li> the morning, I use African Black Soap.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this I was skeptical, but now it&#x27;s the only soap I use now!</li>
            <li> this soap slightly lightens my skin, every skin type is different</li>
            <li> so I cut them each of them in 8 pieces, so 16 cubes in total, and around 2 and a half uses per cube.</li>
            <li> They  has lighting up alot ,im  a mix breed of white, Indian, black .Im</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black female.</li>
            <li> I have been using several skin lightening products that work a little bit</li>
            <li> but it made my skin darker, so be careful.</li>
            <li> No real answers from seller about how to use this.</li>
            <li> ladies stop spending all that money on pink privates and lady whitener.</li>
            <li> Its really not lying when it says its skin drying, so use a lot of moisturiser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about  a month now and the results are minimal but what do you expect to happen.</li>
            <li> Got it before I expected it and can&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
            <li> Did not perform as expected.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews it did leave me very dry</li>

            <li> It could be due to the fact I&#x27;m half Caucasian, but it hasn&#x27;t been clearing my acne spots or lightening my skin the way I had hoped it to.</li>

            <li> I see a little improvement I&#x27;m trying to get rid of  my scars on my legs  </li>
            <li> It did work a little and my face is a tad lighter, as with my knees and elbows.</li>
            <li> I got mine from ebay which is a little bit cheaper..</li>

            <li> waste of money doesnt work</li>

            <li> I have old scars on my feet from random bruises &amp; wanted to be rid of them.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lighten skin need something stronger waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday once a day.</li>
            <li> i dont use it everyday</li>
            <li> fortunately I&#x27;m not experiencing any dryness of skin or other negative effect.</li>
            <li> But now my skin is used to it (no more tingles/stings).</li>
            <li> For sensative skin these are small bars of soap like the mini hotel size ones.</li>
            <li> I spend hundreds and this is the only thing ill use now.</li>
            <li> I cut the soap in small pieces to use</li>
            <li> reviews said to cut the bar into small pieces.</li>
            <li> well maybe ill try the likas papaya soap next and see what happens!</li>
            <li> and I was really surprised at the people that say it has a bad smell.</li>
            <li> at least it makes my skin feel fresher.</li>
            <li> lately</li>
            <li> Even in my two months,its slowly working.</li>
            <li> Small soaps, but waiting to see the results!</li>
            <li> well it&#x27;s just very small soap bars</li>
            <li> no more it made my skin horribly bad and made it dry</li>
            <li> The soap is square and very hard, so it doesn&#x27;t melt like a Dove bar or even Neutrogena bar.</li>
            <li> so I was surprised when I got 3 or 4 of those painful under the skin bumps on my face!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m seeing very slow progress.</li>
            <li> this product has drastically decreased my oil production without drying my skin.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because I am impatient and want these dark spots (used all types of lighteners before and was disappointed with the results) to disappear!  </li>
            <li> But not anything dramatic and miraculous.</li>
            <li> but I didnt notice any lightening of my skin seems as if got a lil darker ill stick with nadinola</li>
            <li> It burns like crazy</li>
            <li> I know it sounds crazy</li>
            <li> My blemishes are still there but not as bad.</li>
            <li> It has also helped me lighten my skin after a bad sunburn/tan.</li>

            <li> I am thinking about doing a peel for my body but not on my face because I am fearful of burning my face.</li>
            <li> Buy it you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Made me break out terribly.</li>

            <li> So much easier to use than messy creams or lotions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 and I&#x27;ve suffered from combination skin resulting in bad acne that gets worst before my monthly and this soap is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works. Here is my way I got results in a week : step 1 I lather my face with tea tree soap to remove any bacteria. I rinse off and pat dry, do not use a rag as I feel it agitates the skin. If you lather right you will be fine. follow up with the kojic acid soap. 3 minutes max and use pure coco butter just a dab on each side for moisture. I saw results in a week. There was a very light peel but no where near a TCA peel. Nothing you need makeup for and no peel with proper moisturizing</li>
            <li> I shared this with my sister as a trial. We both absolutely love this soap. It does what it says. Will be purchasing more and trying out the cream, lotion etc.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap since February 11th,2015 in order to get rid of my dark marks. I&#x27;m not trying to become lighter. Despite this soap&#x27;s claim to whiten skin, my skin doesn&#x27;t look any lighter to me, and this is interesting considering that I use a fade cream. I&#x27;ve heard of kojic acid soap but was scared because of the word &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; being in it.So far, my spots have faded significantly. I tried evening out my complexion with oils like vitamin E and almond oil, but I wasn&#x27;t honestly seeing any results; they only resulted in clogged pores! Your skin needs to adjust to this soap. Don&#x27;t leave it on for too long when you first start using it. This soap smells great and has a nice citrus scent. I broke out around the second or third week of using this soap, but it went away. It&#x27;s incredibly drying, but this should be expected since this is a strong exfoliating soap and will make you peel/shed.I cannot stress the importance of using a moisturizer when you wash your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, I use African Black Soap. I use this soap at night since it is incredibly drying.I lather this soap in my hands and let it sit on my face for anywhere between 5 to 15 minutes. Once I rinse it off, I mix CeraVe cream and AmLactin on my face in order to have moisturized skin and receive the cell renewal benefits from the alpha hydroxy in the latter lotion. Once I let that absorb, I apply a fade cream. Since I&#x27;ve been doing this, my skin has honestly never looked better. Little to no breakouts, my skin is smoother, my pores are shrinking, everything is relatively the same shade, and I can honestly say that my self esteem has increased.</li>
            <li> I am dark skin AA. I purchased only for scars and for a skim condition that if not taken care of my skin becomes splotchy and it works. Plus it removes my tan lines</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this soap but...it broke my face out! I have been using this on my face and body for about a week just to even out my skin tone. I rarely ever get pimples or breakouts when using new products; I rarely ever breakout just in general so I was surprised when I got 3 or 4 of those painful under the skin bumps on my face! I was also using another new product in conjunction with this but because 1) it was an all natural product and 2) my sister had been using this same exact soap and broke out, I was convinced the soap was the problem. I&#x27;ll continue to use this on my body since I haven&#x27;t had any issues there but I won&#x27;t use this on my face anymore.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this I was skeptical, but now it&#x27;s the only soap I use now! It&#x27;s fantastic, my skin has gotten better. I only use this three times a week, I tried using it more but it made my skin darker, so be careful. The stuff works.</li>
            <li> I did not see any change in my skin.</li>
            <li> good but little expensive</li>
            <li> Though it dries out my skin, therefore drying out potential pimples, doesn&#x27;t really lighten or even clear out pores or anything. at least it makes my skin feel fresher.</li>
            <li> LOOOONG wait to get this in the mail. The product is nice though. No real answers from seller about how to use this. Go to YouTube it&#x27;s faster. Would have given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and noticed results within the first week. I have a few areas of hyper pigmentation from acne scars &amp; they&#x27;ve started to fade.</li>
            <li> Smaller bars than expected but it good overall!</li>
            <li> I use the Kojie San soap on my face at night so the sun would not affect my skin. My face is smooth and bright after using the soap. I love how it feels. I use a vitamin c serum and sometimes  argon oil on my face to re-moisturize my face, because the soap does strip away the natural oils on my face. Overall, using this soap give my face that natural bright look.</li>
            <li> I just got on time and first time using it... It burns like crazy but I don&#x27;t know if it works... But burns... Well I&#x27;ll see and write another review if it works...</li>
            <li> This soap leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean after a shower. I ordered another 6 pack. I only have been using it 2 weeks, so I can&#x27;t really tell if my skin is getting lighter.</li>
            <li> Excellent..fixed my skin tone nd got rid of some major acne</li>
            <li> I went through a whole bar and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my age spots.  Maybe you have to keep using the product for a lonnnnng time...</li>
            <li> only last like a week been using it for a month dt see any improvement</li>
            <li> I love this soap. From the 1st use my face appeared more youthful (I&#x27;m 65 have age spots but do not have wrinkles). Of course it&#x27;s not a miracle soap, I still have my spots, but my face looked whiter and more taut. The soap is square and very hard, so it doesn&#x27;t melt like a Dove bar or even Neutrogena bar. It will last a long time. It dries fast on your face, so put some water (not much) on your fingers and massage in circular motion. It will turn creamy white  - love that feel. I must admit however that it is a bit drying. It made my face tingle for first 2 times of use. But now my skin is used to it (no more tingles/stings). Make sure to put on moisturizer because as I said, it makes your face feel taut and squeaky clean. It doesn&#x27;t leave any film on your face like most cleansers. Update 3/17/15: Regarding those who state that the soap doesn&#x27;t last long....  I do not use it in the shower. I don&#x27;t use it for the body. For the face: I wet my face, then glide the soap on my cheeks, forehead, and chin, then using fingers massage on my face adding more water as needed. I rinse in the shower. I do the same for a bath before I fill the bath tub I apply the soap (rising with running water from the faucet using &amp;#34;cupped&amp;#34; hands. It&#x27;s easier for me to rinse this way than in the bathroom sink.). I keep my soap dry (make sure the soap dish or container is dry). I just put it on top of a piece of aluminum foil. In fact, I pick it up by the foil; I don&#x27;t touch the bar.</li>
            <li> For sensative skin these are small bars of soap like the mini hotel size ones.They do not visibly whiten after using both.try stronger products if you want visible results</li>
            <li> worked perfectly love it, just gotta be carefull because it is strong. so happy I finally found something to lighten all the darker skins as I am white. the darkening is very noticeable. this helps so much just use lotion after and don&#x27;t use it every day YOU WONT NEED TO TRUST ME. I looed for something for years and years and everything just kinda worked or worked temporarily. ladies stop spending all that money on pink privates and lady whitener. I spend hundreds and this is the only thing ill use now. thank you kojie</li>
            <li> I love this soap and I recommend it to all of my friends and family.  I will never be without it. It&#x27;s done wonders for my face!</li>
            <li> It takes more then 3 weeks to get completely clear skin.... that&#x27;s why I gave it 2 stars. I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I thought but it did work fine.</li>
            <li> waste of money doesnt work</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. ..I have really dark scars on my cheeks from my 8 year battle with cystic acne. Before trying Kojie San I tried Maderma along with many other home remedies for scar fading (Lemon juice, honey, face scrubs). They worked a LITTLE over a few months. In a month I can see that some of my darkest  and oldest scars on my face have lightened up quite a bit. ...I now don&#x27;t have to apply as much concealer to hide the scars It&#x27;s also prevented me from having any breakouts. Being black I have very oily skin by nature. .. this product has drastically decreased my oil production without drying my skin. I will say the product will dry your skin out if you don&#x27;t use a good natural moisturizer.  After I shower I apply virgin unrefined coconut oil to my skin or Shea Butter mixed with lotion. I definitely plan to purchase again. I recommend this to anyone with problem skin.  If I knew about this product it would&#x27;ve saved me so much trouble, money and scars.</li>
            <li> The bars were smaller than what I have previously ordered, but I am thinking that  it was from a different distribution</li>
            <li> Came way before time. Product was intact....smooth transaction &amp; after 2 days of use it I&#x27;m seeing good results with my skins texture.....</li>
            <li> Works great with no irritation to my skin! Finally, something that does what it says it does. I have a new love!</li>
            <li> I have old scars on my feet from random bruises &amp; wanted to be rid of them. I&#x27;ve been using tge soap a little over 3 weeks &amp; i&#x27;ve seen no change. I thought maybe because the scars/hyperpigmentaion are old but it still made no change on new ones. I purchased 2 packs(both packs come with 2 bars).&lt;br /&gt;PROS: smells good, good cleanser, good price, fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;CONS: did not fade anything after 3 wks of use, very drying on the skin, bars of soap dissolve quickly so keep away from shower/sink when not in use(keep in a dry container)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i will use the remaining bars until theyre all gone but i will not purchase this again, unless, i see a change in the scars after using the remaing bars.</li>
            <li> Made me break out terribly. Had to discontinue using this product !!</li>
            <li> This is very a good products. I like the fact that  the effect was noticeable after one week. People started asking me what I am sing on my face. It decreases the pores and brighten complexion. &amp;#34;not lightening&amp;#34; if yo want a smoother skin and brighter complexion this is just the right product. As per the drying effect which many reviewer mentioned, I have combination skin (oil/dry combo), you have to se a toner anytime you wash your face with a soap in order to balance the pH.  As for me I did not have any dryness, after using my toner, I moisturized, and that is it. I have been using  this for 4 weeks and I will order more. Remember this is mainly for brightening complexion.</li>
            <li> nice soap for evening out you.re skin tone ,found a gem.</li>
            <li> I use this for my armpits and bikini area to treat ingrown hairs.  It&#x27;s a great gentle exfoliator for me.  I only leave it on for a couple of minutes max and have not had any issues with burning, peeling, or irritation. Follow up with a good moisturizer and you shouldn&#x27;t have any weird dryness.</li>
            <li> I can see some brightness in my skin . My blemishes are still there but not as bad. I will give it some more time , however still not dissatisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lighten skin need something stronger waste of money.</li>
            <li> Works great on blemishes, boo-boos, pigmentation all over body, and smells good too. Gentle on skin and lathers very well.</li>
            <li> Small soaps, but waiting to see the results! Looking forward to using the soaps.  I will post another review later.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! I am a medium chocolate color. It helps with my oily skin and really does lighten. I use it in the morning, I apply it to my face before I get in the shower and rinse it off after. It has also helped me lighten my skin after a bad sunburn/tan.</li>
            <li> okay I been using for about a mouth , on and of r I see a little improvement I&#x27;m trying to get rid of  my scars on my legs  , there lighter but still noticeable , and I&#x27;m a brown skin girl .</li>
            <li> I prefer using this Kojie San Kojic Acid Skin Whitening soap.  I tried another professional strength kojic soap and was not as impressed as I am with Kojie.  Honestly, I used this soap 2x&#x27;s a day for 3 weeks.  I noticed a difference in my skin&#x27;s texture, smoothness, clarity, pore shrinkage, and lightening of brown spots that were very noticeable before and now it has been lightened by 1-2 shades.  I am confident that with continued use, it will be completely faded.  I gave it four stars because I am impatient and want these dark spots (used all types of lighteners before and was disappointed with the results) to disappear!  I will keep using until discoloration is gone!</li>
            <li> It made my skin even. My face has been pretty clear and my zits would dry right up after first use.  My kp on my arm is not a deep red anymore. It works almost like tretinion but mild.</li>
            <li> Good product it really lightens and makes the skin feel smooth and clean</li>
            <li> this soap slightly lightens my skin, every skin type is different that&#x27;s my opinion. I so far like it, only been using for about a month.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome, At first it burned a little bit and once I got used to it , It wasn&#x27;t burning anymore, but my face is clearing up then ever before. I wish I&#x27;ve known this product a long time ago. And shipping process was fast and on time...</li>
            <li> I am a African american woman who was excited and hopeful this product would lighten my dark under eye circles. I have used it for a couple months but I do not see a significant amount of lightening under my eyes. I will keep searching for a product that will lighten under my eyes to my satisfaction.  I have been using several skin lightening products that work a little bit but they don&#x27;t work enough to see a significant amount of improvement.  Would not recommend this product to those wanting a significant improvement for the reduction of dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap on my arms every day for 2 months and the difference compared to my legs is about 5 shades!! I love it really works :)</li>
            <li> It stained my shower in a orange color</li>
            <li> I just got it in the mail today, it arrived as posted and when I opened the mailing package the product was in good condition. I opened the box of soap and two orange bars,(there the size of hotel soap), they were each wrapped in plastic and they smelled of candy. I took a shower and the bar doesn&#x27;t dissolve quickly and makes a lot of suds and the color doesn&#x27;t stain anything and the product didn&#x27;t burn my skin when I let it sit for 2 minutes. Im impressed so far.</li>
            <li> Did nothing to lighten my acne scars. Not buying again</li>
            <li> i like this product it smells nice and it lightened my skin two shades about one shade lighter it actually helped my acne to.</li>
            <li> Did not work for us. Did not reduce sun damage spots on face. Found Retinal-A much more effective and did see a difference in hyper pigmentation on face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a week and I can truly say Im seeing results especially in my elbows and knees and few spots I have on my arms due to birth control pills. Ive read that it takes about 2-3 months to see results but i can see a difference. fortunately I&#x27;m not experiencing any dryness of skin or other negative effect.</li>
            <li> After using the product for a couple of weeks I noticed skin getting lighter and some acne scars disappearing. But I also exfoliated my skin everytime before using the product and wore sunblock afterwards.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed purchasing the soap. It has been helping me to clear the acne on my face without causing irritation. I am very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> It has a good smell but it actually seemed to make me darker and it really aggravated my skin.</li>
            <li> This soap is great and I will continue to use it. This really works and is worth every penny. A great choice.</li>
            <li> works well it&#x27;s just very small soap bars</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference.  I get hyperpigmentation every time I get acne - no matter how big or small my zit is!  I use this and then I use ACV as toner afterwards.  I always use toner after I wash my face, because I notice when I don&#x27;t, I&#x27;m prone to more breakouts.  These soap bars are tiny and they take a couple weeks to receive, but  I know there are other sellers here that ship via Prime, so if you&#x27;re impatient and don&#x27;t mind paying a couple more dollars, buy it from a different vendor.</li>
            <li> I so love it, I&#x27;m about 2 or 3 shades lighter...&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face daily and no breakouts have an accord, unlike any other bar soaps  ive used, I use it twice daily, would recommend using sun screen...</li>
            <li> I have hyperpigmentation issues and I love this soap, it really does what it says. It evens out your skin complexion and gives you this beautiful glow, that&#x27;s so noticeable everyone comments on my skin. I started using in on my body and it also brightened it up and now my stretch marks are less noticeable. This stuff is amazing, can&#x27;t  live without it.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!!! It has cleared up my acne so much! I recommended for anybody who has acne.</li>
            <li> The product came fast ! Lightening your skin with this really works</li>
            <li> Mistake buying this product.  Substandard quality. Did not deliver the results I wanted.  I will never buy nor recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin, it didn&#x27;t work on me that much. Made one part of my skin lighter than the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> Helped me get rid of scars from pityriasis rosea. Smells citrusy and pleasant.</li>
            <li> wonderful soap! my skin started looking different in just a couple weeks. I would def. recommend this product. I used it along with the piona strong bleaching cream so that helped to boost my appearance</li>
            <li> I just got this yesterday and I was really surprised at the people that say it has a bad smell. When I opened it it smelled really nice, like orange pop.  The bars are pretty small so I cut them each of them in 8 pieces, so 16 cubes in total, and around 2 and a half uses per cube. So 35 uses for the whole package. Its really not lying when it says its skin drying, so use a lot of moisturiser. I&#x27;m African American, and my the top half of my face is Beyonce shade and the bottom is Gabrielle Union, along with my butt, elbows and knees and a lot of scars all over my legs and thighs. And I don&#x27;t see a difference right now and I don&#x27;t get pimples but other than that I think this soap will really work. I&#x27;ll try to update after a week or two.    Update: Its been a week or so and this soap is not as good as I originally thought. It did work a little and my face is a tad lighter, as with my knees and elbows. But not anything dramatic and miraculous. However I think I need to stop using this because when I used it yesterday before I took a bath it really burned my face but not anywhere else so I washed it off and tried again but it still burned so I just took it of and around two hours later my jawline has this dark rash on it so I think i will just lay off for the next week or two. I will do one more update.</li>
            <li> I do like Kojie San Kojic Acid Skin Whitening it certainly has met my expectation and I would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> It definitely has brightened areas of red caused by acne and can tell that my face is getting softer and has less acne it kinda burns if it gets in the eyes but it works wonders also it&#x27;s a bit drying but It&#x27;s okay just wear moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> Good for exfoliating. Will brighten, but not whiten your skin on it&#x27;s own. Use hyrdoquinone lightening products after washing with this regularly to actually whiten.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap ever!! I use it everyday once a day. I get compliments on my skin all the time. I got mine from ebay which is a little bit cheaper.. Buy it you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Works for people with moderate discoloration or blemishes</li>
            <li> This soap is freaking amazing, I&#x27;ve only been using this soap for four days and my skin has already lightened a shade. I love this soap and will be using this soap for my lifetime. If your having trouble with the soap it helps to exfoliate three times and then to allow the soap to stay on ur skin for five minutes it will work just be consistent</li>
            <li> The saop is amazing, I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and I can already see a difference, my face is way softer and I have no pimples anymore and I got 2 shades lighter (I am black by the way). The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the saop is that its small so if you want to buy it make sure you try a bigger bar size but that just my opinion because trust me you will love it and you won&#x27;t be able to imagine your daily facial/shower without it! Great beauty product!</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing, after the first week my face was glowing. ( or at least I thought so, lol.) I&#x27;ve been using it for about  a month now and the results are minimal but what do you expect to happen. Like the other reviews it did leave me very dry but that&#x27;s no biggie. Also, maybe I bathe too much but my first bar was gone during my second week. At least I know now because I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Soap leafs skin smooth and soft .&lt;br /&gt;It has reduced my acne but hasn&#x27;t lightened my skin but grate products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks and I&#x27;m seeing very slow progress. It could be due to the fact I&#x27;m half Caucasian, but it hasn&#x27;t been clearing my acne spots or lightening my skin the way I had hoped it to.</li>
            <li> Yesterday was my first time using this product and I absolutely love it. I also used nadinola like a week prior to receiving this soap. I ordered this sop and received it about 8-9 days later because it came from GUAM. I was able to track the package as I was really anxious to receive the soap. It lightened my skin about a little under a half shade which is cool. My face loves this soap. I can leave it on for 30 minutes without it hurting my face. I am planning to leave it on my body overnight and rinse off in the morning because I feel that if you leave it on longer (if your skin is not sensitive) then it will lighten better. I also started using sunscreen because the sun tends to be hotter in Georgia than the northern states and will cook you faster. I am a light caramel skinned AA woman ( I like to say the color of hot dog buns). I cut the soap in small pieces to use and I put in on by lathering it up and spreading all over by body. It does melt very fast. I do keep my soap in individual ziplock bags so that I can get more use out of my soap. My hands have lightened as well. I got dark over the 15 years that I have lived in the south and within the one week of using nadinola and the one day (day and night) of using this soap I am really satisfied with the results. I am thinking about doing a peel for my body but not on my face because I am fearful of burning my face.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to have another shower. Bought it not long ago but I&#x27;m totally in love with this soap.</li>
            <li> This is a keeper! The orange Colored soap is deliciously scented. It lathers up wonderfully on my skin, and tingles. That&#x27;s how I know it&#x27;s working. I love this soap and will continue ordering it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Burns a little.  Helped my breakouts.</li>
            <li> I only gave it a 2 because i have not seen much of a difference in my skin tone.im on my third bar of soap,i believe its working i just have to be consistent i only been using it once a day and everyones body reacts differently to different products.</li>
            <li> I been using this soap for two weeks an it does works for my acne spots.They  has lighting up alot ,im  a mix breed of white, Indian, black .Im still using this soap an will keep using it for a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Got it before I expected it and can&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
            <li> nice product i see my skin is soft and not dried out at all&lt;br /&gt;as far a s lightening  i have  already have light skin&lt;br /&gt;but i have some brown spots i would like to fade&lt;br /&gt;i bought based on reviews for the improvement i saw in other people&lt;br /&gt;try it i may buy some more&lt;br /&gt;to see what happens over time&lt;br /&gt;smells nice as well</li>
            <li> I ordered Kojie San on jan 5 and got it the 10. Which is pretty fast, but I&#x27;m in the LA area so I don&#x27;t know if that has anything to do with it. I started using Kojie san on Saturday so far I like it. My skin type is sensitive (sometimes I have eczema).&lt;br /&gt;Obviously I wont be able to see results for a couple more weeks. Here are some pros and cons of my first experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-orange citrus smell&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin ( and I&#x27;ve been using a exfoliating cloth with it)&lt;br /&gt;- skin feels smooth and a bit firm&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t burn when applied to face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- bars are pretty small ( hotel soap to compare)&lt;br /&gt;- the only place it burns is the nipple area! As well as you can, KEEP SOAP OFF NIPPLE AREA. Go around instead; male or female. After the first use that area felt raw (compared to chaffing against tshirt without a bra on, then go jogging)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most reviews said to cut the bar into small pieces. I cut my bar horizontally into 5 even pieces and put in a ziplock bag. So far it&#x27;s about 3 uses per piece. Making it appx. 15 uses per full bar. I plan on using Kojie San every other day (4x per week). It&#x27;s been gloomy/rainy  lately so I haven&#x27;t needed to use sunscreen, but will do so when needed.&lt;br /&gt;Keep your skin moisturized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update after 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Really works I wash my flash with the on-air brush then I  clean it with water after that I lather the soap on my face and leave it on for five minutes and I used it for week it really bbc.co works</li>
            <li> I use to clear the tan lines after beach vacation and to lighten knees and elbows. As far as my face, I leave on for no more than a minute else it leaves burn like spots on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It is a nice product so far I just need to use it more often to see the results, also smells good and very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> Does lighten but haven&#x27;t seen a drastic change</li>
            <li> Well, it smells good but I didnt notice any lightening of my skin seems as if got a lil darker ill stick with nadinola</li>
            <li> It does work i use it for my underarms i dont use it everyday</li>
            <li> Does not appear to be affective on hyper pigmentation. Very drying.Did not perform as expected.</li>
            <li> Ok so i am lightening my entire body. I am Kelly Rowland complexion and want to be light like Alicia Keys. I leave this soap on for about three minutes and then exfoliate my skin with an exfoliate glove (amazon has this). And then i use the Piona bleaching cream two to three times tbroughout the day. I can honestlyy say that my face has gotten lighter. But not 100% remember im really dark. So its going to take time for my skin to be completely lighter. But so far this soap is working! If yur skin isnt shedding or you not seeing results. Means u need to exfoliate twice or three times a day. I know it sounds crazy but this is the only way u going to see fast results. I want to be really light by Decemeber. Thats my goal.</li>
            <li> I always have extra bars of this soap in my cabinet so that I never run out. I use it a couple times a week on my face to keep it fresh and bright especially after a hard gym workout.</li>
            <li> I uses soap for two days and I couldn&#x27;t use it no more it made my skin horribly bad and made it dry so it wasn&#x27;t good for me at all I threw it away and didn&#x27;t even finish using it it was just a bad decision it wasn&#x27;t good for me.</li>
            <li> Im 15 years old. When i was little i used to get bit by bugs and fall and hurt myself all the time. Now i have thousands of scars on my arms and legs i also have back acne and chest acne. Im an african american girl and my skin tone is in between dark skin and light skin. Some Caucasian people think im a mixed but im not some african american people say im light skin but i prefer my self as in between some people say im two toned with all these spots. This soap  dosent help at all. Im a shy teen with real low self esteem. I all most commited suicide because of my skin my shyness and the way people treat me i thought the soap was going to help clear my spots. every time i wear shorts people ask me &amp;#34;what dat stuff is on yo legs&amp;#34; sometimes i say that i was born with it thats what my mom told me when i was younger now im older she says she dont know how my skin got liked this the main reason why i bought this is because every other teenager ive seen got clear glowing skin and i over here boys talking about how they want a light skinned girlfriend with a big butts and sexy legs the only thing i got out of that is the butt and its starting to go away boys flirt with me a lot but the ones that do aren&#x27;t  my type so i turn down every single one of them i thought the soap was going to clear my skin the only good thing i can say about this soap is that it makes my skin real soft therefore i waisted my money on two packs of soap i barely use</li>
            <li> I had really high expectations for this soap but it let me down, didn&#x27;t really see any noticeable changes with my acne or skin tone and i was really hoping it would atleast lighten my complexion a little bit oh well maybe ill try the likas papaya soap next and see what happens!</li>
            <li> Purchased 4 bars and it did nothing for the hyperpigmentation on my arms. My arms are significantly darker than my chest and face and I wanted it all to even out. This soap made no difference. Next.</li>
            <li> Used for a week and already see and feel results, my skin looks and feels moist and healthy, great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for over 2 months now and I must say, it has been working well! I have dark skin (like Kelly Rowland&#x27;s tone) and I mainly use it to get rid of hyperpigmentation. It doesn&#x27;t give that ugly bleached face look lol and it&#x27;s all natural and safe unlike the mercury filled &amp;#34;others&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m actually ordering more because I don&#x27;t want to run out!</li>
            <li> product works love koji-san to brighten dull skin</li>
            <li> Just got this package, super small bars. This explains the price, i hope this helps with acne scars.</li>
            <li> Not everyone on here has hyper pigmentation,sun burns ect. Some people just want lighter skin,and that&#x27;s absolutely fine. I&#x27;m one of those people I&#x27;m a black female. About Kelly Rowland&#x27;s complexion,I want a lighter complexion so I have been using this soap about two months. I&#x27;ve tried creams and they aren&#x27;t that great,I will admit this soap burns and can itch. But it works,everytime I use I look in the mirror and feel as though I see gold undertones in my skin. It works,but don&#x27;t expect a huge over night. Even in my two months,its slowly working. I had a darkline across my wrist and it just keeps getting more faint. I plan to stick with this soap.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen anything no results nothing just dry skin</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for two years and I really like it.  It really works just like it has been advertised.  The dark spots, fine wrinkles and other problems has faded.  I use this soap on my face every morning and evening.&lt;br /&gt;It is very low coast and works the best compared to any other expensive facial soaps that I have used. My face is smooth, soft and even toned.  I plan to continue using as long as I can.</li>
            <li> Some brightening, but nothing too impressive.&lt;br /&gt;Also ran out very quickly.</li>
