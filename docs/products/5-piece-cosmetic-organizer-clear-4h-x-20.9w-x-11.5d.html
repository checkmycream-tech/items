            <li>It holds a lot of miscellaneous items and is visually appealing.</li>
            <li>I spent 3 days looking at all of the acrylic organizers on Amazon, and settled on this, and BOY what a GREAT DECISION!  </li>
            <li>Great company &amp; shipped super fast.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a pratical, organized, keep EVERYTHING condensed, easy to find stuff, cosmetic organizer for a vanity, table...</li>
            <li>all neat and easy to find.</li>
            <li>This is made of strong plastic--4 separate square trays within a tray, so that you have some freedom to arrange the way you want.  </li>
            <li>It is more than adequate to hold all my cosmetics.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge and I get plenty of compliments....</li>
            <li>It does have a very large foot print, so I would caution that you measure your space to make sure it fits where you want to put it.</li>
            <li>Everything looks neat and organized now, and it&#x27;s been super easy to keep it that way.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the price!  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;The design it very useful, having the movable trays is a nice feature and the quality is great - the plastic is thick and wont chip or crack.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My girl friend uses it to organize all her makeup products, it&#x27;s so clean like showing all her goods in store.</li>
            <li>Be sure to measure because it is a fairly large piece.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, hold soooo many items, my vanity looks so organized with this</li>
            <li>It really helped me organize my make up in a much better fashion.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it would been a great organizer.</li>
            <li>After searching far and wide for a cosmetics/skin care organizer, Iam so happy I came across this!  </li>
            <li>yet all fit onto one large tray.</li>
            <li>Soooo worth the money.</li>
            <li>some but well worth</li>
            <li>So nice to be able to organize all my cosmetics and have them in plain view</li>
            <li>Exactly what I hoped for, thank you for getting this to me so quickly</li>
            <li>And what&#x27;s good about it is that it&#x27;s pretty large and the different dividers are not stuck together</li>
            <li>So, I can lift the entire tray when I want to clean my the top of my bureau</li>
            <li>This organizer really comes in useful!</li>
            <li>It is rather large overall and can be divided to store even more, so plan on using this in a stationary place like a bathroom counter top, or a makeup stand where you won&#x27;t need to move it much.</li>
            <li>I even bought another last August for my sister&#x27;s birthday :)</li>
            <li>This is the only one I could find that would actually be able to hold all my make-up.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly as advertised and does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>It is high quality and very pretty.</li>
            <li>I noticed I can apply my make-up much quicker now that I can see and then grab exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>It has four separate pieces that can fit into the 5th (large tray) or can each be used individually.</li>
            <li>It has really helped my organization of everything.</li>
            <li>It will help to keep me from buying multiples I don&#x27;t want, at a glance really helps with inventory when preparing to order online or GWP.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s really neat is that you can rearrange the &amp;#34;5 pieces&amp;#34; and assemble the parts to your liking.</li>
            <li>The acrylic seems solid and the fact that it&#x27;s clear it helps you easily find what you are looking for.    </li>
            <li>I looked everywhere for an acrylic organizer for a decent price.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a decent sized make-up organizer for my bathroom.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and big and fits all my make-up items as well as eye drops, nasal spray and all my other &amp;#34;stuff.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Very handy and nice-looking compared to my previous messy arrangement.</li>
            <li>I am very hard to please, but I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This organizer is larger than I expected, but I was still able to use it all.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a makeup organizer for a really long time, wanting something that was a little bigger and could fit more things.</li>
            <li>It fits on my vanity and because it&#x27;s clear it doesn&#x27;t compete with my vanity table!</li>
            <li>Wow, this is just what I needed!</li>
            <li>I looked high and low for a large make up organizer</li>
            <li>It was really a headache for me especially in the morning, when i have to quickly get ready to go to work, to find one lipstick or eyepencil becauce they were stack in a big or multiple makeup bag or drawers organizer thing or cosmetic case...</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at a couple different pieces before deciding on this one, it was a little more costly then</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li>The problem with that was that I forgot about products that I owned, I couldn&#x27;t find things in a hurry, they were taking up too much space, and I started buying things that were similar to what I already had (since what I had was hiding in drawers).</li>
            <li>Another thing that I really like about it is that you can adjust the different sections (they come out) and rearrange them however you wish.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that I wish it had more slots for makeup palettes (I have quite a few</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a durable hard clear plastic and does not look cheap.</li>
            <li>What I really like about it is that there are several pieces ( different sizes and shapes)</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t stress how amazing the size of it, it fits almost all of my makeup (which was very difficult).</li>
            <li>It is also quite large compared to the other sets.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I needed to organize my 10+ lip gloss&#x27;, my lip liners, eye liners, and various color contact lenses, and other makup accessories like brushes, blushes and eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really into makeup, so i have a complete kit to do my makeup everyday and for every occasion from foundation, eyeshadows, concealers...</li>
            <li>Figured that it was not worth the effort to return the whole thing via Amazon just for one piece of a 5 piece set.</li>
            <li>What I love the most about this setup is that all of the pieces are MOVABLE and the base piece serves as a solid foundation upon which to build your &amp;#34;CUSTOM&amp;#34; makeup center.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It is large and a little bulky but that is what my daughter needed for her dresser and all of her make-up.</li>

            <li> Great for organizing &amp; keeping everything in its place. Be sure to measure because it is a fairly large piece.</li>
            <li> I love the adjustable parts to create the perfect organized vanity space.</li>
            <li> This an amazing organizer for some of my makeup.  It is high quality and very pretty. I am very hard to please, but I am very satisfied with my purchase. Plus, I think it is made in the USA.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really into makeup, so i have a complete kit to do my makeup everyday and for every occasion from foundation, eyeshadows, concealers...It was really a headache for me especially in the morning, when i have to quickly get ready to go to work, to find one lipstick or eyepencil becauce they were stack in a big or multiple makeup bag or drawers organizer thing or cosmetic case...i tried them all trust me and this is the best one ! If you&#x27;re looking for a pratical, organized, keep EVERYTHING condensed, easy to find stuff, cosmetic organizer for a vanity, table... this is it you guys !  And what&#x27;s good about it is that it&#x27;s pretty large and the different dividers are not stuck together, they are just resting in this acrylic tray so you can arrange them however you like or even take the pieces you don&#x27;t want or need out to put them somewhere else or use them for something else. The acrylic seems solid and the fact that it&#x27;s clear it helps you easily find what you are looking for.    Hope that helps !</li>
            <li> looks good and since it is clear,displayed neatly all my cosmetics.No wasting time to search for makeup,which is great.Love it.</li>
            <li> I used this for almost 3 years. The quality is great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. Organized make-up finally!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed to organize my 10+ lip gloss&#x27;, my lip liners, eye liners, and various color contact lenses, and other makup accessories like brushes, blushes and eyeshadows. It is rather large overall and can be divided to store even more, so plan on using this in a stationary place like a bathroom counter top, or a makeup stand where you won&#x27;t need to move it much. It has really helped my organization of everything. It&#x27;s a durable hard clear plastic and does not look cheap. I would definately recommend this to others who have a stockpile of makeup pencils, or lip gloss type lip colors. I think it made a perfect fit for my needs!!!</li>
            <li> This organizer is well made - the 5 compartments give me tons of space for storage - I can find everything very easily now.  My countertop looks so good now without everything all over.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for an acrylic organizer for a decent price.  This one has room for everything!  It&#x27;s durable too.  I&#x27;d recommend it to any woman looking to organize their cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Soooo worth the money. I love this product and i would gift this to anyone who is a make up lover because i would be great for organization. Great product! Great shipper</li>
            <li> What I really like about it is that there are several pieces ( different sizes and shapes) yet all fit onto one large tray. So, I can lift the entire tray when I want to clean my the top of my bureau</li>
            <li> This organizer is larger than I expected, but I was still able to use it all.  Nicely made, I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I looked high and low for a large make up organizer and this does not disappoint! It is large and a little bulky but that is what my daughter needed for her dresser and all of her make-up. Great company &amp; shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> Our dressing table used to look like a mess. But no more. I wish it was a weeee bit bigger as I see some stuff on the side not fitting. Yet its a great piece of organizer.</li>
            <li> Love it!  One small problem though, there is a small crack and chip in the back of the slanted holder.  Otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars.  I emailed US acrylic, but my emails would not get accepted by their server.  So I gave up.  Figured that it was not worth the effort to return the whole thing via Amazon just for one piece of a 5 piece set.</li>
            <li> The organizer is on the larger size, but you&#x27;ll find uses for it.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s great and it can be used for all sorts of things.</li>
            <li> This is a nice sturdy make up tray. It is more than adequate to hold all my cosmetics. It does have a very large foot print, so I would caution that you measure your space to make sure it fits where you want to put it.</li>
            <li> This is pretty amazing!! It&#x27;s huge and I get plenty of compliments....I even bought another last August for my sister&#x27;s birthday :)</li>
            <li> The product arrived with the end of the tray chipped off or slightly damaged. Other than that, it would been a great organizer. Returned for a refund.</li>
            <li> My girl friend uses it to organize all her makeup products, it&#x27;s so clean like showing all her goods in store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love! In make-up aficionado needs this organizer. It has a place for palates lipsticks, liners, gloss, using the elevated tray in the back I now house my fragrance. It will help to keep me from buying multiples I don&#x27;t want, at a glance really helps with inventory when preparing to order online or GWP. It fits on my vanity and because it&#x27;s clear it doesn&#x27;t compete with my vanity table!</li>
            <li> Love this item. Very sturdy, hold soooo many items, my vanity looks so organized with this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recomment this.</li>
            <li> I love this! I had been feeling a bit overwhelmed by my makeup collection. I had things hiding in sterilite organizers - out of sight and out of mind. The problem with that was that I forgot about products that I owned, I couldn&#x27;t find things in a hurry, they were taking up too much space, and I started buying things that were similar to what I already had (since what I had was hiding in drawers). I also wanted to minimize my makeup collection. I actually use the nail polish display to store my lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it&#x27;s clear so I can see everything that I have. I also like that I can re-arrange the different organizers. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that I wish it had more slots for makeup palettes (I have quite a few so I need more than 3 slots). I&#x27;m thinking of using one of the nail polish display shelves to hold some of my palettes. Other than that, I highly recommend this product. I love it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a decent sized make-up organizer for my bathroom. This is the only one I could find that would actually be able to hold all my make-up. you can rearrange the different containers, it fits all my make-up with room to spare! Love it, really happy I bought it</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a makeup organizer for a really long time, wanting something that was a little bigger and could fit more things. I really like how the four pieces are not attached to the large base, so you can configure it anyway you like. I really can&#x27;t stress how amazing the size of it, it fits almost all of my makeup (which was very difficult). Truly, truly impressed.</li>
            <li> This organizer is made of super sturdy plastic and is very stylish! It really helped me organize my make up in a much better fashion. The product arrived in a timely manner in great condition.</li>
            <li> Well made, tray is nice to have underneath, well thought out - plenty of areas for pencils, lipsticks - great spacing</li>
            <li> The organizer took up all of my makeup (except for my single eye shadows, which I have a gazillion of) and still managed not to swallow my desk! What&#x27;s really neat is that you can rearrange the &amp;#34;5 pieces&amp;#34; and assemble the parts to your liking. Nearly perfect, the product was delivered pretty quickly and was as described.</li>
            <li> This organizer really comes in useful! It has a place for everything, plus some! It is also durable, and you can even move some of the sections around to your liking.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It has four separate pieces that can fit into the 5th (large tray) or can each be used individually. The separate pieces have dividers which make each one perfect for storing different sized items. It&#x27;s made up of a nice sturdy material. I am happy with the product, quality, size, and price. I will be using it to store my makeup. I had looked at several others but they were much more expensive and way smaller. Would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> This was just what I was looking for to organize my makeup. It looks nice and chic, but it also holds a lot. Another thing that I really like about it is that you can adjust the different sections (they come out) and rearrange them however you wish.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these. Great quality and looks so great on my vanity. Keeps my make up all neat and easy to find.</li>
            <li> I spent 3 days looking at all of the acrylic organizers on Amazon, and settled on this, and BOY what a GREAT DECISION!  What I love the most about this setup is that all of the pieces are MOVABLE and the base piece serves as a solid foundation upon which to build your &amp;#34;CUSTOM&amp;#34; makeup center.  It is also quite large compared to the other sets.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  It looks great on my vanity.  I always like the look of the acrylic organizers.</li>
            <li> Love it, all my friends wabt one</li>
            <li> So nice to be able to organize all my cosmetics and have them in plain view&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at a couple different pieces before deciding on this one, it was a little more costly then some but well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The design it very useful, having the movable trays is a nice feature and the quality is great - the plastic is thick and wont chip or crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I hoped for, thank you for getting this to me so quickly</li>
            <li> Looks nice &amp; is convenient to store makeup items...keeps my vanity much more organized.  Might have to buy another one</li>
            <li> Wow, this is just what I needed! I&#x27;ve had it a week and gone are the sloppy piles of make up goodies all over my make-up table. Everything looks neat and organized now, and it&#x27;s been super easy to keep it that way. I noticed I can apply my make-up much quicker now that I can see and then grab exactly what I need. This is made of strong plastic--4 separate square trays within a tray, so that you have some freedom to arrange the way you want.  Very handy and nice-looking compared to my previous messy arrangement. Love it. It&#x27;s nice and big and fits all my make-up items as well as eye drops, nasal spray and all my other &amp;#34;stuff.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is exactly as advertised and does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It holds a lot of miscellaneous items and is visually appealing.</li>
            <li> After searching far and wide for a cosmetics/skin care organizer, Iam so happy I came across this!  Absolutely worth the price!  Great size, made good, and prevents me from \\&quot;spreading out\\&quot; all my stuff to my husbands side of the dual vanity in our master bathroom. Highly recommend it!!</li>
