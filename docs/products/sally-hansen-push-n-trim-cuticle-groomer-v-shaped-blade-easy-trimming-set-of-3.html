            <li>This item is the best one I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>This item is the best one I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I use it to apply my Jamberry nail wraps and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This one is just great.</li>
            <li>The plastic is sturdy and the grip on it is great.</li>
            <li>If it were sharper, it&#x27;d be great, but I can&#x27;t recommend as is.</li>
            <li>Nice weight, good quality, works well.  </li>
            <li>and I am more than delighted to have accidentally found it in the kit I bought.  </li>
            <li>and I thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>This is very cheap, you shouldn&#x27;t get this overpriced item when you can get it at ulta for $3.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>The idea is great, but the device, not so much.</li>
            <li>Cuticle ripper is more like it.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; skids along the top of the cuticle and does literally nothing.</li>
            <li>I couldnt&#x27; really figure out how to effectively use the cutter part without gouging my nails.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sharp... which is very good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please with these, and will continue to purchase more as needed.</li>
            <li>This is the first combo I have used on my nails that allows easy use with either hand</li>
            <li>These types of tools are great, but this one isn&#x27;t sharp.  </li>
            <li>Actually, the trimmer is pretty good, for the price, too.</li>
            <li>TRIM makes a much better product, especially the one with the easy hold rubber grip.</li>
            <li>I just received it today after waiting weeks but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>A good sharp pair of cuticle nippers is required for that.  </li>
            <li>A very comfortably handle and nice rubber tip that pushes cuticles firmly but gently.  </li>
            <li>If the trimming blade is the main reason you&#x27;re looking to buy this tool, I&#x27;d honestly recommend going with one of the cheap pink ones with the trimmer blade/filer blade combo that you can find on this site.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is not the tool for large cuticles or hanging/torn cuticles.  </li>
            <li>They may not last as long, but they cut much more accurately and with ease.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as if the Chinese manufacturer never sharpened the cheap flimsy metal.</li>
            <li>The handle and pusher end of this tool feel very sturdy and well-made.</li>
            <li>The cuticle pusher end is nice and firm, but soft, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>This arrived much sooner than I expected, and has been much more useful than I expected.</li>
            <li>The trimmer end of this tool though, is severely lacking as it&#x27;s not even nearly as sharp as a blade that you&#x27;d find on a cheap trimmer/filer tool.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this thing.</li>
            <li>Good product that does everything it needs to do- be careful with it though as this item is very sharp!</li>
            <li>Surprised at Sally Hansen.  </li>
            <li>I like this much better than nail scissors or clippers since it protects me from cutting myself and gets the extra skin easily.</li>
            <li>Is also works exactly as I wanted for burnishing down my wraps.  </li>
            <li>This is not a forever cuticle trimmer, it does get dull over time and needs to be replaced like most sharp things, you either sharpen them or toss them.</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews the sharpeness of the blade varies wildly from too sharp to not sharp at all.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t cut off my cuticles completely, but I will trim them down after pushing if there are edges that look like they might get caught on things.</li>
            <li> If you can find a SH store near you: faster &amp; less expense.</li>
            <li> I love when it is sharp to have one swoop and done, scissors are difficult to manipulate with both hands</li>
            <li> Maybe I have metal cuticles, but this thing dulled out quick and it tears skin instead of cutting it, only after a few uses.</li>
            <li> so be careful!).  </li>
            <li> I bought this for the rubber cuticle pusher, not the trimmer, so I wasn&#x27;t concerned about other reviews that said the trimmer wasn&#x27;t sharp.  </li>
            <li> However ,you have to be very careful using it as you can cut yourself!</li>
            <li> Not very easy to use without cutting/ripping an area.</li>
            <li> This item was not as I had expected,  the sharp part didn&#x27;t cut, it was dull, just tore my cutical...  </li>
            <li> and it broke off from the plastic after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This cuticle trimmer is so dull that I threw it out after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is too sharp and ends up cutting my nails as well as my cuticles, creating lines that have to grow out.</li>
            <li> Completely dull, poorly made and useless.</li>
            <li> I am bed ridden, so I am unable to go and shop for the items I want....</li>
            <li> But, the trimmer end is useless!</li>
            <li> Maybe I am an idiot?  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed..</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I read about this item in &amp;#34;goodhouse Keeping magazine and I am pleased with it.  However ,you have to be very careful using it as you can cut yourself!</li>
            <li> This is not a forever cuticle trimmer, it does get dull over time and needs to be replaced like most sharp things, you either sharpen them or toss them. This is the first combo I have used on my nails that allows easy use with either hand and I am more than delighted to have accidentally found it in the kit I bought.  I love when it is sharp to have one swoop and done, scissors are difficult to manipulate with both hands and I thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> This cuticle trimmer is so dull that I threw it out after 5 minutes. It just made my cuticles bleed when it did anything at all. I had to go to a manicurist to fix the damage!</li>
            <li> This item is the best one I have ever used. I recommended to anyone. I love it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This item was not as I had expected,  the sharp part didn&#x27;t cut, it was dull, just tore my cutical...  I am very disappointed.. I am bed ridden, so I am unable to go and shop for the items I want....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if the Chinese manufacturer never sharpened the cheap flimsy metal. Based on the reviews the sharpeness of the blade varies wildly from too sharp to not sharp at all. I wrote Sally Hansen suggesting they pull this product until they worked out the quality issue.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have metal cuticles, but this thing dulled out quick and it tears skin instead of cutting it, only after a few uses. The idea is great, but the device, not so much.</li>
            <li> The handle and pusher end of this tool feel very sturdy and well-made. The pusher is soft and actually works quite well in pushing down your cuticles. The trimmer end of this tool though, is severely lacking as it&#x27;s not even nearly as sharp as a blade that you&#x27;d find on a cheap trimmer/filer tool.

They may not last as long, but they cut much more accurately and with ease.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am an idiot?  I couldnt&#x27; really figure out how to effectively use the cutter part without gouging my nails.  I don&#x27;t recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> Good product that does everything it needs to do- be careful with it though as this item is very sharp! (I accidentally went too deep and into my nail with this tool- so be careful!).  With this in mind it cuts cuticles like butter- I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This item is the best one I have ever used. I just received it today after waiting weeks but worth the wait. If you can find a SH store near you: faster &amp; less expense. No such luck for me on location.&lt;br /&gt;I lopped one star because of the shipping cost. Wish they had enrolled in the Add-On program.</li>
            <li> This arrived much sooner than I expected, and has been much more useful than I expected. It&#x27;s very sharp... which is very good. I&#x27;ve not found any danger in using it.</li>
            <li> Nice weight, good quality, works well.  Shipped promptly.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this thing. I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it before. Trims your cuticles neatly. I had one before that came in a gift set and it broke off from the plastic after a few months of use. This one is just great. The plastic is sturdy and the grip on it is great.</li>
            <li> Cuticle ripper is more like it. Not very easy to use without cutting/ripping an area. Throwing away today. Skip this one folks.</li>
            <li> This is very cheap, you shouldn&#x27;t get this overpriced item when you can get it at ulta for $3. It may just me mine but in the rubber pusher it had a rip and air bubble in it. The cutter is dull and get even more dull over time.</li>
            <li> The cuticle pusher end is nice and firm, but soft, if that makes sense. But, the trimmer end is useless! I don&#x27;t cut off my cuticles completely, but I will trim them down after pushing if there are edges that look like they might get caught on things. This &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; skids along the top of the cuticle and does literally nothing. If it were sharper, it&#x27;d be great, but I can&#x27;t recommend as is.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the rubber cuticle pusher, not the trimmer, so I wasn&#x27;t concerned about other reviews that said the trimmer wasn&#x27;t sharp.  I use it to apply my Jamberry nail wraps and it works perfectly.  A very comfortably handle and nice rubber tip that pushes cuticles firmly but gently.  Is also works exactly as I wanted for burnishing down my wraps.  Actually, the trimmer is pretty good, for the price, too. I use it for trimming those tiny edges sticking up after they&#x27;ve been coated with cuticle remover and pushed back.  This is not the tool for large cuticles or hanging/torn cuticles.  A good sharp pair of cuticle nippers is required for that.  I&#x27;m very please with these, and will continue to purchase more as needed.</li>
            <li> These types of tools are great, but this one isn&#x27;t sharp.  It snags the cuticle, creating ragged edges.  Surprised at Sally Hansen.  TRIM makes a much better product, especially the one with the easy hold rubber grip.</li>
            <li> This couldn&#x27;t cut through anything. Completely dull, poorly made and useless. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This is too sharp and ends up cutting my nails as well as my cuticles, creating lines that have to grow out.</li>
