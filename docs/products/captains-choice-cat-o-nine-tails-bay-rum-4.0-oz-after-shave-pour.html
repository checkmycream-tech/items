            <li>/&gt;After a great shave with</li>
            <li>/&gt;Afterwards, this product does a great job of what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>If any of you want it then I will happily sent it to you.  </li>
            <li>This one is great.</li>

            <li>Great warming sensation on the skin, and an emphasis on the spice notes of the bay.</li>
            <li>Has a great smell.</li>
            <li>Completely happy with the product and will try others by this company.</li>
            <li>Captain&#x27;s Choice aftershave is truly an amazing product and the best I&#x27;ve used in quite a while.</li>
            <li>A great Fathers day gift from my daughter.</li>
            <li>I thinks it is a great product meant for men and not boys.</li>
            <li>Great job Captain.</li>
            <li>Cat O&#x27;Nine Tails does contain some great conditioners for your skin.  </li>
            <li>Nine Tails holds its own with the best of &#x27;em!</li>
            <li>Great scent, will purchase again.</li>
            <li>I get no cloves and just a very nice warming sensation after using this.</li>
            <li>Very nice product.</li>
            <li>Feels great on the face and plenty of pleasant aroma.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing!</li>
            <li>And today I had a nick-free shave and this stuff still provided a really pleasant kick in the face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great aftershave, if you like a nice tingle this is the stuff.</li>
            <li>The ingredients listed are good, but the fragrance leaves a lot to be desired.  </li>
            <li>The feel on the face is good</li>
            <li>and it does a good job as an aftershave from a septic perspective.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as good as i had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m good with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is so good.  </li>
            <li>Heard good things from others though</li>
            <li>but in a good way.</li>
            <li>It has a good bay rum smell.</li>
            <li>I feel that Captain&#x27;s Choice bay rum is the real, authentic thing, but this stuff is even better!</li>
            <li>An awesome bay rum that isn&#x27;t a sweet, powdery, or clove infused type of aftershave.</li>
            <li>Very sexy.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and it conditioned my gorgeous face really nicely.  </li>
            <li>That being said, it&#x27;s a great aftershave with a very unique scent.</li>
            <li>Love the burn!</li>
            <li>has a crisp burn going on - feels wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I like just a tab more!</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells!  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice variation.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my go-to aftershave during the winter months, or whenever I want to make sure I still smell good into the evening.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, if I could bathe in this stuff I probably would.</li>
            <li>Nothing really stands out but the resulting combination is just exquisite.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice warming sensation which lasts but a moment.</li>
            <li>After Shave Pour]] is aptly named.</li>
            <li>Both nice</li>
            <li>From cheapos and classics to small-batch boutique aftershaves, and my own homemade recipes.</li>
            <li>After using each one, I can honestly say that I smelled like a medicine cabinet after wearing Captain&#x27;s Choice.  </li>
            <li>It will leave your face feeling nice and toned and will get rid of any irritation that you may have.</li>
            <li>This one smells quite nice.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very strong odor.</li>
            <li>This version is stronger the the original Captain&#x27;s Choice Bay Rum and has a bit more staying power for those that want the great scent to linger.</li>
            <li>Some old bald guy who looked like he knew what he was talking about made a video on youtube in which he praised this as one of the best after shaves.</li>
            <li>Nice spicy bay rum and clove scent leaves you smelling like a sexy Easter ham.</li>
            <li>By far the best feeling I have gotten out of an aftershave</li>
            <li>I love bay rum after shave - I own and use a variety of them including some hard-to-find vintage concoctions.</li>
            <li>The warming feeling starts off low but builds up to a wonderful crescendo then tapers off nicely.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great aftershave that has staying power and a great scent look no further.</li>
            <li>but I was expecting more of a Bay Rum and as another reviewer stated, it instead has a very strong clove smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great aftershave if you can handle the first couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>If you are the type that wants his aftershave to tingle and warm his freshly shaved face, this is the very best.  </li>
            <li>Great product, gives a really nice burst of heat without \\&quot;burning\\&quot;, and makes your skin feel smooth and fresh for hours.  </li>
            <li>Seller shipped quick and price was fair.</li>
            <li>Probably most important, and something that I should have mentioned first, is that this is a very good quality aftershave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But even better than the alcohol kick is the scent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;And even better than the scent is the ingredients list.  </li>
            <li>more.  </li>
            <li>love it and will always have a bottle available!</li>
            <li>Love the burn and the long-lasting scent.</li>
            <li>Of all the bay rums I currently have, this is the best.  </li>
            <li>, this one is the one I reach for most.  </li>
            <li>love this.</li>
            <li>It has a burn to it on most people</li>
            <li>I will not use this product, others are better.</li>
            <li>Once it settles on the skin, it becomes interesting.</li>
            <li>Many reviews talk about a burning and cloves.</li>
            <li>Clubman is a better choice.</li>
            <li>I love Captains Choice</li>
            <li>and I love Cat&#x27;O Nine Tails but Cat&#x27;O Nine Tails</li>
            <li>Love them both.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a warming sensation.</li>
            <li>This is still a great aftershave with a nice masculine scent.</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>This is my favorite aftershave...</li>
            <li>Love this aftershave.</li>
            <li>I love the sting.</li>
            <li>this is still my favorite.  </li>
            <li>My Husband says, \\&quot;Feel the burn!\\&quot; &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Glad it did.</li>
            <li>Not to be disrespectful to those of you who love this stuff, but this is just my two cents.</li>
            <li>That being said, I gave it a try after a safety razor shave and the feeling on my skin was fantastic!</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for an aftershave with more of an emphasis on a cologne type fragrance, and clove is not your thing, you might want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m handsome and the babes love me.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>subsides, my face feels absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>Hubby love it.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for something a bit more Spicy for a Bay Rum.</li>
            <li>favorite part of this product is the condition in which it leaves your skin.  </li>
            <li>Love the burn.</li>
            <li>It just has a tad more alocohol than I prefer in a splash.  </li>
            <li>This aftershave is rather pungent but the smell is nice and not disgusting while still very powerful.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, the feeling is a great wake up juice, and it is high quality like the rest of captains choice.</li>
            <li>This has a nice full Bay Rum scent and will surely catch your breath with</li>
            <li>They should call it &amp;#34;Lots O&#x27; Clove.&amp;#34;  My wife wasn&#x27;t thrilled about it, and quite honestly, neither was I at first.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it does burn, and burn long like the best of them do.  </li>
            <li>I love cloves, and this aftershave is strongly scented with it.  </li>
            <li>nice scent - bit of bite when applied to a freshly shaved face - but not horrible.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something different and this filled the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I recently tried all 3 Captain&#x27;s Choice Bay Rum after shave scents and each one is unique and WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li>first off, Cat&#x27;O&#x27;Nine is a great name for this product, being a fun take on the alcohol bite that this stuff provides after your shave.  </li>
            <li>smells great and makes my face soft .</li>
            <li>Cat o&#x27;Nine Tails doesn&#x27;t have the eye-watering, finger-numbing freeze of Osage Rub, mind you, but it offers a great stinging post-shave... burn.</li>
            <li>It really restored my face after a shave and made me feel good for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smell</li>
            <li>But other than the after shave is excellent which I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li>I love the unique scent that reminds me of being a kid in the barbershop.</li>
            <li>Ha sa strong licorice type smell to it.</li>
            <li>I did not think that there was a strong burn when it was applied after a shave.</li>
            <li>I thought it smelled like strong cloves on a holiday ham x1000.  </li>
            <li>This is a bit strong for my liking perhaps you may like it</li>
            <li>Pinaud Clubman Special Reserve is what I&#x27;m using now, and it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li>It has a strong cinnamon, clove and bay scent at first, but fades nicely over the day.  </li>
            <li>You will know you are in the presence of greatness when you use this fine aftershave.  </li>
            <li>After the burn (it&#x27;s definitely more of a long-lasting burn than a quick sting)</li>
            <li>From the very first splash it has become my favorite after shave.  </li>
            <li>With West Coast Shavings wonderful selection, I have easily found several favorites that are on the top of my list, Taylor of Old Bond Street, Edwin Jagger and the \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; Penaud Clubman to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little more cinnamon in the scent than most bay rums, but it smells great without making you smell like a gingerbread man.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>After a good shave and an application of the Cat, your face feels smooth, soft, conditioned.  </li>
            <li>Nine Tails smells fantastic, and lasts all day without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It does leave my face smooth</li>
            <li>I wish it were stronger and could be used as a light cologne</li>
            <li>I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Col. Conks Bay-rum soap (Also available at WCS)</li>
            <li>Wow, what a great burn which slowly dissipates into a wonderful warming sensation.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy them both</li>
            <li>Amazon has this one and the Bay Rum aftershave both available.</li>
            <li>but I needed to pay shipping rather than use the free Prime shipping.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic smelling stuff.</li>
            <li>The pain is well worth it though, rewarding those who can take their lashes with a pleasing and earthy rum scent which lingers all day at a level I find &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you like a smooth, conditioned feel, without the oily, sticky result, but still like to \\&quot;feel\\&quot; it</li>
            <li>Great smell, and some extra burn to go with it.  </li>
            <li>and it really left my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>I still use it and enjoy it though.</li>
            <li>I really do enjoy splashing this on after a shave.</li>
            <li>Ha enjoy it and Feel the Burn guys</li>
            <li>There is a great warming sensation, almost a \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; tingle that grows for several moments after application.  </li>
            <li>more I use this the more I&#x27;m really liking the smell.</li>
            <li>Easily my favorite AS right now.</li>
            <li>Classy packaging, good value and totally unique.</li>
            <li>The burn is more intense than most, but it&#x27;s not painful, and that burn pulls out all of the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>was looking for a nice Bay Rum scent and stumbled upon this based on the high reviews.</li>
            <li>It does burn when first applied to a shaved face, but the burn is more of a warming sensation than an alcohol sting.  </li>
            <li>C.O. Bigelow No.032 Bay Rum Original Formulary Cologne</li>
            <li>and she said the scent was familiar.  </li>
            <li>The bay rum scent seems to be a touch \\&quot;spicier\\&quot; than the Captain&#x27;s Choice original bay rum aftershave.</li>
            <li>I prefer the scent of this over the original Bay Rum.</li>
            <li>A spicy unique scent.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time; Exactly as described; Pleased with product, but not quite what I was expecting ...</li>
            <li>I am a fan of the Captain&#x27;s, have been since I tried his original.  </li>
            <li>I should be able to leave the bottle open on the counter as a nice air freshener.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good after shave to tighten up your skins and heal the little unseen nick&#x27;s that don&#x27;t bleed.</li>
            <li>However, once cooled down, the spice(cloves?) wear off and it mixes well with my chemistry and leaves a pleasant scent, which is better than by itself.</li>
            <li>Maybe their other scents are better, but this one just didn&#x27;t smell good to me at all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a good, tingly aftershave.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a great burning sensation to wrap up a wet shave.</li>
            <li>I poured a lavish amount of the venom into my palm, figuring if I was going to do it, I might as well let&#x27;r rip and get the full sadomasochistic effect.  </li>
            <li>is the incredibly sweet scent of bay rum.</li>
            <li>give it 4 stars for doing everything it needs to really well but not the fifth as I still would not consider it a top tier</li>
            <li>Overall a good after shave with a spicy fragrance that lasts through lunchtime.</li>
            <li>Is a good replacement for Royall Bay Rum and St. Johns Bay Rum, which have tended to disappoint in recent years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent has grown on me the more that I use it, and my girlfriend really likes it too.</li>
            <li>but while it&#x27;s not bad, I just don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li>Feels great on my skin but a little strong on the clove scent for my taste.</li>
            <li>The right amount will give a good burn while too much will really sting.</li>
            <li>However, it dries down very well and transforms into a warm and pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>this stuff, finding the right quantity for your face is really important.</li>
            <li>It quickly subsides to a soothing, warm feeling which is awesome when the weather turns cold (like now).  </li>
            <li>According to AMAZON.COM&#x27;S own policy,  Captain&#x27;s Choice is considered a Hazardous Waste.</li>
            <li>And the after shave is rather mild.</li>
            <li>The scent is very much like the original Bay Rum aftershave, but adds some warmth.</li>
            <li>has a strong scent going on: bay, cloves, ..... very manly.  </li>
            <li>This is a strong aftershave, really clove-ish.  </li>
            <li>The scent of this aftershave is pretty unique.</li>
            <li>Pricey and Spicy, like my first Brazilian  girlfriend, Margharita!  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is strong at first, but very quickly calms down to a warm bay rum scent.  </li>
            <li>When it arrived in the mail I was like a little kid on Christmas, I opened the box (seller did a great job on packaging) pulled out this bottle, opened it, and too a sniff.</li>
            <li>It goes on with a nice tingle, strong but not uncomfortable, and leaves your face soothed, not oily nor dry.  </li>
            <li>calm.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing and comfortable finish.</li>
            <li>but I wanted something with a really good burn and this was not it, especially with &amp;#34;Feel the Burn&amp;#34; on the label I expected a really nice wake me up burn</li>
            <li>However I did let several house guest smell this product and not one person liked it at all.  </li>
            <li>make it all worth it.</li>
            <li>Cat o Nine has just enough BURN \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; to let you know its there, with a warm aroma that will stay with you throughout your day.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this aftershave so far.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a Bay Rum with powerful aromatics....</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and since using it my face feels as soft as it did when I was a pre-teen.</li>
            <li>You can try 100 different Bay Rum aftershaves, but Cat O Nine Tails provides a unique burn and a memorable feeling on the face.  </li>
            <li>Younger females more used to the over the top boy scents may not appreciate a classic scent.</li>
            <li>There other products may be more appealing like the lime aftershave.</li>
            <li>If you like the original Captains Choice, then you&#x27;re in for an even bigger and better treat with Cat o Nine Tails...</li>
            <li>It really is a top-notch scent and seems to be longer lasting than other Bay Rum aftershaves I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>but it wears off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Strong burn, but a very nice and long lasting tropical aroma with cloves and other good spices.  </li>
            <li>Not as good of a burn as other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li>Wakes me right up in the morning.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of moisturizing and healing ingredients.</li>
            <li>Even more importantly I didn&#x27;t get a single razor bump or</li>
            <li>I liked the smell stays with you for a long time for hours if you wash your hands and pat</li>
            <li>The products from Captain&#x27;s Choice are top notch and high quality, I would highly recommend Cat o Nine as a staple in anyone&#x27;s shave arsenal.</li>
            <li>The scent disperses reasonably quickly allowing you to apply a cologne by the time you are dressed and ready to head</li>
            <li>The Cat O&#x27;Nine Tails is a fantastic scent, rich and invigorating at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I bought the aftershave after reading the reviews, wish I could have smelled it first, all I can smell is clove.</li>
            <li>And I just came around again and tried this one for the first time in a while and holey moley...</li>
            <li>but its actually quite refreshing in the end.</li>
            <li>Some say that it is too hot but that may be because of the alcohol that is in it and the face of the unseen nick&#x27;s .</li>
            <li>the one you couldn&#x27;t stand at first,</li>
            <li>the one you couldn&#x27;t stand at first,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get that stinging alcohol burn but rather like a hot towel on the face with spices.</li>
            <li>an aside: the white tab in the top of the cap used to create a seal on the bottle falls out all the time.</li>
            <li>Choice fragrances and this is my first choice...</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Love the burn after shaving with my double edge razor.</li>
            <li>Really like this stuff!</li>
            <li>In fact, my daughter could smell it when I first opened the box</li>
            <li>When I put it on, my wife said I smelled like a hot buttered rum.  </li>
            <li>hot stuff does what it said it can do</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I never noticed any improvement on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Soothes irritation, tones the skin, and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The initial sting is pretty refreshing, in my opinion, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mission accomplished - bring it on!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not someone who uses an alcohol-based aftershave in the first place.</li>
            <li>It burned like a mother for about the first three minutes</li>
            <li>Dry at first, but my skin really worked into a nice feel.  </li>
            <li>this Cat&#x27;O&#x27;Nine wants to love your face with witch hazel and glycerin and an utter lack of unpronounceable chemical compounds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely a more mature old time scent.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I didn&#x27;t like the scent at first, which I would describe as being very earthy, damp, and pungent.</li>
            <li>The after effects of the burn are a slight euphoric effect that&#x27;s really nice just getting up in the morning but also a bit calming at a time of day you need some energy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the overall packaging was good received on time but the product itself wasn&#x27;t what i thought it would be as it is a little to sweet for me.</li>
            <li>I am a bay rum ran, and I really wanted to like this, having read all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I have to say I was kind of disappointed in the smell when it arrived as I was really looking forward to it with all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Any true fan of bay rum will immediately love this deep, romantic, intoxicating take on bay rum.  </li>
            <li>I really love the way I smell about 10 minutes after application, and lucky for me that scent lasts a few hours.  </li>
            <li>Pretty decent aftershave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bay rum with an intense depth to it.  </li>
            <li>It really is.  </li>
            <li>Too much overpowering clove scent.</li>
            <li>Bay Rum, Ogallala and their varieties, and even Captain&#x27;s Choice straight bay rum</li>
            <li>very manly scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is really overpowering and reeks of cloves.</li>
            <li>Myself , I don&#x27;t get that much burn out of it , maybe because I have used after shave lotion&#x27;s all my life with alcohol in them</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
            <li>much smother and sweeter.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how I learned I was using too much</li>
            <li>/&gt;Funny though; this aftershave doesn&#x27;t have much burn, despite the name.  </li>
            <li>I  don&#x27;t  buy aftershave much.</li>
            <li>Burns like the fire of hades but its very soothing afterwards</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really mind the smell</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really explain it</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.  </li>
            <li>And I really did want to like it.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this stuff feels on my face after shaving.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use it that much.</li>
            <li>It had a very earthy tone, like mushrooms.  </li>
            <li>I am someone who feels that you need the burn to know it works and this stuff really gives you the burn.</li>
            <li>I really have no complaints with this product.  </li>
            <li>In a few seconds it fades but leaves a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a classic Bay Rum with a bit of extra kick that I find myself reaching for more often than not!</li>
            <li>I had more with other aftershaves.</li>
            <li>It is kinda like a sweeter and definitely spicier version of the original.</li>
            <li>The aftershave gives off quite a burn, more than any other aftershave I can think of.</li>
            <li>, maybe the bay leave smell is a bit overwhelming compared to the other adjuncts.</li>
            <li>More than any other alcohol-based aftershave I&#x27;ve encountered.</li>
            <li>What makes it really special to me is that I can&#x27;t really pick apart the different elements of the scent.  </li>
            <li>I was quite disappointed in this Bay Rum after reading some many great things about it.  </li>
            <li>I really like the initial burn--it is quite intense, but fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>This will for certain be a part of my normal shave routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was completely caught off guard when I first tried this product.</li>
            <li>and I can sense a little bit of a floral note, but truly, the whole is greater than the sum of it</li>
            <li>but I prefer the classic smell of Bay Rum.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, aside from that poor first impression, I have come to love this aftershave!  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and a little goes along ways.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting something with a little more bite.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, but be warned, it is not for the faint of heart.  </li>
            <li>the  scent  seems to be Ok with heavy clove tones as others have noted.</li>
            <li>I normally use a sandlewood aftershave lotion.</li>
            <li>a newbie to the wet shaving arena, I have been experimenting with as many soaps, creams, aftershaves and colognes as I possibly can.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really sting that much although there IS a delayed sting after about ten seconds.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using The Captain&#x27;s bay rum for a little over a year and really like it, but it did lack the \\&quot;burn\\&quot; that many associate with traditional bay rums.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>Now, while the burn is strong and long-lasting (relatively), it should not be too much for someone who enjoys any other alcohol-based aftershaves.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>My current stock: Polo Blue - Cool Wave (Gillette) - Clubman Bay Rum - Proraso - Clubman Pinaud and Cat O&#x27;Nine Tails.</li>
            <li>It did have a great smack of ice cold astringent but that positive is not enough to overcome the pungent oder.  </li>
            <li>stuff has a strong, out of the bottle initial sent which quickly fades to a subtle masculine spicy fragrance.  </li>

            <li>Actually, it heats things up a bit, then just when you&#x27;re ready to scream...</li>
            <li>20 inch glass tube color television set watching MTV-VJ Nina Blackwood introducing the premier video of the then young John Cougar Melloncamp</li>
            <li>Upon opening my eyes and looking in the mirror, I was pleasantly surprised to see my skin hadn&#x27;t melted off into the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;MMpleasantly surprised to see my skin hadn&#x27;t melted off into the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was expecting something similar to Bay Rum based on reviews, but the smell is very clove, cedar, bay like tones (woodsy clove could describe it)</li>
            <li>This line of Bay Rum aftershaves has by far the nicest, cleanest scent I have tried (and I have tried several).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went on the Captains Choice wed site and ordered it directly from him (the owner/ manufacturer).</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, my skin feels soft and well-conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But wow what in the world I cant even describe the scent</li>
            <li>but it gets more complex than just the clove smell.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into heavy, earthy scents like sandalwood, patchouli, or nag champa, you might really enjoy this.</li>
            <li>It really does have a stronger &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; than the regular, but I think the fragrance is more complex too - deeper somehow.</li>
            <li>even after my first shave with a straight razor(many cuts) it was just a slight stinging sensation.</li>
            <li>Make sure you shake the bottle before putting it on to get the full effect it does have a very warming feature but not in a bad way the will go away after about 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>The orange spice is really powerful compared to other bay rum products I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s not off-putting at all.</li>
            <li>this bottle will last me a long while, making it worth the price.</li>
            <li>but then once you had a chance to experience the heat, you just couldn&#x27;t get enough of, and can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li>but then once you had a chance to experience the heat, you just couldn&#x27;t get enough of, and can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li>The least favorite of the group is Polo Blue - The next to least is Clubman Bay Rum - The others are all equal they all give a little sting and make my face feel good, skin soft.</li>
            <li>Now, you must understand that I&#x27;m a little bit more discerning than the average cat.  </li>
            <li>, then you are old enough to apply this after shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works especially well when paired with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Soap.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re concerned about too much sting, I proffer two suggestions: 1) get the regular bay rum, or 2) move to a wholly different facial product so as not to hurt yourself, sissy boy.  </li>
            <li>I barely feel the need to moisturize after a shave.</li>
            <li>Alas, I have razor bumps where I never did before with my aftershave balm, and my skin feels more sensitive when shaving the next day after using this product.  </li>
            <li>My face has finally calmed down after feeling as if I took some habanero pepper juice and rubbed it all over my freshly shave kisser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really like to try some of the Captain&#x27;s other offerings.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too much in the burn department, but it&#x27;s ramped up from any other aftershave I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin and live in a desert, so I should have guessed that the alcohol-based formula might cause problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first got the bottle, I splashed a little on, having not shaved in a couple of days.</li>
            <li>A couple dashes in the hands after a straight shave will leave you sharply inhaling from the burn, this stuff definitely lives up to its name.</li>
            <li>it is hard to say how good the product is due to the evaporation of about a forth of it the rest i repackaged and added to another brand so as not to waste it, the mix works well but who can tell how this was by itself.</li>
            <li>its a little to much clove scent at first but mellows out after a few hours.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like too much burn use a little glycerin, that will help.</li>
            <li>Feels good not as bad as I thought it was going to be</li>

            <li> Very nice product.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the face and plenty of pleasant aroma.  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> And today I had a nick-free shave and this stuff still provided a really pleasant kick in the face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great aftershave, if you like a nice tingle this is the stuff.</li>
            <li> The ingredients listed are good, but the fragrance leaves a lot to be desired.  </li>
            <li> The feel on the face is good</li>
            <li> and it does a good job as an aftershave from a septic perspective.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as good as i had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m good with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is so good.  </li>
            <li> Heard good things from others though</li>
            <li> but in a good way.</li>
            <li> It has a good bay rum smell.</li>
            <li> I feel that Captain&#x27;s Choice bay rum is the real, authentic thing, but this stuff is even better!</li>
            <li> An awesome bay rum that isn&#x27;t a sweet, powdery, or clove infused type of aftershave.</li>
            <li> Very sexy.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and it conditioned my gorgeous face really nicely.  </li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s a great aftershave with a very unique scent.</li>
            <li> Love the burn!</li>
            <li> has a crisp burn going on - feels wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I like just a tab more!</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells!  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice variation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go-to aftershave during the winter months, or whenever I want to make sure I still smell good into the evening.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, if I could bathe in this stuff I probably would.</li>
            <li> Nothing really stands out but the resulting combination is just exquisite.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice warming sensation which lasts but a moment.</li>
            <li> After Shave Pour]] is aptly named.</li>
            <li> Both nice</li>
            <li> From cheapos and classics to small-batch boutique aftershaves, and my own homemade recipes.</li>
            <li> After using each one, I can honestly say that I smelled like a medicine cabinet after wearing Captain&#x27;s Choice.  </li>
            <li> It will leave your face feeling nice and toned and will get rid of any irritation that you may have.</li>
            <li> This one smells quite nice.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very strong odor.</li>
            <li> This version is stronger the the original Captain&#x27;s Choice Bay Rum and has a bit more staying power for those that want the great scent to linger.</li>
            <li> Some old bald guy who looked like he knew what he was talking about made a video on youtube in which he praised this as one of the best after shaves.</li>
            <li> Nice spicy bay rum and clove scent leaves you smelling like a sexy Easter ham.</li>
            <li> By far the best feeling I have gotten out of an aftershave</li>
            <li> I love bay rum after shave - I own and use a variety of them including some hard-to-find vintage concoctions.</li>
            <li> The warming feeling starts off low but builds up to a wonderful crescendo then tapers off nicely.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great aftershave that has staying power and a great scent look no further.</li>
            <li> but I was expecting more of a Bay Rum and as another reviewer stated, it instead has a very strong clove smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great aftershave if you can handle the first couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> If you are the type that wants his aftershave to tingle and warm his freshly shaved face, this is the very best.  </li>
            <li> Great product, gives a really nice burst of heat without \\&quot;burning\\&quot;, and makes your skin feel smooth and fresh for hours.  </li>
            <li> Seller shipped quick and price was fair.</li>
            <li> Probably most important, and something that I should have mentioned first, is that this is a very good quality aftershave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But even better than the alcohol kick is the scent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;And even better than the scent is the ingredients list.  </li>
            <li> more.  </li>
            <li> love it and will always have a bottle available!</li>
            <li> Love the burn and the long-lasting scent.</li>
            <li> Of all the bay rums I currently have, this is the best.  </li>
            <li> , this one is the one I reach for most.  </li>
            <li> love this.</li>
            <li> It has a burn to it on most people</li>
            <li> I will not use this product, others are better.</li>
            <li> Once it settles on the skin, it becomes interesting.</li>
            <li> Many reviews talk about a burning and cloves.</li>
            <li> Clubman is a better choice.</li>
            <li> I love Captains Choice</li>
            <li> and I love Cat&#x27;O Nine Tails but Cat&#x27;O Nine Tails</li>
            <li> Love them both.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a warming sensation.</li>
            <li> This is still a great aftershave with a nice masculine scent.</li>
            <li> OK</li>
            <li> This is my favorite aftershave...</li>
            <li> Love this aftershave.</li>
            <li> I love the sting.</li>
            <li> this is still my favorite.  </li>
            <li> My Husband says, \\&quot;Feel the burn!\\&quot; &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Glad it did.</li>
            <li> Not to be disrespectful to those of you who love this stuff, but this is just my two cents.</li>
            <li> That being said, I gave it a try after a safety razor shave and the feeling on my skin was fantastic!</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re looking for an aftershave with more of an emphasis on a cologne type fragrance, and clove is not your thing, you might want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m handsome and the babes love me.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> subsides, my face feels absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> Hubby love it.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for something a bit more Spicy for a Bay Rum.</li>
            <li> favorite part of this product is the condition in which it leaves your skin.  </li>
            <li> Love the burn.</li>
            <li> It just has a tad more alocohol than I prefer in a splash.  </li>
            <li> This aftershave is rather pungent but the smell is nice and not disgusting while still very powerful.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, the feeling is a great wake up juice, and it is high quality like the rest of captains choice.</li>
            <li> This has a nice full Bay Rum scent and will surely catch your breath with</li>
            <li> They should call it &amp;#34;Lots O&#x27; Clove.&amp;#34;  My wife wasn&#x27;t thrilled about it, and quite honestly, neither was I at first.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it does burn, and burn long like the best of them do.  </li>
            <li> I love cloves, and this aftershave is strongly scented with it.  </li>
            <li> nice scent - bit of bite when applied to a freshly shaved face - but not horrible.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something different and this filled the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I recently tried all 3 Captain&#x27;s Choice Bay Rum after shave scents and each one is unique and WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li> first off, Cat&#x27;O&#x27;Nine is a great name for this product, being a fun take on the alcohol bite that this stuff provides after your shave.  </li>
            <li> smells great and makes my face soft .</li>
            <li> Cat o&#x27;Nine Tails doesn&#x27;t have the eye-watering, finger-numbing freeze of Osage Rub, mind you, but it offers a great stinging post-shave... burn.</li>
            <li> It really restored my face after a shave and made me feel good for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smell</li>
            <li> But other than the after shave is excellent which I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I love the unique scent that reminds me of being a kid in the barbershop.</li>
            <li> Ha sa strong licorice type smell to it.</li>
            <li> I did not think that there was a strong burn when it was applied after a shave.</li>
            <li> I thought it smelled like strong cloves on a holiday ham x1000.  </li>
            <li> This is a bit strong for my liking perhaps you may like it</li>
            <li> Pinaud Clubman Special Reserve is what I&#x27;m using now, and it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li> It has a strong cinnamon, clove and bay scent at first, but fades nicely over the day.  </li>
            <li> You will know you are in the presence of greatness when you use this fine aftershave.  </li>
            <li> After the burn (it&#x27;s definitely more of a long-lasting burn than a quick sting)</li>
            <li> From the very first splash it has become my favorite after shave.  </li>
            <li> With West Coast Shavings wonderful selection, I have easily found several favorites that are on the top of my list, Taylor of Old Bond Street, Edwin Jagger and the \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; Penaud Clubman to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little more cinnamon in the scent than most bay rums, but it smells great without making you smell like a gingerbread man.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> After a good shave and an application of the Cat, your face feels smooth, soft, conditioned.  </li>
            <li> Nine Tails smells fantastic, and lasts all day without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> It does leave my face smooth</li>
            <li> I wish it were stronger and could be used as a light cologne</li>
            <li> I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Col. Conks Bay-rum soap (Also available at WCS)</li>
            <li> Wow, what a great burn which slowly dissipates into a wonderful warming sensation.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy them both</li>
            <li> Amazon has this one and the Bay Rum aftershave both available.</li>
            <li> but I needed to pay shipping rather than use the free Prime shipping.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic smelling stuff.</li>
            <li> The pain is well worth it though, rewarding those who can take their lashes with a pleasing and earthy rum scent which lingers all day at a level I find &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you like a smooth, conditioned feel, without the oily, sticky result, but still like to \\&quot;feel\\&quot; it</li>
            <li> Great smell, and some extra burn to go with it.  </li>
            <li> and it really left my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> I still use it and enjoy it though.</li>
            <li> I really do enjoy splashing this on after a shave.</li>
            <li> Ha enjoy it and Feel the Burn guys</li>
            <li> There is a great warming sensation, almost a \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; tingle that grows for several moments after application.  </li>
            <li> more I use this the more I&#x27;m really liking the smell.</li>
            <li> Easily my favorite AS right now.</li>
            <li> Classy packaging, good value and totally unique.</li>
            <li> The burn is more intense than most, but it&#x27;s not painful, and that burn pulls out all of the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was looking for a nice Bay Rum scent and stumbled upon this based on the high reviews.</li>
            <li> It does burn when first applied to a shaved face, but the burn is more of a warming sensation than an alcohol sting.  </li>
            <li> C.O. Bigelow No.032 Bay Rum Original Formulary Cologne</li>
            <li> and she said the scent was familiar.  </li>
            <li> The bay rum scent seems to be a touch \\&quot;spicier\\&quot; than the Captain&#x27;s Choice original bay rum aftershave.</li>
            <li> I prefer the scent of this over the original Bay Rum.</li>
            <li> A spicy unique scent.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time; Exactly as described; Pleased with product, but not quite what I was expecting ...</li>
            <li> I am a fan of the Captain&#x27;s, have been since I tried his original.  </li>
            <li> I should be able to leave the bottle open on the counter as a nice air freshener.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good after shave to tighten up your skins and heal the little unseen nick&#x27;s that don&#x27;t bleed.</li>
            <li> However, once cooled down, the spice(cloves?) wear off and it mixes well with my chemistry and leaves a pleasant scent, which is better than by itself.</li>
            <li> Maybe their other scents are better, but this one just didn&#x27;t smell good to me at all.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a good, tingly aftershave.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a great burning sensation to wrap up a wet shave.</li>
            <li> I poured a lavish amount of the venom into my palm, figuring if I was going to do it, I might as well let&#x27;r rip and get the full sadomasochistic effect.  </li>
            <li> is the incredibly sweet scent of bay rum.</li>
            <li> give it 4 stars for doing everything it needs to really well but not the fifth as I still would not consider it a top tier</li>
            <li> Overall a good after shave with a spicy fragrance that lasts through lunchtime.</li>
            <li> Is a good replacement for Royall Bay Rum and St. Johns Bay Rum, which have tended to disappoint in recent years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent has grown on me the more that I use it, and my girlfriend really likes it too.</li>
            <li> but while it&#x27;s not bad, I just don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin but a little strong on the clove scent for my taste.</li>
            <li> The right amount will give a good burn while too much will really sting.</li>
            <li> However, it dries down very well and transforms into a warm and pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> this stuff, finding the right quantity for your face is really important.</li>
            <li> It quickly subsides to a soothing, warm feeling which is awesome when the weather turns cold (like now).  </li>
            <li> According to AMAZON.COM&#x27;S own policy,  Captain&#x27;s Choice is considered a Hazardous Waste.</li>
            <li> And the after shave is rather mild.</li>
            <li> The scent is very much like the original Bay Rum aftershave, but adds some warmth.</li>
            <li> has a strong scent going on: bay, cloves, ..... very manly.  </li>
            <li> This is a strong aftershave, really clove-ish.  </li>
            <li> The scent of this aftershave is pretty unique.</li>
            <li> Pricey and Spicy, like my first Brazilian  girlfriend, Margharita!  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is strong at first, but very quickly calms down to a warm bay rum scent.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived in the mail I was like a little kid on Christmas, I opened the box (seller did a great job on packaging) pulled out this bottle, opened it, and too a sniff.</li>
            <li> It goes on with a nice tingle, strong but not uncomfortable, and leaves your face soothed, not oily nor dry.  </li>
            <li> calm.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing and comfortable finish.</li>
            <li> but I wanted something with a really good burn and this was not it, especially with &amp;#34;Feel the Burn&amp;#34; on the label I expected a really nice wake me up burn</li>
            <li> However I did let several house guest smell this product and not one person liked it at all.  </li>
            <li> make it all worth it.</li>
            <li> Cat o Nine has just enough BURN \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; to let you know its there, with a warm aroma that will stay with you throughout your day.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this aftershave so far.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a Bay Rum with powerful aromatics....</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and since using it my face feels as soft as it did when I was a pre-teen.</li>
            <li> You can try 100 different Bay Rum aftershaves, but Cat O Nine Tails provides a unique burn and a memorable feeling on the face.  </li>
            <li> Younger females more used to the over the top boy scents may not appreciate a classic scent.</li>
            <li> There other products may be more appealing like the lime aftershave.</li>
            <li> If you like the original Captains Choice, then you&#x27;re in for an even bigger and better treat with Cat o Nine Tails...</li>
            <li> It really is a top-notch scent and seems to be longer lasting than other Bay Rum aftershaves I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> but it wears off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Strong burn, but a very nice and long lasting tropical aroma with cloves and other good spices.  </li>
            <li> Not as good of a burn as other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> Wakes me right up in the morning.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of moisturizing and healing ingredients.</li>
            <li> Even more importantly I didn&#x27;t get a single razor bump or</li>
            <li> I liked the smell stays with you for a long time for hours if you wash your hands and pat</li>
            <li> The products from Captain&#x27;s Choice are top notch and high quality, I would highly recommend Cat o Nine as a staple in anyone&#x27;s shave arsenal.</li>
            <li> The scent disperses reasonably quickly allowing you to apply a cologne by the time you are dressed and ready to head</li>
            <li> The Cat O&#x27;Nine Tails is a fantastic scent, rich and invigorating at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I bought the aftershave after reading the reviews, wish I could have smelled it first, all I can smell is clove.</li>
            <li> And I just came around again and tried this one for the first time in a while and holey moley...</li>
            <li> but its actually quite refreshing in the end.</li>
            <li> Some say that it is too hot but that may be because of the alcohol that is in it and the face of the unseen nick&#x27;s .</li>
            <li> the one you couldn&#x27;t stand at first,</li>
            <li> the one you couldn&#x27;t stand at first,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get that stinging alcohol burn but rather like a hot towel on the face with spices.</li>
            <li> an aside: the white tab in the top of the cap used to create a seal on the bottle falls out all the time.</li>
            <li> Choice fragrances and this is my first choice...</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Love the burn after shaving with my double edge razor.</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff!</li>
            <li> In fact, my daughter could smell it when I first opened the box</li>
            <li> When I put it on, my wife said I smelled like a hot buttered rum.  </li>
            <li> hot stuff does what it said it can do</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I never noticed any improvement on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Soothes irritation, tones the skin, and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The initial sting is pretty refreshing, in my opinion, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mission accomplished - bring it on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not someone who uses an alcohol-based aftershave in the first place.</li>
            <li> It burned like a mother for about the first three minutes</li>
            <li> Dry at first, but my skin really worked into a nice feel.  </li>
            <li> this Cat&#x27;O&#x27;Nine wants to love your face with witch hazel and glycerin and an utter lack of unpronounceable chemical compounds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely a more mature old time scent.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I didn&#x27;t like the scent at first, which I would describe as being very earthy, damp, and pungent.</li>
            <li> The after effects of the burn are a slight euphoric effect that&#x27;s really nice just getting up in the morning but also a bit calming at a time of day you need some energy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the overall packaging was good received on time but the product itself wasn&#x27;t what i thought it would be as it is a little to sweet for me.</li>
            <li> I am a bay rum ran, and I really wanted to like this, having read all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I was kind of disappointed in the smell when it arrived as I was really looking forward to it with all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Any true fan of bay rum will immediately love this deep, romantic, intoxicating take on bay rum.  </li>
            <li> I really love the way I smell about 10 minutes after application, and lucky for me that scent lasts a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Pretty decent aftershave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bay rum with an intense depth to it.  </li>
            <li> It really is.  </li>
            <li> Too much overpowering clove scent.</li>
            <li> Bay Rum, Ogallala and their varieties, and even Captain&#x27;s Choice straight bay rum</li>
            <li> very manly scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is really overpowering and reeks of cloves.</li>
            <li> Myself , I don&#x27;t get that much burn out of it , maybe because I have used after shave lotion&#x27;s all my life with alcohol in them</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
            <li> much smother and sweeter.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how I learned I was using too much</li>
            <li> /&gt;Funny though; this aftershave doesn&#x27;t have much burn, despite the name.  </li>
            <li> I  don&#x27;t  buy aftershave much.</li>
            <li> Burns like the fire of hades but its very soothing afterwards</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really mind the smell</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really explain it</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.  </li>
            <li> And I really did want to like it.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this stuff feels on my face after shaving.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use it that much.</li>
            <li> It had a very earthy tone, like mushrooms.  </li>
            <li> I am someone who feels that you need the burn to know it works and this stuff really gives you the burn.</li>
            <li> I really have no complaints with this product.  </li>
            <li> In a few seconds it fades but leaves a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a classic Bay Rum with a bit of extra kick that I find myself reaching for more often than not!</li>
            <li> I had more with other aftershaves.</li>
            <li> It is kinda like a sweeter and definitely spicier version of the original.</li>
            <li> The aftershave gives off quite a burn, more than any other aftershave I can think of.</li>
            <li> , maybe the bay leave smell is a bit overwhelming compared to the other adjuncts.</li>
            <li> More than any other alcohol-based aftershave I&#x27;ve encountered.</li>
            <li> What makes it really special to me is that I can&#x27;t really pick apart the different elements of the scent.  </li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed in this Bay Rum after reading some many great things about it.  </li>
            <li> I really like the initial burn--it is quite intense, but fades quickly.  </li>
            <li> This will for certain be a part of my normal shave routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was completely caught off guard when I first tried this product.</li>
            <li> and I can sense a little bit of a floral note, but truly, the whole is greater than the sum of it</li>
            <li> but I prefer the classic smell of Bay Rum.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, aside from that poor first impression, I have come to love this aftershave!  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and a little goes along ways.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting something with a little more bite.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but be warned, it is not for the faint of heart.  </li>
            <li> the  scent  seems to be Ok with heavy clove tones as others have noted.</li>
            <li> I normally use a sandlewood aftershave lotion.</li>
            <li> a newbie to the wet shaving arena, I have been experimenting with as many soaps, creams, aftershaves and colognes as I possibly can.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really sting that much although there IS a delayed sting after about ten seconds.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using The Captain&#x27;s bay rum for a little over a year and really like it, but it did lack the \\&quot;burn\\&quot; that many associate with traditional bay rums.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> Now, while the burn is strong and long-lasting (relatively), it should not be too much for someone who enjoys any other alcohol-based aftershaves.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> My current stock: Polo Blue - Cool Wave (Gillette) - Clubman Bay Rum - Proraso - Clubman Pinaud and Cat O&#x27;Nine Tails.</li>
            <li> It did have a great smack of ice cold astringent but that positive is not enough to overcome the pungent oder.  </li>
            <li> stuff has a strong, out of the bottle initial sent which quickly fades to a subtle masculine spicy fragrance.  </li>

            <li> Actually, it heats things up a bit, then just when you&#x27;re ready to scream...</li>
            <li> 20 inch glass tube color television set watching MTV-VJ Nina Blackwood introducing the premier video of the then young John Cougar Melloncamp</li>
            <li> Upon opening my eyes and looking in the mirror, I was pleasantly surprised to see my skin hadn&#x27;t melted off into the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;MMpleasantly surprised to see my skin hadn&#x27;t melted off into the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was expecting something similar to Bay Rum based on reviews, but the smell is very clove, cedar, bay like tones (woodsy clove could describe it)</li>
            <li> This line of Bay Rum aftershaves has by far the nicest, cleanest scent I have tried (and I have tried several).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went on the Captains Choice wed site and ordered it directly from him (the owner/ manufacturer).</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, my skin feels soft and well-conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But wow what in the world I cant even describe the scent</li>
            <li> but it gets more complex than just the clove smell.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into heavy, earthy scents like sandalwood, patchouli, or nag champa, you might really enjoy this.</li>
            <li> It really does have a stronger &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; than the regular, but I think the fragrance is more complex too - deeper somehow.</li>
            <li> even after my first shave with a straight razor(many cuts) it was just a slight stinging sensation.</li>
            <li> Make sure you shake the bottle before putting it on to get the full effect it does have a very warming feature but not in a bad way the will go away after about 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> The orange spice is really powerful compared to other bay rum products I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s not off-putting at all.</li>
            <li> this bottle will last me a long while, making it worth the price.</li>
            <li> but then once you had a chance to experience the heat, you just couldn&#x27;t get enough of, and can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li> but then once you had a chance to experience the heat, you just couldn&#x27;t get enough of, and can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li> The least favorite of the group is Polo Blue - The next to least is Clubman Bay Rum - The others are all equal they all give a little sting and make my face feel good, skin soft.</li>
            <li> Now, you must understand that I&#x27;m a little bit more discerning than the average cat.  </li>
            <li> , then you are old enough to apply this after shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works especially well when paired with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Soap.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re concerned about too much sting, I proffer two suggestions: 1) get the regular bay rum, or 2) move to a wholly different facial product so as not to hurt yourself, sissy boy.  </li>
            <li> I barely feel the need to moisturize after a shave.</li>
            <li> Alas, I have razor bumps where I never did before with my aftershave balm, and my skin feels more sensitive when shaving the next day after using this product.  </li>
            <li> My face has finally calmed down after feeling as if I took some habanero pepper juice and rubbed it all over my freshly shave kisser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really like to try some of the Captain&#x27;s other offerings.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too much in the burn department, but it&#x27;s ramped up from any other aftershave I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and live in a desert, so I should have guessed that the alcohol-based formula might cause problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first got the bottle, I splashed a little on, having not shaved in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> A couple dashes in the hands after a straight shave will leave you sharply inhaling from the burn, this stuff definitely lives up to its name.</li>
            <li> it is hard to say how good the product is due to the evaporation of about a forth of it the rest i repackaged and added to another brand so as not to waste it, the mix works well but who can tell how this was by itself.</li>
            <li> its a little to much clove scent at first but mellows out after a few hours.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like too much burn use a little glycerin, that will help.</li>
            <li> Feels good not as bad as I thought it was going to be</li>
            <li> The only drawback that kept it from a 5 star was that the product aromatics don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I also found the smell faded pretty quickly and is by no means unpleasant.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, I found that the cap was completely off of the bottle, with half the contents gone.  </li>
            <li> However it is a little stronger and maybe even a little more edgy than say something a little less intense like Pinnaud Virgin Island Bay Rum.</li>
            <li> In spite of this, I committed to use Co9T for a week straight before deciding whether or not I liked it.</li>
            <li> Out of the bottle, the smell is strange.</li>
            <li> Not real big on the scent, to me it smells like wet cardboard.</li>
            <li> the scent doesn&#x27;t linger long...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried four or five other Bay Rums, and always come back to CO9T</li>
            <li> It does seem to last longer than any other bay rum I have, but doesn&#x27;t walk into a room before I do like some colognes can do.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to describe in words, but it&#x27;s a unique feeling that satisfies.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re different and one scent will appeal to one and not the other.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s a touch cinnamon blended with other essential oils with citrus?</li>
            <li> you face the smell picks back up my girlfriend on the other hand</li>
            <li> Out of the bottle, the smell is almost unpleasant, as many have said.  </li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m giving a 4 star vs a 5 star : the bottle was in a plastic bag and the cap was loose.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it, I found the smell to be weird and reminiscent of that powdered soap that, once upon a time, was used in men&#x27;s rooms.  </li>
            <li> bottle leaked due to cracked lid other reviewer had same.</li>
            <li> It slaps you in the face then catches you on fire and then has a soothing warmth feeling a little while later.</li>
            <li> The burn isn&#x27;t that bad (and if it is you should learn how to shave better).</li>
            <li> Thankfully we had an an empty bottle on hand.</li>
            <li> After the burn subsides, one is left with a Bay Rum scent, heavily laden with cloves.</li>
            <li> Well, the box came soaking wet and smelling of cardboard and cinnamon.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Not much sting???</li>
            <li> Not the scent I expected.</li>
            <li> I have 10 different aftershaves on my shelf, and this is the one that I reach for everyday.</li>
            <li> Not really anything to take off for just kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> It builds slowly, but clubman virgin island bay rum burns far hotter.</li>
            <li> I have other Cpt.</li>
            <li> It refreshes, it wakes up your sleepy face - the glycerin and other ingredients sooth and heal....</li>
            <li> it is not very strog but the scent ticks around for a few hours.</li>
            <li> the title, \\&quot;It hurts so good\\&quot; resurrects fond memories of sitting down in front of the family</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers have noted, it BURNS!</li>
            <li> For Men 3.4 fl oz (100 ml)]], which is a much less aggressive scent;</li>
            <li> It starts with a slight tingle to the face</li>
            <li> Irritation that would have previously lasted for days is just gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not a sweet or citrusy scent.</li>
            <li> I like the aroma , unfortunately mine came broken , packaged badly , just a bag full , not bottle full ,</li>
            <li> Do you all remember the times you stubbed your little toe on the side of the bedpost?  </li>
            <li> (a little bite as advertised) when you put it on</li>
            <li> Others may differ, but the smell is too harsh for me, lacking smoothness and sophistication.</li>
            <li> After using this  a few times  </li>
            <li> The smell is a bit harsh, not refined.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the harsh alcohol burn that you get with a lot of aftershaves, on the contrary, it is quite enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have read more before ordering cause it is close to pathetic.</li>
            <li> Not sure how that happened, but I was not pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this is labeled bay rum.</li>
            <li> I am not sure who could stand the smell of this</li>
            <li> This is what happens when you blindly order an item that you have not seen physically, such is my case.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it was absolutely awful in performance,since and only smells like pure cinnamon oil.</li>
            <li> not a very good after shave.</li>
            <li> This smells rancid, almost rude, I&#x27;ve tried it time and again</li>
            <li> I guess I am a sucker for pain</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the burn is slow and building.  </li>
            <li> I take my shaving seriously and wanted something a bit spicy, with a bit of kick.  </li>
            <li> this was subtle and unexciting.  </li>
            <li> but I like a serious burning sensation.</li>
            <li> Seriously, upon opening the bottle I thought I was in the lawn care aisle at Lowes.  </li>
            <li> skin, however, is not good with that.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not pleasant for me.  </li>
            <li> Arrived with the cap broken.</li>
            <li> but the bark is worse than the bite.</li>
            <li> Package got broken in transit.</li>
            <li> A word of caution, don&#x27;t splash this on if you already have a shirt on, it seemed to leave a discolored stain behind on one of mine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the bad twin, the one that you just know is trouble.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I was a little disappointed in my purchase.</li>
            <li> They did credit my account within a day and told me to do whatever I wished with the wrong one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting with \\&quot;boutique\\&quot; brands, and it&#x27;s a terrible start.  </li>
            <li> Smelled like cloves and stale baby powder.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it stings</li>
            <li> Needless to say this was not the scent.&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nasty pure nasty</li>
            <li> All in all, Captains Choice Cat-O-Nine Tails is akin to that crazy relationship you have had, you know the one I&#x27;m talking about...</li>

            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with the Captain&#x27;s Choice!</li>
            <li> The bite is not as bad  as others say .</li>
            <li> Beware it does burn after a shave (not too bad but they do call it cat</li>
            <li> but I thought it stunk so bad that I had to wash it off after 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> she&#x27;s one crazy B#@!.  </li>
            <li> she&#x27;s one crazy B#@!.  </li>
            <li> but I myself hate the smell, how will others like it?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a vial used in a chemistry lab, and I really hate losing those things.</li>
            <li> As it is, I don&#x27;t hate it, either.  </li>
            <li> However, the scent is horrible.  </li>
            <li> It cures my worst razor burn in a matter of minutes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the aroma , unfortunately mine came broken , packaged badly , just a bag full , not bottle full ,&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had come in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells like Scott&#x27;s Turfbuilder.</li>
            <li> My husband has always worn Bay Rum.  This is a really nice variation.  Smells real...not like chemicals.</li>
            <li> I bought the aftershave after reading the reviews, wish I could have smelled it first, all I can smell is clove. I will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> Since I started using Captain&#x27;s Choice aftershaves, I haven&#x27;t used anything else.  Nothing compares to the way these great-smelling, all-natural products make my face feel after a shave.  A stronger, warmer, spicier cousin of [[ASIN:B0066GR55K Captain&#x27;s Choice Bay Rum Aftershave 4oz after shave]], Cat o&#x27; Nine Tails smells fantastic, and lasts all day without being overpowering.  It&#x27;s my go-to aftershave during the winter months, or whenever I want to make sure I still smell good into the evening.  Honestly, if I could bathe in this stuff I probably would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried out a lot of bay rums.  A LOT of them.  And I just came around again and tried this one for the first time in a while and holey moley...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok first off, Cat&#x27;O&#x27;Nine is a great name for this product, being a fun take on the alcohol bite that this stuff provides after your shave.  And today I had a nick-free shave and this stuff still provided a really pleasant kick in the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even better than the alcohol kick is the scent.  Any true fan of bay rum will immediately love this deep, romantic, intoxicating take on bay rum.  It&#x27;s a bay rum with an intense depth to it.  What makes it really special to me is that I can&#x27;t really pick apart the different elements of the scent.  Nothing really stands out but the resulting combination is just exquisite.  It really is.  I can sense the citrus and I can sense a little bit of a floral note, but truly, the whole is greater than the sum of it&#x27;s parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even better than the scent is the ingredients list.  The Captain has truly lived up to the K.I.S.S. credo, keeping it relatively simple.  While Cat&#x27;O&#x27;Nine may be an instrument of torture, this Cat&#x27;O&#x27;Nine wants to love your face with witch hazel and glycerin and an utter lack of unpronounceable chemical compounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Captain.  An excellent choice if I may say so myself.</li>
            <li> Great! Splash some on and you&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;ve been smacked by The Hulk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using The Captain&#x27;s bay rum for a little over a year and really like it, but it did lack the \\&quot;burn\\&quot; that many associate with traditional bay rums.&lt;br /&gt;No more.  This stuff is a BLOWTORCH!  A little more cinnamon in the scent than most bay rums, but it smells great without making you smell like a gingerbread man.&lt;br /&gt;And did I mention the burn?  Unless I&#x27;ve got a touch of razor burn, I don&#x27;t get any burn at all from the Captain&#x27;s Choice..  but the Cat o&#x27; Nine Tails lives up to it&#x27;s name!&lt;br /&gt;I love it and will always have a bottle available!</li>
            <li> Great product, gives a really nice burst of heat without \\&quot;burning\\&quot;, and makes your skin feel smooth and fresh for hours.  I&#x27;ve tried four or five other Bay Rums, and always come back to CO9T</li>
            <li> Love the burn and the long-lasting scent. If you&#x27;re looking for the \\&quot;next level\\&quot; bay rum experience, this is the aftershave for you. Classy packaging, good value and totally unique. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Too much overpowering clove scent.</li>
            <li> Not as good of a burn as other reviewers have said. I had more with other aftershaves. Also my wife HATES how this smells, she told me I smell like a bunch of weeds if I use this. It does leave my face smooth but I wanted something with a really good burn and this was not it, especially with &amp;#34;Feel the Burn&amp;#34; on the label I expected a really nice wake me up burn and this seems too mellow. In the future maybe I&#x27;ll try a different scent, Lime perhaps?</li>
            <li> Arrived with the cap broken. Thankfully we had an an empty bottle on hand. The bubble wrapping did keep the fluid contained.</li>
            <li> Of all the bay rums I currently have, this is the best.  While I still like Pinaud&#x27;s Virgin Island Bay Rum, Ogallala and their varieties, and even Captain&#x27;s Choice straight bay rum, this one is the one I reach for most.  It does burn when first applied to a shaved face, but the burn is more of a warming sensation than an alcohol sting.  It quickly subsides to a soothing, warm feeling which is awesome when the weather turns cold (like now).  Witch hazel and glycerin provide healing and moisturizing for your face, and my face feels great all day.  The fragrance is strong at first, but very quickly calms down to a warm bay rum scent.  It does seem to last longer than any other bay rum I have, but doesn&#x27;t walk into a room before I do like some colognes can do.  This is now my go-to after shave for the winter.</li>
            <li> love this. very manly scent.</li>
            <li> Smell is great feels great. Burn is a surprise but hopefully you knew that coming in. Leaves my face feeling great after a shave.</li>
            <li> Great aftershave, if you like a nice tingle this is the stuff. Feels good not as bad as I thought it was going to be</li>
            <li> nice scent - bit of bite when applied to a freshly shaved face - but not horrible.  If you like trying different bay rums - try this one!</li>
            <li> I owned all the captains choice aftershaves and soaps except for this one last aftershave. When it arrived in the mail I was like a little kid on Christmas, I opened the box (seller did a great job on packaging) pulled out this bottle, opened it, and too a sniff. It is kinda like a sweeter and definitely spicier version of the original. I then shaved and applied this to my face...............listen its called Cat O Nine Tails............and it burns a LOT.......but its actually quite refreshing in the end. It slaps you in the face then catches you on fire and then has a soothing warmth feeling a little while later. I love the scent, the feeling is a great wake up juice, and it is high quality like the rest of captains choice.</li>
            <li> Quality product. Aftershave preference is such a subjective thing, but have to recommend this one. It&#x27;s my weekend standard!</li>
            <li> This has a nice full Bay Rum scent and will surely catch your breath with it&#x27;s nice warming sensation which lasts but a moment. This version is stronger the the original Captain&#x27;s Choice Bay Rum and has a bit more staying power for those that want the great scent to linger.</li>
            <li> I recently tried all 3 Captain&#x27;s Choice Bay Rum after shave scents and each one is unique and WONDERFUL. Cat O&#x27; Nine Tails has an excellent Bay Rum scent that one comes to expect from Captain&#x27;s Choice. The scent is very much like the original Bay Rum aftershave, but adds some warmth. Actually, it heats things up a bit, then just when you&#x27;re ready to scream... calm.  It&#x27;s difficult to describe in words, but it&#x27;s a unique feeling that satisfies. You can try 100 different Bay Rum aftershaves, but Cat O Nine Tails provides a unique burn and a memorable feeling on the face.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Love the burn! Feels great and invigorating and gives you feedback on your shave. Smells amazing! I wish it were stronger and could be used as a light cologne but it wears off pretty quickly. This is how Bay Rum scent should smell. I bought Ogallala double strength and it was absolutely awful in performance,since and only smells like pure cinnamon oil. Captains Choice leaves my face feeling great and toned and invigorated. Great great stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but be warned, it is not for the faint of heart.  This stuff burns heavily for about 20 seconds, but works really well as an aftershave.</li>
            <li> Wife says it smells like cloves.  I say it smells like freedom.</li>
            <li> Ha sa strong licorice type smell to it. some people like it, others don&#x27;t. I do not mind it at all,  it is not very strog but the scent ticks around for a few hours. I did not think that there was a strong burn when it was applied after a shave. I enjoy it. seems like this bottle will last me a long while, making it worth the price.</li>
            <li> Strong burn, but a very nice and long lasting tropical aroma with cloves and other good spices.  For this price I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> The scent is really overpowering and reeks of cloves. Not a fan. Pinaud Clubman Special Reserve is what I&#x27;m using now, and it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li> This is a very good after shave to tighten up your skins and heal the little unseen nick&#x27;s that don&#x27;t bleed. It has a burn to it on most people but it goes away after a bit. Some say that it is too hot but that may be because of the alcohol that is in it and the face of the unseen nick&#x27;s . Myself , I don&#x27;t get that much burn out of it , maybe because I have used after shave lotion&#x27;s all my life with alcohol in them so it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much. Anyhow this is a very good lotion and it stay with you a while so I give it an A+. Thank&#x27;s a lot for a great product.</li>
            <li> Gents,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the title, \\&quot;It hurts so good\\&quot; resurrects fond memories of sitting down in front of the family 20 inch glass tube color television set watching MTV-VJ Nina Blackwood introducing the premier video of the then young John Cougar Melloncamp, then you are old enough to apply this after shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a newbie to the wet shaving arena, I have been experimenting with as many soaps, creams, aftershaves and colognes as I possibly can.  With West Coast Shavings wonderful selection, I have easily found several favorites that are on the top of my list, Taylor of Old Bond Street, Edwin Jagger and the \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; Penaud Clubman to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As winter approaches I set out to find a great winter fragrance.  I found countless reviews indicating that a Fall/Winter blend of choice was Bay-Rum. After conducting copious research via the \\&quot;gold star\\&quot; method standard, I saw any of the \\&quot;Captains Choice\\&quot; products were obvious choices.  Out of the three choices offered, Bay-rum, Limes and Cat-O-Nine tails, the whip was my selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a great shave with Col. Conks Bay-rum soap (Also available at WCS) I hesitantly unscrewed the cap of the liquid scorpion.  I poured a lavish amount of the venom into my palm, figuring if I was going to do it, I might as well let&#x27;r rip and get the full sadomasochistic effect.  I vigorously rubbed my hands together and took a deep breath before slapping the lava on my face.  My heart raced and I held my breath as I messaged my skin.  Do you all remember the times you stubbed your little toe on the side of the bedpost?  There seems to be a nanosecond before the pain runs up your neurotransmitter and registers \\&quot;OUCH\\&quot; with your brain...well, that is what happens when you apply the Cat-O-Nine on your face.  One, Two, Thr.....Blow-torch!  Call me a glutton for pain, but I LOVED IT!  Wow, what a great burn which slowly dissipates into a wonderful warming sensation.  Upon opening my eyes and looking in the mirror, I was pleasantly surprised to see my skin hadn&#x27;t melted off into the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has a strong, out of the bottle initial sent which quickly fades to a subtle masculine spicy fragrance.  All in all, Captains Choice Cat-O-Nine Tails is akin to that crazy relationship you have had, you know the one I&#x27;m talking about...the one you couldn&#x27;t stand at first, but then once you had a chance to experience the heat, you just couldn&#x27;t get enough of, and can&#x27;t live without.  Cat-O-Nine Tails...she&#x27;s one crazy B#@!.  ☺&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MMpleasantly surprised to see my skin hadn&#x27;t melted off into the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has a strong, out of the bottle initial sent which quickly fades to a subtle masculine spicy fragrance.

            <li> The smell is not pleasant for me.  I was expecting something similar to Bay Rum based on reviews, but the smell is very clove, cedar, bay like tones (woodsy clove could describe it) once it dries without the rum and vanilla warmth.  Not a smell that I like.  The ingredients listed are good, but the fragrance leaves a lot to be desired.  Others may differ, but the smell is too harsh for me, lacking smoothness and sophistication. The feel on the face is good (a little bite as advertised) when you put it on and it does a good job as an aftershave from a septic perspective. I will not use this product, others are better. Wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> Wow! My face has finally calmed down after feeling as if I took some habanero pepper juice and rubbed it all over my freshly shave kisser. It&#x27;s an intoxicating feeling. [[ASIN:B00A0J4RS2 Captain&#x27;s Choice Cat O&#x27; Nine Tails Bay Rum 4.0 oz After Shave Pour]] is aptly named. After the burn subsides, one is left with a Bay Rum scent, heavily laden with cloves. Completely different from [[ASIN:B001EZ3XU4 Bath &amp; Body Works C.O. Bigelow No.032 Bay Rum Original Formulary Cologne For Men 3.4 fl oz (100 ml)]], which is a much less aggressive scent; much smother and sweeter. They&#x27;re different and one scent will appeal to one and not the other. I enjoy them both and so does my wife. If this product doesn&#x27;t wake you up in the morning, you&#x27;re dead.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something different and this filled the bill perfectly.  From the very first splash it has become my favorite after shave.  I am looking forward to trying the rest of the Captain&#x27;s Choice after shaves.</li>
            <li> The scent of this aftershave is pretty unique. Supposedly there aren&#x27;t any cloves in Cat O&#x27; Nine, but whatever it is, it does remind me of cloves. Perhaps it&#x27;s a touch cinnamon blended with other essential oils with citrus? The aftershave gives off quite a burn, more than any other aftershave I can think of. However, once cooled down, the spice(cloves?) wear off and it mixes well with my chemistry and leaves a pleasant scent, which is better than by itself. Out of the bottle, the smell is strange. Once it settles on the skin, it becomes interesting. I will buy this one again once it runs out.</li>
            <li> Easily my favorite AS right now. Seller shipped quick and price was fair.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin but a little strong on the clove scent for my taste.</li>
            <li> Many reviews talk about a burning and cloves. I get no cloves and just a very nice warming sensation after using this. I don&#x27;t get that stinging alcohol burn but rather like a hot towel on the face with spices. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> After using this  a few times  I find  the  scent  seems to be Ok with heavy clove tones as others have noted. The bite is not as bad  as others say .</li>
            <li> If you like bay rum colognes you will likely like this. However it is a little stronger and maybe even a little more edgy than say something a little less intense like Pinnaud Virgin Island Bay Rum. Beware it does burn after a shave (not too bad but they do call it cat o&#x27; nine tails...). It has a strong cinnamon, clove and bay scent at first, but fades nicely over the day.  My lady likes it but then again my daughter hates it. Definitely a more mature old time scent. Younger females more used to the over the top boy scents may not appreciate a classic scent.</li>
            <li> Captain&#x27;s choice made a solid product. Works great after every shave! Smells good too!</li>
            <li> Some old bald guy who looked like he knew what he was talking about made a video on youtube in which he praised this as one of the best after shaves. Let me tell you one thing, guys. This smells rancid, almost rude, I&#x27;ve tried it time and again but I myself hate the smell, how will others like it? I should have read more before ordering cause it is close to pathetic.</li>
            <li> not a very good after shave. Clubman is a better choice. I personally prefer the Clubman brand of bay rum.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as good as i had hoped it would be. the overall packaging was good received on time but the product itself wasn&#x27;t what i thought it would be as it is a little to sweet for me.</li>
            <li> I love Captains Choice and I love Cat&#x27;O Nine Tails but Cat&#x27;O Nine Tails is not what I got.... I received regular Bay Rum, which I also like but was not what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the Captains Choice after shaves. Amazon has this one and the Bay Rum aftershave both available. Love them both. If you like a burn after shaving give this one (Cat O&#x27; Nine Tails) a try. You will not believe the warmth you feel. It may feel like your face is on fire but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. If you want something a bit tamer, use the Captains Choice Bay Rum. They also make a Lime scented after shave and one called North (smells like a pine forest). Both nice but I prefer the classic smell of Bay Rum. This line of Bay Rum aftershaves has by far the nicest, cleanest scent I have tried (and I have tried several).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the service from Amazon. Great!!! When I ordered the Cat O&#x27; Nine Tails from Amazon (actually a vender) they sent me the Bay Rum rather than the Cat..... Called Amazon and they told me that because the aftershave was &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34; (Alcohol based) they couldn&#x27;t take the midshipmen back. They did credit my account within a day and told me to do whatever I wished with the wrong one. I went on the Captains Choice wed site and ordered it directly from him (the owner/ manufacturer). The cost was the same but I needed to pay shipping rather than use the free Prime shipping.</li>
            <li> I was completely caught off guard when I first tried this product. It felt like my face was on fire. That&#x27;s how I learned I was using too much aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this stuff, finding the right quantity for your face is really important. The right amount will give a good burn while too much will really sting. The after effects of the burn are a slight euphoric effect that&#x27;s really nice just getting up in the morning but also a bit calming at a time of day you need some energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, this product does a great job of what it is supposed to do. It really restored my face after a shave and made me feel good for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smell is the incredibly sweet scent of bay rum. This aftershave is rather pungent but the smell is nice and not disgusting while still very powerful. The scent disperses reasonably quickly allowing you to apply a cologne by the time you are dressed and ready to head out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars for doing everything it needs to really well but not the fifth as I still would not consider it a top tier product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside: the white tab in the top of the cap used to create a seal on the bottle falls out all the time. Something to watch out for if you don&#x27;t want to lost it. It&#x27;s like a vial used in a chemistry lab, and I really hate losing those things. Not really anything to take off for just kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and a little goes along ways.  I wish the bottle was bigger, so you have to use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> Well, the box came soaking wet and smelling of cardboard and cinnamon.  When I opened it, I found that the cap was completely off of the bottle, with half the contents gone.  Not sure how that happened, but I was not pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, aside from that poor first impression, I have come to love this aftershave!  The first time I applied it, I found the smell to be weird and reminiscent of that powdered soap that, once upon a time, was used in men&#x27;s rooms.  However, it dries down very well and transforms into a warm and pleasant scent.  I really love the way I smell about 10 minutes after application, and lucky for me that scent lasts a few hours.  Meanwhile, my skin feels soft and well-conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny though; this aftershave doesn&#x27;t have much burn, despite the name.  It&#x27;s more of a warming sensation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this is labeled bay rum. It doesn&#x27;t say bay rum anywhere on the bottle nor does it smell like bay rum at all. That being said, it&#x27;s a great aftershave with a very unique scent. Holiday cloves with spicy accents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The burn? Well it&#x27;s there but the bark is worse than the bite. It builds slowly, but clubman virgin island bay rum burns far hotter. This is still a great aftershave with a nice masculine scent. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> ok im sorry but I had to post my opinion and LIKE I said my opinion only.  Nasty pure nasty I  don&#x27;t  buy aftershave much. But wow what in the world I cant even describe the scent AND I don&#x27;t want to either.  Now then some may like this smell and as we all have different taste and smells. However I did let several house guest smell this product and not one person liked it at all.  However there is always someone who likes it. I just didn&#x27;t find that person today.  There other products may be more appealing like the lime aftershave. OK well I hope this may help if not all the best.</li>
            <li> Burns like the fire of hades but its very soothing afterwards</li>
            <li> Not real big on the scent, to me it smells like wet cardboard. It burns like you have been struck across the face by.... well a cat-o-nine&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic for healing the nicks</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic smelling stuff. A couple dashes in the hands after a straight shave will leave you sharply inhaling from the burn, this stuff definitely lives up to its name. The pain is well worth it though, rewarding those who can take their lashes with a pleasing and earthy rum scent which lingers all day at a level I find &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works especially well when paired with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Soap.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Spicy with a bite well after application. Very soothing and comfortable finish. The only drawback that kept it from a 5 star was that the product aromatics don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite aftershave...has a strong scent going on: bay, cloves, ..... very manly.  I have other Cpt. Choice fragrances and this is my first choice... the scent doesn&#x27;t linger long...has a crisp burn going on - feels wonderful.  Love this aftershave.</li>
            <li> I call it Sex Panther (probably because it has Cat in the name). I love the sting. Wakes me right up in the morning. Also does everything you want an aftershave to do. Leaves your skin soft and smooth.  Nice spicy bay rum and clove scent leaves you smelling like a sexy Easter ham.</li>
            <li> this is still my favorite.  I&#x27;ve gone thru all the \\&quot;usual\\&quot; brands and this is still miles ahead in every aspect.&lt;br /&gt;now I&#x27;m starting with \\&quot;boutique\\&quot; brands, and it&#x27;s a terrible start.  this stuff is great.&lt;br /&gt;if you like a smooth, conditioned feel, without the oily, sticky result, but still like to \\&quot;feel\\&quot; it, there is plenty of \\&quot;feel\\&quot; with this</li>
            <li> My Husband says, \\&quot;Feel the burn!\\&quot; &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Package got broken in transit. Glad it did. Smelled like cloves and stale baby powder. Do not reccomend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Fragrance was not what I expected.  I don&#x27;t like it, but someone else might.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Period.  Love the burn after shaving with my double edge razor.</li>
            <li> Great smell, and some extra burn to go with it.  Think of it as wasabe for your face.</li>
            <li> I am not sure who could stand the smell of this but I thought it stunk so bad that I had to wash it off after 10 minutes.  It did have a great smack of ice cold astringent but that positive is not enough to overcome the pungent oder.  My wife threw me out of the bathroom and told me she felt like she was going to vomit.  I thought it smelled like strong cloves on a holiday ham x1000.  I am a prime member but the this was not a prime vendor so the return protection is not offered.  If any of you want it then I will happily sent it to you.  Not to be disrespectful to those of you who love this stuff, but this is just my two cents.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was kind of disappointed in the smell when it arrived as I was really looking forward to it with all the great reviews. I don&#x27;t really mind the smell but I was expecting more of a Bay Rum and as another reviewer stated, it instead has a very strong clove smell. In fact I have a bottle of NOW 100% Clove Oil and to me the smell is virtually identical. That being said, I gave it a try after a safety razor shave and the feeling on my skin was fantastic! By far the best feeling I have gotten out of an aftershave and it really left my skin feeling great. Like I said I don&#x27;t mind the smell but if you&#x27;re looking for an aftershave with more of an emphasis on a cologne type fragrance, and clove is not your thing, you might want to look elsewhere. I also found the smell faded pretty quickly and is by no means unpleasant. Overall I do like it and the feeling and results on the skin make it all worth it. This will for certain be a part of my normal shave routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Update-&lt;br /&gt;The more I use this the more I&#x27;m really liking the smell. Can&#x27;t really explain it but it gets more complex than just the clove smell. Really like this stuff!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.  As it is, I don&#x27;t hate it, either.  I love cloves, and this aftershave is strongly scented with it.  In fact, my daughter could smell it when I first opened the box and she said the scent was familiar.  Reminding her that I put some in pumpkin pie, I let her sniff a bottle of cloves from the kitchen and she emphatically agreed, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s it!&amp;#34;  When I put it on, my wife said I smelled like a hot buttered rum.  I&#x27;m good with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin, however, is not good with that.  I had hoped there was enough glycerin in the formula to offset the grain alcohol.  Alas, I have razor bumps where I never did before with my aftershave balm, and my skin feels more sensitive when shaving the next day after using this product.  I have dry skin and live in a desert, so I should have guessed that the alcohol-based formula might cause problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, the experiment was not a total loss.  I should be able to leave the bottle open on the counter as a nice air freshener.  And I really did want to like it.</li>
            <li> I feel that Captain&#x27;s Choice bay rum is the real, authentic thing, but this stuff is even better! It really does have a stronger &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; than the regular, but I think the fragrance is more complex too - deeper somehow. I will put this on my &amp;#34;dnroo&amp;#34; list. (DO NOT RUN OUT OF).</li>
            <li> bottle leaked due to cracked lid other reviewer had same. it is hard to say how good the product is due to the evaporation of about a forth of it the rest i repackaged and added to another brand so as not to waste it, the mix works well but who can tell how this was by itself.</li>
            <li> I have quite a collection of aftershaves. From cheapos and classics to small-batch boutique aftershaves, and my own homemade recipes. This one is great. Great scent. The Mrs. loves it. But boy does it burn. When I first got the bottle, I splashed a little on, having not shaved in a couple of days. It burned then. It&#x27;s a great aftershave if you can handle the first couple of minutes. Just the right amount of moisturizing and healing ingredients. I&#x27;d really like to try some of the Captain&#x27;s other offerings.</li>
            <li> If you are the type that wants his aftershave to tingle and warm his freshly shaved face, this is the very best.  You will know you are in the presence of greatness when you use this fine aftershave.  For manly men only.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so good.  If you like that after shave burn, this stuff is for you.  Very refreshing!!</li>
            <li> I chose two Bay Rum Aftershaves: &amp;#34;Captain&#x27;s Choice&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;Barberry Coast&amp;#34;.  After using each one, I can honestly say that I smelled like a medicine cabinet after wearing Captain&#x27;s Choice.  Checking Amazon.com&#x27;s return policy on this product had revealed the following:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Captain&#x27;s Choice&amp;#34; could NOT be returned, but Barberry Coast COULD.  According to AMAZON.COM&#x27;S own policy,  Captain&#x27;s Choice is considered a Hazardous Waste.</li>
            <li> If you like the original Captains Choice, then you&#x27;re in for an even bigger and better treat with Cat o Nine Tails...The scent is basically the same except I feel it&#x27;s a tad stronger, the ingredients are somewhat the same but the difference is in the heavenly &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; you feel when applied. The warming feeling starts off low but builds up to a wonderful crescendo then tapers off nicely. It will leave your face feeling nice and toned and will get rid of any irritation that you may have.</li>
            <li> I have used a LOT of different after shave lotions. My current stock: Polo Blue - Cool Wave (Gillette) - Clubman Bay Rum - Proraso - Clubman Pinaud and Cat O&#x27;Nine Tails. The least favorite of the group is Polo Blue - The next to least is Clubman Bay Rum - The others are all equal they all give a little sting and make my face feel good, skin soft. The Cat O&#x27;Nine Tails I like just a tab more! The reason I&#x27;m giving a 4 star vs a 5 star : the bottle was in a plastic bag and the cap was loose. Some spilled and it&#x27;s a very strong odor. But other than the after shave is excellent which I would recommend to others. Actually all the ones mentioned above gets a recommendation from me. The product was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Great warming sensation on the skin, and an emphasis on the spice notes of the bay. An awesome bay rum that isn&#x27;t a sweet, powdery, or clove infused type of aftershave. It&#x27;s the only aftershave my girl has stated I have to always have a bottle of on the shelf.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great aftershave that has staying power and a great scent look no further. Cat o Nine has just enough BURN \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; to let you know its there, with a warm aroma that will stay with you throughout your day. I love the unique scent that reminds me of being a kid in the barbershop. The products from Captain&#x27;s Choice are top notch and high quality, I would highly recommend Cat o Nine as a staple in anyone&#x27;s shave arsenal.</li>
            <li> Speedy shipping and great product, thank you!</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit harsh, not refined.  Doesn&#x27;t really sting that much although there IS a delayed sting after about ten seconds.  All you can do is see if you like the smell.  For me it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted although I do like bay rum.  I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
            <li> The burn isn&#x27;t that bad (and if it is you should learn how to shave better). For me it&#x27;s perfect as a skin conditioner and aftershave. The orange spice is really powerful compared to other bay rum products I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s not off-putting at all. Overall a good after shave with a spicy fragrance that lasts through lunchtime.</li>
            <li> hot stuff does what it said it can do</li>
            <li> Pretty decent aftershave. Has a great smell.</li>
            <li> Smells like a ham cooking in the oven...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this 3.5 stars if I could.  Now, you must understand that I&#x27;m a little bit more discerning than the average cat.  I&#x27;m handsome and the babes love me.  I wanted to try some of this &amp;#34;bay rum&amp;#34; business.  I take my shaving seriously and wanted something a bit spicy, with a bit of kick.  And let me tell you, this son-of-a-pooch can kick!  Whooaaayyyaaa!  It&#x27;s not too much in the burn department, but it&#x27;s ramped up from any other aftershave I&#x27;ve used.  So if you&#x27;re concerned about too much sting, I proffer two suggestions: 1) get the regular bay rum, or 2) move to a wholly different facial product so as not to hurt yourself, sissy boy.  May I suggest vagisil?  This is a strong aftershave, really clove-ish.  They should call it &amp;#34;Lots O&#x27; Clove.&amp;#34;  My wife wasn&#x27;t thrilled about it, and quite honestly, neither was I at first.  I smelled like a spiced ham!!!  But after some time it began to grow on me.  Now here I type, 12 hours after the application to my handsome mug, and I can still faintly smell the sauce.  Oh, and it conditioned my gorgeous face really nicely.  Dry at first, but my skin really worked into a nice feel.  Pricey and Spicy, like my first Brazilian  girlfriend, Margharita!  If you like bay rum and like a nice warming burn, then try the Cat O&#x27; Nine Tails on!!!</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this aftershave so far. The burn gradually kicks in and fades in the same manner. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it stings but it&#x27;s a great burning sensation to wrap up a wet shave. The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming. It didn&#x27;t smell quite like I was expecting, maybe the bay leave smell is a bit overwhelming compared to the other adjuncts. A word of caution, don&#x27;t splash this on if you already have a shirt on, it seemed to leave a discolored stain behind on one of mine.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! The bay rum scent seems to be a touch \\&quot;spicier\\&quot; than the Captain&#x27;s Choice original bay rum aftershave. I prefer the scent of this over the original Bay Rum. It really is a top-notch scent and seems to be longer lasting than other Bay Rum aftershaves I&#x27;ve tried. However, the reason it has become my go-to aftershave is the face-feel. Like the other reviewers have noted, it BURNS! More than any other alcohol-based aftershave I&#x27;ve encountered. After the burn (it&#x27;s definitely more of a long-lasting burn than a quick sting) subsides, my face feels absolutely fantastic! It tightens up but still feels well-moisturized (it has witch hazel listed in the ingredients). This feeling lasts all day! Now, while the burn is strong and long-lasting (relatively), it should not be too much for someone who enjoys any other alcohol-based aftershaves. It&#x27;s definitely a notch or two above, but don&#x27;t let that scare you! Overall, this is a classic Bay Rum with a bit of extra kick that I find myself reaching for more often than not!</li>
            <li> I like this product but had to give it away as it irritated my skin after shaving (broke out in splotchy welts and had to put benedryl lotion on to get rid of them. Heard good things from others though so it&#x27;s probably just my skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed in this Bay Rum after reading some many great things about it.  Yes, it does burn, and burn long like the best of them do.  However, the scent just isn&#x27;t there.  Out of the bottle, the smell is almost unpleasant, as many have said.  Unfortunately, I never noticed any improvement on the skin.  I think of bay rum as being spicy and heady... this was subtle and unexciting.  If you&#x27;re looking for a Bay Rum with powerful aromatics.... keep looking.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!  I like the smell and the burn is slow and building.  If you don&#x27;t like too much burn use a little glycerin, that will help.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something with a little more bite. even after my first shave with a straight razor(many cuts) it was just a slight stinging sensation. I guess I am a sucker for pain but I like a serious burning sensation. smells great and makes my face soft . just lacks the burn I was expecting. I bought the &amp;#34;north&amp;#34; flavor from the same company and that I would give five stars. its a little to much clove scent at first but mellows out after a few hours. I still use it and enjoy it though.</li>
            <li> This is a bit strong for my liking perhaps you may like it</li>
            <li> Hubby love it.  I love the way it smells!  Very sexy.  Completely happy with the product and will try others by this company.</li>
            <li> A spicy unique scent.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this stuff feels on my face after shaving. I liked the smell stays with you for a long time for hours if you wash your hands and pat you face the smell picks back up my girlfriend on the other hand does not care for the smell so I don&#x27;t use it that much. Make sure you shake the bottle before putting it on to get the full effect it does have a very warming feature but not in a bad way the will go away after about 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Captain&#x27;s Choice aftershave is truly an amazing product and the best I&#x27;ve used in quite a while. Soothes irritation, tones the skin, and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth. I barely feel the need to moisturize after a shave. The initial sting is pretty refreshing, in my opinion, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product any guy I know that puts a razor to his face.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try it and I will finish it but while it&#x27;s not bad, I just don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time; Exactly as described; Pleased with product, but not quite what I was expecting ... It had a very earthy tone, like mushrooms.  I was hoping for something a bit more Spicy for a Bay Rum.</li>
            <li> Holly god does this burn. Mission accomplished - bring it on!</li>
            <li> Bring the fire is all I can. I really do enjoy splashing this on after a shave. It starts with a slight tingle to the face and then it hits with a Feel the burn sensation. In a few seconds it fades but leaves a nice scent. A great Fathers day gift from my daughter. I thinks it is a great product meant for men and not boys. Ha enjoy it and Feel the Burn guys but in a good way.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a good, tingly aftershave. It has a good bay rum smell.</li>
            <li> I watched a review on this on youtube and seemed impressive. I am someone who feels that you need the burn to know it works and this stuff really gives you the burn. I love this stuff and since using it my face feels as soft as it did when I was a pre-teen. If you can take the burn this stuff is the best!!</li>
            <li> I have shaving traditionally for about a year, and during the process came across Captains Choice.  The Cat O&#x27;Nine Tails is a fantastic scent, rich and invigorating at the same time.  There is a great warming sensation, almost a \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; tingle that grows for several moments after application.  It&#x27;s not the harsh alcohol burn that you get with a lot of aftershaves, on the contrary, it is quite enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part of this product is the condition in which it leaves your skin.  After a good shave and an application of the Cat, your face feels smooth, soft, conditioned.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of the Captain&#x27;s, have been since I tried his original.  Cat o&#x27; Nine Tails is a stronger, bolder, spicier brother.  It&#x27;s the bad twin, the one that you just know is trouble.  It goes on with a nice tingle, strong but not uncomfortable, and leaves your face soothed, not oily nor dry.  Upon smelling it, my wife said \\&quot;That&#x27;s what a man is supposed to smell like.\\&quot;  Two thumbs up, I won&#x27;t be without it!  Great job Captain.</li>
            <li> Captain&#x27;s Choice Cat O&#x27; Nine Tails Bay Rum is an excellent product.  Feels great on the face and plenty of pleasant aroma.  Is a good replacement for Royall Bay Rum and St. Johns Bay Rum, which have tended to disappoint in recent years.</li>
            <li> I am a bay rum ran, and I really wanted to like this, having read all the positive reviews.  However, after using it a number of times, all I can say is &amp;#34;yuck.&amp;#34;  I like the ingredient list--Cat O&#x27;Nine Tails does contain some great conditioners for your skin.  I really like the initial burn--it is quite intense, but fades quickly.  However, the scent is horrible.  To me it smells like a cross between bay rum and an insecticide you probably have out in your garage or shed.  Seriously, upon opening the bottle I thought I was in the lawn care aisle at Lowes.  Maybe their other scents are better, but this one just didn&#x27;t smell good to me at all.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> Not much sting??? must be water based</li>
            <li> The problem that I have with this product is that the scent is overpowered with clove. This is what happens when you blindly order an item that you have not seen physically, such is my case.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a nice Bay Rum scent and stumbled upon this based on the high reviews. I&#x27;m not someone who uses an alcohol-based aftershave in the first place. I normally use a sandlewood aftershave lotion. Anyway, I wanted something that had the bay rum scent that I can put on after every shower. I have experimented with several bay rum shaving soaps, so I knew the scent I was looking for. Needless to say this was not the scent.&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;While I believe that the clove scent is overpowered, you might feel that the clove sent suits you. Probably most important, and something that I should have mentioned first, is that this is a very good quality aftershave. It burned like a mother for about the first three minutes but after that my skin felt awesome. Even more importantly I didn&#x27;t get a single razor bump or burn.&lt;br /&gt; My girlfriend doesn&#x27;t seem to mind it at all but it has already lost its appeal to me after only a week.</li>
            <li> Not the scent I expected. And the after shave is rather mild. Won&#x27;t buy this specific after shave again.</li>
            <li> I love bay rum after shave - I own and use a variety of them including some hard-to-find vintage concoctions. The Captain&#x27;s Cat o&#x27; Nine Tails holds its own with the best of &#x27;em! This is a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; bay rum - there&#x27;s no sweetness here as there can be with lesser products - just spices a&#x27;plenty... oh, by the way -  IT BURNS! And for that burn, it is a GREAT after shave! Cat o&#x27;Nine Tails doesn&#x27;t have the eye-watering, finger-numbing freeze of Osage Rub, mind you, but it offers a great stinging post-shave... burn. Yeah, as the label says. It refreshes, it wakes up your sleepy face - the glycerin and other ingredients sooth and heal.... you can&#x27;t go wrong with the Captain&#x27;s Choice!</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I didn&#x27;t like the scent at first, which I would describe as being very earthy, damp, and pungent. In fact, I was a little disappointed in my purchase. In spite of this, I committed to use Co9T for a week straight before deciding whether or not I liked it. Oh man, this stuff is incredible! It cures my worst razor burn in a matter of minutes. Irritation that would have previously lasted for days is just gone. The burn is more intense than most, but it&#x27;s not painful, and that burn pulls out all of the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent has grown on me the more that I use it, and my girlfriend really likes it too. It&#x27;s definitely not a sweet or citrusy scent. If you&#x27;re into heavy, earthy scents like sandalwood, patchouli, or nag champa, you might really enjoy this. I have 10 different aftershaves on my shelf, and this is the one that I reach for everyday.</li>
            <li> Love the burn. Reminds you that you are doing a manly thing. Great scent, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really have no complaints with this product.  The amound of alcohol in an aftershave is a personal preference, I suppose.  This one smells quite nice.  It just has a tad more alocohol than I prefer in a splash.  If you don&#x27;t mind an exorbinate amount of alcohol, this product may be for you.</li>
