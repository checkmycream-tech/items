            <li>I wasnt sure if Mizani would work in my hair.</li>

            <li>I love this serum.  </li>

            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this item.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for products that help to make my hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>You did it again:-)</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>Great scent, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>mizani has great hair products and this one is no exception...great for just permed hair and natural curled hair, use with coconut milk oil and watch the magic.</li>
            <li>Thanks good price.</li>
            <li>I just use a moisturizer after blow-drying and the problem is easily solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives my hair excellent shine, but it does not weight my hair down.</li>
            <li>To be honest, it looked like I paid a whole lot of money to get my hair done.</li>
            <li>This is one of the product the Egyptian uses on women of color hair to get that smooth texture with body and softness hair</li>
            <li>I love this produc,t our hair is really straight and smooth when using it!</li>
            <li>it also has a good scent and is not heavy on the the hair.</li>
            <li>I think women with long hair (not extensions) see great results with alternative straightening enhancement products like these.</li>
            <li>Exactly what it says it is!&lt;br /&gt;Reduces frizz, great to put on before straightening and after straightening to smooth it down</li>
            <li>It never fails!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Mizani!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and leaves my hair soft and shiny without any sticky residue...</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair straight, smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I checked on Amazon, and sure enough, the Smooth Guard Serum was available.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well I am her to tell you this is &#x27;it&#x27;, well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I also use the serum when I wear partial sew - ins occasionally,  and it helps blend my hair with my weave perfectly!</li>
            <li>omg these products are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I like this very much.  </li>
            <li>Great product to use with curling and flat irons, especially, blow dryer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used this product was when it was time for yet another relaxer.</li>
            <li>My hair/roots were straight!  </li>
            <li>I could feel a difference in my hair upon the first use.</li>
            <li>I love this heat protectant for blow drying only.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a couple of years and will continue to use it because it works very well!</li>
            <li>my hair was so soft and left amazing waves in my hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally thick hair (which I love) and was therefore getting a relaxer every 6 weeks (which I didn&#x27;t love).  </li>
            <li>Soft, smooth, shiny, flat iron easy hair.</li>
            <li>The first time I used too much</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny and full of body.</li>
            <li>therefore began a mission to find something that would help me stretch the time between relaxer applications and keep my hair manageable enough to easily comb through.  </li>
            <li>Not bone straight or even as straight as when I get a relaxer, but straight enough to easily get through my hair.  </li>
            <li>and they worked very well on my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is bone straight and feels as if I&#x27;ve relaxed it.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and manageable and it combats humidity very well.</li>
            <li>and really did not like it.</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t much shine either.</li>
            <li>I never follow the dime size rule with hair products, but with the thermasmooth smooth guard you really do only need a drop.</li>
            <li>Just use sparingly...great for smooth hair - apply to towel dried hair...leaves hair smooth and very shiny.</li>
            <li>and I spent the money. :)</li>
            <li>Yes, this product will leave your hair bone straight.</li>
            <li>After trying this, I really don&#x27;t see the point in getting a relaxer ever again.</li>
            <li>Seller provided fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Hair is straight and really shiny.</li>
            <li>havent really seen this product do much for my hair.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair shinny and straight.</li>
            <li>this is a very god product and keeps the hair very shiny</li>
            <li>I really like this protect.  </li>
            <li>Keeps it straight longer.  </li>
            <li>It really smooths your hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it all that I stopped using it and went back to my original smoothing serum that doesn&#x27;t have a heat guard.</li>
            <li>My particular hair did get quite straight</li>
            <li>For instance,  my hair has a natural softness and tends to get really frizzy really fast, but this serum prevents the frizz.</li>
            <li>Older product that does not work as it is supposed.  </li>
            <li>It might work better for those who live in less humid places.</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft it felt like a wig!!</li>
            <li>My picky teenage daughter now wants me to use it on her hair!!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t mind spending a little more.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li>I make a bottle of my normal leave-in conditioner with some oil and instead of putting this product in my hair then blow drying it.</li>
            <li>She applied it before blow-drying and flat-ironing and said it did help make straightening her thick locks easier and giving it a nice shine without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve known for years that getting relaxers just aren&#x27;t good for the hair due to all the chemicals they contain, but I&#x27;m really not interested in going natural at this</li>
            <li>When I smoothed my hair out with the flat iron, my hair had that freshly relaxed look and it shined.</li>
            <li>I live in Louisiana where during the summer and spring the humidity gets up to 90% or higher on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I use it on her hair and now my naturally 3c hair!  </li>
            <li>I purchased to use when I blow dry my hair with hopes that it would prevent it from being dry and more damaged.</li>
            <li>Not worth the money imo, better off going with a cheaper brand that gives the same results.</li>
            <li>My natural hair got silky straight and reverted back after washing....</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair (type 3C)</li>
            <li>I have natural kinky-curly hair</li>
            <li>If you have natural hair, or your transitioning..</li>
            <li>the all natural hair.</li>
            <li>went without a relaxer for 6 months, but that was really too long for me.  </li>
            <li>but it had no shine and did not stay straight for long.</li>
            <li>I really like Mizani hair products because they are one of the only products that actually work on my hair and this one works wonders for my hair!!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical as to how effective it would be, but I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>My have thick hair and it helps with the frizz and keeps it feeling smooth</li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural always, but for a change I decides to flat iron.</li>
            <li>This stung my skin a little when I first used it.</li>
            <li>I used this after I washed my hair and it left my hair so soft and shiny when I was flat ironing it.  </li>
            <li>It will leave little flakes behind at times but they are pretty easy to pick out.</li>

            <li> I read it was to be done by a professional, which I don&#x27;t mind, but the price for the process seemed steep to me for what basically boiled down to a wash and blow dry.  </li>
            <li> Two beauticians I went to in the past actually recommended I get relaxed every 4 weeks due to my hair thickness and how fast my hair reverts.  </li>

            <li> If you are a woman of color, your bathroom cabinet is full of products that promised to work on your hair, but failed.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feels so flimsy and not very straight.</li>

            <li> You only need to use a little on your hair.</li>
            <li> i put it in my oil bottle with my other products and i let my hair air dry.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The pump is hard, but I like it.  It works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I recieved this item and it was leaking all over. 1/4 of the product was gone by the time I got it. Not happy with product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product in excellent. Great product to use with curling and flat irons, especially, blow dryer. Great scent, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair (type 3C) and since I don&#x27;t have a chemical relaxer in my hair anymore, it&#x27;s been nearly impossible to get my hair straight! I found Mizani Thermasmooth Heat Serum in my local Walmart and was a little skeptical because for such a small bottle it cost $24.95!  But I use Carol&#x27;s Daughter products, so I&#x27;m used to paying a lot for hair care products, plus I&#x27;ve used other Mizani products and they worked very well on my hair.  Anyway, I put a little bit of the Mizani in my hair after I shampooed and conditioned it, then after it dried, I put some on each section and I flat-ironed my hair.  My hair is bone straight and feels as if I&#x27;ve relaxed it.  I LOVE this stuff - it&#x27;s the only thing that works for me. It makes my hair shiny and manageable and it combats humidity very well.</li>
            <li> This product was so so.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick hair (which I love) and was therefore getting a relaxer every 6 weeks (which I didn&#x27;t love).  Two beauticians I went to in the past actually recommended I get relaxed every 4 weeks due to my hair thickness and how fast my hair reverts.  I decided not to listen to them, but the suggestion was under serious consideration both times considering that by week 5 post relaxer, I would have to *very* carefully comb through my hair to minimize breakage, which was frustrating and time consuming.  I&#x27;ve known for years that getting relaxers just aren&#x27;t good for the hair due to all the chemicals they contain, but I&#x27;m really not interested in going natural at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I therefore began a mission to find something that would help me stretch the time between relaxer applications and keep my hair manageable enough to easily comb through.  I came across this product on the internet.  I read it was to be done by a professional, which I don&#x27;t mind, but the price for the process seemed steep to me for what basically boiled down to a wash and blow dry.  I checked on Amazon, and sure enough, the Smooth Guard Serum was available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this product was when it was time for yet another relaxer. I was skeptical as to how effective it would be, but I decided to give it a shot. I washed and conditioned my hair, and then applied the serum before blow drying.  WOW!  I&#x27;m so glad I gave this a chance.  My hair/roots were straight!  Not bone straight or even as straight as when I get a relaxer, but straight enough to easily get through my hair.  I experienced no breakage when combing, so I was absolutely amazed with the results.  The only drawback was my hair felt a little \\&quot;straw-like\\&quot; and looked a little dry.  I&#x27;m used to a silky feeling when using other heat-protectants.  But in my opinion, it was a small price to pay.  I just use a moisturizer after blow-drying and the problem is easily solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went without a relaxer for 6 months, but that was really too long for me.  I&#x27;ve since decided to get a relaxer every 4 months.  I think that&#x27;s awesome, and I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Order this and used it is on my hair and really did not like it. It makes my hair feels so flimsy and not very straight. I will not order it again.</li>
            <li> This stung my skin a little when I first used it. It doesn&#x27;t do what it says it will either. During humid days my hair reverted to curly quicker with this than anything I have ever used. There wasn&#x27;t much shine either. I had to use some other product to get that.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the product and with the delivery of the product...very timely.  This product gives my hair the extra shine I need whenever I decide to apply heat to my hair.  I am very satisfied with all of Mizani products.  My hair has not been the same since using them.</li>
            <li> I wasnt sure if Mizani would work in my hair. I used it finally last night. My hair was so soft it felt like a wig!! Loved it. I look forward to washing my hair again.</li>
            <li> I never follow the dime size rule with hair products, but with the thermasmooth smooth guard you really do only need a drop. I&#x27;ve had the 3.4 FL oz bottle for a year and it&#x27;s not even half gone. It&#x27;s very light and leaves my hair soft and shiny without any sticky residue... and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I just ordered another bottle. You only need to use a little on your hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, I know it&#x27;s for ethnic hair basically, but anyone any use it. Just use sparingly...great for smooth hair - apply to towel dried hair...leaves hair smooth and very shiny.</li>
            <li> This serum provided just what I was looking for; shine and protection when flat-ironing. I have natural kinky-curly hair so I applied it individually to each section I flat-ironed. The first time I used too much but it still didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. It tamed the frizz just as I needed to for that day. I have to use it daily though since my hair is so dry.</li>
            <li> mizani has great hair products and this one is no exception...great for just permed hair and natural curled hair, use with coconut milk oil and watch the magic.</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair and my daughters hair. I love this produc,t our hair is really straight and smooth when using it!</li>
            <li> I keep a short crop (think Halle Berry, Ginnifer Goodwin). Like most African-American women, I have dual textured hair.  I do relax for convenience, but only about once every 3 or 4 months.  Depending on the season, I may go longer so I decided to try this as an alternative in the interim..  Once again, I was disappointed when it comes to products like these.  I think women with long hair (not extensions) see great results with alternative straightening enhancement products like these. I ended up giving it to my niece whose hair comes past her shoulders and is chemical-free. She applied it before blow-drying and flat-ironing and said it did help make straightening her thick locks easier and giving it a nice shine without being greasy.  So, I give it at least 2 stars because it worked for someone, just not me...and I spent the money. :)</li>
            <li> I used this after I washed my hair and it left my hair so soft and shiny when I was flat ironing it.  This is a  good product.  It&#x27;s what everyone is saying.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says it is!&lt;br /&gt;Reduces frizz, great to put on before straightening and after straightening to smooth it down</li>
            <li> I just used the Mizani Butter Blend relaxer. Combined with the Thermasmooth Smoothing serum and the Shine Extend Anti-Humidity spray the results are amazing!!! My hair is soft, shiny and full of body. This is a bit pricey, but I have found &#x27;the&#x27; ultimate product line. If you are a woman of color, your bathroom cabinet is full of products that promised to work on your hair, but failed. Well I am her to tell you this is &#x27;it&#x27;, well worth the investment. My picky teenage daughter now wants me to use it on her hair!!</li>
            <li> This product is by far one of the best out there.  I begin using it four years ago on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  At that time her  4b hair had fallen out for some unknown reason.. I took her to a beautician who not only introduced us to the line but also showed me how to use it...every since then I have been hooked.  I use it on her hair and now my naturally 3c hair!  It never fails!  Our hair is alway straight, bouncey, beautiful  when we are going for that look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are contemplating buying this product...DON&#x27;T!!!!</li>
            <li> Yes, this product will leave your hair bone straight. After trying this, I really don&#x27;t see the point in getting a relaxer ever again. When I smoothed my hair out with the flat iron, my hair had that freshly relaxed look and it shined. To be honest, it looked like I paid a whole lot of money to get my hair done.</li>
            <li> This product is a great product. It protect the hair from hair damage. My stylist use it in my hair whenever she straightens my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  I am a woman of color with natural hair (no relaxer), and this product does what previous products could not.  For instance,  my hair has a natural softness and tends to get really frizzy really fast, but this serum prevents the frizz. I also use the serum when I wear partial sew - ins occasionally,  and it helps blend my hair with my weave perfectly! Money well spent!</li>
            <li> I like how it smooths down my hair and controls the frizz. However, i can&#x27;t get over the smell. I don&#x27;t like it all that I stopped using it and went back to my original smoothing serum that doesn&#x27;t have a heat guard.</li>
            <li> Seller provided fast shipping.  I love this serum.  It gives my hair excellent shine, but it does not weight my hair down.</li>
            <li> okay, didn&#x27;t get the results I was expecting</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Works great! Really simple to use.</li>
            <li> Older product that does not work as it is supposed.  Recieved different bottles from what was illustrated in pictures. Very unhappy and dissappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells terrific and it does what it says. I&#x27;m satisfied. It also lasts a long time too. Love.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something to extend the life if my hair straightener, as to not damage my hair, and this is it. This item has exceeded my expectations. I blow dry my hair then add the serum and flatiron my hair and voila!  Hair is straight and really shiny. Love Love Love this item.</li>
            <li> I like this very much.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> havent really seen this product do much for my hair. thought i would see something after drying it and styling it but never have</li>
            <li> This product does what it says! I make a bottle of my normal leave-in conditioner with some oil and instead of putting this product in my hair then blow drying it. i put it in my oil bottle with my other products and i let my hair air dry. omg. my hair was so soft and left amazing waves in my hair. I am also using the Shampoo and conditioner. omg these products are worth every penny. If you have natural hair, or your transitioning..then this is the stuff you want. Soft, smooth, shiny, flat iron easy hair.</li>
            <li> The Mizani Thermasmooth Smooth Guard is a great product. I could feel a difference in my hair upon the first use.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair shinny and straight. Works great with your hot irons or&lt;br /&gt;curling irons to protect the hair. Makes the hair look like you have a perm,&lt;br /&gt;for the all natural hair.</li>
            <li> Arrived immediately and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for products that help to make my hair more manageable. This Mizani product is wonderful . After I flat iron my hair there is no frizz.</li>
            <li> I live in Louisiana where during the summer and spring the humidity gets up to 90% or higher on a regular basis. I used this product and it keeps my style in place when I&#x27;m inside but once I step outside the product only works for about 10 minutes before my hair begins to poof out. It also weighs the hair down. It might work better for those who live in less humid places. This LA humidity ain&#x27;t a joke. Not worth the money imo, better off going with a cheaper brand that gives the same results. also makes hair a tiny bit hard when you comb it out.</li>
            <li> Does what it says if you use enough of it.  I have to use a generous amount for my daughter thick/natural African american hair.  It will leave little flakes behind at times but they are pretty easy to pick out. Will use again.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this prior to blow drying or flat ironing her hair.  She swears by it...great protectant and shine serum.</li>
            <li> I think this product is either too thick to get through the pump - or my pump is broken.  Either way - wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> this is a very god product and keeps the hair very shiny it also has a good scent and is not heavy on the the hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this protect.  I have used it for a long time.  My have thick hair and it helps with the frizz and keeps it feeling smooth</li>
            <li> I love this heat protectant for blow drying only.</li>
            <li> This is one of the product the Egyptian uses on women of color hair to get that smooth texture with body and softness hair&lt;br /&gt;that moves when using an airbrush. Thanks good price.</li>
            <li> This product is great but I did not get quite the results I expected. My particular hair did get quite straight but it had no shine and did not stay straight for long. Planning on using it again shortly.</li>
            <li> Product helpful. I was looking for a different Mizani product to use when straightening my hair &amp;#34;Thermostrength&amp;#34; not Thermosmooth. Too oily for pressing.</li>
            <li> I really like Mizani hair products because they are one of the only products that actually work on my hair and this one works wonders for my hair!! It leaves my hair straight, smooth and shiny. Thanks Mizani!! You did it again:-)</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my hair when I press it.  Keeps it straight longer.  But what do you expect from all Mizani products? The products do what they say so I don&#x27;t mind spending a little more.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural always, but for a change I decides to flat iron. My hair is so beautiful. Everyone thinks I have a perm. This product is amazing. It really smooths your hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased to use when I blow dry my hair with hopes that it would prevent it from being dry and more damaged. I can say I am very pleased with the results I achieved in using this product.  My hair is so soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smooth and shiny! LOVEEE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I purchase Mizani products all the time.  I have been using this product for a couple of years and will continue to use it because it works very well!</li>
            <li> Love it! I used the entire 4 step system! My natural hair got silky straight and reverted back after washing....</li>
