    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>However, I had a perfect manicure until I took them off.</li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>They work great!</li>
            <li>This kit works great!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of practice with those things and my application is never quite perfect.</li>
            <li>It took two hours, but my nails are beautiful!  </li>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>I saw reviews saying this was a wonderful product and reviews saying it was a rip off.</li>
            <li>I am in the wonderful category.</li>
            <li>, it is still literally perfect.</li>
            <li>Beyond impressed</li>
            <li>Used the strips but was not too impressed.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>But its a great starter kit!</li>
            <li>Good protection from breaking!</li>
            <li>The paint stayed on and I was very pleased!</li>
            <li>Great gift Idea for the Gal on the go.</li>
            <li>I do, however, have great results and here&#x27;s how.</li>
            <li>still wearing my gel nails with no mishaps from 2 days ago, and they look great.  </li>
            <li>With the correct prep (buffing, cleaning, etc) the strips went on great.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li>It took some practice and getting used to but the product is very nice.</li>
            <li>Very easy to tear!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still good to go!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The light colors work best.</li>
            <li>Loved the color that came with it.</li>
            <li>thought I would give these a try and was going to be super impressed if they made it through a couple of days of the abuse that living in my reality would put them through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the nail stickers/strips!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, I really really love them!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Looks nice while it lasts.</li>
            <li>My sister owns her own company and lives on the road.</li>
            <li>I work in the yard, work on my own car,</li>
            <li>After a week of debating whether or not I would use it, I decided to use it my own way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 3 days in with 6 kids (15-4yo) and a cheer coach/housewife (meaning lots of wear and tear on my hands between catching kids and dishes/laundry/cleaning, etc)</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m rather inept when it comes to doing my own nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice once watching on TV.</li>
            <li>Always good to have another bottle of top coat, always needed.</li>
            <li>I was super happy to get this as a gift-until I used it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They were very easy to apply, I had no problem getting them to stick to my nails</li>
            <li>I have had great success with the product.</li>
            <li>great first time.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this kit.  </li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had smooth, shiny, glorious nails!</li>
            <li>They are fantastic!</li>
            <li>And I did what they said, I soaked with nail polish remover in foil for 5 minutes, then five minutes more,</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shopping around and have found the top coat for $5 on eBay.</li>
            <li>I love these things.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li>but I am glad I took a chance and bought this product.  </li>
            <li>I also made sure to use the cleansing pads before and after the application procedure.  </li>
            <li>Everything turned out fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this product and plan on purchasing more in the future.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sold separately and really adds a great foundation to the nail.</li>
            <li>Then I add the top coat and cure for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the results for an at-home gel mani solution.</li>
            <li>I think the trick may be to make sure you get the gel painted over the edges of the strip.</li>
            <li>It probably costs more now.</li>
            <li>may be such that the gel color strips just adhere better than most, but I&#x27;m really impressed with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>apply gel top coat to each nail&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>The gel doesn&#x27;t thicken the way most gel does.  </li>
            <li>though that I could fix the problem by adding more of the polish</li>
            <li>Granted you can do at most 2 nails at a time, but it saved me from having to buy another starter kit.  </li>
            <li>so I was pleased about the LED.</li>
            <li>I love these strips and kit.</li>
            <li>I Love it</li>
            <li>being that I love Sally Hansen products</li>
            <li>You have to wipe them once more with the alcohol pad.</li>
            <li>so I got two nails out of most of the press on polishers.  </li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>love doing my nails myself, I also love the durability and look of gel nails.</li>
            <li>Those tips plus this top coat has been my prettiest manicure ever.</li>
            <li>I purchased this kit, for $27 btw, and am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I use nail strips regularly so I am pretty good at getting them on so applying them</li>
            <li>Still a pretty good performance in my opinion.</li>
            <li>the lady said that the gel alone was very good, so I tried it with regular polish.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying the LED light and the gel top coat, and that is all you need.</li>
            <li>Then I filed the tips of my nails to make sure the color strip was sealed and smooth around each nail tip.</li>
            <li>Going to the salon and paying more for a one time application justifys the one time investment in the UV light that comes in this kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was freaked out at the end because my nails where super sticky, but after reviewing the instructions one more time, I had forgotten about the cleaning with alcohol one more time (to get rid of the sticky residue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Quick and Easy!</li>
            <li>drawbacks to me are that the lamp breaks easily (</li>
            <li>It has been over a week and they are still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty good at putting them on my fingernails now, aligning them just right.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is just one defective product or they are all this cheaply made</li>
            <li>, I have some LED lights lying around, and a UV light for my indoor herb garden.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I tried LED lights and my garden UV light.</li>
            <li>Ahem, as it turns out, the light that comes with the kit is a LED UV light.</li>
            <li>The light worked well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of chipping at the cuticle edge, as well as around places where the strip didn&#x27;t go on completely smooth.</li>
            <li>I thought the gel topcoat and/or UV light were defective when my nails were tacky after curing.</li>
            <li>I also saw that one reviewer said she didn&#x27;t have luck with correcting chips by coating over it again with the gel and re-curing with the UV light, however I did just that</li>
            <li>By keeping an eye out for coupons and sales, this is a lot more reasonable and enjoyable for me than going to a salon.</li>
            <li>Purchase worth it for the light and top coat alone.</li>
            <li>The lamp works great and is small so it is even better for travel!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would recommend it, but go in knowing that you need to take your time on the first application, and don&#x27;t expect miracles!!  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed it very much.</li>
            <li>: Easy to do, especially if you aren&#x27;t good with clean lines.</li>
            <li>With a gel manicure I can go 2 weeks or more without even a chip, which is good for me since I really love having my nails &#x27;done&#x27; but I am not easy on  them.  </li>
            <li>I bought this kit exclusively for the LED light because it was on sale and such a good deal.</li>
            <li>Let it stand for 3-5min, and then wipe clean.</li>
            <li>(It says don&#x27;t let the gel polish touch your cuticle/skin, so take the time to clean it up if this happens.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to wait for anything to dry, which is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1) trim, file, and clean nails well.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>so shiny &amp; clean around the edges.  </li>
            <li>really the gold in this kit is the light and the top coat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I can honestly say that they aren&#x27;t even worth that much...</li>
            <li>Good thing I only paid $8 compared to the retail price of almost $30.  </li>
            <li>The adage &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; is certainly true of this product.  </li>
            <li>&quot; and \\&quot;omg, i love it\\&quot; weren&#x27;t very helpful.</li>
            <li>I did use it with the non-gel strips, so maybe that was part of the reason it didn&#x27;t go 2 full weeks.</li>
            <li>Plus you can use other nail strips and normal polish for this which is awesome!</li>
            <li>So--where I didn&#x27;t, they chipped fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I think that&#x27;s probably because they don&#x27;t cure as quickly as the instructions say they do...</li>
            <li>I got impatient on my right hand (dominent hand) and struggled with the pulling to ensure a great fit; and the results showed it.  </li>
            <li>They tear fairly easily and if you accidentally take off too much</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this kit, and followed the directions EXACTLY.</li>
            <li>The resulting finish is strong and durable, more so than traditional nail</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the cheapest I have been able to find so far.</li>
            <li>It is worth noting that LED is far better than UV lights because it doesn&#x27;t emit harmful skin damaging/cancer causing waves.  </li>
            <li>And by the way, the starter kit (the kit that contains the red strips) does in fact come with its own mini LED lamp -</li>
            <li>I never got the strips laid right on my nails</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, $3.00 for just the strips with the gel.</li>
            <li>you have to use the right</li>
            <li>very cheap and the polish RUBBED off almost as soon as it dryed --fun for a few minutes ( at most)</li>
            <li>My nails look wonderful a week and a half later.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to repair them by using my OPI top coat to restick the \\&quot;polish\\&quot; back to my nails, but it doesn&#x27;t look professional.</li>
            <li>This is exactly the same process except once you&#x27;re done fitting your nails with the strips you add a top coat of the gel and stick each individual finger under the light for 30 seconds, wipe with the alcohol cloth and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>I am a total klutz &amp; if I can easily apply these things, anybody can!  </li>
            <li>I was nervous at first because they felt tacky after 30 seconds under the light, but then I finished reading the instructions and that is normal.</li>
            <li>Love the other brush on gel polish I bought, even though it takes longer to do than the strips, and used the mini LED light with the polish.  </li>
            <li>4 days old now and wearing just fine.  </li>
            <li>I followed directions prior to application of strips and then again to the letter when applying the gel top coat.</li>
            <li>I would have given them 3 stars (maybe even 4), but the lamp doesn&#x27;t stay on consistently.</li>
            <li>Hi, first, i would like to thank everyone who commented on the \\&quot;deets\\&quot; of the gel/curing process.</li>
            <li>eh, it was pretty once i put it on ....</li>
            <li>exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>I put off buying them at full price ($11.99 for the strip kit without the light), but when I saw them at a local store on clearance for $3 I picked up a set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>You only need regular nail polish, this gel top coat and the light!</li>
            <li>And for once in my life I have pretty nails.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the lamp get really hot and it burns the tops of my nails...</li>
            <li>I buffered, and cleansed my nails first.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m sure everyone has some regular rubbing alcohol in their house.</li>
            <li>The cleansing pads that the kit brings contains exactly that: rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>But I was interested in this cheaper, \\&quot;easier\\&quot; alternative to Shellac or OPI gel nails, and took the plunge today.</li>
            <li>I have used the regular nail strips for a while so adding the durability of gel was really appealing.</li>
            <li>I picked up this kit at a local store and came to Amazon to order more.  </li>
            <li>but I have included an image just so others could see that they turned out pretty well despite my clumsiness.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re cute to use from time to time, especially the patterned ones that I could never recreate on my nails otherwise, but</li>
            <li>I expect to make the 2 full weeks or longer before there is any need to even begin to consider a new manicure.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time on this garbage, you&#x27;re probably better of saving your money for a more high end product.</li>
            <li>red the comments before buying the product and most people said they peel off easily, that is does not last a week.</li>
            <li>The trick is, I think, taking the time to make sure they are really stuck to your nails, and properly trimmed.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, the light works with other brand LED gel polishes.  </li>
            <li>I did however get alot of compliments, and my nails are super red and super duper</li>
            <li>This system seems easy enough...</li>
            <li>Was easy to do, took 30 minutes total.  </li>
            <li>you let your nails completely dry before attempting to do any chores you will be totally satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also buffed out and mashed the gel strip securely to each nail - almost like working the air bubbles out of wall paper - and used the file to mash it down securely all over the nail bed.</li>
            <li>You are better off getting a LED light that will fit more than 1 finger at a time (kit light only cures 1 finger at a time &#x3D; slow) and some actual gel polish/top coat/base coat from your local beauty supply</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen these last 10 days without chips though, and at the price it is at now I think is super worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also paired these with the Broadway Nails tips kit.</li>
            <li>They stay on for 1 and a half weeks but other than that I love them!:)</li>
            <li>In the future I plan to use pure acetone (I found it at Sally Beauty supply for $2.60 or something), make sure I use real cotton balls (or just soak in a glass bowl) and hope it goes a little better.</li>
            <li>great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just looking at the strips and polish, I have a feeling that I will just stick to using the whole kit for the lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easier to remove than a real gel manicure.</li>
            <li>I did not buy the whole starter kit, as I thought \\&quot;hey</li>
            <li>I looked everywhere online to see if these were sufficient lighting devices and found absolutely nothing, so I&#x27;m assuming that should have been my answer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>I really damaged my nails.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I spent more time fixing the mistakes I made.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions closely and made sure to rough up my nails to remove any shine on the tops of them.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy the whole set.</li>
            <li>within about five minutes of applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have followed the directions PRECISELY each time I&#x27;ve used this kit, but have had the same results every time.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>I bought the Sally Hansen Gel Insta strips (not the whole kit) because of the design</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit that I am not the most careful manicurist.</li>
            <li>I only got to use the led light twice</li>
            <li>Not so much as a teensy lift on any of them.</li>
            <li>Honestly this was the biggest waste of time.</li>
            <li>I am 100% pleased with this and won&#x27;t ever go back to the old method.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best thing next to getting a professional Gelish style manicure from the salon.  </li>
            <li>So I clean the nail with alcohol and add another top coat followed by at least 90 seconds of curing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m familiar with the non-gel Sally Hansen polish strips and have used them on several occassions.</li>
            <li>Since you can put them on top of each other, I might build a pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up from me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very careful, and had used the insta-strips before (again with pleased results), so I will say I knew what to expect.  </li>
            <li>I am secretly hoping I get a chip soon just because I want an excuse to take this color off and have another perfect looking, glossy color to look at!</li>
            <li>It did dry instantly and seemed to have a nice, glossy finish.</li>
            <li>After letting each coat dry COMPLETELY, I followed the instructions for this gel top coat and cured each nail.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, even though they are cute and I do like the patterns available, these things are a total waste of time and money even at $3 a set.  </li>
            <li>If you get too close to the skin, nail bed or neglect to file down the top edge IT IS GOING TO CHIP.</li>
            <li>the top coat!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been marked down super cheap here and in stores because they&#x27;re replacing this with a much more expensive kit.</li>
            <li>I was ready for a new color anyway.</li>
            <li>Regular polish does not adhere to my nails well and doesn&#x27;t last more than a day or 2.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect much from it and was very surprised.</li>
            <li>Finished result is a high gloss polish strip.</li>
            <li>The tips are high quality but the gel + activator in that is basically garbage.</li>
            <li>Also the little light broke after the first use.</li>
            <li>You can file and smooth out any rough edges before applying the liquid gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A professional manicure gets banged up by me much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>CAN chip, even with a few top</li>
            <li>Normally I get gel manicures at the salon and wanted to start doing it at home.</li>
            <li>and I do a lot of things that would normally chip my polish.</li>
            <li>This might be more of a personal issue, but I actually find it easier to use a brush to apply color to my nails (even with my less dominant left hand) than to get these things on straight and without them touching my cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>did have some spots where the strip tore, so for those I just \\&quot;patched\\&quot; them with leftover from other nails - it worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>I will update as the days go on, but right now I am totally sold on this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As other have mentioned, use this for the light and</li>
            <li>I live on a ranch and care for 2 horses, 4 goats, 6 dogs and a husband.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s decent for a do-it-yourself version of a professional service.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and discovered several things...</li>
            <li>The nails peel off (completely!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually one to paint my nails</li>
            <li>At first I thought they weren&#x27;t drying, but you have to wipe off the extra gel with the pad.</li>
            <li>short, I just removed the first set yesterday because my nails had grown out, not because anything had come off.  </li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t open that second pack until you&#x27;re sure you need it, because onece opened they won&#x27;t last..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to attempt to use the top coat and the light on regular SH strips or standard polish to see if I get the same results for less money.</li>
            <li>My nails are growing out and the strips are still on even though you can see the new nail growth near my cuticles just like with the salon style manicures.  </li>
            <li>Also, the first time I did it, I wasn&#x27;t so careful about the getting the tabs really adhered to the nails all the way to the edges.  </li>
            <li>I buffed off as many of the ridges as possible, shaped my nail, and filed down all the roughness.</li>
            <li>even though there are 16 strips in the package (supposedly 8 different sizes), there are 8 that are pretty much the same size.  </li>
            <li>$28 covers only two sets and the light is for one finger at a time and takes about 12x of one of your fingers to have it dry.</li>
            <li>Not sure why you would buy this for $30 when you can go to a nail salon and pay $20-25 and get a real legit shellac manicure instead of having to do it yourself and having it peel off..not worth it!</li>
            <li>Made sure the color tabs were carefully pressed clear to the corners of each nail (don&#x27;t ignore a loose corner).  </li>
            <li>The first lasted a little more than two weeks, then they started peeling a little bit near the bottom of the nail where the new nail growth was showing.</li>
            <li>3-4 days later, I did a third coat to cover my tips again because I hit them on everything (and enjoy tapping my fingernails on hard surfaces to hear the sound).</li>
            <li>You can fix the peeling by filing it a bit and applying another clear coat.</li>
            <li>The ones meant for your pinky MIGHT fit a child&#x27;s hand, but they are way too narrow to even consider for an adult hand.  </li>
            <li>Also had a smidge of the strip on my cutical (which is clearly a no-no)</li>
            <li>and I red the whole instructions</li>
            <li>Not messy.</li>
            <li>This is a real problem since you can only put one finger in at a time.</li>
            <li>However, the chipping (which isn&#x27;t terribly frequent) just is what it is.</li>
            <li>I applied an additional layer, because I felt like I&#x27;d come this far for just one coat of shine?</li>
            <li>The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars from me is because it doesn&#x27;t really work like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>For me, this lasts much longer than a standard polish job</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been giving myself all kinds of mani&#x27;s since i was 12 years old, so</li>
            <li>The next day five of my nails were very chipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cure them for a minute under the LED lamp (press twice; 2 sets of 30 seconds), and finally use some rubbing alcohol with a cotton ball and rub your nails gently with it.</li>
            <li>I have had gel nails done professionally and paid over $100 for both hands and feet about 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>and then it completely broke</li>
            <li>A bonus for my husband is there is no harsh smell.</li>
            <li>One teensy chip near cuticle of pinky.</li>
            <li>These are my natural nails.</li>
            <li>I must say I was surprised by the unflattering reviews.  </li>
            <li>and they dried in 30 seconds under the LED light.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m taking the whole kit back, and I expect a refund even though I used the darn thing.  </li>
            <li>This product is an at home kit, so of COURSE it&#x27;s not going to look like you had them professionally done.  </li>
            <li>It is a very, very, subtle amount of color, but good for a first try as no one other than you will notice the mistakes.</li>
            <li>when I pulled the chord out of the back for the first time, the recepticle broke and I had to take it back to the store for a new one.  </li>
            <li>After 4 hours I had 1 nail chip on my left hand and the next day another chip on my right hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;d be better off just getting a high end nail polish and using a base coat,then the nail polish and a top</li>
            <li>The color came out clear when the package shows a pretty pearly pink.  </li>
            <li>apply gel strips to each nail and use the provided wooden stick to smooth down edges&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>Noticed that on a few of them the strip covered the real nail completely and those were the 3 that peeled fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now tried four packs of them (light pink, tan tiger stripes, wine, and red) and had the same results with each.  </li>
            <li>So I just store the new one with the chord left in.  </li>
            <li>And the only reason I took them off is because my nails had grown out so much that I had regular nail showing from my cuticle.  </li>
            <li>By the third application and a total of 4 days, I was discussed and tossed the whole kit in the trash.  </li>
            <li>The others only fit so-so if your nails aren&#x27;t on the narrow side....</li>
            <li>Had a few nails start to peel quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this on clearance at a major drugstore chain.  </li>
            <li>have only had mine on for two days now, however I work in an office and do alot of typing - my nails have held up so far!  </li>
            <li>I also found the uv light not strong enough with one application and had to repeat 2 or 3 times.</li>
            <li>Had to repeat the light cycle a couple of times to make the gel hard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tries it with dark colors, now I&#x27;ll try a light one.</li>
            <li>I find that if you tear them off carefully and have small nails, you can get one pack of strips (8) to do both hands.  </li>
            <li>A week later, I have no chips and it still looks glassy and truly professional.</li>
            <li>Almost instantly my nails began to peel off, and some of my nails came completely off.</li>
            <li>that you want the gel on a bit of bare nail on each side.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve always kept them completely bare all my life.  </li>
            <li>Like I mentioned before, I haven&#x27;t completely finished the entire process</li>
            <li>Therefore, the &amp;#34;gel manicure&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t much different than regular, normal nail polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so be careful attaching the black cord to the light.</li>
            <li>By the next day, all of my nails had chips, and I had barely done anything!  </li>
            <li>I got the strip starter kit as a gift, and was not thrilled; I have not had good luck with the strips in the past!</li>
            <li>First of all, let me say that I am not one to ever get manicures at a salon because I&#x27;m so ashamed of how bad my hands look in general, but I&#x27;ve always envied the finished results of others who are able to have manis/pedis done -</li>
            <li>You have to have a steady hand to get these on straight, but they lasted at least 10 days for me.</li>
            <li>I love \\&quot;Wine Not\\&quot; color and usually I don&#x27;t wear bright or dark colors because they look so bad by day 2 or 3.  </li>
            <li>I like to fold them over the top of my nail, push down as hard as I can without bending my nail and pulling the rest off.</li>
            <li>The box that the product was packaged in was covered in nail polish and the nail strips were so old and dry that they would not even stick to my nails</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry completely either so even after an hour it still feels gummy.</li>
            <li>My nails were thin and split easily.</li>
            <li>Overall impression: Lasts slightly longer than a regular mani, but nothing like a real gel one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great gift Idea for the Gal on the go.</li>
            <li> I do, however, have great results and here&#x27;s how.</li>
            <li> still wearing my gel nails with no mishaps from 2 days ago, and they look great.  </li>
            <li> With the correct prep (buffing, cleaning, etc) the strips went on great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> It took some practice and getting used to but the product is very nice.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m still good to go!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The light colors work best.</li>
            <li> Loved the color that came with it.</li>
            <li> thought I would give these a try and was going to be super impressed if they made it through a couple of days of the abuse that living in my reality would put them through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the nail stickers/strips!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, I really really love them!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Looks nice while it lasts.</li>
            <li> My sister owns her own company and lives on the road.</li>
            <li> I work in the yard, work on my own car,</li>
            <li> After a week of debating whether or not I would use it, I decided to use it my own way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 3 days in with 6 kids (15-4yo) and a cheer coach/housewife (meaning lots of wear and tear on my hands between catching kids and dishes/laundry/cleaning, etc)</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m rather inept when it comes to doing my own nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice once watching on TV.</li>
            <li> Always good to have another bottle of top coat, always needed.</li>
            <li> I was super happy to get this as a gift-until I used it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They were very easy to apply, I had no problem getting them to stick to my nails</li>
            <li> I have had great success with the product.</li>
            <li> great first time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this kit.  </li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had smooth, shiny, glorious nails!</li>
            <li> They are fantastic!</li>
            <li> And I did what they said, I soaked with nail polish remover in foil for 5 minutes, then five minutes more,</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shopping around and have found the top coat for $5 on eBay.</li>
            <li> I love these things.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li> but I am glad I took a chance and bought this product.  </li>
            <li> I also made sure to use the cleansing pads before and after the application procedure.  </li>
            <li> Everything turned out fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product and plan on purchasing more in the future.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sold separately and really adds a great foundation to the nail.</li>
            <li> Then I add the top coat and cure for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the results for an at-home gel mani solution.</li>
            <li> I think the trick may be to make sure you get the gel painted over the edges of the strip.</li>
            <li> It probably costs more now.</li>
            <li> may be such that the gel color strips just adhere better than most, but I&#x27;m really impressed with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> apply gel top coat to each nail&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> The gel doesn&#x27;t thicken the way most gel does.  </li>
            <li> though that I could fix the problem by adding more of the polish</li>
            <li> Granted you can do at most 2 nails at a time, but it saved me from having to buy another starter kit.  </li>
            <li> so I was pleased about the LED.</li>
            <li> I love these strips and kit.</li>
            <li> I Love it</li>
            <li> being that I love Sally Hansen products</li>
            <li> You have to wipe them once more with the alcohol pad.</li>
            <li> so I got two nails out of most of the press on polishers.  </li>
            <li> I love these</li>
            <li> love doing my nails myself, I also love the durability and look of gel nails.</li>
            <li> Those tips plus this top coat has been my prettiest manicure ever.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit, for $27 btw, and am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I use nail strips regularly so I am pretty good at getting them on so applying them</li>
            <li> Still a pretty good performance in my opinion.</li>
            <li> the lady said that the gel alone was very good, so I tried it with regular polish.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying the LED light and the gel top coat, and that is all you need.</li>
            <li> Then I filed the tips of my nails to make sure the color strip was sealed and smooth around each nail tip.</li>
            <li> Going to the salon and paying more for a one time application justifys the one time investment in the UV light that comes in this kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was freaked out at the end because my nails where super sticky, but after reviewing the instructions one more time, I had forgotten about the cleaning with alcohol one more time (to get rid of the sticky residue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Quick and Easy!</li>
            <li> drawbacks to me are that the lamp breaks easily (</li>
            <li> It has been over a week and they are still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty good at putting them on my fingernails now, aligning them just right.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is just one defective product or they are all this cheaply made</li>
            <li> , I have some LED lights lying around, and a UV light for my indoor herb garden.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I tried LED lights and my garden UV light.</li>
            <li> Ahem, as it turns out, the light that comes with the kit is a LED UV light.</li>
            <li> The light worked well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of chipping at the cuticle edge, as well as around places where the strip didn&#x27;t go on completely smooth.</li>
            <li> I thought the gel topcoat and/or UV light were defective when my nails were tacky after curing.</li>
            <li> I also saw that one reviewer said she didn&#x27;t have luck with correcting chips by coating over it again with the gel and re-curing with the UV light, however I did just that</li>
            <li> By keeping an eye out for coupons and sales, this is a lot more reasonable and enjoyable for me than going to a salon.</li>
            <li> Purchase worth it for the light and top coat alone.</li>
            <li> The lamp works great and is small so it is even better for travel!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would recommend it, but go in knowing that you need to take your time on the first application, and don&#x27;t expect miracles!!  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed it very much.</li>
            <li> : Easy to do, especially if you aren&#x27;t good with clean lines.</li>
            <li> With a gel manicure I can go 2 weeks or more without even a chip, which is good for me since I really love having my nails &#x27;done&#x27; but I am not easy on  them.  </li>
            <li> I bought this kit exclusively for the LED light because it was on sale and such a good deal.</li>
            <li> Let it stand for 3-5min, and then wipe clean.</li>
            <li> (It says don&#x27;t let the gel polish touch your cuticle/skin, so take the time to clean it up if this happens.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to wait for anything to dry, which is great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1) trim, file, and clean nails well.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> so shiny &amp; clean around the edges.  </li>
            <li> really the gold in this kit is the light and the top coat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I can honestly say that they aren&#x27;t even worth that much...</li>
            <li> Good thing I only paid $8 compared to the retail price of almost $30.  </li>
            <li> The adage &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; is certainly true of this product.  </li>
            <li> &quot; and \\&quot;omg, i love it\\&quot; weren&#x27;t very helpful.</li>
            <li> I did use it with the non-gel strips, so maybe that was part of the reason it didn&#x27;t go 2 full weeks.</li>
            <li> Plus you can use other nail strips and normal polish for this which is awesome!</li>
            <li> So--where I didn&#x27;t, they chipped fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I think that&#x27;s probably because they don&#x27;t cure as quickly as the instructions say they do...</li>
            <li> I got impatient on my right hand (dominent hand) and struggled with the pulling to ensure a great fit; and the results showed it.  </li>
            <li> They tear fairly easily and if you accidentally take off too much</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this kit, and followed the directions EXACTLY.</li>
            <li> The resulting finish is strong and durable, more so than traditional nail</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the cheapest I have been able to find so far.</li>
            <li> It is worth noting that LED is far better than UV lights because it doesn&#x27;t emit harmful skin damaging/cancer causing waves.  </li>
            <li> And by the way, the starter kit (the kit that contains the red strips) does in fact come with its own mini LED lamp -</li>
            <li> I never got the strips laid right on my nails</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right, $3.00 for just the strips with the gel.</li>
            <li> you have to use the right</li>
            <li> very cheap and the polish RUBBED off almost as soon as it dryed --fun for a few minutes ( at most)</li>
            <li> My nails look wonderful a week and a half later.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to repair them by using my OPI top coat to restick the \\&quot;polish\\&quot; back to my nails, but it doesn&#x27;t look professional.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the same process except once you&#x27;re done fitting your nails with the strips you add a top coat of the gel and stick each individual finger under the light for 30 seconds, wipe with the alcohol cloth and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> I am a total klutz &amp; if I can easily apply these things, anybody can!  </li>
            <li> I was nervous at first because they felt tacky after 30 seconds under the light, but then I finished reading the instructions and that is normal.</li>
            <li> Love the other brush on gel polish I bought, even though it takes longer to do than the strips, and used the mini LED light with the polish.  </li>
            <li> 4 days old now and wearing just fine.  </li>
            <li> I followed directions prior to application of strips and then again to the letter when applying the gel top coat.</li>
            <li> I would have given them 3 stars (maybe even 4), but the lamp doesn&#x27;t stay on consistently.</li>
            <li> Hi, first, i would like to thank everyone who commented on the \\&quot;deets\\&quot; of the gel/curing process.</li>
            <li> eh, it was pretty once i put it on ....</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> I put off buying them at full price ($11.99 for the strip kit without the light), but when I saw them at a local store on clearance for $3 I picked up a set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> You only need regular nail polish, this gel top coat and the light!</li>
            <li> And for once in my life I have pretty nails.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the lamp get really hot and it burns the tops of my nails...</li>
            <li> I buffered, and cleansed my nails first.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m sure everyone has some regular rubbing alcohol in their house.</li>
            <li> The cleansing pads that the kit brings contains exactly that: rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> But I was interested in this cheaper, \\&quot;easier\\&quot; alternative to Shellac or OPI gel nails, and took the plunge today.</li>
            <li> I have used the regular nail strips for a while so adding the durability of gel was really appealing.</li>
            <li> I picked up this kit at a local store and came to Amazon to order more.  </li>
            <li> but I have included an image just so others could see that they turned out pretty well despite my clumsiness.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re cute to use from time to time, especially the patterned ones that I could never recreate on my nails otherwise, but</li>
            <li> I expect to make the 2 full weeks or longer before there is any need to even begin to consider a new manicure.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on this garbage, you&#x27;re probably better of saving your money for a more high end product.</li>
            <li> red the comments before buying the product and most people said they peel off easily, that is does not last a week.</li>
            <li> The trick is, I think, taking the time to make sure they are really stuck to your nails, and properly trimmed.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, the light works with other brand LED gel polishes.  </li>
            <li> I did however get alot of compliments, and my nails are super red and super duper</li>
            <li> This system seems easy enough...</li>
            <li> Was easy to do, took 30 minutes total.  </li>
            <li> you let your nails completely dry before attempting to do any chores you will be totally satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also buffed out and mashed the gel strip securely to each nail - almost like working the air bubbles out of wall paper - and used the file to mash it down securely all over the nail bed.</li>
            <li> You are better off getting a LED light that will fit more than 1 finger at a time (kit light only cures 1 finger at a time &#x3D; slow) and some actual gel polish/top coat/base coat from your local beauty supply</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen these last 10 days without chips though, and at the price it is at now I think is super worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also paired these with the Broadway Nails tips kit.</li>
            <li> They stay on for 1 and a half weeks but other than that I love them!:)</li>
            <li> In the future I plan to use pure acetone (I found it at Sally Beauty supply for $2.60 or something), make sure I use real cotton balls (or just soak in a glass bowl) and hope it goes a little better.</li>
            <li> great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just looking at the strips and polish, I have a feeling that I will just stick to using the whole kit for the lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easier to remove than a real gel manicure.</li>
            <li> I did not buy the whole starter kit, as I thought \\&quot;hey</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere online to see if these were sufficient lighting devices and found absolutely nothing, so I&#x27;m assuming that should have been my answer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> I really damaged my nails.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I spent more time fixing the mistakes I made.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions closely and made sure to rough up my nails to remove any shine on the tops of them.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy the whole set.</li>
            <li> within about five minutes of applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have followed the directions PRECISELY each time I&#x27;ve used this kit, but have had the same results every time.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> I bought the Sally Hansen Gel Insta strips (not the whole kit) because of the design</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I am not the most careful manicurist.</li>
            <li> I only got to use the led light twice</li>
            <li> Not so much as a teensy lift on any of them.</li>
            <li> Honestly this was the biggest waste of time.</li>
            <li> I am 100% pleased with this and won&#x27;t ever go back to the old method.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best thing next to getting a professional Gelish style manicure from the salon.  </li>
            <li> So I clean the nail with alcohol and add another top coat followed by at least 90 seconds of curing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m familiar with the non-gel Sally Hansen polish strips and have used them on several occassions.</li>
            <li> Since you can put them on top of each other, I might build a pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up from me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very careful, and had used the insta-strips before (again with pleased results), so I will say I knew what to expect.  </li>
            <li> I am secretly hoping I get a chip soon just because I want an excuse to take this color off and have another perfect looking, glossy color to look at!</li>
            <li> It did dry instantly and seemed to have a nice, glossy finish.</li>
            <li> After letting each coat dry COMPLETELY, I followed the instructions for this gel top coat and cured each nail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, even though they are cute and I do like the patterns available, these things are a total waste of time and money even at $3 a set.  </li>
            <li> If you get too close to the skin, nail bed or neglect to file down the top edge IT IS GOING TO CHIP.</li>
            <li> the top coat!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been marked down super cheap here and in stores because they&#x27;re replacing this with a much more expensive kit.</li>
            <li> I was ready for a new color anyway.</li>
            <li> Regular polish does not adhere to my nails well and doesn&#x27;t last more than a day or 2.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect much from it and was very surprised.</li>
            <li> Finished result is a high gloss polish strip.</li>
            <li> The tips are high quality but the gel + activator in that is basically garbage.</li>
            <li> Also the little light broke after the first use.</li>
            <li> You can file and smooth out any rough edges before applying the liquid gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A professional manicure gets banged up by me much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> CAN chip, even with a few top</li>
            <li> Normally I get gel manicures at the salon and wanted to start doing it at home.</li>
            <li> and I do a lot of things that would normally chip my polish.</li>
            <li> This might be more of a personal issue, but I actually find it easier to use a brush to apply color to my nails (even with my less dominant left hand) than to get these things on straight and without them touching my cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> did have some spots where the strip tore, so for those I just \\&quot;patched\\&quot; them with leftover from other nails - it worked just fine.  </li>
            <li> I will update as the days go on, but right now I am totally sold on this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As other have mentioned, use this for the light and</li>
            <li> I live on a ranch and care for 2 horses, 4 goats, 6 dogs and a husband.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s decent for a do-it-yourself version of a professional service.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and discovered several things...</li>
            <li> The nails peel off (completely!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually one to paint my nails</li>
            <li> At first I thought they weren&#x27;t drying, but you have to wipe off the extra gel with the pad.</li>
            <li> short, I just removed the first set yesterday because my nails had grown out, not because anything had come off.  </li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t open that second pack until you&#x27;re sure you need it, because onece opened they won&#x27;t last..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to attempt to use the top coat and the light on regular SH strips or standard polish to see if I get the same results for less money.</li>
            <li> My nails are growing out and the strips are still on even though you can see the new nail growth near my cuticles just like with the salon style manicures.  </li>
            <li> Also, the first time I did it, I wasn&#x27;t so careful about the getting the tabs really adhered to the nails all the way to the edges.  </li>
            <li> I buffed off as many of the ridges as possible, shaped my nail, and filed down all the roughness.</li>
            <li> even though there are 16 strips in the package (supposedly 8 different sizes), there are 8 that are pretty much the same size.  </li>
            <li> $28 covers only two sets and the light is for one finger at a time and takes about 12x of one of your fingers to have it dry.</li>
            <li> Not sure why you would buy this for $30 when you can go to a nail salon and pay $20-25 and get a real legit shellac manicure instead of having to do it yourself and having it peel off..not worth it!</li>
            <li> Made sure the color tabs were carefully pressed clear to the corners of each nail (don&#x27;t ignore a loose corner).  </li>
            <li> The first lasted a little more than two weeks, then they started peeling a little bit near the bottom of the nail where the new nail growth was showing.</li>
            <li> 3-4 days later, I did a third coat to cover my tips again because I hit them on everything (and enjoy tapping my fingernails on hard surfaces to hear the sound).</li>
            <li> You can fix the peeling by filing it a bit and applying another clear coat.</li>
            <li> The ones meant for your pinky MIGHT fit a child&#x27;s hand, but they are way too narrow to even consider for an adult hand.  </li>
            <li> Also had a smidge of the strip on my cutical (which is clearly a no-no)</li>
            <li> and I red the whole instructions</li>
            <li> Not messy.</li>
            <li> This is a real problem since you can only put one finger in at a time.</li>
            <li> However, the chipping (which isn&#x27;t terribly frequent) just is what it is.</li>
            <li> I applied an additional layer, because I felt like I&#x27;d come this far for just one coat of shine?</li>
            <li> The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars from me is because it doesn&#x27;t really work like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> For me, this lasts much longer than a standard polish job</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been giving myself all kinds of mani&#x27;s since i was 12 years old, so</li>
            <li> The next day five of my nails were very chipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cure them for a minute under the LED lamp (press twice; 2 sets of 30 seconds), and finally use some rubbing alcohol with a cotton ball and rub your nails gently with it.</li>
            <li> I have had gel nails done professionally and paid over $100 for both hands and feet about 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> and then it completely broke</li>
            <li> A bonus for my husband is there is no harsh smell.</li>
            <li> One teensy chip near cuticle of pinky.</li>
            <li> These are my natural nails.</li>
            <li> I must say I was surprised by the unflattering reviews.  </li>
            <li> and they dried in 30 seconds under the LED light.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking the whole kit back, and I expect a refund even though I used the darn thing.  </li>
            <li> This product is an at home kit, so of COURSE it&#x27;s not going to look like you had them professionally done.  </li>
            <li> It is a very, very, subtle amount of color, but good for a first try as no one other than you will notice the mistakes.</li>
            <li> when I pulled the chord out of the back for the first time, the recepticle broke and I had to take it back to the store for a new one.  </li>
            <li> After 4 hours I had 1 nail chip on my left hand and the next day another chip on my right hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;d be better off just getting a high end nail polish and using a base coat,then the nail polish and a top</li>
            <li> The color came out clear when the package shows a pretty pearly pink.  </li>
            <li> apply gel strips to each nail and use the provided wooden stick to smooth down edges&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> Noticed that on a few of them the strip covered the real nail completely and those were the 3 that peeled fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now tried four packs of them (light pink, tan tiger stripes, wine, and red) and had the same results with each.  </li>
            <li> So I just store the new one with the chord left in.  </li>
            <li> And the only reason I took them off is because my nails had grown out so much that I had regular nail showing from my cuticle.  </li>
            <li> By the third application and a total of 4 days, I was discussed and tossed the whole kit in the trash.  </li>
            <li> The others only fit so-so if your nails aren&#x27;t on the narrow side....</li>
            <li> Had a few nails start to peel quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this on clearance at a major drugstore chain.  </li>
            <li> have only had mine on for two days now, however I work in an office and do alot of typing - my nails have held up so far!  </li>
            <li> I also found the uv light not strong enough with one application and had to repeat 2 or 3 times.</li>
            <li> Had to repeat the light cycle a couple of times to make the gel hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tries it with dark colors, now I&#x27;ll try a light one.</li>
            <li> I find that if you tear them off carefully and have small nails, you can get one pack of strips (8) to do both hands.  </li>
            <li> A week later, I have no chips and it still looks glassy and truly professional.</li>
            <li> Almost instantly my nails began to peel off, and some of my nails came completely off.</li>
            <li> that you want the gel on a bit of bare nail on each side.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve always kept them completely bare all my life.  </li>
            <li> Like I mentioned before, I haven&#x27;t completely finished the entire process</li>
            <li> Therefore, the &amp;#34;gel manicure&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t much different than regular, normal nail polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so be careful attaching the black cord to the light.</li>
            <li> By the next day, all of my nails had chips, and I had barely done anything!  </li>
            <li> I got the strip starter kit as a gift, and was not thrilled; I have not had good luck with the strips in the past!</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say that I am not one to ever get manicures at a salon because I&#x27;m so ashamed of how bad my hands look in general, but I&#x27;ve always envied the finished results of others who are able to have manis/pedis done -</li>
            <li> You have to have a steady hand to get these on straight, but they lasted at least 10 days for me.</li>
            <li> I love \\&quot;Wine Not\\&quot; color and usually I don&#x27;t wear bright or dark colors because they look so bad by day 2 or 3.  </li>
            <li> I like to fold them over the top of my nail, push down as hard as I can without bending my nail and pulling the rest off.</li>
            <li> The box that the product was packaged in was covered in nail polish and the nail strips were so old and dry that they would not even stick to my nails</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry completely either so even after an hour it still feels gummy.</li>
            <li> My nails were thin and split easily.</li>
            <li> Overall impression: Lasts slightly longer than a regular mani, but nothing like a real gel one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> First nail started coming loose after just a few hours.  </li>
            <li> The other thing that I figured out when I applied one that was a little too small for the nail that I had put it on was that you can just put another on top of it before you apply the gel to cover any mistakes that you make.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even painted the clear coat over them &amp; had to stop to submit my review because I&#x27;m still just so shocked at how well they have turned out so far &amp; how easy it was to do.  </li>
            <li> I have small nails, and the sizes they give you are rather large for me.</li>
            <li> I came inside, found my first aid kit, pulled out an alcohol swab, (said another little prayer) and voila, the sticky stuff came off!!</li>
            <li> remove was a little tricky, as you need to soak a little cotton ball with plain acetone-based nail paint remover, put in on top of your nail and wrap it with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li> If your nails aren&#x27;t too long, you can actually use 1 strip on two nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me almost as long to do this as it does to do a regular gel mani.  </li>
            <li> I followed all the directions and within less than 24 hours three of my finger nails were completely peeled off.</li>
            <li> I say it lasted 5 days on the properly applied nails-not nearly long enough to warrant another try for me (someone who types and is active with crafts and such).</li>
            <li> When I say short, I mean it doesn&#x27;t stay on for the normal 30 second period.</li>
            <li> Well from the minute I started using it the light is faulty and flickers on and off unless I hold it in some weird position.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very helpful to watch the video and also to know that the strips are delicate so use care not to tear them when applying.</li>
            <li> lamp is for 1 to 2 fingers at a time and has a long cord to plug into the wall.</li>
            <li> Still a complete waste of money though.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I&#x27;ve never had long nails before</li>
            <li> so I opened the bottom and the chip fell out complete waste of time and money</li>
            <li> , I picked the lighter pink kit rather than the red one.  </li>
            <li> I will be using these for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit a long time ago (before Christmas) &amp; today I tried it.  </li>
            <li> The strips are strange sizes.</li>
            <li> It takes about as long to apply as it would if you let your nails dry well between coats, but you don&#x27;t have to worry about smudges when you are finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I agree that you want the strip slightly thinner than the nails as it becomes apparent</li>
            <li> it can only cure one nail at a time, unlike other typical LED nail lamps, but the kit is definitely all-inclusive which provides for the ultimate convenience.  </li>
            <li> Other nail strip brands, traditional nail polish, etc.</li>
            <li> clarify my review, I do have all of the other above stuff on hand</li>
            <li> My main problem with it was when it came time to remove the gel, I had to scrape so hard to get the stuff off</li>
            <li> 8: Slight, very slight wear on the tips of 4 nails, other than that no chips and as glossy as when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> and now I have raw finger tips/sides of finger tip near nails, and even under my nails.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had a manicure last two weeks, but that&#x27;s mostly because I have a bad habit of peeling off my polish.</li>
            <li> When I used the nail strips in this starter kit, they were so dry and non-pliable, I just threw them away.  </li>
            <li> Helps to dry and seal in the shine.</li>
            <li> :  Nails are completely dry when you are done.  </li>
            <li> the gel takes on to dry therefore leaving you with sticky finger nails.</li>
            <li> There is fuzz from my clothes stuck to the manicure at this point, and after a single load of laundry, I have two nails with chunks out of them already.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the majority of my issues with it are user inexperience, but it is a little disappointing to have a product with such a learning curve.  </li>
            <li> So just apply one layer of a good base ( I prefer clear ones), then paint your nails in the desired color (two or three layers), LET THEM DRY THOROUGHLY, and finally apply a THIN layer of the gel.</li>
            <li> If you get the gel strip onto your cuticle or don&#x27;t seal it down properly around the edges of your nail, air and moisture will get underneath the strip and it will peel.</li>
            <li> The next day after putting the top coat on, my fingers - side of nails skin, and even finger tips became real dry and felt numb!  </li>
            <li> have to wonder, from some of the negative reviews, if there may be inconsistencies with the product, depending on the color of the gel strips; if folks aren&#x27;t following the instructions exactly; or if the product doesn&#x27;t work on different types of nails?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very weak, short, brittle, and peeling nails.</li>
            <li> It chipped just a little on my index fingers, but it was not noticeable at simple view.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, a little honesty starting out-</li>
            <li> After wiping with an alcohol pad, they were completely hard and crystal clear like I had gone to the salon.</li>
            <li> I have used Sally Hansen nail strips for over a year now with absolutely NO issues.  </li>
            <li> I saw these I was curious if they worked as well and would be quicker.  </li>
            <li> It is money well spent.</li>
            <li> When finished my nail is shiny but not very durable.</li>
            <li> Careful application should take you almost 1 hour and 20 minutes, you cannot rush any of the steps.</li>
            <li> I have also found you have to be careful not to allow the liquid mixture get on your cuticles either before using the UV lamp; else, the excess with peel away with part of the color stip.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!!n  Will go back to Jamberry&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I would absolutely NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Filed off minimal tip wear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only wasteful if I choose to waste it.  </li>
            <li> I filed and cleaned my nails with simple alcohol before applying the base coat, followed by the strips and then the top coat.</li>
            <li> I used a regular base coat (I love Orly Rubberized Bonder) and two coats of one of my OPI polishes.</li>
            <li> They are starting to chip a little at the ends, but if they can make it through a week with me, I say WooHoo!</li>
            <li> just applied my second set of strips and am anxiously waiting to see what happens.  </li>
            <li> I would like to recommend this product, but cant fully do so, due to the quality of materials used to hold the LED lamp together.</li>
            <li> I disagree with the other reviews.</li>
            <li> and they were a total waste!</li>
            <li> heard another reviewer talk about how long they were and the &#x27;waste&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I cannot wait to try some other colors but with the way it is wearing, it may be another week.</li>
            <li> Just as well if not better in some cases than when I had Shellac done at a salon, where I had results similar to what others are describing about this</li>
            <li> I am very rough on my nails and have always wanted to try the gel manicure.  </li>
            <li> , I purchased the additional base coat (which is not included in the starter kit), and a cheap simple acetone (to take it off just in case).</li>
            <li> So after following the proper procedure for the strips, I applied a thin coat of gel topcoat.</li>
            <li> your nails are bounds to last at least 5 days to a week.</li>
            <li> Defiantly not worth $15 for 16 strips.</li>
            <li> It will likely peel off, however, if it is applied too thick, just like any gel.  </li>
            <li> I had to keep pressing them down.</li>
            <li> I found it helps to stretch and pull the gel strip down over the nail tip, like saran wrap.</li>
            <li> Almost imperceptible wear on the tips but other than that</li>
            <li> and my nails still look like I did them 5 minutes ago, and I am very hard on my nails and not careful about protecting them.</li>
            <li> Peels slightly about a week in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m worried my brute strength will tear them in half.</li>
            <li> So it is odd for me to have that experience.</li>
            <li> It took me less than an hour to do both hands.</li>
            <li> I imagine that I&#x27;ll have less of this with practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Painting with nail polish is less time and hassle, nail polish even dries faster than this gel.</li>
            <li> I applied another layer of gel topcoat (said a little prayer) and danced around on the deck for about a minute and a half in the blazing sun.</li>
            <li> Ofter reviewers complained about it not working correctly, but I used it on each finger for the directed amount of time and  the gel was completely dry.  </li>
            <li> I do think I put it on a little thicker than advised.  </li>
            <li> They also are a little bit cheaper than the gel version, which is a plus when buying them.</li>
            <li> I just used a little nail polish to fill in the chipped areas and added another coat of gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother, such a waste of time and money!!!</li>
            <li> I think perhaps they were somewhat dried out.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> The plug in the back of the lamp has broken.</li>
            <li> what a waste of time and money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> waste your time buying gel polishes or the strip refills.</li>
            <li> And no, it wasn&#x27;t my fault; I only used a thin layer of gel.</li>
            <li> Then I washed and dried my hands before applying the gel strips.</li>
            <li> but it was a complete fail.</li>
            <li> What a waste.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is a joke...don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read several of the reviews and it seems to me a lot of work is involved for poor results.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> They can stretch a little to cover the sides...but just a little!</li>
            <li> so I am not exactly easy on my hands/</li>
            <li> I bought this expensive little kit last week in the Shell</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my nails started peeling within minutes, and a few hours later, almost all of them have peeled or chipped.</li>
            <li> I washed my hands afterwards and noted they looked a little dull.</li>
            <li> It was very awkward trying to get the foil just right to keep the tightness.  </li>
            <li> It is a small bottle, but still has a lot in it after my three coats.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> (That&#x27;s why I usually pay someone to do my nails.)</li>
            <li> He usually hates it when I paint my nails in the living room.</li>
            <li> I have to blame part of the failure on myself, but the other part of the failure belongs to the product itself.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m constantly digging clay getting my hands dirty and messy everyday!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> First of all, I bought the base coat.</li>
            <li> They are difficult to apply and do not smooth down to the nail well at all.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> Moreover, I fail miserably at painting my own nails</li>
            <li> Then apply at least two coats of gel.</li>
            <li> The gel strips are thick and DO NOT apply neatly.  </li>
            <li> and some are so narrow that they won&#x27;t cover your nail (take your pick!!)  </li>
            <li> For me, this unfortunately was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> not a good look</li>
            <li> The end result is a rock hard nail!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very delicate</li>
            <li> I bought it because I was tired of doing my nails every 3 days.</li>
            <li> and it is broken.</li>
            <li> But, alas, while writing this review, they seem to have hardened and become shinier.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed in the LED lamp breaking after minimal usage.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was the product itself or due to the seller but this product was HORRIBLE!  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> I had tried the regular Salon Effects strip some time ago, and had a terrible result.  </li>
            <li> Fail!</li>
            <li> am I sorry!  </li>
            <li> These strips seemed impossible to apply correctly so they look like the ads look.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m suffering with raw fingers!!!!!</li>
            <li> It looks sloppy and nasty.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a gift, and was extremly disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> It was so disappointing!</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> that was very disappointing</li>
            <li> I hated it.  </li>
            <li> The result was a horrible lump.</li>
            <li> AWFUL.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When I used the nail strips in this starter kit, they were so dry and non-pliable, I just threw them away.  Is there a possibility for a refund?</li>
            <li> I bought this on clearance at a major drugstore chain.  I am very rough on my nails and have always wanted to try the gel manicure.  I LOVE this kit.  I use nail strips regularly so I am pretty good at getting them on so applying them went well. I followed directions prior to application of strips and then again to the letter when applying the gel top coat. I do think I put it on a little thicker than advised.  However, I had a perfect manicure until I took them off. And the only reason I took them off is because my nails had grown out so much that I had regular nail showing from my cuticle.  The shine lasted and only one almost invisible chip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, regarding the removal and the reason why I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  I hated it.  It took longer to take off then to put on. It was very awkward trying to get the foil just right to keep the tightness.  And I did not like the white skin around my nail caused by the acetone runoff from the cotton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just applied my second set of strips and am anxiously waiting to see what happens.  I had an awful time applying, and I am very experienced at this.  I think perhaps they were somewhat dried out.  We shall see.  I am hoping to get another 2 plus weeks out of this.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit exclusively for the LED light because it was on sale and such a good deal. Well from the minute I started using it the light is faulty and flickers on and off unless I hold it in some weird position. I don&#x27;t know if this is just one defective product or they are all this cheaply made but it&#x27;s pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this kit, and followed the directions EXACTLY. It did dry instantly and seemed to have a nice, glossy finish. By the next day, all of my nails had chips, and I had barely done anything!  Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> It took some practice and getting used to but the product is very nice. I have enjoyed it very much.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the lamp which works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just looking at the strips and polish, I have a feeling that I will just stick to using the whole kit for the lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lamp is for 1 to 2 fingers at a time and has a long cord to plug into the wall. Helps to dry and seal in the shine.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I was tired of doing my nails every 3 days. I got the kit and I red the whole instructions, I purchased the additional base coat (which is not included in the starter kit), and a cheap simple acetone (to take it off just in case). I filed and cleaned my nails with simple alcohol before applying the base coat, followed by the strips and then the top coat. I was freaked out at the end because my nails where super sticky, but after reviewing the instructions one more time, I had forgotten about the cleaning with alcohol one more time (to get rid of the sticky residue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I red the comments before buying the product and most people said they peel off easily, that is does not last a week. In my case it lasted 2 weeks!! without losing the shine. It chipped just a little on my index fingers, but it was not noticeable at simple view. I decided to remove it because my nails have grown and because two weeks was enough of having the same color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To remove was a little tricky, as you need to soak a little cotton ball with plain acetone-based nail paint remover, put in on top of your nail and wrap it with aluminum foil. Let it stand for 3-5min, and then wipe clean. The gel will come out entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a box of regular SH nail strips (not the gel nail strips), and I used them in my second manicure and it worked the same as the gel manicure. They also are a little bit cheaper than the gel version, which is a plus when buying them. I did not buy the SH gel remover solution or the cleaning pad, as they are the same as acetone nail paint remover and isopropyl alcohol.</li>
            <li> Overall impression: Lasts slightly longer than a regular mani, but nothing like a real gel one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy to do, especially if you aren&#x27;t good with clean lines. Looks nice while it lasts. Easier to remove than a real gel manicure. Not messy. Price. If your nails aren&#x27;t too long, you can actually use 1 strip on two nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: LED has a short and doesn&#x27;t stay on. When I say short, I mean it doesn&#x27;t stay on for the normal 30 second period. It goes on for 3 seconds, then flickers out. You restart it and it stays on for 5 seconds, etc. Peels slightly about a week in. CAN chip, even with a few top coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is an instance of \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot;. I would have given them 3 stars (maybe even 4), but the lamp doesn&#x27;t stay on consistently. This is a real problem since you can only put one finger in at a time. You can fix the peeling by filing it a bit and applying another clear coat. However, the chipping (which isn&#x27;t terribly frequent) just is what it is.</li>
            <li> Purchase this kit in May. It&#x27;s June and it is broken. Only used 3 times. The plug in the back of the lamp has broken. Really disappointed in the LED lamp breaking after minimal usage. I DO like the gel nail polish and the strips, but not the LED lamp. I would like to recommend this product, but cant fully do so, due to the quality of materials used to hold the LED lamp together.</li>
            <li> Great gift Idea for the Gal on the go. My sister owns her own company and lives on the road. She loves the portability of the item but we wished it came with some color polishes to &amp;#34;start you off&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t that the point of a starter kit?</li>
            <li> Followed directions to the T.  First nail started coming loose after just a few hours.  Redid all nails the next day.  Found a polish piece on the floor later that day and noticed that almost all of them were just popping off.  By the third application and a total of 4 days, I was discussed and tossed the whole kit in the trash.  Don&#x27;t bother, such a waste of time and money!!!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was the product itself or due to the seller but this product was HORRIBLE!  The box that the product was packaged in was covered in nail polish and the nail strips were so old and dry that they would not even stick to my nails AT ALL!  I had to throw it all away.  I have used Sally Hansen nail strips for over a year now with absolutely NO issues.  Good thing I only paid $8 compared to the retail price of almost $30.  Still a complete waste of money though.</li>
            <li> The adage &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; is certainly true of this product.  I opened the package to find they include 2 different gel strips set were sent, but each only had 8 strips.  WHAT??? What am I going to do with 8 painted nails and 2 unpainted nails?  These strips seemed impossible to apply correctly so they look like the ads look.  I never got the strips laid right on my nails, so I never got to use the lamp or the sealer that is included.  For me, this unfortunately was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Hi, first, i would like to thank everyone who commented on the \\&quot;deets\\&quot; of the gel/curing process. The \\&quot;it sucks\\&quot; and \\&quot;omg, i love it\\&quot; weren&#x27;t very helpful. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, a little honesty starting out- i bought the gel nail strips on clearance at Ulta. That&#x27;s right, $3.00 for just the strips with the gel. I did not buy the whole starter kit, as I thought \\&quot;hey, I have some LED lights lying around, and a UV light for my indoor herb garden.\\&quot; Like I said, don&#x27;t judge me. I looked everywhere online to see if these were sufficient lighting devices and found absolutely nothing, so I&#x27;m assuming that should have been my answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So last night, I decided I would give these a try. I love the nail stickers/strips! I buy them up when i can find them on sale (currently have about 6 of them on my desk). I&#x27;m pretty good at putting them on my fingernails now, aligning them just right. I know the directions say to pull them into place, but I never do that. I&#x27;m worried my brute strength will tear them in half. I have small nails, and the sizes they give you are rather large for me. I like to fold them over the top of my nail, push down as hard as I can without bending my nail and pulling the rest off. So after following the proper procedure for the strips, I applied a thin coat of gel topcoat. I tried LED lights and my garden UV light. Ahem, as it turns out, the light that comes with the kit is a LED UV light. I tried to use this \\&quot;technique\\&quot; on and off for about ...3 hours. Fail! Yeah, so don&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then today, I saw in some reviews that you could actually get some sun on them, and they will cure that way. Perfect! I applied another layer of gel topcoat (said a little prayer) and danced around on the deck for about a minute and a half in the blazing sun. I came inside, found my first aid kit, pulled out an alcohol swab, (said another little prayer) and voila, the sticky stuff came off!! I had smooth, shiny, glorious nails! I applied an additional layer, because I felt like I&#x27;d come this far for just one coat of shine? Ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I really really love them! I washed my hands afterwards and noted they looked a little dull. But, alas, while writing this review, they seem to have hardened and become shinier. They are fantastic! I rated them only 4 stars, though, because I&#x27;m scared of the removal process. I feel like I&#x27;ll need to break out the gas mask to avoid the fumigation of the acetone on cotton with aluminum foil? Reminds me of sitting under the hair dryer at the salon with foils in your hair. Haha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for the tips, folks!</li>
            <li> Quick and Easy! I love it!</li>
            <li> eh, it was pretty once i put it on .... but then after about 4 hours it was peeling off.</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> I did use it with the non-gel strips, so maybe that was part of the reason it didn&#x27;t go 2 full weeks. Still a pretty good performance in my opinion. My main problem with it was when it came time to remove the gel, I had to scrape so hard to get the stuff off I really damaged my nails. My nails are like steel, they don&#x27;t break, don&#x27;t bend. So it is odd for me to have that experience. And I did what they said, I soaked with nail polish remover in foil for 5 minutes, then five minutes more, then five minutes AGAIN! I was out of cotton balls, so I used paper towel pieces. In the future I plan to use pure acetone (I found it at Sally Beauty supply for $2.60 or something), make sure I use real cotton balls (or just soak in a glass bowl) and hope it goes a little better. I would probably buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have been doing gel manicures myself at home for a couple of years now and I love it.  Regular polish does not adhere to my nails well and doesn&#x27;t last more than a day or 2.  With a gel manicure I can go 2 weeks or more without even a chip, which is good for me since I really love having my nails &#x27;done&#x27; but I am not easy on  them.  I work in the yard, work on my own car, am the handyman for my household, and take care of a disable room-mate...so I am not exactly easy on my hands/nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw these I was curious if they worked as well and would be quicker.  I put off buying them at full price ($11.99 for the strip kit without the light), but when I saw them at a local store on clearance for $3 I picked up a set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I can honestly say that they aren&#x27;t even worth that much...what a waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;It took me almost as long to do this as it does to do a regular gel mani.  I followed the directions exactly and discovered several things...&lt;br /&gt;1) even though there are 16 strips in the package (supposedly 8 different sizes), there are 8 that are pretty much the same size.  The ones meant for your pinky MIGHT fit a child&#x27;s hand, but they are way too narrow to even consider for an adult hand.  The others only fit so-so if your nails aren&#x27;t on the narrow side....meaning, if you have normal-larger hands.nailbeds you can expect to have your nails showing on the sides of the color strip.&lt;br /&gt;2) This might be more of a personal issue, but I actually find it easier to use a brush to apply color to my nails (even with my less dominant left hand) than to get these things on straight and without them touching my cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;3) Trying to &#x27;trim&#x27; them is a trick in itself.  They tear fairly easily and if you accidentally take off too much it ends up looking like your polish is chipped, unless you have another strip that fits your nail that you can replace it with.&lt;br /&gt;4) Normally a regular manicure might last 2 days on me.  A gel manicure last 2+ weeks.&lt;br /&gt;These started to peel within 2 hours, and I didn&#x27;t even wash my hands or do anything in the time.  I was just sitting on the couch watching a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, even though they are cute and I do like the patterns available, these things are a total waste of time and money even at $3 a set.  I will keep doing my regular gel manis at home and go to the salon if I want a design done once in a while.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying the LED light and the gel top coat, and that is all you need. I got the strip starter kit as a gift, and was not thrilled; I have not had good luck with the strips in the past! After a week of debating whether or not I would use it, I decided to use it my own way. I used a regular base coat (I love Orly Rubberized Bonder) and two coats of one of my OPI polishes. After letting each coat dry COMPLETELY, I followed the instructions for this gel top coat and cured each nail. I was nervous at first because they felt tacky after 30 seconds under the light, but then I finished reading the instructions and that is normal. After wiping with an alcohol pad, they were completely hard and crystal clear like I had gone to the salon. I did a second coat so I could close in the tips to save my nails from chipping. 3-4 days later, I did a third coat to cover my tips again because I hit them on everything (and enjoy tapping my fingernails on hard surfaces to hear the sound). A week later, I have no chips and it still looks glassy and truly professional. Definitely follow the directions, and I don&#x27;t see why you should have any problems. (It says don&#x27;t let the gel polish touch your cuticle/skin, so take the time to clean it up if this happens. Otherwise it won&#x27;t seal to your nail.)&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time buying gel polishes or the strip refills. You only need regular nail polish, this gel top coat and the light! I&#x27;ve been shopping around and have found the top coat for $5 on eBay. That&#x27;s the cheapest I have been able to find so far. It is a small bottle, but still has a lot in it after my three coats. I am secretly hoping I get a chip soon just because I want an excuse to take this color off and have another perfect looking, glossy color to look at! It is money well spent.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t even give it one star!  I have had Gel done at the Saloon before with no problem.  Then I tried this product and boy am I sorry!  The next day after putting the top coat on, my fingers - side of nails skin, and even finger tips became real dry and felt numb!  The next day they cracked and started to peel and now I have raw finger tips/sides of finger tip near nails, and even under my nails.  I have never had an allergy before - if that is it!  But I will never buy it again since now I&#x27;m suffering with raw fingers!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works really well. Didn&#x27;t expect much from it and was very surprised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second set. The first lasted a little more than two weeks, then they started peeling a little bit near the bottom of the nail where the new nail growth was showing. I was ready for a new color anyway. I bought these because I&#x27;ve never had long nails before so I have had no practice painting my nails. The times I tried polishing my nails were a disaster. I spent more time fixing the mistakes I made.  I&#x27;ve had maybe 6 manicures in my life. My nails were thin and split easily. Then I get thyroid problems and I lose 30 lbs. and my nails start growing! They still split though so I decided to try these to protect my nails. They&#x27;ve worked like a charm. I haven&#x27;t cracked or split a nail since. And for once in my life I have pretty nails. I love these things.</li>
            <li> Works well ....Sometimes the lamp get really hot and it burns the tops of my nails...Plus you can use other nail strips and normal polish for this which is awesome!</li>
            <li> Had to repeat the light cycle a couple of times to make the gel hard. Totally peeled off within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> They work great! They stay on for 1 and a half weeks but other than that I love them!:)</li>
            <li> This kit works great!  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but I am glad I took a chance and bought this product.  I followed the instructions closely and made sure to rough up my nails to remove any shine on the tops of them.  I also made sure to use the cleansing pads before and after the application procedure.  Everything turned out fantastic!  It has been over a week and they are still going strong.  My nails are growing out and the strips are still on even though you can see the new nail growth near my cuticles just like with the salon style manicures.  I am very impressed with this product and plan on purchasing more in the future.  This is seriously the best thing next to getting a professional Gelish style manicure from the salon.  I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product. The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars from me is because it doesn&#x27;t really work like it&#x27;s supposed to. I do, however, have great results and here&#x27;s how. First of all, I bought the base coat. It&#x27;s sold separately and really adds a great foundation to the nail. After applying that I add anything I want. Other nail strip brands, traditional nail polish, etc. Then I add the top coat and cure for 30 seconds. When finished my nail is shiny but not very durable. So I clean the nail with alcohol and add another top coat followed by at least 90 seconds of curing. The end result is a rock hard nail! I&#x27;m a mom of 4 so I use my hands a lot cleaning, cooking, bathing kids, but this week I tested it while on vacation. It withstood days of swimming and tubing in the lake, hard-core arcade gaming, and two days at an amusement park! Needless to say, I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m familiar with the non-gel Sally Hansen polish strips and have used them on several occassions. This is exactly the same process except once you&#x27;re done fitting your nails with the strips you add a top coat of the gel and stick each individual finger under the light for 30 seconds, wipe with the alcohol cloth and you&#x27;re done. Finished result is a high gloss polish strip. I&#x27;ve had a lot of practice with those things and my application is never quite perfect. If you get too close to the skin, nail bed or neglect to file down the top edge IT IS GOING TO CHIP. Careful application should take you almost 1 hour and 20 minutes, you cannot rush any of the steps. For me, this lasts much longer than a standard polish job and you don&#x27;t have to wait for anything to dry, which is great. I&#x27;m going to attempt to use the top coat and the light on regular SH strips or standard polish to see if I get the same results for less money. I&#x27;m satisfied with the results for an at-home gel mani solution.</li>
            <li> The strips don&#x27;t stick to the nails. And yes. I buffered, and cleansed my nails first. I&#x27;ve been giving myself all kinds of mani&#x27;s since i was 12 years old, so I don&#x27;t think it was my fault this didn&#x27;t work. I tried warming the strips after they wouldn&#x27;t stick, but it didn&#x27;t work. I had to keep pressing them down. Then I added the gel and cured. The result was a horrible lump. And no, it wasn&#x27;t my fault; I only used a thin layer of gel. It was a waste of time and money! Whithin an hour my nails were chipping. The next day five of my nails were very chipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT!!! I found another review were the lady said that the gel alone was very good, so I tried it with regular polish. Tada!!!! Don&#x27;t buy the whole set. Just the lamp and the gel. I believe some stores sell these separately. And I&#x27;m sure everyone has some regular rubbing alcohol in their house. The cleansing pads that the kit brings contains exactly that: rubbing alcohol. So just apply one layer of a good base ( I prefer clear ones), then paint your nails in the desired color (two or three layers), LET THEM DRY THOROUGHLY, and finally apply a THIN layer of the gel. Cure them for a minute under the LED lamp (press twice; 2 sets of 30 seconds), and finally use some rubbing alcohol with a cotton ball and rub your nails gently with it. THERE YOU GO!!! your nails are bounds to last at least 5 days to a week. Some people claim they last up to 2 weeks. I&#x27;ve tries it with dark colors, now I&#x27;ll try a light one. I&#x27;ll keep updating!</li>
            <li> Had a few nails start to peel quickly. I think the trick may be to make sure you get the gel painted over the edges of the strip. Noticed that on a few of them the strip covered the real nail completely and those were the 3 that peeled fast. Redid those and allowed the gel to adhere to the actual nail. I&#x27;m 3 days in with 6 kids (15-4yo) and a cheer coach/housewife (meaning lots of wear and tear on my hands between catching kids and dishes/laundry/cleaning, etc) and I&#x27;m still good to go!&lt;br /&gt;I used the pinkish color and added strips of white tip I found from another company followed by the gel.</li>
            <li> great first time. I was about to use again and my lamp didnt turn on so I opened the bottom and the chip fell out complete waste of time and money</li>
            <li> I disagree with the other reviews. I have had great success with the product. I have \\&quot;done\\&quot; manicured nails for 10 days. I do the manicures in about 20 minutes. The light colors work best. Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit 2 nights ago locally. I have had gel nails done professionally and paid over $100 for both hands and feet about 2 years ago. It probably costs more now. I&#x27;m an accountant by profession and nails just aren&#x27;t conducive to using a calculator at lightening speed. So, I&#x27;m rather inept when it comes to doing my own nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to wonder, from some of the negative reviews, if there may be inconsistencies with the product, depending on the color of the gel strips; if folks aren&#x27;t following the instructions exactly; or if the product doesn&#x27;t work on different types of nails?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very weak, short, brittle, and peeling nails. I buffed off as many of the ridges as possible, shaped my nail, and filed down all the roughness. Then I washed and dried my hands before applying the gel strips. If you get the gel strip onto your cuticle or don&#x27;t seal it down properly around the edges of your nail, air and moisture will get underneath the strip and it will peel. I also buffed out and mashed the gel strip securely to each nail - almost like working the air bubbles out of wall paper - and used the file to mash it down securely all over the nail bed. Then I filed the tips of my nails to make sure the color strip was sealed and smooth around each nail tip. I have also found you have to be careful not to allow the liquid mixture get on your cuticles either before using the UV lamp; else, the excess with peel away with part of the color stip. It took me less than an hour to do both hands. I found it helps to stretch and pull the gel strip down over the nail tip, like saran wrap. You can file and smooth out any rough edges before applying the liquid gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still wearing my gel nails with no mishaps from 2 days ago, and they look great.  It may have been beginner&#x27;s luck or the condition of my nails may be such that the gel color strips just adhere better than most, but I&#x27;m really impressed with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This system seems easy enough...&lt;br /&gt;1) trim, file, and clean nails well.&lt;br /&gt;2) apply gel strips to each nail and use the provided wooden stick to smooth down edges&lt;br /&gt;3) apply gel top coat to each nail&lt;br /&gt;4) cure each nail under mini-LED lamp&lt;br /&gt;5) cleanse each nail with the provided cleansing pads (which are just isopropyl alcohol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it isn&#x27;t that easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The gel strips are thick and DO NOT apply neatly.  I&#x27;ve now tried four packs of them (light pink, tan tiger stripes, wine, and red) and had the same results with each.  They are difficult to apply and do not smooth down to the nail well at all.&lt;br /&gt;2) The gel doesn&#x27;t thicken the way most gel does.  Therefore, the &amp;#34;gel manicure&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t much different than regular, normal nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;3) The nails peel off (completely!) within about five minutes of applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have followed the directions PRECISELY each time I&#x27;ve used this kit, but have had the same results every time.  I do not believe this is user error; I believe that this is a faulty product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very helpful to watch the video and also to know that the strips are delicate so use care not to tear them when applying. I also found the uv light not strong enough with one application and had to repeat 2 or 3 times. Also the little light broke after the first use. It&#x27;s very delicate so be careful attaching the black cord to the light.</li>
            <li> Not sure why you would buy this for $30 when you can go to a nail salon and pay $20-25 and get a real legit shellac manicure instead of having to do it yourself and having it peel off..not worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually one to paint my nails becuase I find it too time consuming.  However, with the promise of the gel nails lasting two weeks, I decided to give this kit a shot.  My results were a bit of a mixed bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Nails are completely dry when you are done.  I started typing and knitting immediately after I was finished and didn&#x27;t have any smudges.  The light worked well.  Ofter reviewers complained about it not working correctly, but I used it on each finger for the directed amount of time and  the gel was completely dry.  The resulting finish is strong and durable, more so than traditional nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  My biggest issue with the kit is the gel strip color application.  I&#x27;m sure the majority of my issues with it are user inexperience, but it is a little disappointing to have a product with such a learning curve.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of chipping at the cuticle edge, as well as around places where the strip didn&#x27;t go on completely smooth. I imagine that I&#x27;ll have less of this with practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s decent for a do-it-yourself version of a professional service.  It takes about as long to apply as it would if you let your nails dry well between coats, but you don&#x27;t have to worry about smudges when you are finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I picked the lighter pink kit rather than the red one.  It is a very, very, subtle amount of color, but good for a first try as no one other than you will notice the mistakes.</li>
            <li> Honestly this was the biggest waste of time. I got this product as a gift, and was extremly disappointed with the results. Almost instantly my nails began to peel off, and some of my nails came completely off. I though that I could fix the problem by adding more of the polish but it was a complete fail. Don&#x27;t waste your time on this garbage, you&#x27;re probably better of saving your money for a more high end product.</li>
            <li> Absolute waste of money.  After following all the instructions, the strips just rippled and peeled off within an hour.  What a waste.  Fortunately, the light works with other brand LED gel polishes.  Granted you can do at most 2 nails at a time, but it saved me from having to buy another starter kit.  Love the other brush on gel polish I bought, even though it takes longer to do than the strips, and used the mini LED light with the polish.  It is worth noting that LED is far better than UV lights because it doesn&#x27;t emit harmful skin damaging/cancer causing waves.  UV lights always made me nervous about aging my hands prematurely so I was pleased about the LED.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product. Normally I get gel manicures at the salon and wanted to start doing it at home. I bought the Sally Hansen Gel Insta strips (not the whole kit) because of the design and they were a total waste! You are better off getting a LED light that will fit more than 1 finger at a time (kit light only cures 1 finger at a time &#x3D; slow) and some actual gel polish/top coat/base coat from your local beauty supply store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clarify my review, I do have all of the other above stuff on hand so I know how to use the strips properly. After 4 hours I had 1 nail chip on my left hand and the next day another chip on my right hand. It was so disappointing!</li>
            <li> Nice once watching on TV. the gel takes on to dry therefore leaving you with sticky finger nails. not a good look</li>
            <li> Strips didn&#x27;t even stay on a day.  Waste of money!!!n  Will go back to Jamberry&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I love these strips and kit. I have worn the wine not for 12 days strait with out one popping off and I do a lot of things that would normally chip my polish.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it zero stars. It peeled within 20 minutes, and I followed the directions to the letter. So disappointed. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a gift from my co worker. I was super happy to get this as a gift-until I used it. I followed all the directions and within less than 24 hours three of my finger nails were completely peeled off. I couldn&#x27;t even scratch myself without it peeling up. Even though I got this as a gift I bought a different color. Defiantly not worth $15 for 16 strips. Painting with nail polish is less time and hassle, nail polish even dries faster than this gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I am not the most careful manicurist. (That&#x27;s why I usually pay someone to do my nails.) But I was interested in this cheaper, \\&quot;easier\\&quot; alternative to Shellac or OPI gel nails, and took the plunge today. Unfortunately, my nails started peeling within minutes, and a few hours later, almost all of them have peeled or chipped. I tried repairing them with the gel polish and resetting them, but it didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve been able to repair them by using my OPI top coat to restick the \\&quot;polish\\&quot; back to my nails, but it doesn&#x27;t look professional. It looks sloppy and nasty. I would absolutely NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had tried the regular Salon Effects strip some time ago, and had a terrible result.  But on a whim, I picked this kit up at Ulta (for $30, btw).  It took two hours, but my nails are beautiful!  The trick is, I think, taking the time to make sure they are really stuck to your nails, and properly trimmed.  I will keep using!</li>
            <li> I have to blame part of the failure on myself, but the other part of the failure belongs to the product itself.  I got impatient on my right hand (dominent hand) and struggled with the pulling to ensure a great fit; and the results showed it.  Also had a smidge of the strip on my cutical (which is clearly a no-no) and it lifted off my nail a bit.  I say it lasted 5 days on the properly applied nails-not nearly long enough to warrant another try for me (someone who types and is active with crafts and such).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!! I have a ceramics class and I&#x27;m constantly digging clay getting my hands dirty and messy everyday! The paint stayed on and I was very pleased! I Love it and I&#x27;ll keep buying the gel strips! Great buy!</li>
            <li> I only got to use the led light twice and then it completely broke that was very disappointing being that I love Sally Hansen products but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have used the regular nail strips for a while so adding the durability of gel was really appealing. With the correct prep (buffing, cleaning, etc) the strips went on great. I thought the gel topcoat and/or UV light were defective when my nails were tacky after curing. Only then did I pay close attention to the directions! You have to wipe them once more with the alcohol pad. The pad dried out too fast for me, so I just put some alcohol on a cotton ball I had at home to finish - just like at the salon. By keeping an eye out for coupons and sales, this is a lot more reasonable and enjoyable for me than going to a salon. A bonus for my husband is there is no harsh smell. He usually hates it when I paint my nails in the living room.</li>
            <li> I saw reviews saying this was a wonderful product and reviews saying it was a rip off. I am in the wonderful category. Day 4 and my nails still look like I did them 5 minutes ago, and I am very hard on my nails and not careful about protecting them. Not so much as a teensy lift on any of them. I agree that you want the strip slightly thinner than the nails as it becomes apparent that you want the gel on a bit of bare nail on each side. I think that is the key. Also, keep the gel top coat thin!  I love \\&quot;Wine Not\\&quot; color and usually I don&#x27;t wear bright or dark colors because they look so bad by day 2 or 3.  I will update as the days go on, but right now I am totally sold on this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Day 5 and after cleaning all cupboards and moving boxes and extensive cleaning. Almost imperceptible wear on the tips but other than that, it is still literally perfect. Not one chip, no lifting anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 8: Slight, very slight wear on the tips of 4 nails, other than that no chips and as glossy as when I first put it on. Beyond impressed and I have done all sorts of things that would have previously totally trashed red nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 11: One teensy chip on side of one index finger. One teensy chip near cuticle of pinky. Filed off minimal tip wear. Still as glossy as day one. I expect to make the 2 full weeks or longer before there is any need to even begin to consider a new manicure. I am 100% pleased with this and won&#x27;t ever go back to the old method. My nails also feel thicker and stronger than ever. Good protection from breaking! These are my natural nails.</li>
            <li> I picked up this kit at a local store and came to Amazon to order more.  I must say I was surprised by the unflattering reviews.  I live on a ranch and care for 2 horses, 4 goats, 6 dogs and a husband. I am banging away on a computer keyboard 12-15 hours a day and I refuse to alter the way I move through my world so I don&#x27;t chip my nails or my polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would give these a try and was going to be super impressed if they made it through a couple of days of the abuse that living in my reality would put them through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were very easy to apply, I had no problem getting them to stick to my nails and they dried in 30 seconds under the LED light.  At first I thought they weren&#x27;t drying, but you have to wipe off the extra gel with the pad. My nails look wonderful a week and a half later.  They are starting to chip a little at the ends, but if they can make it through a week with me, I say WooHoo! A professional manicure gets banged up by me much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard another reviewer talk about how long they were and the &#x27;waste&#x27;.  I just took the extra and put it on another nail so I got two nails out of most of the press on polishers.  It&#x27;s only wasteful if I choose to waste it.  I love these and I am so thankful that I tried them. The other thing that I figured out when I applied one that was a little too small for the nail that I had put it on was that you can just put another on top of it before you apply the gel to cover any mistakes that you make.  I wish they made them for my toes.  Since you can put them on top of each other, I might build a pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up from me.  I will be using these for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Was easy to do, took 30 minutes total.  4 days old now and wearing just fine.  It will likely peel off, however, if it is applied too thick, just like any gel.  I cannot wait to try some other colors but with the way it is wearing, it may be another week.</li>
            <li> Purchase worth it for the light and top coat alone. Used the strips but was not too impressed. The lamp works great and is small so it is even better for travel! Always good to have another bottle of top coat, always needed.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to the letter and my nails were chipping and peeling within 8 hours.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say that I am not one to ever get manicures at a salon because I&#x27;m so ashamed of how bad my hands look in general, but I&#x27;ve always envied the finished results of others who are able to have manis/pedis done - so shiny &amp; clean around the edges.  Moreover, I fail miserably at painting my own nails so I&#x27;ve always kept them completely bare all my life.  I purchased this kit a long time ago (before Christmas) &amp; today I tried it.  I am totally amazed!  I haven&#x27;t even painted the clear coat over them &amp; had to stop to submit my review because I&#x27;m still just so shocked at how well they have turned out so far &amp; how easy it was to do.  I am a total klutz &amp; if I can easily apply these things, anybody can!  And by the way, the starter kit (the kit that contains the red strips) does in fact come with its own mini LED lamp - it can only cure one nail at a time, unlike other typical LED nail lamps, but the kit is definitely all-inclusive which provides for the ultimate convenience.  Like I mentioned before, I haven&#x27;t completely finished the entire process but I have included an image just so others could see that they turned out pretty well despite my clumsiness.</li>
            <li> As other have mentioned, use this for the light and the top coat!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been marked down super cheap here and in stores because they&#x27;re replacing this with a much more expensive kit. This is an affordable at home gel manicure starter kit: get it!&lt;br /&gt;I have the strips and they&#x27;re cute to use from time to time, especially the patterned ones that I could never recreate on my nails otherwise, but really the gold in this kit is the light and the top coat.&lt;br /&gt;I love doing my nails myself, I also love the durability and look of gel nails. This is perfect for me. I have tried using both gel and regular polishes for the color and each have worked great.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had a manicure last two weeks, but that&#x27;s mostly because I have a bad habit of peeling off my polish. I&#x27;ve seen these last 10 days without chips though, and at the price it is at now I think is super worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also paired these with the Broadway Nails tips kit. The tips are high quality but the gel + activator in that is basically garbage. Those tips plus this top coat has been my prettiest manicure ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second batch of nails now.  Am not going to repeat all the instructions others have.  Here is what worked for me:  Made sure the color tabs were carefully pressed clear to the corners of each nail (don&#x27;t ignore a loose corner).  Then apply at least two coats of gel. I actually ended up adding a third coat a week later to enhance the shine for another week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also discovered that if you don&#x27;t feel like putting your nails under the lamp one at a time, you can simply walk outside, find a sunny place, face your nails to the sun and your nails will set all at once.  Of course, this doesn&#x27;t work on a cloudy or partly cloudy day.  I tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawbacks to me are that the lamp breaks easily (when I pulled the chord out of the back for the first time, the recepticle broke and I had to take it back to the store for a new one.  Well--what do I expect for about $30?  So I just store the new one with the chord left in.  Also, the first time I did it, I wasn&#x27;t so careful about the getting the tabs really adhered to the nails all the way to the edges.  So--where I didn&#x27;t, they chipped fairly quickly.  I just used a little nail polish to fill in the chipped areas and added another coat of gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long/short, I just removed the first set yesterday because my nails had grown out, not because anything had come off.  I&#x27;m very happy. I&#x27;m much more content doing my nails at home than having to go somewhere and get bored while my nails are getting done.</li>
            <li> I bought this expensive little kit last week in the Shell We Dance shade.  I applied it this evening and followed the directions TO THE LETTER.  The color came out clear when the package shows a pretty pearly pink.  The strips are strange sizes. Some are so big that there is excess hanging over the sides of the nail and some are so narrow that they won&#x27;t cover your nail (take your pick!!)  They also aren&#x27;t shiny at all and I think that&#x27;s probably because they don&#x27;t cure as quickly as the instructions say they do...so I went about my evening and promptly rubbed the shine off.  There is fuzz from my clothes stuck to the manicure at this point, and after a single load of laundry, I have two nails with chunks out of them already.  This is a joke...don&#x27;t waste your money.  I&#x27;m taking the whole kit back, and I expect a refund even though I used the darn thing.  AWFUL.</li>
            <li> very cheap and the polish RUBBED off almost as soon as it dryed --fun for a few minutes ( at most) the color and designs DID NOT last</li>
            <li> Loved the color that came with it. Personally I would like a lamp that didn&#x27;t have a cord. But its a great starter kit! I do like the Sally Hansen brand over others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to say this product has a lot of shortcomings.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;d be better off just getting a high end nail polish and using a base coat,then the nail polish and a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;If you let your nails completely dry before attempting to do any chores you will be totally satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I use this method and guess what my nails usually last for about 10 days before they begin to chip.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheaper and the results are the same if done properly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read several of the reviews and it seems to me a lot of work is involved for poor results.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit, for $27 btw, and am pleased with the results.  Going to the salon and paying more for a one time application justifys the one time investment in the UV light that comes in this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very careful, and had used the insta-strips before (again with pleased results), so I will say I knew what to expect.  I find that if you tear them off carefully and have small nails, you can get one pack of strips (8) to do both hands.  So don&#x27;t open that second pack until you&#x27;re sure you need it, because onece opened they won&#x27;t last..you have to use the right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have some spots where the strip tore, so for those I just \\&quot;patched\\&quot; them with leftover from other nails - it worked just fine.  I also saw that one reviewer said she didn&#x27;t have luck with correcting chips by coating over it again with the gel and re-curing with the UV light, however I did just that and it worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had mine on for two days now, however I work in an office and do alot of typing - my nails have held up so far!  Just as well if not better in some cases than when I had Shellac done at a salon, where I had results similar to what others are describing about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend it, but go in knowing that you need to take your time on the first application, and don&#x27;t expect miracles!!  This product is an at home kit, so of COURSE it&#x27;s not going to look like you had them professionally done.  I did however get alot of compliments, and my nails are super red and super duper shiny!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happer.</li>
            <li> You have to have a steady hand to get these on straight, but they lasted at least 10 days for me. They can stretch a little to cover the sides...but just a little! Very easy to tear! Every time I wear these I get compliments on my nails.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money. $28 covers only two sets and the light is for one finger at a time and takes about 12x of one of your fingers to have it dry. It doesn&#x27;t dry completely either so even after an hour it still feels gummy.</li>
