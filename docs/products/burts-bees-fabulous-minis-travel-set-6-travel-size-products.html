            <li>I have been using their products for about twenty years now and with the exception of the hand cream, I have been purchasing and using all these products with excellent results and have never had an allergic reaction to any of them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an excellent way to try new-to-you products from Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>

            <li>The best thing in this was the Hand Cream.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>As for the hand cream, it is very good and comparable to the Shea butter hand cream I already use daily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are very good products</li>
            <li>/&gt;This wasn&#x27;t my ideal set</li>

            <li>This did a great job of healing.</li>
            <li>Nice product happy to recommend.</li>
            <li>Great set, nice sized bottles.</li>
            <li>I think they are each fantastic, and together they make a perfect travel kit with everything you need.</li>
            <li>These would also be good for traveling.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect way to test a variety of the beloved Burt&#x27;s Bees products without investing in full size versions.</li>
            <li>I was pretty impressed when I received this Gift Set and knew it would be great to try them out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to try them out and see what best suits you.  </li>
            <li>the body lotion is great even for our daughters who have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good travel kit that is sized perfectly for you to take in your hand carry.  </li>
            <li>It works out very good for my daughter who has mild eczema.</li>
            <li>The hand repair cream has an amazing scent.</li>
            <li>The Shea lotion for the hands is really hydrating, it&#x27;s really wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It was a nice sampler</li>
            <li>I liked it a lot as I did the Cream cleanser.</li>
            <li>and this was nice in maintaining, but</li>
            <li>For us, the size that everything came in is also a great sampler to try out the product before getting the full size.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Very good quality hand cream without the high price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Milk</li>
            <li>works great but heavy, best for bedtime or just on cuticles and knuckles&lt;</li>
            <li>They are great for any age and very gentle.</li>
            <li>Very nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The intense hydration day lotion is nice as well.</li>
            <li>the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scents are wonderful, not too strong, not too sweet, but earthy and fresh.</li>
            <li>I love this set.</li>
            <li>, I love how this smells and tingles.  </li>
            <li>, I moisturizer my face, my hands, my feet, so this one was just okay</li>
            <li>is more glass than lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so if Burt&#x27;s Bees wanted us to think of giving this as a gift, then they should have provided a cute or practical carry case so we, the giver, do not have to buy an additional case to make this</li>
            <li>They work more than not.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this face wash.  </li>
            <li>It is more like a Vaseline texture.  </li>
            <li>I will be sticking with my favorite</li>
            <li>This way I can try a bunch of the products to see what I might want to buy more of for myself or gifts for others.</li>
            <li>Seriously I am in love with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I like it much better if the product soaks in.</li>
            <li>Most of them do have some scent to them, although the coconut foot cream and milk and honey body lotion have the strongest smells.</li>
            <li>A nice travel size companion if you are already familiar with the product.  </li>
            <li>The hand cream is the best I have used in a long time</li>
            <li>You really receive a good taste of what this Company has to offer you in this Gift Set.</li>
            <li>Moreover, unlike some of the original Burt&#x27;s Bees products, this is more image than substance.</li>
            <li>The cream cleanser wasn&#x27;t my favorite, as I have oily skin, and felt like it didn&#x27;t cut through the oil very well, but otherwise, it&#x27;s a nice set.</li>
            <li>The body lotion is fine</li>
            <li>It is great for winter months when skin tends to be more dry and eczema can appear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Coconut foot cream is more like a salve in a tube and it works great on dry or cracked feet.</li>
            <li>Both feel and smell fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Because I enjoy Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and have bought their gift</li>
            <li>enjoy using BB products.</li>
            <li>Next day I used the body lotion which did make my skin feel nice and healthy, but my favorite ones were the Hand Repair and Foot Cream.</li>
            <li>and Honey body lotion: lightly scented lotion, moisture without being greasy&lt;</li>
            <li>Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser was a nice discovery for my wife.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Intense Hydration day lotion: excellent moisture and gentle enough that I don&#x27;t need a separate eye cream,</li>
            <li>I had not tried the clary and sage cleanser before - new favorite!  </li>
            <li>It is a fine face wash but a bit more drying than the Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Very heavy, best for bedtime with socks over it.</li>
            <li>Another great product for winter months and unusually dry skin.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nothing special,</li>
            <li>/&gt;First is a deep cleansing cream and it feels so good against my skin.  </li>
            <li>They include two lotions and two face cleansers- one more intense.</li>
            <li>This is a great set of travel items from Burt&#x27;s Bees and it&#x27;s pretty good value for what you get considering each of these items costs about a third of what this sets costs if you buy them individually.  </li>
            <li>I put a cream on sometimes at night, and my hands look good for a day and then back to cracky hands.</li>
            <li>and I am going to buy the full size tube.  </li>
            <li>It will be super in the winter because it also acts as a protectant and will seal in moisture.</li>
            <li>It is super moisturizing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty, but mild scent.</li>
            <li>It is suitable for sensitive skin, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Intense hydration cream cleanser is also good for sensitive skin and also leaves your skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m delighted with the hand cream and the other tried and true products that leave my skin feeling both clean and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Great to tuck into gift bags or to keep on hand as needed.h typical use since they&#x27;re made</li>
            <li>I like that none of it has that strong of smells/scents, which is important to me, and even then, they try to keep it natural, like mint, or fruity scents.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is such a nice sampler if you are trying to find a new favorite, maybe traveling, a gift to a friend.  </li>
            <li>A great little set for a stocking stuffer, for travel, or to have at a desk at work</li>
            <li>Some of the item&#x27;s are a bit redundant but all of them come with the great quality you come to expect from Burt&#x27;s Bees items.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if they came in some simple bag or container as each just came stuffed in one envelope.</li>
            <li>Coconut Foot Cream: Nicely scented but definitely not a &amp;#34;cream.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>The texture feels different than most lotions I&#x27;ve tried and I enjoy the difference...</li>
            <li>Ahhh I love this set even more than I expected!</li>
            <li>Absorbs well, leaves skin soft and has a very mild scent.</li>
            <li>And these cleansers are so very very gentle on your skin.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure I will be buying that in the future.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s deal with the claim of a mini gift set first.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin smooth and so soft.</li>
            <li>I would love if Burt&#x27;s Bees had sets like these for specific types of lotions, too - face creams, for instance.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 1-2 years and have it on Subscribe &amp; Save on Amazon since the local drugstores&#x27; prices are $3+ more a tube.  </li>
            <li>Some of these I already buy regularly in the full size packages, but some were new to me and I enjoyed trying them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have liked the smells of other</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mini gift set, it was a great way to try these items before paying full price - which can be expensive, especially if you find out you don&#x27;t really like something.  </li>
            <li>The little tub of body cream is just ok, not for super dry skin but still works ok.  </li>
            <li>In addition there is an intense hydration for excema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this set.  </li>
            <li>I really like the clary sage cleanser and lotion</li>
            <li>so I really cannot comment well on the differences in the product.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes.</li>
            <li>and I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>It really reminds me of L&#x27;Occitane with the scent and consistency.  </li>
            <li>Feet get a lot of punishment here in Florida with the use of Flip Flop Shoes being worn all the time so this product really helped.</li>
            <li>Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser:</li>
            <li>I really like the consistency and the level of moisture but am not a fan of the smell.  </li>
            <li>Intense Hydration Day Lotion:</li>
            <li>Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser - Travel Size</li>
            <li>Intense Hydration Day Lotion - Travel Size</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t care of the Intense Hydration Cleanser or lotion.</li>
            <li>I actually like this in a unique way.  </li>
            <li>Aside from being smaller and very portable it gives a purchaser some flexibility to get to know the products without buying their full size versions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Milk and Honey Body Lotion:  I really enjoy the scent of this one and the lotion goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I prefer this one and do buy the full size regularly.  </li>
            <li>but this may be good for younger teen faces that are a constantly oily.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>The foot cream is decent.</li>
            <li>They work well with sensitive skin and hydrate the dry parts pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>This is such a nice little set of Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
            <li>This was a new product to me</li>
            <li>Shea Butter hand repair cream was also new to me.</li>
            <li>Some of these products I have bought before and some were new to me.</li>
            <li>The foot lotion is luxurious, I put it on with socks before bed and my feet were very soft when I woke up.  </li>
            <li>The first product I tried out of here was the coconut foot cream, which definitely smells like coconut.  </li>
            <li>Bark and Chamomile deep cleansing cream: non-foaming cleanser with a little bit of a tingle, love this&lt;br /&gt;Shea</li>
            <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;The deep cleansing cream is so gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>This set contains the following Burt&#x27;s Bees products:  Coconut Foot Cream, Milk&amp;Honey Body Lotion,  Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser with Clary Sage, Soap Bark &amp; Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream, Intense Hydration Day Lotion with Clary Sage, and Shea Butter Hand Repair Cream.&lt;br /&gt;The BB line contains all natural products.</li>
            <li>far as the products go...</li>
            <li>So far, I have not had any breakouts from this and will update if I do.</li>
            <li>Naturally Nourishing Milk &amp; Honey Body Lotion - Travel Size</li>
            <li>,  it includes 6 products: Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser, Day Lotion, Soap Bark and Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream, Milk and Honey Body Lotion, Coconut Foot Cream, and Shea Butter Hand Repair Cream.</li>
            <li>There is the deep cleaning cream, which I found to actually work very well.</li>
            <li>More bulk and packaging (the tubes, I mean) than actual product.</li>
            <li>This cream leaves a little lotion on the outside of your skin, so when you put it on I would put on a clean pair of socks afterward.  </li>
            <li>This is a useful and economical way to try several Burt&#x27;s Bees cosmetics, but it&#x27;s mediocre as a gift of travel set.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Both feel and smell fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Because I enjoy Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and have bought their gift</li>
            <li> enjoy using BB products.</li>
            <li> Next day I used the body lotion which did make my skin feel nice and healthy, but my favorite ones were the Hand Repair and Foot Cream.</li>
            <li> and Honey body lotion: lightly scented lotion, moisture without being greasy&lt;</li>
            <li> Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser was a nice discovery for my wife.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Intense Hydration day lotion: excellent moisture and gentle enough that I don&#x27;t need a separate eye cream,</li>
            <li> I had not tried the clary and sage cleanser before - new favorite!  </li>
            <li> It is a fine face wash but a bit more drying than the Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Very heavy, best for bedtime with socks over it.</li>
            <li> Another great product for winter months and unusually dry skin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nothing special,</li>
            <li> /&gt;First is a deep cleansing cream and it feels so good against my skin.  </li>
            <li> They include two lotions and two face cleansers- one more intense.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of travel items from Burt&#x27;s Bees and it&#x27;s pretty good value for what you get considering each of these items costs about a third of what this sets costs if you buy them individually.  </li>
            <li> I put a cream on sometimes at night, and my hands look good for a day and then back to cracky hands.</li>
            <li> and I am going to buy the full size tube.  </li>
            <li> It will be super in the winter because it also acts as a protectant and will seal in moisture.</li>
            <li> It is super moisturizing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty, but mild scent.</li>
            <li> It is suitable for sensitive skin, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Intense hydration cream cleanser is also good for sensitive skin and also leaves your skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m delighted with the hand cream and the other tried and true products that leave my skin feeling both clean and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great to tuck into gift bags or to keep on hand as needed.h typical use since they&#x27;re made</li>
            <li> I like that none of it has that strong of smells/scents, which is important to me, and even then, they try to keep it natural, like mint, or fruity scents.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is such a nice sampler if you are trying to find a new favorite, maybe traveling, a gift to a friend.  </li>
            <li> A great little set for a stocking stuffer, for travel, or to have at a desk at work</li>
            <li> Some of the item&#x27;s are a bit redundant but all of them come with the great quality you come to expect from Burt&#x27;s Bees items.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if they came in some simple bag or container as each just came stuffed in one envelope.</li>
            <li> Coconut Foot Cream: Nicely scented but definitely not a &amp;#34;cream.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> The texture feels different than most lotions I&#x27;ve tried and I enjoy the difference...</li>
            <li> Ahhh I love this set even more than I expected!</li>
            <li> Absorbs well, leaves skin soft and has a very mild scent.</li>
            <li> And these cleansers are so very very gentle on your skin.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure I will be buying that in the future.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s deal with the claim of a mini gift set first.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin smooth and so soft.</li>
            <li> I would love if Burt&#x27;s Bees had sets like these for specific types of lotions, too - face creams, for instance.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 1-2 years and have it on Subscribe &amp; Save on Amazon since the local drugstores&#x27; prices are $3+ more a tube.  </li>
            <li> Some of these I already buy regularly in the full size packages, but some were new to me and I enjoyed trying them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have liked the smells of other</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mini gift set, it was a great way to try these items before paying full price - which can be expensive, especially if you find out you don&#x27;t really like something.  </li>
            <li> The little tub of body cream is just ok, not for super dry skin but still works ok.  </li>
            <li> In addition there is an intense hydration for excema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this set.  </li>
            <li> I really like the clary sage cleanser and lotion</li>
            <li> so I really cannot comment well on the differences in the product.</li>
            <li> It really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> and I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> It really reminds me of L&#x27;Occitane with the scent and consistency.  </li>
            <li> Feet get a lot of punishment here in Florida with the use of Flip Flop Shoes being worn all the time so this product really helped.</li>
            <li> Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser:</li>
            <li> I really like the consistency and the level of moisture but am not a fan of the smell.  </li>
            <li> Intense Hydration Day Lotion:</li>
            <li> Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser - Travel Size</li>
            <li> Intense Hydration Day Lotion - Travel Size</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t care of the Intense Hydration Cleanser or lotion.</li>
            <li> I actually like this in a unique way.  </li>
            <li> Aside from being smaller and very portable it gives a purchaser some flexibility to get to know the products without buying their full size versions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Milk and Honey Body Lotion:  I really enjoy the scent of this one and the lotion goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I prefer this one and do buy the full size regularly.  </li>
            <li> but this may be good for younger teen faces that are a constantly oily.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> The foot cream is decent.</li>
            <li> They work well with sensitive skin and hydrate the dry parts pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice little set of Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
            <li> This was a new product to me</li>
            <li> Shea Butter hand repair cream was also new to me.</li>
            <li> Some of these products I have bought before and some were new to me.</li>
            <li> The foot lotion is luxurious, I put it on with socks before bed and my feet were very soft when I woke up.  </li>
            <li> The first product I tried out of here was the coconut foot cream, which definitely smells like coconut.  </li>
            <li> Bark and Chamomile deep cleansing cream: non-foaming cleanser with a little bit of a tingle, love this&lt;br /&gt;Shea</li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;The deep cleansing cream is so gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> This set contains the following Burt&#x27;s Bees products:  Coconut Foot Cream, Milk&amp;Honey Body Lotion,  Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser with Clary Sage, Soap Bark &amp; Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream, Intense Hydration Day Lotion with Clary Sage, and Shea Butter Hand Repair Cream.&lt;br /&gt;The BB line contains all natural products.</li>
            <li> far as the products go...</li>
            <li> So far, I have not had any breakouts from this and will update if I do.</li>
            <li> Naturally Nourishing Milk &amp; Honey Body Lotion - Travel Size</li>
            <li> ,  it includes 6 products: Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser, Day Lotion, Soap Bark and Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream, Milk and Honey Body Lotion, Coconut Foot Cream, and Shea Butter Hand Repair Cream.</li>
            <li> There is the deep cleaning cream, which I found to actually work very well.</li>
            <li> More bulk and packaging (the tubes, I mean) than actual product.</li>
            <li> This cream leaves a little lotion on the outside of your skin, so when you put it on I would put on a clean pair of socks afterward.  </li>
            <li> This is a useful and economical way to try several Burt&#x27;s Bees cosmetics, but it&#x27;s mediocre as a gift of travel set.</li>
            <li> The foot product is the same way and just makes me oily, not really moisturizing my feet.</li>
            <li> It is thick and doesn&#x27;t take much to moisturize - actually, all the products are thick and rich and need a very small amount to do</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have dry skin at bedtime since using this.  </li>
            <li> It worked well on the dry areas of her face.  </li>
            <li> These containers were shipped loose</li>
            <li> While it is a &amp;#34;set,&amp;#34; it isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;gift set.&amp;#34;  There is no packaging and the items are tossed loose in a padded envelope.</li>
            <li> Although they are trial size tubes, they will last a while with typical use since they&#x27;re made</li>
            <li> The body lotion was the only product I felt a little, meh, about.  </li>
            <li> so well - you only need a little bit of each.</li>
            <li> so well - you only need a little bit of each.</li>
            <li> I believe that there are inconsistencies in their product line-</li>
            <li> It gives extra moisturization without being heavy on the skin and no greasiness.</li>
            <li> Five stars for the products, minus one star for the lack of any packaging...</li>
            <li> I felt the cleanser left a slick feel and have to rewash with something else.</li>
            <li> I get a pedicure every other week</li>
            <li> But this package is narrowly marketed for those who have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Drop</li>
            <li> Less dry skin means less chance of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> If you were traveling, there would be no compelling reason to bring hand, foot and body lotion separately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They work their way down with hand repair cream and foot cream.  </li>
            <li> Each item is one oz or less</li>
            <li> The foot cream is opaque and a little oily but disappears quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other moisturizers that do this and am not satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> sets(which came in little gift bags) or shower &amp;#34;wishing well&amp;#34; gifts, my expectation was that this set would be in gift format, but it was just a few sample size products in a padded paper bag.  </li>
            <li> Very thick and a little goes a long way with this product too.</li>
            <li> ordered this set to test for Vine because I already buy BB&#x27; s small sampler sets to test products I may have not already tried and to take with me when I go on trips.</li>
            <li> All in all I usually like Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but not this group.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s work on someone with serious cracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hands look horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  I&#x27;m using the facial wipes and lip emollient.  This just gives me an opportunity to &#x27;try before I buy,&#x27; so to speak.  They all come in full-sized packages so if I find I like something and can use it, I will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First is a deep cleansing cream and it feels so good against my skin.  So far it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin and I&#x27;m pretty sensitive.  In addition there is an intense hydration for excema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work their way down with hand repair cream and foot cream.  Both feel and smell fabulous.  The foot cream does wonders on my cracked heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You end with lotion and body cream.  Six products that will allow you to sample what you may like in the Burt&#x27;s Bees family of products.</li>
            <li> I love this set. It is the perfect way to test a variety of the beloved Burt&#x27;s Bees products without investing in full size versions. And I especially like that they are made in the USA. The hand repair cream has an amazing scent. It is thick and doesn&#x27;t take much to moisturize - actually, all the products are thick and rich and need a very small amount to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scents are wonderful, not too strong, not too sweet, but earthy and fresh. The foot cream is opaque and a little oily but disappears quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a gift set this is a nice price and the perfect way to introduce someone to Burt&#x27;s Bees products - or just to have travel sizes for yourself.</li>
            <li> I really like this set.  The first product I tried out of here was the coconut foot cream, which definitely smells like coconut.  This cream leaves a little lotion on the outside of your skin, so when you put it on I would put on a clean pair of socks afterward.  I have used the soap bark and chamomile before, I love how this smells and tingles.  I had not tried the clary and sage cleanser before - new favorite!  This smell is divine and I feel like my skin is just humming after cleansing. And these cleansers are so very very gentle on your skin.  The Shea lotion for the hands is really hydrating, it&#x27;s really wonderful.  The body lotion was the only product I felt a little, meh, about.  I don&#x27;t use body lotion that often, I moisturizer my face, my hands, my feet, so this one was just okay for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is such a nice sampler if you are trying to find a new favorite, maybe traveling, a gift to a friend.  I really like the clary sage cleanser and lotion and I&#x27;m pretty sure I will be buying that in the future.</li>
            <li> It was a nice sampler</li>
            <li> Because I enjoy Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and have bought their gift sets(which came in little gift bags) or shower &amp;#34;wishing well&amp;#34; gifts, my expectation was that this set would be in gift format, but it was just a few sample size products in a padded paper bag.  Also, two of thenproducts--a cleanser and a foot cream--were duplicated.&lt;br /&gt;Four stars because the products are great but I wouldn&#x27;t have given it as a gift as is.</li>
            <li> This is a useful and economical way to try several Burt&#x27;s Bees cosmetics, but it&#x27;s mediocre as a gift of travel set. More bulk and packaging (the tubes, I mean) than actual product. If you were traveling, there would be no compelling reason to bring hand, foot and body lotion separately. Moreover, unlike some of the original Burt&#x27;s Bees products, this is more image than substance. Try to find the Shea Butter in the hand cream, for example. The glass tub for the day lotion is more glass than lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I don&#x27;t like the smells. I have liked the smells of other hurts bees like their lib balm and cuticle cream. However, that&#x27;s a personal issue, and I am not deducting stars from the review of that.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s deal with the claim of a mini gift set first. These containers were shipped loose so if Burt&#x27;s Bees wanted us to think of giving this as a gift, then they should have provided a cute or practical carry case so we, the giver, do not have to buy an additional case to make this truly a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy using BB products. They work more than not. Their lip balm is the best. I occasionally have used face cream and wash, foot cream and their bug spray ( which does not work). I believe that there are inconsistencies in their product line- some being awesome and some mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;With that said, this set focuses on moisturizing through face wash and cream, foot and hand cream, and lotion. They include two lotions and two face cleansers- one more intense. After using these for a short time, the product does work. I do not have dryness issues in the summer so I really cannot comment well on the differences in the product. But this package is narrowly marketed for those who have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Drop the idea of a gift set, and I would have added a star.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent &amp;#34;try me&amp;#34; set of great products. Some of these I already buy regularly in the full size packages, but some were new to me and I enjoyed trying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deep cleansing cream is so gentle on your skin. It makes your skin smooth and so soft. It is suitable for sensitive skin, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intense hydration cream cleanser is also good for sensitive skin and also leaves your skin so soft and smooth. I prefer this one and do buy the full size regularly.  It is great for winter months when skin tends to be more dry and eczema can appear. It works out very good for my daughter who has mild eczema. It is soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coconut foot cream is more like a salve in a tube and it works great on dry or cracked feet. It really moisturizes. Put it on and throw on a pair of comfy socks and let it work it&#x27;s magic. This was a new product to me and I really like it a lot. Great for home pedicures and pampering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shea Butter hand repair cream was also new to me. It will be super in the winter because it also acts as a protectant and will seal in moisture. It really reminds me of L&#x27;Occitane with the scent and consistency.  Very good quality hand cream without the high price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Milk and honey body lotion is moisturizing without any greasy feel. Absorbs well, leaves skin soft and has a very mild scent. Leaves your skin looking and feeling like baby skin. Very nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The intense hydration day lotion is nice as well. Another great product for winter months and unusually dry skin. It gives extra moisturization without being heavy on the skin and no greasiness. I love the scent. It&#x27;s a very pretty, but mild scent. To me it has a &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; scent. Again, a product with excellent performance and quality without the hefty price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set has all the bases covered and is great for travel or to keep in your purse, etc. Although they are trial size tubes, they will last a while with typical use since they&#x27;re made so well - you only need a little bit of each. Great to tuck into gift bags or to keep on hand as needed.h typical use since they&#x27;re made so well - you only need a little bit of each. Great to tuck into gift bags or to keep on hand as needed.</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed when I received this Gift Set and knew it would be great to try them out.  There is the deep cleaning cream, which I found to actually work very well. I liked it a lot as I did the Cream cleanser. Next day I used the body lotion which did make my skin feel nice and healthy, but my favorite ones were the Hand Repair and Foot Cream. They really seemed to make a difference in just a few days to both my hands and my feet. Feet get a lot of punishment here in Florida with the use of Flip Flop Shoes being worn all the time so this product really helped. The day lotion was a plus as well. You really receive a good taste of what this Company has to offer you in this Gift Set. It&#x27;s fun to try them out and see what best suits you.  Great gift idea as well.  Nice product happy to recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of travel items from Burt&#x27;s Bees and it&#x27;s pretty good value for what you get considering each of these items costs about a third of what this sets costs if you buy them individually.  Some of the item&#x27;s are a bit redundant but all of them come with the great quality you come to expect from Burt&#x27;s Bees items.  We&#x27;ve put them in our guest bathroom medicine cabinet.  It would be nice if they came in some simple bag or container as each just came stuffed in one envelope.</li>
            <li> This set contains the following Burt&#x27;s Bees products:  Coconut Foot Cream, Milk&amp;Honey Body Lotion,  Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser with Clary Sage, Soap Bark &amp; Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream, Intense Hydration Day Lotion with Clary Sage, and Shea Butter Hand Repair Cream.&lt;br /&gt;The BB line contains all natural products. I have been using their products for about twenty years now and with the exception of the hand cream, I have been purchasing and using all these products with excellent results and have never had an allergic reaction to any of them. As for the hand cream, it is very good and comparable to the Shea butter hand cream I already use daily.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this set to test for Vine because I already buy BB&#x27; s small sampler sets to test products I may have not already tried and to take with me when I go on trips. Aside from being smaller and very portable it gives a purchaser some flexibility to get to know the products without buying their full size versions.&lt;br /&gt;These are very good products and I&#x27;m delighted with the hand cream and the other tried and true products that leave my skin feeling both clean and moisturizer. They are great for any age and very gentle.</li>
            <li> Ahhh I love this set even more than I expected! Several of these are products I&#x27;ve wanted to try. I would love if Burt&#x27;s Bees had sets like these for specific types of lotions, too - face creams, for instance. Great set, nice sized bottles.</li>
            <li> Five stars for the products, minus one star for the lack of any packaging...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent way to try new-to-you products from Burt&#x27;s Bees. While it is a &amp;#34;set,&amp;#34; it isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;gift set.&amp;#34;  There is no packaging and the items are tossed loose in a padded envelope. You could always buy a gift bag and some ribbon to make it into a gift set, if you are so inclined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the products go...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser: I LOVE this face wash.  I have been using it for 1-2 years and have it on Subscribe &amp; Save on Amazon since the local drugstores&#x27; prices are $3+ more a tube.  It truly is like washing your face with cream.  It is super moisturizing and I don&#x27;t have dry skin at bedtime since using this.  Less dry skin means less chance of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;2. Coconut Foot Cream: Nicely scented but definitely not a &amp;#34;cream.&amp;#34;  It is more like a Vaseline texture.  I don&#x27;t like that consistency but if you do, it is quite hydrating.&lt;br /&gt;3. Deep Cleansing Cream:  It is a fine face wash but a bit more drying than the Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser.  I will be sticking with my favorite but this may be good for younger teen faces that are a constantly oily.&lt;br /&gt;4. Milk and Honey Body Lotion:  I really enjoy the scent of this one and the lotion goes a long way.  I will be re-purchasing to use on my arms and legs before bed.  The scent is perfect to snuggle up to.&lt;br /&gt;5. Shea Butter Hand Repair Cream: I really like the consistency and the level of moisture but am not a fan of the smell.  I won’t be purchasing this in a larger size unless they have another scent.&lt;br /&gt;6. Intense Hydration Day Lotion: Very thick and a little goes a long way with this product too. I actually like this in a unique way.  The texture feels different than most lotions I&#x27;ve tried and I enjoy the difference... maybe because it is novel?  So far, I have not had any breakouts from this and will update if I do.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice little set of Burt&#x27;s Bees.  This way I can try a bunch of the products to see what I might want to buy more of for myself or gifts for others. I think Burt&#x27;s Bees products make a great teacher&#x27;s gift! I like that none of it has that strong of smells/scents, which is important to me, and even then, they try to keep it natural, like mint, or fruity scents.</li>
            <li> Some of these products I have bought before and some were new to me. I think they are each fantastic, and together they make a perfect travel kit with everything you need. Each item is one oz or less so you can bring them all in your carry-on when you fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intense Hydration day lotion: excellent moisture and gentle enough that I don&#x27;t need a separate eye cream, this works for my face and eyes&lt;br /&gt;Milk and Honey body lotion: lightly scented lotion, moisture without being greasy&lt;br /&gt;Intense Hydration cream cleanser: non-foaming cleanser removes my tinted moisturizer without drying my skin&lt;br /&gt;Soap Bark and Chamomile deep cleansing cream: non-foaming cleanser with a little bit of a tingle, love this&lt;br /&gt;Shea Butter hand repair cream: works great but heavy, best for bedtime or just on cuticles and knuckles&lt;br /&gt;Coconut foot cream: a miracle in a tube for even the driest cracked feet! Seriously I am in love with this stuff. Very heavy, best for bedtime with socks over it. I am switching to this from my former foot lotion (Neutrogena) from now on.</li>
            <li> A nice travel size companion if you are already familiar with the product.  For us, the size that everything came in is also a great sampler to try out the product before getting the full size.&lt;br /&gt;The Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser was a nice discovery for my wife. It worked well on the dry areas of her face.  We&#x27;ve always been a fan of the Shea Butter  hand repair cream  and the body lotion is great even for our daughters who have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good travel kit that is sized perfectly for you to take in your hand carry.  It is also a great way to try Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  As advertised, it does make a wonderful gift to any Burt&#x27;s Bees fan.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer for the body, hands and face do not soak in so they just sort of stay on the surface and make you greasy.  I have used other moisturizers that do this and am not satisfied with them. I like it much better if the product soaks in. The foot product is the same way and just makes me oily, not really moisturizing my feet. All in all I usually like Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but not this group.</li>
            <li> Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser - Travel Size&lt;br /&gt;• Intense Hydration Day Lotion - Travel Size&lt;br /&gt;• Soap Bark &amp; Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream - Travel Size&lt;br /&gt;• Naturally Nourishing Milk &amp; Honey Body Lotion - Travel Size&lt;br /&gt;• Coconut Foot Cream Mini&lt;br /&gt;• Shea Butter Hand Repair Cream - Travel Size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t care of the Intense Hydration Cleanser or lotion. I felt the cleanser left a slick feel and have to rewash with something else. Also, I dislike the smell. I prefer my day lotion to have SPF and if you&#x27;re over 30, it shouldn&#x27;t be a question they should figure out how to put SPF in the lotion. The body lotion is fine but it&#x27;s nothing special, a I wish it was thicker. The best thing in this was the Hand Cream. I wash my hands probably 50 times a day. My hands look horrible. I put a cream on sometimes at night, and my hands look good for a day and then back to cracky hands. This did a great job of healing. I was very happy with it. The foot cream is decent. I get a pedicure every other week and this was nice in maintaining, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s work on someone with serious cracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wasn&#x27;t my ideal set</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mini gift set, it was a great way to try these items before paying full price - which can be expensive, especially if you find out you don&#x27;t really like something.  The face wash works well but be careful you don&#x27;t get it near or in your eyes, it does sting.  The hand cream is the best I have used in a long time and I am going to buy the full size tube.  The foot lotion is luxurious, I put it on with socks before bed and my feet were very soft when I woke up.  The little tub of body cream is just ok, not for super dry skin but still works ok.  These would also be good for traveling.</li>
            <li> A great little set for a stocking stuffer, for travel, or to have at a desk at work,  it includes 6 products: Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser, Day Lotion, Soap Bark and Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream, Milk and Honey Body Lotion, Coconut Foot Cream, and Shea Butter Hand Repair Cream. Most of them do have some scent to them, although the coconut foot cream and milk and honey body lotion have the strongest smells. They work well with sensitive skin and hydrate the dry parts pretty quickly. The cream cleanser wasn&#x27;t my favorite, as I have oily skin, and felt like it didn&#x27;t cut through the oil very well, but otherwise, it&#x27;s a nice set.</li>
