            <li>Have noticed fine lines decrease  and absorbs immediately when I apply!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very light and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>Shipping is quick and the product is also good performance.</li>

            <li>Mostly I just notice it.  </li>

            <li>My skin looks firmer after just three weeks, looking to purchase more.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product.</li>
            <li>I can’t wait to see how that improves after a month or more.</li>
            <li>Then again, the more you put on, the tighter your skin becomes.</li>
            <li>After he told me that I&#x27;m ordering some more.</li>
            <li>Love love love it,will continue to buy it forever</li>
            <li>Love this serum.</li>

            <li>Love it</li>

            <li>Many compliments from strangers on my&lt;br /&gt;skin.</li>
            <li>It dispensed easily and was very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I normally use vitamin C serum with my derma roller and see great results</li>
            <li>THEN I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT!  </li>
            <li>I really love this serum and happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been working great so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Wrinkle repair, and it is very good; however, in the Texas heat, my makeup seems to slide</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall:  I think this is a very good product that last 2-3 months (I use it on face and throat,</li>
            <li>I can see her skin looking better and skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li>--this has been a great product so far</li>
            <li>My 50 year old face looks great and part of that may be stopping retinol.</li>
            <li>Plan to buy another bottle to really give it a chance to do some good on my sagging skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how your skin tightens right away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many creams &amp; lotions and everything inbetween, and this is the best by far, and I&#x27;m 73yrs old!!</li>
            <li>Easily applied.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to absorb.</li>
            <li>Thank you good price with high quality well that we will use</li>
            <li>Fine lines at eyes, forehead and mouth gone too.  </li>
            <li>There is a noticeable improvement in the fine lines around my eyes and lips as well.</li>
            <li>With that said, a friend had told me about this one helping with the fine lines around her eyes.  </li>
            <li>I find the serum  erases some fine lines</li>
            <li>I see fine lines disappearing and wrinkles on their way.  </li>
            <li>It does go on smoothly and it&#x27;s easy to appyly.</li>
            <li>I love the way it absorbs quickly into your skin and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>Its literally like magic, the way it tightens up and gives you a younger vibrant and self satisfying complexion!!!!</li>
            <li>I see a younger more vibrant and happy me!</li>
            <li>This skincare line is fantastic and I&#x27;m over-joyed at disappearing wrinkles, fine lines and crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li>The lovely woman I would always get on the phone, who was always so patient with my questions,even interested in my family life, was, I am almost embarrassed to say, the CEO and head of VISIO ELAN!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderfully effective and fast.</li>
            <li>The product glides on with ease and leaves the skin feeling refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li>Even though I’ve taken great care of my skin, wrinkles are forming and this serum tightens the heck out of those instantly upon application.  </li>
            <li>goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>One nice surprise for me is how much &#x27;lighter&#x27; my skin looks - almost brighter.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this now for a few weeks, and I am very impressed.</li>
            <li>but bait and switching with cheap chemicals.</li>
            <li>company has been very diligent with follow-up to make sure I am using product correctly and that I am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I apply it right after my toner, and I think the toner helps it to sink into the skin better.  </li>
            <li>many times was right in the eyes and face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The owner  has been so personable and friendly and genuinely concerned about me and the results that I&#x27;ve gotten.  </li>
            <li>The serum is easy to apply and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I chose this product because it was the most natural firming product I could find - paraben free and many of the ingredients are derived from plants.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited that it is not clogging my pores</li>
            <li>this product has significantly faded brown spots  and I plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li>not see any significant change at all.</li>
            <li>The serum is light, absorbs quickly and in 3 weeks, I’ve seen a noticeable improvement both in sagging and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how good it felt on my freshly cleaned skin.  </li>
            <li>Well sometimes husbands get things right!  </li>
            <li>Glides on, non greasy, right under my makeup!</li>
            <li>It feels good initially because of the hyaluronic acid, but it neither firms or lifts the skin.</li>
            <li>The value is definitely here at a good price and I foresee that price going up.</li>
            <li>I have skin that gets very reddened and burns from most anti-aging products and then I can&#x27;t continue to use them.</li>
            <li>is that the pump squirts excessively fast, so if you don&#x27;t cover the hole by cupping your hand over the top, the serum will squirt out and miss your finger</li>
            <li>I use about a full pump of serum</li>
            <li>chose this one, and upon receiving it I see that it is FULL of chemicals...</li>
            <li>I have not yet finished the first bottle but love how it feels on my skin and is absorbed quickly with no sticky residue feeling.  </li>
            <li>It is a good quick &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34;, but I was looking for something a little more nourishing for my skin and help with elasticity.</li>
            <li>My better half says the combination of a lot of peptides and other really great ingredients is doing the trick of decreasing lines and her lovely face is more radiant.</li>
            <li>The serum absorbs quickly and works well</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference really quickly.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will continue to order in the future.</li>
            <li>Love that it is so clean and natural.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I was chosen, I now have a new product for my beauty routine</li>
            <li>You will have to work with it very quickly to cover the whole face and neck before it dries up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very lightweight formula and dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lightweight serum that is absorbed quickly (in seconds).  </li>
            <li>Capacity is small, but it was good to be able to purchase an affordable price.</li>
            <li>IT ABSOLUTELY DOES WORK!!</li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>No face plumping and the fine wrinkles around my mouth are still very visible.</li>
            <li>I know that one day this company will be too big for that, but right now, it sure is a luxury!</li>
            <li>She said in &amp;#34;just a few weeks&amp;#34; she’s seen a great change in how her skin looks.</li>
            <li>They really work and have helped even my skin tone and produce a genuine improvement in lines and texture too..</li>
            <li>Yay!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to mention that the follow up from the vendor was a nice personal</li>
            <li>Is absorbed by the skin</li>
            <li>I am 74 years old and my wrinkles do look better.</li>
            <li>Even friends that I have not seen in months remarked last weeek how nice my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>It has a cool feeling when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>and so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li>She raves about it, and while its only been 10 days, it does seem to be doing nice things for my skin.</li>
            <li>The amount of proven and effective peptides in this serum is a big plus.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pricey when compared to other good serums.</li>
            <li>Maybe this product is good for other people.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this product, she can tell a significant difference from before to now.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>Allows you to get just the right amount.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The serum tightens your skin right away</li>
            <li>I felt my skin tightening right away.</li>
            <li>It seems it absorbs right away</li>
            <li>(Often I use an Aldi one, but right now I&#x27;m using the companion moisturizer for this.)</li>
            <li>I felt the firmness in my skin right away.</li>
            <li>After using both the Aria &#x27;regenerating cream&#x27; and &#x27;firming serum,&#x27; my skin is significantly smoother and softer and I am pleased that, even after 2 heatwaves, my skin is &amp;#34;comfortable&amp;#34; rather than oily, which it has been most of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any skin breakouts from applying either of these two products - especially a moisturizer - to my entire face.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased to report that I noticed a difference within a few days and after a week my skin was looking full and radiant.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic, I was fortunate enough to receive this at a reduced cost</li>
            <li>thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to get a handle on their fine lines and put a hold on the hands of time.</li>
            <li>Skin is soft and fine wrinkles are minimized.</li>
            <li>and I do think I&#x27;m seeing fine lines disappear so far.</li>
            <li>I will give it more time since it has only been a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to finish my first bottle</li>
            <li>When I look in the mirror now, I see the person I saw ten years ago or more.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>still – it’s a powerful serum that really works.</li>
            <li>I noticed an immediate difference from the first application.</li>
            <li>my face, my skin would look much much brighter!</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:1527400652f87a48298610fdeb922ee4]]I wanted to do this video for Aria Firming Serum because I love Visio Elan products and have used them for several months.</li>
            <li>but I need to give it some more time before I can say its actually reducing the appearance of lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a  &amp;#34;you gotta see it and feel it&amp;#34; to appreciate and love it  product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many are very similar in look.  </li>
            <li>Visually, it appears to soften lines and wrinkles, makes the skin look firmer, and it feels more elastic.</li>
            <li>and I still have pores that are pretty dominant,</li>
            <li>Thanks to the folks at Visio Elan!</li>
            <li>Packaged in a pretty box with an insert.</li>
            <li>and I took the suggestion of moistening face first.</li>
            <li>A real find!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used this product .</li>
            <li>Not only does it make my skin feel tighter, but my skin LOOKS better too.</li>
            <li>Overall im satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>my skin is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>No weird, funky smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received my new daily serum at discount for a HONEST review</li>
            <li>It was not sticky or too runny - it seemed like just the right texture to me - and it absorbed very quickly, without leaving my skin feeling dry.  </li>
            <li>that it is so clean and natural.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product and have seen promising results especially in my neck area.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I only recommend products, or services, I use personally, and believe will be good for my Flockers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed tightening of my skin when using the serum and a bit of discernible difference in some deep lines I have in my chin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very encouraged, and know there will be more improvement the longer I use the product.</li>
            <li>One day I faced the fact that I had a wrinkle in my forehead and grooves around my mouth where I smiled, droopy skin and dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It arrived promptly in a pretty box, nice bottle and a tight pump to keep from dispensing too much.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, sun-damaged, peeling, flaky skin most of the year.</li>
            <li>I looked up and it said it is strong approved for houshold cleaning products and &amp;#34;rinse off products like shampoos and conditioners&amp;#34;... &amp;#34;it has been named allergen of the year (2013) by the American Contact Dermatitis Society&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>I have had acne-prone skin, discoloration, and large pores and these 2 products</li>
            <li>I will certainly continue using it</li>
            <li>I also did not like how it penetrated the skin immediately causing a person to have to use a large a amount to cover their face and neck.</li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels when I put this on my face, and down my neck, I can feel it going to work right away.</li>
            <li>really tightens the skin with no irritation</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It really seems to improve my skin..</li>
            <li>and it dries so fast on the skin.</li>
            <li>This is lightweight and absorbs very quicky.  </li>
            <li>And a guide came with it that she really appreciated.</li>
            <li>I am really satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Want</li>
            <li>she really loves it.</li>
            <li>very fact is pleasing to me.</li>
            <li>I can feel and see how much this product has nourished and replenished my skin.</li>
            <li>You don’t need much of this at all so</li>
            <li>I really am in shock how well this works.</li>
            <li>This product really seems to make a difference.  </li>
            <li>They seem to really care about their products and their customers.</li>
            <li>This product exceeded my expectations and made my skin young and fresh.</li>
            <li>Additionally, my face feels much softer.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey, but it is much cheaper than the Botox nightmares</li>
            <li>I have noticed a change in the size of some of my pores, but the biggest thing is that my face looks all-around brighter.</li>
            <li>I took some photos to share because the serum is so unusual.  </li>
            <li>have really made a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to the firming part of the product, I have not specifically noticed any firming, but maybe my skin does not need it as much as some people&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li>and it’s an absolute hit.</li>
            <li>I really saw a difference and that&#x27;s</li>
            <li>No smell really.</li>
            <li>I likes the product but after one month, I am waiting to see if it really works.</li>
            <li>It also does not have an overly intense smell to it either</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this serum, it sinks into my skin and after a couple of weeks i already see a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to different brands, looking similar, and both felt nice on my skin, but no visable difference.</li>
            <li>I have just purchased my second bottle and I am excited to see the effects with my derma roller.</li>
            <li>I am seeing improvement in the first few days, and hope for more</li>
            <li>I have been trying and trying to find something that would help my 50 year old skin and reduce pore size and have not found anything that really worked very well,... until this!  </li>
            <li>She loves that it does not have a heavy feel to it, and it goes on very easily.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know which one is REALLY working or if they&#x27;re both doing the job, but I have never had such smooth, clear skin.  </li>
            <li>Love the slight tightening feeling.  </li>
            <li>One has to have realistic elections, its not a face lift.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more of this, in the future.  </li>
            <li>The most recent one commented that my skin looks so much younger than 60</li>
            <li>The serum was smooth feeling as it went on and absorbed very quickly not leaving a greasy after feel at all.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>I am a product junkie and have tried dozens of brands-from high end to drug store brands.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These products are highly praised wife is a product</li>
            <li>mother and I both highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for plastic surgery results without the cost and surgery.  </li>
            <li>Deciding I wasn&#x27;t ready to look old, I went in search of skincare products and found serums that contain Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>I received the product mentioned above complimentary for review and testing purposes.</li>
            <li>Now I see a cumulative result and anticipate even more improvement in another few weeks.</li>
            <li>I normally apply it in the morning after my shower.</li>
            <li>The fine lines has just about vanished, and some of the deeper ones in my forehead are very minimal.  </li>
            <li>She’s been reading about this new skincare called ‘peptides’ to diminish aging appearance.</li>
            <li>Like everything, there’s bad, good and fabulous.</li>
            <li>I find this product to be already effective although I have used it for only a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for all women, young to old!!  </li>
            <li>It can stand up to a side by side picture with my eight year old daughter!</li>
            <li>I might add that I&#x27;ve never experienced such awesome customer service before from any other company.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product only about 2 weeks so far and really like it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over one month and notice fine line has been getting softer.  </li>
            <li>I can really see a difference in my skin, especially around the mouth, where I had some pretty deep wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin - prone to breakouts and oil clogged pores and my face has been clear so far.</li>
            <li>The label is clear so you can see the serum.</li>
            <li>Clearly I wont be using this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying it for the last couple of weeks - and so far not too much change.  </li>
            <li>This product is really responsible for making me looking 10+ years younger.</li>
            <li>The only real problem area was my eye lids beginning to droop and become hooded.  </li>
            <li>My skin is also noticably soft.  </li>
            <li>I’m 50 years old and</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft</li>
            <li>As a professional make up artist and stylist, I have used every skin care product created.</li>
            <li>75yrs old</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft since I started using it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have not had any issues at all</li>
            <li>but I like the results so far.</li>
            <li>Sticking with NCN Professional.</li>
            <li>(he prudently does not say how old I look....LOL).  </li>
            <li>is yet again another company using the trend of looking natural-</li>
            <li>I am adding to my old review I used all of their products for about two years</li>
            <li>She says it makes her feel young again</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised....</li>
            <li>I am hoping for gradual, albeit probably more slow that what I would really like (instant, actually!).&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My skin combination is fairly well-balanced so not as complicated as it is for some.  </li>
            <li>I try a lot of different products from high end to new ones that appear.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest to the lasting effects but the initial response is very positive. .”</li>
            <li>Bottle came half full</li>
            <li>No smart husband would ever buy an anti-aging serum for his wife unless she out right told you she wanted one.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a surprise and historically not typical for my complexion.  </li>
            <li>No more flakiness or dryness - just smooth, soft, silky skin.</li>
            <li>I have tested other products and I have to say that I felt the skin feeling tightened right away.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone desiring to have skin that looks and feels much younger.</li>
            <li>In this day in age where customer service is a thing of the past, this company goes past what is normal and gives exceptional customer service and the products deliver.  </li>
            <li>I have used this serum on my face, neck and tops of my hands, for the past few weeks, and am very satisfied with my results, thus far.</li>
            <li>The only thing she dislikes about the product is that it is a little sticky feeling after applying to the face, but it becomes smooth and absorbs into the skin within 30 seconds to 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see effects it might have on the little wrinkles I&#x27;m already developing in my 20s!</li>
            <li>IT DOES firm the different areas, it does plump your skin,it does make it feel smooth.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen a difference but only used it for one day and like it so far!</li>
            <li>Granted, I’m only in my early 40’s</li>
            <li>I recently decided to go the natural route with my skin care and have also started using rosehip seed oil which seems to be balancing out my oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 49 yrs old and have tried several products</li>
            <li>It definitely keeps the skin soft.</li>
            <li>she also wants to try the other visio elan products.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the product I noticed a little difference.</li>
            <li>It didn’t take long to see a plumping of skin that evened out the wrinkles completely.</li>
            <li>, it is very mild compared to other products she has tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>Being a bargain hunter, I&#x27;m always looking for a less expensive, but just as good product.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so I tread carefully using different products.  </li>
            <li>My skin is already looking less dry and my fine lines are much less noticeable.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This serum is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I even used La Prarie from Switzerland &amp; this is better than that.  </li>
            <li> Hope they makre more products for the rest of my body and hair.</li>

            <li> The results are astonishing.</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Mostly I just notice it.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> My skin looks firmer after just three weeks, looking to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product.</li>
            <li> I can’t wait to see how that improves after a month or more.</li>
            <li> Then again, the more you put on, the tighter your skin becomes.</li>
            <li> After he told me that I&#x27;m ordering some more.</li>
            <li> Love love love it,will continue to buy it forever</li>
            <li> Love this serum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Many compliments from strangers on my&lt;br /&gt;skin.</li>
            <li> It dispensed easily and was very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I normally use vitamin C serum with my derma roller and see great results</li>
            <li> THEN I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT!  </li>
            <li> I really love this serum and happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working great so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Wrinkle repair, and it is very good; however, in the Texas heat, my makeup seems to slide</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall:  I think this is a very good product that last 2-3 months (I use it on face and throat,</li>
            <li> I can see her skin looking better and skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li> --this has been a great product so far</li>
            <li> My 50 year old face looks great and part of that may be stopping retinol.</li>
            <li> Plan to buy another bottle to really give it a chance to do some good on my sagging skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how your skin tightens right away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many creams &amp; lotions and everything inbetween, and this is the best by far, and I&#x27;m 73yrs old!!</li>
            <li> Easily applied.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to absorb.</li>
            <li> Thank you good price with high quality well that we will use</li>
            <li> Fine lines at eyes, forehead and mouth gone too.  </li>
            <li> There is a noticeable improvement in the fine lines around my eyes and lips as well.</li>
            <li> With that said, a friend had told me about this one helping with the fine lines around her eyes.  </li>
            <li> I find the serum  erases some fine lines</li>
            <li> I see fine lines disappearing and wrinkles on their way.  </li>
            <li> It does go on smoothly and it&#x27;s easy to appyly.</li>
            <li> I love the way it absorbs quickly into your skin and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> Its literally like magic, the way it tightens up and gives you a younger vibrant and self satisfying complexion!!!!</li>
            <li> I see a younger more vibrant and happy me!</li>
            <li> This skincare line is fantastic and I&#x27;m over-joyed at disappearing wrinkles, fine lines and crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> The lovely woman I would always get on the phone, who was always so patient with my questions,even interested in my family life, was, I am almost embarrassed to say, the CEO and head of VISIO ELAN!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderfully effective and fast.</li>
            <li> The product glides on with ease and leaves the skin feeling refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li> Even though I’ve taken great care of my skin, wrinkles are forming and this serum tightens the heck out of those instantly upon application.  </li>
            <li> goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> One nice surprise for me is how much &#x27;lighter&#x27; my skin looks - almost brighter.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this now for a few weeks, and I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> but bait and switching with cheap chemicals.</li>
            <li> company has been very diligent with follow-up to make sure I am using product correctly and that I am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I apply it right after my toner, and I think the toner helps it to sink into the skin better.  </li>
            <li> many times was right in the eyes and face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The owner  has been so personable and friendly and genuinely concerned about me and the results that I&#x27;ve gotten.  </li>
            <li> The serum is easy to apply and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because it was the most natural firming product I could find - paraben free and many of the ingredients are derived from plants.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited that it is not clogging my pores</li>
            <li> this product has significantly faded brown spots  and I plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> not see any significant change at all.</li>
            <li> The serum is light, absorbs quickly and in 3 weeks, I’ve seen a noticeable improvement both in sagging and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how good it felt on my freshly cleaned skin.  </li>
            <li> Well sometimes husbands get things right!  </li>
            <li> Glides on, non greasy, right under my makeup!</li>
            <li> It feels good initially because of the hyaluronic acid, but it neither firms or lifts the skin.</li>
            <li> The value is definitely here at a good price and I foresee that price going up.</li>
            <li> I have skin that gets very reddened and burns from most anti-aging products and then I can&#x27;t continue to use them.</li>
            <li> is that the pump squirts excessively fast, so if you don&#x27;t cover the hole by cupping your hand over the top, the serum will squirt out and miss your finger</li>
            <li> I use about a full pump of serum</li>
            <li> chose this one, and upon receiving it I see that it is FULL of chemicals...</li>
            <li> I have not yet finished the first bottle but love how it feels on my skin and is absorbed quickly with no sticky residue feeling.  </li>
            <li> It is a good quick &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34;, but I was looking for something a little more nourishing for my skin and help with elasticity.</li>
            <li> My better half says the combination of a lot of peptides and other really great ingredients is doing the trick of decreasing lines and her lovely face is more radiant.</li>
            <li> The serum absorbs quickly and works well</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference really quickly.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will continue to order in the future.</li>
            <li> Love that it is so clean and natural.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I was chosen, I now have a new product for my beauty routine</li>
            <li> You will have to work with it very quickly to cover the whole face and neck before it dries up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very lightweight formula and dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lightweight serum that is absorbed quickly (in seconds).  </li>
            <li> Capacity is small, but it was good to be able to purchase an affordable price.</li>
            <li> IT ABSOLUTELY DOES WORK!!</li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> No face plumping and the fine wrinkles around my mouth are still very visible.</li>
            <li> I know that one day this company will be too big for that, but right now, it sure is a luxury!</li>
            <li> She said in &amp;#34;just a few weeks&amp;#34; she’s seen a great change in how her skin looks.</li>
            <li> They really work and have helped even my skin tone and produce a genuine improvement in lines and texture too..</li>
            <li> Yay!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to mention that the follow up from the vendor was a nice personal</li>
            <li> Is absorbed by the skin</li>
            <li> I am 74 years old and my wrinkles do look better.</li>
            <li> Even friends that I have not seen in months remarked last weeek how nice my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> It has a cool feeling when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> and so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li> She raves about it, and while its only been 10 days, it does seem to be doing nice things for my skin.</li>
            <li> The amount of proven and effective peptides in this serum is a big plus.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pricey when compared to other good serums.</li>
            <li> Maybe this product is good for other people.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this product, she can tell a significant difference from before to now.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> Allows you to get just the right amount.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The serum tightens your skin right away</li>
            <li> I felt my skin tightening right away.</li>
            <li> It seems it absorbs right away</li>
            <li> (Often I use an Aldi one, but right now I&#x27;m using the companion moisturizer for this.)</li>
            <li> I felt the firmness in my skin right away.</li>
            <li> After using both the Aria &#x27;regenerating cream&#x27; and &#x27;firming serum,&#x27; my skin is significantly smoother and softer and I am pleased that, even after 2 heatwaves, my skin is &amp;#34;comfortable&amp;#34; rather than oily, which it has been most of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any skin breakouts from applying either of these two products - especially a moisturizer - to my entire face.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased to report that I noticed a difference within a few days and after a week my skin was looking full and radiant.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic, I was fortunate enough to receive this at a reduced cost</li>
            <li> thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to get a handle on their fine lines and put a hold on the hands of time.</li>
            <li> Skin is soft and fine wrinkles are minimized.</li>
            <li> and I do think I&#x27;m seeing fine lines disappear so far.</li>
            <li> I will give it more time since it has only been a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to finish my first bottle</li>
            <li> When I look in the mirror now, I see the person I saw ten years ago or more.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> still – it’s a powerful serum that really works.</li>
            <li> I noticed an immediate difference from the first application.</li>
            <li> my face, my skin would look much much brighter!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:1527400652f87a48298610fdeb922ee4]]I wanted to do this video for Aria Firming Serum because I love Visio Elan products and have used them for several months.</li>
            <li> but I need to give it some more time before I can say its actually reducing the appearance of lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a  &amp;#34;you gotta see it and feel it&amp;#34; to appreciate and love it  product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many are very similar in look.  </li>
            <li> Visually, it appears to soften lines and wrinkles, makes the skin look firmer, and it feels more elastic.</li>
            <li> and I still have pores that are pretty dominant,</li>
            <li> Thanks to the folks at Visio Elan!</li>
            <li> Packaged in a pretty box with an insert.</li>
            <li> and I took the suggestion of moistening face first.</li>
            <li> A real find!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used this product .</li>
            <li> Not only does it make my skin feel tighter, but my skin LOOKS better too.</li>
            <li> Overall im satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> my skin is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> No weird, funky smell</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received my new daily serum at discount for a HONEST review</li>
            <li> It was not sticky or too runny - it seemed like just the right texture to me - and it absorbed very quickly, without leaving my skin feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> that it is so clean and natural.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product and have seen promising results especially in my neck area.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I only recommend products, or services, I use personally, and believe will be good for my Flockers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed tightening of my skin when using the serum and a bit of discernible difference in some deep lines I have in my chin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very encouraged, and know there will be more improvement the longer I use the product.</li>
            <li> One day I faced the fact that I had a wrinkle in my forehead and grooves around my mouth where I smiled, droopy skin and dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It arrived promptly in a pretty box, nice bottle and a tight pump to keep from dispensing too much.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, sun-damaged, peeling, flaky skin most of the year.</li>
            <li> I looked up and it said it is strong approved for houshold cleaning products and &amp;#34;rinse off products like shampoos and conditioners&amp;#34;... &amp;#34;it has been named allergen of the year (2013) by the American Contact Dermatitis Society&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> I have had acne-prone skin, discoloration, and large pores and these 2 products</li>
            <li> I will certainly continue using it</li>
            <li> I also did not like how it penetrated the skin immediately causing a person to have to use a large a amount to cover their face and neck.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels when I put this on my face, and down my neck, I can feel it going to work right away.</li>
            <li> really tightens the skin with no irritation</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It really seems to improve my skin..</li>
            <li> and it dries so fast on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is lightweight and absorbs very quicky.  </li>
            <li> And a guide came with it that she really appreciated.</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Want</li>
            <li> she really loves it.</li>
            <li> very fact is pleasing to me.</li>
            <li> I can feel and see how much this product has nourished and replenished my skin.</li>
            <li> You don’t need much of this at all so</li>
            <li> I really am in shock how well this works.</li>
            <li> This product really seems to make a difference.  </li>
            <li> They seem to really care about their products and their customers.</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations and made my skin young and fresh.</li>
            <li> Additionally, my face feels much softer.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey, but it is much cheaper than the Botox nightmares</li>
            <li> I have noticed a change in the size of some of my pores, but the biggest thing is that my face looks all-around brighter.</li>
            <li> I took some photos to share because the serum is so unusual.  </li>
            <li> have really made a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the firming part of the product, I have not specifically noticed any firming, but maybe my skin does not need it as much as some people&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li> and it’s an absolute hit.</li>
            <li> I really saw a difference and that&#x27;s</li>
            <li> No smell really.</li>
            <li> I likes the product but after one month, I am waiting to see if it really works.</li>
            <li> It also does not have an overly intense smell to it either</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this serum, it sinks into my skin and after a couple of weeks i already see a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to different brands, looking similar, and both felt nice on my skin, but no visable difference.</li>
            <li> I have just purchased my second bottle and I am excited to see the effects with my derma roller.</li>
            <li> I am seeing improvement in the first few days, and hope for more</li>
            <li> I have been trying and trying to find something that would help my 50 year old skin and reduce pore size and have not found anything that really worked very well,... until this!  </li>
            <li> She loves that it does not have a heavy feel to it, and it goes on very easily.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know which one is REALLY working or if they&#x27;re both doing the job, but I have never had such smooth, clear skin.  </li>
            <li> Love the slight tightening feeling.  </li>
            <li> One has to have realistic elections, its not a face lift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more of this, in the future.  </li>
            <li> The most recent one commented that my skin looks so much younger than 60</li>
            <li> The serum was smooth feeling as it went on and absorbed very quickly not leaving a greasy after feel at all.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie and have tried dozens of brands-from high end to drug store brands.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These products are highly praised wife is a product</li>
            <li> mother and I both highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for plastic surgery results without the cost and surgery.  </li>
            <li> Deciding I wasn&#x27;t ready to look old, I went in search of skincare products and found serums that contain Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> I received the product mentioned above complimentary for review and testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Now I see a cumulative result and anticipate even more improvement in another few weeks.</li>
            <li> I normally apply it in the morning after my shower.</li>
            <li> The fine lines has just about vanished, and some of the deeper ones in my forehead are very minimal.  </li>
            <li> She’s been reading about this new skincare called ‘peptides’ to diminish aging appearance.</li>
            <li> Like everything, there’s bad, good and fabulous.</li>
            <li> I find this product to be already effective although I have used it for only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for all women, young to old!!  </li>
            <li> It can stand up to a side by side picture with my eight year old daughter!</li>
            <li> I might add that I&#x27;ve never experienced such awesome customer service before from any other company.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product only about 2 weeks so far and really like it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over one month and notice fine line has been getting softer.  </li>
            <li> I can really see a difference in my skin, especially around the mouth, where I had some pretty deep wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin - prone to breakouts and oil clogged pores and my face has been clear so far.</li>
            <li> The label is clear so you can see the serum.</li>
            <li> Clearly I wont be using this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying it for the last couple of weeks - and so far not too much change.  </li>
            <li> This product is really responsible for making me looking 10+ years younger.</li>
            <li> The only real problem area was my eye lids beginning to droop and become hooded.  </li>
            <li> My skin is also noticably soft.  </li>
            <li> I’m 50 years old and</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft</li>
            <li> As a professional make up artist and stylist, I have used every skin care product created.</li>
            <li> 75yrs old</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have not had any issues at all</li>
            <li> but I like the results so far.</li>
            <li> Sticking with NCN Professional.</li>
            <li> (he prudently does not say how old I look....LOL).  </li>
            <li> is yet again another company using the trend of looking natural-</li>
            <li> I am adding to my old review I used all of their products for about two years</li>
            <li> She says it makes her feel young again</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised....</li>
            <li> I am hoping for gradual, albeit probably more slow that what I would really like (instant, actually!).&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My skin combination is fairly well-balanced so not as complicated as it is for some.  </li>
            <li> I try a lot of different products from high end to new ones that appear.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to the lasting effects but the initial response is very positive. .”</li>
            <li> Bottle came half full</li>
            <li> No smart husband would ever buy an anti-aging serum for his wife unless she out right told you she wanted one.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a surprise and historically not typical for my complexion.  </li>
            <li> No more flakiness or dryness - just smooth, soft, silky skin.</li>
            <li> I have tested other products and I have to say that I felt the skin feeling tightened right away.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone desiring to have skin that looks and feels much younger.</li>
            <li> In this day in age where customer service is a thing of the past, this company goes past what is normal and gives exceptional customer service and the products deliver.  </li>
            <li> I have used this serum on my face, neck and tops of my hands, for the past few weeks, and am very satisfied with my results, thus far.</li>
            <li> The only thing she dislikes about the product is that it is a little sticky feeling after applying to the face, but it becomes smooth and absorbs into the skin within 30 seconds to 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see effects it might have on the little wrinkles I&#x27;m already developing in my 20s!</li>
            <li> IT DOES firm the different areas, it does plump your skin,it does make it feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a difference but only used it for one day and like it so far!</li>
            <li> Granted, I’m only in my early 40’s</li>
            <li> I recently decided to go the natural route with my skin care and have also started using rosehip seed oil which seems to be balancing out my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 yrs old and have tried several products</li>
            <li> It definitely keeps the skin soft.</li>
            <li> she also wants to try the other visio elan products.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the product I noticed a little difference.</li>
            <li> It didn’t take long to see a plumping of skin that evened out the wrinkles completely.</li>
            <li> , it is very mild compared to other products she has tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> Being a bargain hunter, I&#x27;m always looking for a less expensive, but just as good product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I tread carefully using different products.  </li>
            <li> My skin is already looking less dry and my fine lines are much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> A little really does go a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> #34;No way is your mother older than 52!&amp;#34; and an older woman (in her late 50s), who asked me my age, and said, &amp;#34;Wow!</li>
            <li> As i mentioned previously with my rating on the visio élan anti aging rich moisturizing cream, my only complaint is the amount needed for each application.</li>
            <li> It only becomes a problem if you have dry skin that immediately absorbs anything placed on it, like mine.</li>
            <li> was looking at several different products on Amazon and spent time comparing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is relevant that I am a mature woman and late to the game of anti-aging product use.  </li>
            <li> The name brands all seem to put that in to mass produce to allow for a long shelf life.</li>
            <li> My skin now has a glow that I have not seen in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 12 days, long with the Visio Elan moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have been following the directions for use carefully.</li>
            <li> Finding what works for your face can be a long process.</li>
            <li> I definitely see lines diminishing and wrinkles are less deep.  </li>
            <li> I still in used it, I have other brand moisture cream put on after that, it may see the result later like you said 30-40 days,</li>
            <li> I’ve paid a lot of money for skincare products over the years from big brand names to lesser known that brought little to no discernible results.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Let the serum dry for 30 seconds</li>
            <li> Product has 3 peptides and it works, however, there is not very much of it for the price.  </li>
            <li> Even after just a week I could see new health and youthfulness in my skin when used with Aria Peptide Complex Regenerating cream.</li>
            <li> Vacationing several times a year in Florida and swimming in a chlorinated pool all summer long is definitely harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have some indented acne scars around my cheeks that have plumped and are now less deep.</li>
            <li> Since I started using it a couple of months ago the lines around my eyes and at the corners of my mouth have become less deep</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks after receiving this product (and serum) to see the actual effects on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Time marches over your face regardless of how careful you are.  </li>
            <li> Not much change noticed...</li>
            <li> I am hopeful it will because I spent $40 on it</li>
            <li> Not really the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no greasiness!  </li>
            <li> and I know it&#x27;s due to using this product.</li>
            <li> It tightens and lifts sagging jowls,decreases pore size,and manipulates the skin so that it appears plump and extremely moist and dewy.</li>
            <li> I use the serum in conjunction with other moisturizers and have not tried any other associated products yet.  </li>
            <li> and yes I already have wrinkles, crowsfeet, and other skin problems.</li>
            <li> is the first time I have ever taken the time to leave an angry review...</li>
            <li> You only have to use a small amount</li>
            <li> /melt right off when I use the less expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and have noticed a difference in my eye area where I was starting to get a few wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> If it has made a difference, these past several weeks, in my opinion, it is ever so slight.</li>
            <li> It will also lighten your dark spot in your face.</li>
            <li> Serum is a little &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;, you need to be careful when depressing the applicator for the first 5 days or so.  </li>
            <li> Lines are less noticeable around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Aria radiant triple peptide firming serum to help with slight lines around my eyes and nose.  </li>
            <li> I use this along with the Anti Aging Cream and have noticed a difference in less than a month with some of my deeper wrinkles.</li>
            <li> has used this product for about two weeks, her wrinkles are less noticeable and she feels like her face, neck and her eyes are firmer.  </li>
            <li> Her skin looks and feels smoother, and the wrinkles are less noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are so much less noticeable since I been using this product.  </li>
            <li> Less noticeable pores and skin feels softer.</li>
            <li> And my skin feels tight.</li>
            <li> and I apply by slow small circular motion under my eyes, on my chin, upper lips and beetween eyes, and on my neck.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and can already see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get impatient and keep using them together</li>
            <li> I have been using Aria Tri-Peptide Firm Serum for three days now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few days</li>
            <li> and you may end up sleeping on the couch a few nights.</li>
            <li> Going to give this another few weeks and will return and update my review.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to quite a few friends.</li>
            <li> This serum will definitely firm your skin and help with scars.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my mother (49) to try and help firm and tighten her face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I price checked other products with 3 peptides which are hard to find but the one I did was sold by a plastic surgeon for $120.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I usually apply it before bed but have also used it under my makeup with no problems.</li>
            <li> I have been using their products for about a month now and there is an unbelievable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to see how my skin improves as I continue to use this serum.  </li>
            <li> You need a small drop</li>
            <li> or so then apply Aria Peptide Complex Cream.</li>
            <li> negative is the price.  </li>
            <li> was not what I thought I was ordering dried out my face made my wrinkles deep and ugly</li>
            <li> I know its depressing and its also sad to see yourself getting older in the mirror.</li>
            <li> It helped a bit, but the price was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It smells really subtle</li>
            <li> , I was a little skeptical about this stuff</li>
            <li> I hate to write bad reviews especially after only using a product for a week but this serum clogged my pores immediately and made me break out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they&#x27;re still there but are slowly fading.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave the greasy feeling behind.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, I doubt you will be sorry you did.</li>
            <li> I even tried a hugely expensive line for a while.  </li>
            <li> I was looking very tired.  </li>
            <li> Terrible waste of money</li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;m one of those who waited until age 45 to pay attention to lines and wrinkles!</li>
            <li> There is an unpleasant smell to it</li>
            <li> Has an unpleasant smell of alcohol.</li>
            <li> Some very expensive products.</li>
            <li> Works like the real expensive alternates.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> really tightens the skin with no irritation</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Received the product.  I have used the serum for about 1 month.  Lines are less noticeable around my eyes.  Skin is smoother and softer, making me younger looking.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product and have seen promising results especially in my neck area.</li>
            <li> I do love the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mis 60&#x27;s and have tried just about every product.. including $, $$$ and prescription.. I&#x27;m amazed by this.. It really seems to improve my skin.. Four girlfriends have asked what I&#x27;m using.. Customer service is far and away the best I&#x27;ve encountered.. Check with me in 6 months.. I just may start lying about my age!</li>
            <li> It feels good initially because of the hyaluronic acid, but it neither firms or lifts the skin.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I saw results after only a couple of weeks. It is worth every penny, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I still in used it, I have other brand moisture cream put on after that, it may see the result later like you said 30-40 days, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> reduced pore size, best  customer service I have ever experienced</li>
            <li> I LOVE this serum.  It definately makes my skin feel tighter after applying it. I apply it right after my toner, and I think the toner helps it to sink into the skin better.  I would recommend putting it on before your toner dries. I&#x27;m very happy that I have added it to my beauty routine. Give it a try, I doubt you will be sorry you did.</li>
            <li> Skin is so aoft using this serum ! Not too greasy &amp; I&#x27;m sure in time will see good results</li>
            <li> I have tried many,oh so many products! This is a wonderfully effective and fast.</li>
            <li> Works. Skin is soft and fine wrinkles are minimized. Like the eye dropper.  Allows you to get just the right amount.</li>
            <li> Shipping is quick and the product is also good performance.</li>
            <li> I Like the product just takes awhile to notice the difference in the jaw area.</li>
            <li> This seems like a great quality item. I&#x27;m excited to see effects it might have on the little wrinkles I&#x27;m already developing in my 20s!</li>
            <li> I love the three products. I apply the serum followed by the moisturizer twice a day and I use the mask twice a week. I will be reordering!</li>
            <li> There is an unpleasant smell to it and it dries so fast on the skin. You will have to work with it very quickly to cover the whole face and neck before it dries up. After a month of continued use, I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement. No face plumping and the fine wrinkles around my mouth are still very visible. I give it 2 stars because of the nice customer service and delivery on time.</li>
            <li> feels nice and smooth, expecting great result</li>
            <li> “I can feel this product tightening up my face when I put it on. I can&#x27;t attest to the lasting effects but the initial response is very positive. .”</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and can already see a difference in my skin. I usually apply it before bed but have also used it under my makeup with no problems.The serum is easy to apply and absorbs quickly. I have had no skin reactions or side affects. It&#x27;s been working great so far!</li>
            <li> This is lightweight and absorbs very quicky.  Love the slight tightening feeling.  Best when used with the Anti-Aging Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum for my girlfriend&#x27;s Mom’s birthday knowing she’s concerned about aging. She goes on and on about lines and wrinkles showing.  She’s been reading about this new skincare called ‘peptides’ to diminish aging appearance. I purchased this Aria serum because it has 3 peptides and most of the others had just 1. Not that I know what they are, but she loves it. She said in &amp;#34;just a few weeks&amp;#34; she’s seen a great change in how her skin looks. Bought the peptide moisturizer that goes with the serum for a stocking stuffer for Christmas. Quick service, great company. And a guide came with it that she really appreciated.</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie and have tried dozens of brands-from high end to drug store brands.  This serum is excellent.  I had been noticing a loss of volume in my cheeks and was looking for something that would address this issue.  I am very pleased to report that I noticed a difference within a few days and after a week my skin was looking full and radiant.  Yay!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to mention that the follow up from the vendor was a nice personal touch.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate!  Buy this today!</li>
            <li> I am seeing results after 30 days of using the serum and the regenerating cream.  They are an amazing duo.  Also the customer service is off the charts.  The owner  has been so personable and friendly and genuinely concerned about me and the results that I&#x27;ve gotten.  In this day in age where customer service is a thing of the past, this company goes past what is normal and gives exceptional customer service and the products deliver.  Don&#x27;t get impatient and keep using them together and you will see results!!!!  I&#x27;m 60 and I can see the tone of my skin brightening and fine lines relaxing!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Want to give 100 points&lt;br /&gt;Good seller !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products are highly praised wife is a product</li>
            <li> what can I say, seems to work... I have been using for about 3 months and there is a difference. One has to have realistic elections, its not a face lift. But i will keep buying because there is a tightening and lifting... yeah, it works.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - NOW MORE THEN 6 MONTHS - EVEN BETTER THEN I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT!  IT ABSOLUTELY DOES WORK!! This product is really responsible for making me looking 10+ years younger.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom. she likes the results that Aria serum has given her. she has been using the serum for about a week now. I can see her skin looking better and skin feels smooth. there is no fragrance like some serum has. my mom use the serum twice a day, once in morning and once before going to sleep. she really loves it. she also wants to try the other visio elan products.  love the fact that is USA FDA certified lab. and is never tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I love it this is the greatest firming serum i have used yes i plan to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have used this serum on my face, neck and tops of my hands, for the past few weeks, and am very satisfied with my results, thus far. #firmingserum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER:  I received the product mentioned above complimentary for review and testing purposes.

            <li> here are the before and after pictures.  I am 66 and very happy as the worst problem for me is around the lips.  very happy after 2-3 weeks.  P.S.   I was not wearing any foundation, just lipstick</li>

            <li> Quality, the price is satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Works like the real expensive alternates.</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks after receiving this product (and serum) to see the actual effects on my skin.  It is relevant that I am a mature woman and late to the game of anti-aging product use.  The only real problem area was my eye lids beginning to droop and become hooded.  I can see my eye lids again and the results are amazing!! Fine lines at eyes, forehead and mouth gone too.  I almost forgot but had to double check, the one age spot I was getting is gone as well.  woohooo  :)</li>
            <li> I ordered the Aria radiant triple peptide firming serum to help with slight lines around my eyes and nose.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good it felt on my freshly cleaned skin.  There was absolutely no greasiness!  It&#x27;s a very lightweight formula and dries very quickly.  I used a pearl sized drop and it was just enough for my face and neck.  Immediately, it left my skin with a glow!  After a week of daily use, I can see a noticeable difference.  The fine lines has just about vanished, and some of the deeper ones in my forehead are very minimal.  I will continue to use this product daily.  I recommend this for all women, young to old!!  BONUS::: This product is CRUELTY FREE!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> As a postpartum mom, my face has seen great improvement, i love the tightness and radiance!</li>
            <li> I believe it is working!! I have noticed how it tightens up you skin in a good way. My skin is also noticably soft.  I will give it more time since it has only been a week.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for approx 2-3 weeks and so far I am very happy with the results</li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;m one of those who waited until age 45 to pay attention to lines and wrinkles! My skin combination is fairly well-balanced so not as complicated as it is for some.  I am so pleased with this product after 2 weeks I&#x27;ll write a review now although I anticipate even better results as time goes by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum tightens your skin right away and I see signs of brightness returning. This is quite a blend of 3 peptides and hyaulonic acid.  The serum absorbs quickly and works well and I bought the peptide moisturizer, too.  I price checked other products with 3 peptides which are hard to find but the one I did was sold by a plastic surgeon for $120. The value is definitely here at a good price and I foresee that price going up. My skin has definitely benefited and I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that it is so clean and natural. No Parabens! The name brands all seem to put that in to mass produce to allow for a long shelf life.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, happy with the results after using one bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the best firming product I have tried and will continue to use it. I am 74 years old and my wrinkles do look better.</li>
            <li> Very Nice And Effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice and effective peptide serum. It arrived promptly in a pretty box, nice bottle and a tight pump to keep from dispensing too much.  I began using it about 3 weeks ago twice a day and adding the peptide cream. Your skin will tighten immediately upon application which feels very good. I definitely see lines diminishing and wrinkles are less deep.  I’m 50 years old and while I’ve taken good care of my skin, age was beginning to show.  I will continue to buy this skincare system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to finish my first bottle and I see good results. Would order again but it&#x27;s pricey when compared to other good serums.</li>
            <li> Thank you good price with high quality well that we will use</li>
            <li> Amazing change in my skin texture!  Even after just a week I could see new health and youthfulness in my skin when used with Aria Peptide Complex Regenerating cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over one month and notice fine line has been getting softer.  Will be keep using it.</li>
            <li> I had to post a comment about this product because, I too, didn&#x27;t believe anti-aging products could make a difference.  All my life I had great skin from just washing my face with a mild olive oil soap then putting on a light lotion.  That was it.  I never thought about my skin because it was flawless!  Over the years things gradually changed. One day I faced the fact that I had a wrinkle in my forehead and grooves around my mouth where I smiled, droopy skin and dark circles under my eyes.  When had that happened?  Deciding I wasn&#x27;t ready to look old, I went in search of skincare products and found serums that contain Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid. They did help. I even tried a hugely expensive line for a while.  It helped a bit, but the price was ridiculous. Then I read somewhere that the combination of peptides and collagen-elastin was the real key.  I tried the Aria serum along with a collagen elastin moisturizer and it was if my face decided to do a Benjamin Button!  I kid you not.  When I look in the mirror now, I see the person I saw ten years ago or more.  I am in no way connected to this company.  Don&#x27;t know anyone here.  Trust me, this is the good stuff.  Do your face a favor and give it a try.</li>
            <li> This serum will make your face look and feel great!</li>
            <li> I love how my skin is looking. It can stand up to a side by side picture with my eight year old daughter! (I am 41.) I definitely could NOT say that before....I was using two pumps and it lasted a month. Lois Clark ( a great help!) told me to just do one and that it should last 60 days. That&#x27;s what I am doing now...A little really does go a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;,,,,I have been using this product for about 3-4 months now, along with the moisturizer. I am so happy with the results and the company! The lovely woman I would always get on the phone, who was always so patient with my questions,even interested in my family life, was, I am almost embarrassed to say, the CEO and head of VISIO ELAN! She likes to answer each and every customer herself. I know that one day this company will be too big for that, but right now, it sure is a luxury! An A+ for the product and the customer service.</li>
            <li> did not see any difference after using it</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels incredibly amazing since using this. I have to admit, I was a little skeptical about this stuff but it now has me convinced. My crows feet around my eyes have diminished. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they&#x27;re still there but are slowly fading. My skin feels so soft and I know it&#x27;s due to using this product. It absorbs well into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave the greasy feeling behind. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a couple of weeks. I will also be buying the second step to this and can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Aria Tri-Peptide Firm Serum for three days now.&lt;br /&gt;That very fact is pleasing to me. I have skin that gets very reddened and burns from most anti-aging products and then I can&#x27;t continue to use them. But this serum is actually soothing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed tightening of my skin when using the serum and a bit of discernible difference in some deep lines I have in my chin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very encouraged, and know there will be more improvement the longer I use the product.</li>
            <li> After using both the Aria &#x27;regenerating cream&#x27; and &#x27;firming serum,&#x27; my skin is significantly smoother and softer and I am pleased that, even after 2 heatwaves, my skin is &amp;#34;comfortable&amp;#34; rather than oily, which it has been most of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any skin breakouts from applying either of these two products - especially a moisturizer - to my entire face.  That&#x27;s a surprise and historically not typical for my complexion.  Both products, which I do use together, are very nice under make-up -- I use a power foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is the only product that I would expect to reorder sooner because the cream comes in a larger container.  Yes, I would buy both products again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company has been very diligent with follow-up to make sure I am using product correctly and that I am completely satisfied.  Nice!</li>
            <li> so good&lt;br /&gt;i remeber +_+</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more of this, in the future.  Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Perfect anti aging serum among the I have been used! I recommended my friends also</li>
            <li> Terrible waste of money</li>
            <li> Easily applied.  Skin feels and looks brighter. Scent is pleasant. Am anticipating reordering as I am pleased with this product</li>
            <li> As i mentioned previously with my rating on the visio élan anti aging rich moisturizing cream, my only complaint is the amount needed for each application. The product glides on with ease and leaves the skin feeling refreshed and smooth. It only becomes a problem if you have dry skin that immediately absorbs anything placed on it, like mine. I see the improvements in the skin, but I will run out of the product way before I&#x27;m supposed to. Love the product</li>
            <li> Love that it is so clean and natural. No Parabens!!!  FAGRANCE FREE AND NON-GREASY! Have noticed fine lines decrease  and absorbs immediately when I apply!  Will continue to use .</li>
            <li> I like this product so far.&lt;br /&gt;Have only been using it for a couple weeks and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sun-damaged, peeling, flaky skin most of the year. Vacationing several times a year in Florida and swimming in a chlorinated pool all summer long is definitely harsh on my skin. Imagine my delight when I found Visio Elan anti-aging products! I have been using their products for about a month now and there is an unbelievable difference in my skin. No more flakiness or dryness - just smooth, soft, silky skin. There is a noticeable improvement in the fine lines around my eyes and lips as well. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product. I can feel and see how much this product has nourished and replenished my skin. I highly recommend it to anyone desiring to have skin that looks and feels much younger.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product!!! Thank you so much for a great quality!!!</li>
            <li> I received this product as a gift from my boyfriend.  He knows I’m hooked on products and loves that I take really good care of my skin. I try a lot of different products from high end to new ones that appear. Like everything, there’s bad, good and fabulous. This serum is fabulous! Even though I’ve taken great care of my skin, wrinkles are forming and this serum tightens the heck out of those instantly upon application.  It didn’t take long to see a plumping of skin that evened out the wrinkles completely. Granted, I’m only in my early 40’s still – it’s a powerful serum that really works. I’ve been using this every morning along with the peptide moisturizer and will continue using both. I also notice my skin glows and has a great tone.  He notices it, too. You don’t need much of this at all so use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> As a professional make up artist and stylist, I have used every skin care product created. Some very expensive products. This product is absolutely amazing. I noticed an immediate difference from the first application. This is what I wish I had been using for the last 5 years. It&#x27;s truly the best product out there. Using in addition to the skin cream. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I really am in shock how well this works. I have some indented acne scars around my cheeks that have plumped and are now less deep. I normally use vitamin C serum with my derma roller and see great results but I saw awesome results with this serum alone. I have just purchased my second bottle and I am excited to see the effects with my derma roller.</li>
            <li> good!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
            <li> The Anti Aging Triple Peptide Collagen Firming Serum with Hyaluronic is the best cream IHave ever used @ 75yrs old that&#x27;s a lot of creams. I even used La Prarie from Switzerland &amp; this is better than that.  Try it! I wish I knew about this cream when I was younger my face, my skin would look much much brighter!</li>
            <li> i am very happy with this product.  Even friends that I have not seen in months remarked last weeek how nice my skin looks.  Hope they makre more products for the rest of my body and hair.</li>
            <li> Received on time and have used the product one time but like it.</li>
            <li> This is the best serum I have ever used, and that says a lot. It tightens and lifts sagging jowls,decreases pore size,and manipulates the skin so that it appears plump and extremely moist and dewy. Please do not ever quit making this compound.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough of this serum.IT DOES firm the different areas, it does plump your skin,it does make it feel smooth.</li>
            <li> This product really seems to make a difference.  I felt my skin tightening right away.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of using the anti-aging serum, I love the radiance and even skin tone that I have noticed.  I&#x27;m anxious to see how my skin improves as I continue to use this serum.  I might add that I&#x27;ve never experienced such awesome customer service before from any other company.  They seem to really care about their products and their customers.</li>
            <li> This product was very nicely packaged, with a tamper seal etc. It dispensed easily and was very easy to use. The serum was smooth feeling as it went on and absorbed very quickly not leaving a greasy after feel at all. All in all I am please with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product at a reduced price and asked to write a review for it.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth. Haven&#x27;t seen a difference but only used it for one day and like it so far! Will update next week. I was given a discount for a review</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels when I put this on my face, and down my neck, I can feel it going to work right away. It has a cool feeling when you first put it on. My skin feels so soft since I started using it. I get compliments that I don&#x27;t look my age! This stuff is fantastic, I was fortunate enough to receive this at a reduced cost so I could give my honest opinion on it. I am so glad I was chosen, I now have a new product for my beauty routine</li>
            <li> I’ve paid a lot of money for skincare products over the years from big brand names to lesser known that brought little to no discernible results. This is a very “honest” product line (meaning has ingredients that are proven beneficial in wrinkle reduction) for a great price considering all that’s in it. The serum is light, absorbs quickly and in 3 weeks, I’ve seen a noticeable improvement both in sagging and wrinkles.  Now I see a cumulative result and anticipate even more improvement in another few weeks. I purchased both the serum and moisturizer. Excellent products and highly recommend both.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:1527400652f87a48298610fdeb922ee4]]I wanted to do this video for Aria Firming Serum because I love Visio Elan products and have used them for several months. This skincare line is fantastic and I&#x27;m over-joyed at disappearing wrinkles, fine lines and crow&#x27;s feet. Iam very happy with how my skin looks and a pearl size drop on your finger is all you need. Apply on your face and around eyes. I use it on my neck, too. Let the serum dry for 30 seconds or so then apply Aria Peptide Complex Cream. Then wait a minute and apply makeup which glides over beautifully. I&#x27;ve used many, many products over the years and nothing compares to Visio Elan&#x27;s. The firming serum really does firm and tighten. It&#x27;s light, non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations and made my skin young and fresh.</li>
            <li> Used for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;No adverse reaction, no reaction at all.&lt;br /&gt;Did nothing.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I use it before using the firming lotion.  Both have been wonderfully moisturizing without over using.  No greasiness either.  I use these products under my make up as well.</li>
            <li> It does what it says and makes a nice smooth foundation for your make up!</li>
            <li> I love this product! My skin is already looking less dry and my fine lines are much less noticeable.  I will definitely recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two months; there is a definite decrease in the appearance of crows feet around my eyes.  I have always taken excellent care of my skin and avoided the sun.  Time marches over your face regardless of how careful you are.  I am now 48, and the lines were definitely starting to amass.  I was looking very tired.  My skin now has a glow that I have not seen in a long time.  Additionally, my face feels much softer.  I use the serum in conjunction with other moisturizers and have not tried any other associated products yet.  One criticism I have (and I read that the manufacturers are working to correct this) is that the pump squirts excessively fast, so if you don&#x27;t cover the hole by cupping your hand over the top, the serum will squirt out and miss your finger completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product, as it is the only one I have found that actually works.  It is a bit pricey, but it is much cheaper than the Botox nightmares my peers at work have paid for.</li>
            <li> I have been using this anti aging serum for a couple of weeks now I am very pleased with my results!  I have very sensitive skin, so I tread carefully using different products.  With that said, a friend had told me about this one helping with the fine lines around her eyes.  So I started using it and I was very happy from the first application!  It was not sticky or too runny - it seemed like just the right texture to me - and it absorbed very quickly, without leaving my skin feeling dry.  One nice surprise for me is how much &#x27;lighter&#x27; my skin looks - almost brighter.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to get a handle on their fine lines and put a hold on the hands of time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 12 days, long with the Visio Elan moisturizer and so far I am pleased. I have noticed a change in the size of some of my pores, but the biggest thing is that my face looks all-around brighter. I have been following the directions for use carefully. I am hoping for gradual, albeit probably more slow that what I would really like (instant, actually!).&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I use this along with the Anti Aging Cream and have noticed a difference in less than a month with some of my deeper wrinkles. I&#x27;m only in my mid thirties and hope to combat getting additional wrinkles with the use of these products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the design of these pumps, they allow you to get every last drop out of them!</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any difference yet.  Has an unpleasant smell of alcohol.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have not had any issues at all --this has been a great product so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product only about 2 weeks so far and really like it!  I have very sensitive skin - prone to breakouts and oil clogged pores and my face has been clear so far. I&#x27;m in my 50s so I need an anti aging product. I recently decided to go the natural route with my skin care and have also started using rosehip seed oil which seems to be balancing out my oily skin.  I chose this product because it was the most natural firming product I could find - paraben free and many of the ingredients are derived from plants.  I love the way it absorbs quickly into your skin and leaves no residue. I&#x27;m excited that it is not clogging my pores so I am giving it a 5 star rating but I need to give it some more time before I can say its actually reducing the appearance of lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I love the product!  Since I started using it a couple of months ago the lines around my eyes and at the corners of my mouth have become less deep and it also has diminished brown patches.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the product I noticed a little difference. I could feel it tighten. Now it&#x27;s been a couple of weeks and I am noticing the lines soften and can definitely tell a difference. I&#x27;m 49 yrs old and have tried several products but I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will continue to order in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for a few weeks, and I am very impressed. I normally apply it in the morning after my shower. I use about a full pump of serum and I apply by slow small circular motion under my eyes, on my chin, upper lips and beetween eyes, and on my neck. The results are astonishing. Its literally like magic, the way it tightens up and gives you a younger vibrant and self satisfying complexion!!!! I could write amillion words and still not be able to get out the message of this product is age defying!!!! Im 35 and yes I already have wrinkles, crowsfeet, and other skin problems. I know its depressing and its also sad to see yourself getting older in the mirror. After using this I love to see me!!!! I see a younger more vibrant and happy me! This is definitely a  &amp;#34;you gotta see it and feel it&amp;#34; to appreciate and love it  product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received my new daily serum at discount for a HONEST review</li>
            <li> Great product.  Results are truly amazing.  Serum is a little &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;, you need to be careful when depressing the applicator for the first 5 days or so.  But once you apply, the serum quickly dries leaving your skin feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and have noticed a difference in my eye area where I was starting to get a few wrinkles.  Will keep using!</li>
            <li> this product has significantly faded brown spots  and I plan to continue using it. I have only udes it for a month but I like the results so far. It contains all the ingredients needed for collagen production.</li>
            <li> I really love this serum and happy with it so far. I took some photos to share because the serum is so unusual.  The label is clear so you can see the serum. The camera may have caused the label to look white but that&#x27;s the opaque color of the serum.</li>
            <li> Like the feel of this product, however, do not see any difference with using it.  Wonder about the packaging of these moisturizers and serums.  Many are very similar in look.  Same company?  Don&#x27;t know.  I&#x27;ve tried to different brands, looking similar, and both felt nice on my skin, but no visable difference.</li>
            <li> I started using it the minute I received it in the mail. I have tested other products and I have to say that I felt the skin feeling tightened right away. I have used it for a few days and I have noticed a difference. Best to use it in the evening when your face is resting... It really works!!</li>
            <li> Great results to pricey.  Sticking with NCN Professional.</li>
            <li> I received it days ago and tried it on the back of my hand. It&#x27;s easy to absorb. As planned, It&#x27;s a gift for my mom, and she loves it. She has a lot of brown spots and wrinkles on the skin. She is happy to start useing it to get rid of her skin problems.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of this product. It seems it absorbs right away And my skin feels tight.</li>
            <li> Not much change noticed...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product now for almost a year, and I continue to be impressed.  It&#x27;s a lightweight serum that is absorbed quickly (in seconds).  I follow up with a moisturizer. (Often I use an Aldi one, but right now I&#x27;m using the companion moisturizer for this.) Because of family history, I have to see a dermatologist on a yearly basis.  The most recent one commented that my skin looks so much younger than 60+ women (ok...she wants to build a good rapport with me!).  My husband says almost daily I just don&#x27;t look 60ish (he prudently does not say how old I look....LOL).  2 of the nicest compliments I&#x27;ve received have been from a younger woman (friend of my 25-year-old son who said, &amp;#34;No way is your mother older than 52!&amp;#34; and an older woman (in her late 50s), who asked me my age, and said, &amp;#34;Wow! You have held up amazingly well.&amp;#34; (Yes, I know kind people too).&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is the price.  Being a bargain hunter, I&#x27;m always looking for a less expensive, but just as good product. I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Wrinkle repair, and it is very good; however, in the Texas heat, my makeup seems to slide/melt right off when I use the less expensive Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  I think this is a very good product that last 2-3 months (I use it on face and throat, 1-2 x a day). It definitely keeps the skin soft. Visually, it appears to soften lines and wrinkles, makes the skin look firmer, and it feels more elastic. My skin looks brighter, more glowing.  I still have to add color to my face, but my skin feels smoother.  If I could only have 2 products for my skin, I would choose this one and my complexion brush!</li>
            <li> I am SO disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking at several different products on Amazon and spent time comparing.&lt;br /&gt;I chose this one, and upon receiving it I see that it is FULL of chemicals... none are listed in the ingredients shown.&lt;br /&gt;The last chemical in the list (Methylisothiazolinone) I looked up and it said it is strong approved for houshold cleaning products and &amp;#34;rinse off products like shampoos and conditioners&amp;#34;... &amp;#34;it has been named allergen of the year (2013) by the American Contact Dermatitis Society&amp;#34;... Look it up!&lt;br /&gt;This is yet again another company using the trend of looking natural- but bait and switching with cheap chemicals. Clearly I wont be using this.&lt;br /&gt;I have been an Amazon member since they only sold books. I have been a Prime member since they started the program.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I have ever taken the time to leave an angry review... this is an untrustworthy company.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it made any difference. I am hopeful it will because I spent $40 on it but there&#x27;s nothing that I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I noticed a difference really quickly.</li>
            <li> I find this product to be already effective although I have used it for only a few weeks. It only takes a drop or two. I love it.</li>
            <li> was not what I thought I was ordering dried out my face made my wrinkles deep and ugly however the ceo is sending me a different one with a moisturizer so will see if that works</li>
            <li> I started using this along with an anti-aging firming serum so I don&#x27;t know which one is REALLY working or if they&#x27;re both doing the job, but I have never had such smooth, clear skin.  I have had acne-prone skin, discoloration, and large pores and these 2 products have really made a difference in my skin.  I still don&#x27;t have perfect skin and I still have pores that are pretty dominant, however, I have never been happier with the texture and tone of my skin.</li>
            <li> It smells really subtle but I can&#x27;t quite decide if I like the smell or not.  Mostly I just notice it.  I can&#x27;t speak to the firming part of the product, I have not specifically noticed any firming, but maybe my skin does not need it as much as some people&#x27;s skin.  I ordered it to help fight aging, not because I was looking for a cure to change what mother nature has already done.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great. I use seceveral serums and this is one of the best. I will order again.</li>
            <li> Well sometimes husbands get things right!  I didn’t buy this because I thought my wife was aging as she’s perfect to me. No smart husband would ever buy an anti-aging serum for his wife unless she out right told you she wanted one. Try that and you may end up sleeping on the couch a few nights. Back to the products – bought both the serum and moisturizer and it’s an absolute hit. My better half says the combination of a lot of peptides and other really great ingredients is doing the trick of decreasing lines and her lovely face is more radiant. She’s happy, I’m happy and we’re both happy with these products! Thanks to the folks at Visio Elan! Great company.</li>
            <li> I am a very fair skinned Caucasian over forty.  If it has made a difference, these past several weeks, in my opinion, it is ever so slight.</li>
            <li> My daughter purchased this for me. She raves about it, and while its only been 10 days, it does seem to be doing nice things for my skin. It&#x27;s amazing how your skin tightens right away and I do think I&#x27;m seeing fine lines disappear so far. Going to give this another few weeks and will return and update my review. Packaged in a pretty box with an insert. I joined their VIP program too.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an affordable peptide serum and this one did the trick.  I am seeing improvement in the first few days, and hope for more</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it day and night under my moisturizer . My skin looks firmer after just three weeks, looking to purchase more. I am adding to my old review I used all of their products for about two years and then I stopped to find something that was cheaper. Well you get what you pay for it is been a year since I stopped using the products and now I am back I find the serum Tita well you get what you pay for it is been a year since I stopped using the products and now I am back I find the serum  erases some fine lines but I like most about it is that it gives my skin very bright look</li>
            <li> makes your skin feel smooth still got the wrinkles lol</li>
            <li> Feels good on my skin. Like the ingredients. Too soon to tell if there is a noticeable difference to skin appearance.</li>
            <li> Not really the results I wanted. It is a good quick &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34;, but I was looking for something a little more nourishing for my skin and help with elasticity. I did find what I was looking for though. Maybe this product is good for other people.</li>
            <li> I used it for 3 weeks and it is almost gone,&lt;br /&gt;Did not see any significant change at all. Although I don&#x27;t have any  deep wrinkles to begin with.</li>
            <li> Reduces my brown spot after 3-4 use only.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift and my mother in law loves it. She says it makes her feel young again</li>
            <li> I love the way this product. I felt the firmness in my skin right away. I will certainly continue using it and hopefully I will see results with time.</li>
            <li> After using this serum just a short time, I’ve stopped using retinol.  My 50 year old face looks great and part of that may be stopping retinol. The amount of proven and effective peptides in this serum is a big plus. Finding what works for your face can be a long process. I thought retinol worked well until buying this. I see fine lines disappearing and wrinkles on their way.  I can’t wait to see how that improves after a month or more. You need a small drop and I took the suggestion of moistening face first. Then again, the more you put on, the tighter your skin becomes. I have recommended this to quite a few friends. A real find!</li>
            <li> My husband told me my skin look great. This is the first time I used this product . After he told me that I&#x27;m ordering some more.</li>
            <li> I really saw a difference and that&#x27;s I really liked it I will purchase it again</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised....good product!</li>
            <li> Glides on, non greasy, right under my makeup!</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a week now and I can already see some improvements. You only have to use a small amount and it&#x27;s very light and absorbs well. Very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> I hate to write bad reviews especially after only using a product for a week but this serum clogged my pores immediately and made me break out. I never get pimples and I woke up with 4 after I started using this serum. It could just be how it reacts with my skin. I personally will not use it again. I also did not like how it penetrated the skin immediately causing a person to have to use a large a amount to cover their face and neck. This product just did not work well for me.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my mom and she loves it!</li>
            <li> Love love love it,will continue to buy it forever</li>
            <li> serum feels good on skin, I has been 2 weeks, as of yet I can tell no difference in look of skin, spots, or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Love this serum. Not only does it make my skin feel tighter, but my skin LOOKS better too.</li>
            <li> I have been trying and trying to find something that would help my 50 year old skin and reduce pore size and have not found anything that really worked very well,... until this!  This serum is fabulous!!!  I absolutely love it!  I apply after using Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera (which is also great) and then apply moisturizer after this serum.</li>
            <li> It feel good on my skin but truthfully, I don&#x27;t notice any difference. I will give it another month to see if there are any changes.</li>
            <li> Product has 3 peptides and it works, however, there is not very much of it for the price.  I would recommend however.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful serum.  Results are not immediate.  You need to give it time and you will be very happy you did.  I plan on reordering.  The company also keeps in touch with you to see how you like the product.</li>
            <li> Product is packaged well. No smell really. It feels nice on my skin but I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes to my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying it for the last couple of weeks - and so far not too much change.  Maybe it takes longer. It does go on smoothly and it&#x27;s easy to appyly.</li>
            <li> I have not yet finished the first bottle but love how it feels on my skin and is absorbed quickly with no sticky residue feeling.  Plan to buy another bottle to really give it a chance to do some good on my sagging skin.</li>
            <li> I likes the product but after one month, I am waiting to see if it really works.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the customer service is outstanding.  Had a problem with one bottle and it was taken care of immediately and pleasantly.</li>
            <li> Bottle came half full</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Very Nice and works!!</li>
            <li> Great serum. Overall im satisfied with this product. It&#x27;s better than I thought it would be. This serum will definitely firm your skin and help with scars. It will also lighten your dark spot in your face. I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Veryveryveruy good good good</li>
            <li> Anti-aging is essential in the age of the mid-30s. Capacity is small, but it was good to be able to purchase an affordable price. Well every time ~</li>
            <li> Saw a difference after 1 week!!!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my mother (49) to try and help firm and tighten her face and neck.  She absolutely loves this product, she can tell a significant difference from before to now.&lt;br /&gt;She has used this product for about two weeks, her wrinkles are less noticeable and she feels like her face, neck and her eyes are firmer.  It pumps out just enough to use on her targeted areas. She loves that it does not have a heavy feel to it, and it goes on very easily.  It also does not have an overly intense smell to it either, it is very mild compared to other products she has tried in the past.  The only thing she dislikes about the product is that it is a little sticky feeling after applying to the face, but it becomes smooth and absorbs into the skin within 30 seconds to 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;From my point of view, I can see a difference in my mother&#x27;s skin, ESPECIALLY her neck, which has been her biggest issue. Her skin looks and feels smoother, and the wrinkles are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;My mother and I both highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for plastic surgery results without the cost and surgery.  This is a great price for amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product at a reduced cost to provide my honest and unbiased opinion and this review is of my own without any compensation from the provider.</li>
            <li> Exquisite serum tightens skin, reduces pores and gives your skin a much more youthful appearance. This is a quality product that is using the latest technology to give you wonderful results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this serum, it sinks into my skin and after a couple of weeks i already see a difference. my skin is smooth and soft. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Amazing products . They really work and have helped even my skin tone and produce a genuine improvement in lines and texture too.. Love it</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I can really see a difference in my skin, especially around the mouth, where I had some pretty deep wrinkles.  They are so much less noticeable since I been using this product.  I will definitely reorder this product!!  I&#x27;ve used many creams &amp; lotions and everything inbetween, and this is the best by far, and I&#x27;m 73yrs old!!</li>
            <li> I use this with the cream and it is amazing.  Many compliments from strangers on my&lt;br /&gt;skin.</li>
            <li> This serum is great! No weird, funky smell and it immediately goes to work tightening your skin. I have added it into my nightly skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Less noticeable pores and skin feels softer.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this gift very happy</li>
