            <li> Have used this shampoo about 10-yrs, appears it is being discontinued. As a shampoo I have been satisfied, main reason is it rinses clean, minimal residue.

            <li> As one who is allergic to so many soaps and shampoos, I was pleased to see I could still obtain this from Amazon.  I wish they would start manufacturing it once again.</li>
