            <li>Awesome product!  </li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s the best thing for her acne.</li>
            <li>However, I discovered that this product works best as an acne treatment instead of as a mask.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>This is the best mask I have found.  </li>
            <li>I have always been told proactive is the best</li>

            <li>This mask is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>However, once I ordered it through Amazon and tried it, it was amazing!!  </li>
            <li>Stuff is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>For the money, it&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li>It works very good and helps with acne scars too.</li>
            <li>This price is absolutely incredible.</li>
            <li>Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li>superfast shipping, good price, excellent seller.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best mask I have found, even better than Clinique that I used before!</li>
            <li>am really happy to find a great price and a great vendor of this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great deal.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Great price and no monthly fee coming out of my account</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>and she doesn&#x27;t use it often for that reason, but it works great.</li>
            <li>and after i bought this i was so happy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about when they say they have experienced irritation, breakouts or redness from using Proactiv, i didn&#x27;t experience that.</li>
            <li>Great size for the price  </li>
            <li>This stuff is so great</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The Refining Mask works great for them.</li>
            <li>However, it will reduce the size greatly.</li>
            <li>This is definately a great buy.</li>
            <li>I got the Proactiv Solution Refining Mask as a freebie with my purchase of a 90 day 5-step system, and for awhile, I was really happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is great for blemishes and if you put it on overnight it clears it up by morning.  </li>
            <li>Great Service.</li>
            <li>Great product - my son is 15 and when he uses continuously it works great.</li>
            <li>My face has improved and I am happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Great product to eliminate zits.</li>
            <li>Regardless, the mask is great.  </li>
            <li>Works great as others have stated.</li>
            <li>so happy</li>
            <li>I do not like dealing with the Proactive ordering system, and was happy to find product on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another great use for this mask is as a blemish treatment; whenever I have a pimple, I apply a dot-size amount of the mask to the area and wear it overnight.  </li>
            <li>great stuff.</li>
            <li>Great product, put it on a pimple, blemish etc, it shrinks it and soothes it.</li>
            <li>Great product...does what it advertses.</li>
            <li>The mask is doing a great job in clearing up my complexion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with my skin</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>

            <li>I have used proactive for many years and this mask is INCREDIBLE!</li>
            <li>The sulfur in this product gives it an anti-inflammatory quality that is quite effective!</li>
            <li>I can say it honestly works!</li>
            <li>SKin look more even toned and BEAUTIFUL!!</li>
            <li>Love this product for many years!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent soothing treatment mask for acne and blemishes , easy application and removal, very effective mask for face , reduces inflammation</li>
            <li>Used for 2 months now-is a good product for its price, not he best I have used but one of the more affordable.</li>
            <li>That in itself is worth it!!!!</li>
            <li>Have used this stuff for many years and it works amazing!!</li>
            <li>Delivered on time, a good plus.</li>
            <li>and it wasnt good at all</li>
            <li>Works good..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this since it came out years ago.</li>
            <li>Works well to help fight acne and keep your skin looking good.</li>
            <li>She had gorgeous skin</li>
            <li>I have fairly oily skin in the summer and somewhat drier skin in the winter.</li>
            <li>This is just as good but a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good acne mask.</li>
            <li>its a good deal for proactive, but didn&#x27;t work for my skin.</li>
            <li>Best experience buying this product at a cheap price</li>
            <li>I loved this product.</li>
            <li>My daughter has used this product before and loved it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it works that good</li>
            <li>The price was good for a product that works well.</li>
            <li>Good value for the money.  </li>
            <li>The price is good.</li>
            <li>This is excellent for spot treating acne, leaving on overnight or using as a full face mask and rinsing off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to have my very own!</li>
            <li>very good  product for a  cheap price .  </li>
            <li>Glad to have found this and at a great price</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>- I love what it does for my skin!</li>
            <li>I just ordered some more!</li>
            <li>How many people can say THAT about an acne zapping product?!</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Make sure it is not expired before you order!</li>
            <li>and I love the glow it gives my skin!</li>
            <li>My daughter tried it too - and she was so pleased with the results, she bought her own tube!</li>
            <li>My grand kids SWEAR by this product!  </li>
            <li>Love this product and use it all the time!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Works better then prescription medication from a doctor!</li>
            <li>But I absolutely love this mask!</li>
            <li>Love Proactiv!</li>
            <li>What I do is use Dessert Essence face wash (which is amazing by the way, go ahead and look for it here on amazon.</li>
            <li>I have the orange one and it has AMAZING reviews), anyways I have use the Dessert Essence face wash</li>
            <li>Having used this product before,I know what an amazing and effective item it is on treating blemishes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really amazing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had amazing results.</li>
            <li>My face felt amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>Nice earthy smell,too.  </li>
            <li>Another tip: If you like strips like me, try putting the mask on after using the strips (you&#x27;ll want to rinse your face with warm water in between).</li>
            <li>I found the mask to be so-so, but it must be said that Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand</li>
            <li>(could be longer if you want), then rinsed off with warm water and cleanser</li>
            <li>Sulfur is making a comeback, after being a popular anti-acne medication years ago.  </li>
            <li>The seller put their own sticker on the box saying it was 2.5 ounces, but the printing on the Proactiv box says 1 ounce, and</li>
            <li>Honestly this is my holy grail spot treatment.</li>
            <li>I apply, hang out for twenty or thity minutes and rinse with warm water, or exfoliate with a warm wash cloth.</li>
            <li>She likes the mask, it has a nice smell and makes her face feel refreshed.  </li>
            <li>i bought this for the fact that most reviews were fairly good, tried it a couple of times.</li>
            <li>This is good too, but I feel there are better cheaper items out there.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spend money on this, for your own benefit.</li>
            <li>I have done my own experiment where I tested the refining mask on its own</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product and it really does work.  </li>
            <li>This is the one item you should definitely own.</li>
            <li>As others have said, this stuff doesn&#x27;t smell too great, but the smell is absolutely worth the results!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product this still makes my skin feel clean,  so it may depend on your condition.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, great for teenagers, young adults or anyone who wants to have great skin.</li>
            <li>I have had struggles with skin issues since high school and would have done anything to have perfect skin.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to be able to order them on my own timeline.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years, I think it&#x27;s great and the easiest way to get it quick is from Amazon.com</li>
            <li>I have been using the refining mask for many years, and I love it!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and love it.</li>
            <li>Its always nice to be able to purchase those salon/spa products on Amazon and have them shipped within 2 or 3 days.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>By far the best mask I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get the refining mask after hearing all the good things about it on TV.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see that I could order it by itself and for such a great price.</li>
            <li>this is a sulfur based acne product, smells funny, works great.</li>
            <li>So happy when I used this for the first time.</li>
            <li>great way to heal pimples fast and make them disappear overnight!</li>
            <li>Super product!!</li>
            <li>(very important to use a cleanser or else</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>After 4 times nightly apps, the zit is mostly gone.  </li>
            <li>I have been through so many too...</li>
            <li>I love this product it does work overnight</li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>love the mask, i use if for overnight and anytime i have a problem area coming on i</li>
            <li>I really like to use this weekly as a great mask for my acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of zits and most of them cause permanent scaring...</li>
            <li>How often can you say that about most products.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful facial mask.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>how many times I washed my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>works okay - not as well as i hoped</li>
            <li>I love the proactiv refining mask.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>With that said, it is not an overnight magic mask.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite products from proactiv, and I will re-purchase this product. :)</li>
            <li>Many friends have said it does not work.  </li>
            <li>Better buying here then from the malls in the kiosk, you will spend a lot more then here.</li>
            <li>but it seems to love.</li>
            <li>and it really worked great.</li>
            <li>and the proactive has a greater sulfur percent and also 2.5 oz for $10 give or take.</li>
            <li>It is more convenient buying here instead of the Proactiv website.</li>
            <li>, if it works, I will buy more.</li>
            <li>I love the Proactive skin care</li>
            <li>Love the proactive face mask.</li>
            <li>as most sulfur is - but now in pharmaceuticals its scent is masked by fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like pro-activ, but I LOVE this mask :)  </li>
            <li>i even boke out more</li>
            <li>/&gt;good buy, good price, worth it.</li>
            <li>I would not be able to keep my acne under control.  </li>
            <li>It works even better than the lotion.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to use the entire Proactiv line, but this mask is awesome.</li>
            <li>This refining mask was just ok...</li>
            <li>this mask literally must be magic.</li>
            <li>love love love love.</li>
            <li>I am glad I am able to buy that separately.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this refining mask by proactiv.</li>
            <li>Love love love this mask.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Works ok but is overpriced</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as magical as the &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li>I HAVE TRIED SO MANY ACNE PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>and it really works great.</li>
            <li>I also use it at night to target a specific area of breakout if needed and it works great!!!</li>
            <li>Our son believes this is a magic cream.  </li>
            <li>I hope it&#x27;s a product I&#x27;ll be able to obtain from here on out. &#x3D;}</li>
            <li>Cleans pores out better than most cleansers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This is probably the best of proactive&#x27;s products if you get the occasional pimple.</li>
            <li>Glad to buy this product from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One application (or the most two) used to eliminate any erupting &amp;#34;blemish&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my favorite proactive product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a spot corrector.  </li>
            <li>you just have to put it in the spot were you need it the most.</li>
            <li>glad I made the purchase</li>
            <li>so i am glad that i read some review and ordered it and it came before its suppose to.</li>
            <li>Acnomel also has sulfur but the combination in the Acnomel works much better than in this mask.</li>
            <li>Works better then</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin more polish.</li>
            <li>If used twice in a week, I get better results.</li>
            <li>Love proactiv products</li>
            <li>and my skin feels so much better.</li>
            <li>Its important to moisturize with step three!</li>
            <li>and on top of that I saw no results from using this.</li>
            <li>It is the best facial products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I feel cosmetic planets sulfur mask is better.</li>

            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel that it worked any better than anything else I had tried already.</li>
            <li>I have had severe acne for years now, and i used this on top of Accutane.</li>
            <li>I know better now.</li>
            <li>its okay.  </li>
            <li>This product works okay for me.</li>
            <li>u feel a difference its the best facial cleanser any1 can have!</li>
            <li>This is what really takes care of my acne and I&#x27;m so happy it works for my skin.</li>
            <li>My face is satisfied.</li>
            <li>but when I feel or see a red bump forming underneath my skin (the prelude to a wonderful full-blown zit!)</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this refining mask, and love than I can buy it here without subscribing through the company as I can&#x27;t use the rest of the products.</li>
            <li>Dries pimples up fast and leaves skin feeling silky smooth!!!  </li>
            <li>This one SHRINKS my pores to almost non-existance and because it has incredible drying agents it really gets rid of existing pimples quickly when used as an Overnight Spot Treatment.</li>
            <li>this mask is just magic, one application and it cleans up any stuborn pimple so quick, so effective.  </li>
            <li>The acne on my forehead had faded significantly!  </li>
            <li>The best part about this stuff is that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin overly dry.  </li>
            <li>I would easily purchase more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Strongly suggest anyone suffering with acne buy this immediately so you can enjoy the rest of your life acne-free!</li>
            <li>The tube is huge, effective and cheap.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of removing old skin and refreshing the face</li>
            <li>Great for mild acne &amp; during the hot months in the summer.</li>
            <li>I am not acne prone, but I love how smooth and even textured my skin is after use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of Acne Free&#x27;s spot 10% Benzoyle peroxide treatment, but this face mask works even better.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love it and now that i know how cheap it is on amazon</li>
            <li>AND MOST IMPORTANTLY</li>
            <li>Its pretty good it does tighten your pores and makes your skin smooth it draws out the dirt.the</li>
            <li>My seller was The Acne Prevention Place, fast shipping and good packaging.</li>
            <li>The speed at which I was able to get a blemish free face, upon receiving the product very quickly, makes for for an A+ in my book.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t think that it would benefit very sensitive skin types, as sulfur can cause more harm than good.</li>
            <li>Also, I just happen to LOVE the smell, and using sulphur was unique for me.</li>
            <li>Have tried other sulfur based products and this works the best out of all.</li>
            <li>It is excellent for acne whether young or older!</li>
            <li>This is for sure a great deal for an add-on item which only costs you a couple bucks!</li>
            <li>Easy application and removal.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this purchase of Proactive Refining Mask and will buy more of this product and brand in the future.</li>
            <li>It was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>Strong sulfer scent   </li>
            <li>not have a strong smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no longer a strong supported as I was before. .</li>
            <li>The sulphur smell is quite strong  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is beautiful for when my skin acts up before my period, or when i have a big bump comming</li>
            <li>If the refining function is true, then I will add more contents to this review.</li>
            <li>this stuff is great , clears acne, so does clearskin acne kit, clean and clear face wash, and queen helene</li>
            <li>I first used this from a free sample and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>It works best after a shower when skin is soft and the \\&quot;gunk,\\&quot; in your Tzone is soft, too.</li>
            <li>I notice a huge difference on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love proactiv, and this mask makes my feel fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not only a miracle cream I have used for years but a great value as well.</li>
            <li>Great product,  the entire family uses it.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it great at combating the acne itself, it reduced redness quite a bit as well.</li>
            <li>All in all, it works the same and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous mask that makes your face look and feel cleaner.</li>
            <li>Worked great as a hormone-crazed teen, too.</li>
            <li>A lot of people have had success with it, and I am sure that it is not a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li>I got the product and the shipping was smooth</li>
            <li>But the refining mask is a great skin care &amp;#34;staple&amp;#34; for a twice a month deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I do enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 18 and have light, acne prone combination skin.</li>
            <li>It was a free trial size-</li>
            <li>I spot treat lightly at night and in the morning</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li>Great for those acne prone teens or those of us in our latter 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>B00LFT0CFI TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment &amp;#x2605;</li>
            <li>It makes your face look &amp; feel really smooth, but thats about IT.</li>
            <li>have dried and worked wonderfully at getting rid of a pimple overnight.  </li>
            <li>I always have a tube available.</li>
            <li>I love this product, this was actually my favorite item from the whole kit.</li>
            <li>Works good on clearing up your face, takes a few treatments to see results, but one they start its good...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good mask but don&#x27;t put it near your eyes because of the sulfur in the product.  </li>
            <li>According to my son, this is the absolute best for diminishing acne marks, especially pimples and zits that are just beginning to form.</li>
            <li>I mean, it is a good mask to use here &amp; there, but its no miracle worker, and def does NOTTT \\&quot;zap pimples away overnight\\&quot; as advertised lol</li>
            <li>I would also recommend using it right after you come out of the shower, as your skin is thoroughly moisturized and your pores are in better shape for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very rarely I would get it.</li>
            <li>It is also great as a spot treatment if you feel a blemish starting - dries it right up!  </li>
            <li>:) just be aware it does bleach clothing and hair and don&#x27;t put huge amounts</li>
            <li>leaves my face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Great for frequent use, with a higher end brand once a month or so.</li>
            <li>Not terrible but Your not getting your full moneys worth.</li>
            <li>As an adult I have occassional acne when I spend too much time smoking and drinking and partying like a rockstar, and this is the perfect arsenal in my fight to stay young and handsome looking.</li>
            <li>I suspect it is much too strong to use as directed by most.</li>
            <li>but nothing too overpowering, worth the results!</li>
            <li>but I have been using it for a while and dont feel that it is original</li>
            <li>The first day I used this product I fell in love with it</li>
            <li>There is a significant decrease in her acne.</li>
            <li>Put moisturizer first, then apply on top of acne or pimple.</li>
            <li>Good product helps my skin to feel and look better even helps when I have a break out to clear it up faster thanks</li>
            <li>Remember, for BEST results, use this mask after your shower, or steam your face carefully over a pot of hot water with a towel (to catch the steam) and apply when skin is warm and soft. &#x3D;</li>
            <li>Effectively helps to cleanse existing acne and to prevent new acne from forming.</li>
            <li>Love being able to buy the one product that I need instead of dealing with Proactive directly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a refreshing mask that leaves such a nice &#x27;clean&#x27; feeling.    </li>
            <li>When you buy the mask directly from proactive you will pay much more (like $20 or $30 more).</li>
            <li>All in all a great product, but if you have dry skin already, you may want to pass this up.</li>
            <li>/month just to clean your pores.</li>
            <li>It works GREAT to dry it out ~ overnight.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel, so smooth, soft, and tingly clean!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fair price for something i feel has a huge potential to work on most peoples acne problems, because it really helps mine</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the formula was officially changed or what, but this refining mask product has not been nearly as effective as it was before when it was not so much a flat cream as it was an exfoliating and refreshing face mask.</li>
            <li>After that week though, I stopped using on large areas (my jawline, where I breakout the most).</li>
            <li>The before and after is TV-worthy…it clears your skin right up!  </li>
            <li>Love The way it make my face look clear and fresh !!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only good things about Proactiv&#x27;s line, IMO.</li>
            <li>I think the products themselves probably DO benefit someone with severe acne or very oily skin, but i am guessing that it was OVER drying my skin &amp; creating more problems over all.</li>
            <li>I really love the proactiv refining mask, but I didn&#x27;t want the whole product line.</li>
            <li>It feels good to have this product in my bag of tricks for sudden flare-ups.</li>
            <li>&quot; - it&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>and it really does make your skin look better.  </li>
            <li>Good product, and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s very affordable here on amazon, unlike the proactiv website  .</li>
            <li>Arrived fast love the product</li>
            <li>yes it is true.  </li>
            <li>this is good for getting the bumps away but it drys my face and if you stop use it the bumps will come back</li>
            <li>2.5 Oz last a good while.</li>
            <li>i love this mask so much.</li>
            <li>However, I rarely need to use the Proactiv Refining Mask anymore because my acne has been cured by a homeopathic remedy available at Amazon.com but is cheaper at Wal-mart:</li>
            <li>I originally tried this product when I was 15 and now 6 years later its still my favorite blemish clearer :)</li>
            <li>The active ingredient (sulfur 8%) is great for healing acne.</li>
            <li>This mask makes my face feel so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I use this and the medicated soap and it leaves me skin feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Leaves face fresh, clean and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the item shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>And if I don&#x27;t catch it in time, the mask helps it go away quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment.</li>
            <li>but this seems to get them under control quickly.  </li>
            <li>I saw this advertised on tv as a quick overnight remedy for blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate that it can be used as a quick remedy or an overnight mask.</li>
            <li>If you have persistent acne or mild acne</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for offering such a great product to us.</li>
            <li>plus I got it fast its a big savings totally happy</li>
            <li>Love being able to purchase Proactiv products without having to go through the actual Proactiv company and to sign up for the program</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find this as an individual purchase.  </li>
            <li>It makes for a good excuse to take a long soak in the tubby and makes my face feel really good.</li>
            <li>But this was such a fantastic buy and great price,I will certainly buy more from this seller in the future!</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know if the product is just too strong or my skin is not use to it, but it made me break out really</li>
            <li>But the way I use it works great, and it lasts a really long time since I don&#x27;t use much at a time.</li>
            <li>When I washed it off the next day in the shower, my face looked SO much better!  </li>
            <li>THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I PURCHASED ANY PROACTIVE PRODUCT AND IM HOOKED!</li>
            <li>I started using it before I got pregnant with my six year old daughter, when I was told that I would not be able to take my acne medications during a pregnancy.</li>
            <li>THE TV.IT CAME IN A NICE LITTLE PACKAGE FOR A VERY CHEAP PRICE</li>
            <li>Doesnt work as advertised on tv, but leaves skin VERY smooth and soft</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t see any significant or even minor change on my skin while using this product.</li>
            <li>The mask did calm the blemish and it made it easier for me to remove.  </li>
            <li>The treeactiv oil is amazing as well, just wish I would have figured this out ten years ago!</li>
            <li>Fresh well within expiration dates.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>She says it even hurts to smile.   </li>
            <li>It was worth a try</li>
            <li>Within 24 more hours it has healed completely.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy to find it on Amazon and the size is larger than I expected.</li>
            <li>I am now completely acne free and have been for years!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>For me it took two months, but it was well worth waiting</li>
            <li>This is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>but fresh and youthful.  </li>
            <li>It gets the job done, but I have to use several layers for it to be somewhat effective against my acne...</li>
            <li>I use it most frequently as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li>This is the only item in the Proactiv kit that has been continuously effective, to me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much cheaper and more convenient to buy right here on Amazon rather than going through Proactiv directly, which can be a huge pain.  </li>
            <li>Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands....</li>
            <li>When I first ordered Proactiv, I recieved a small sample of the Refining Mask and I loved it!</li>
            <li>The other reason I LOVED this purchase was the affordable price.  </li>
            <li>I had very severe acne growing up and all throughout most of high school.</li>
            <li>Young people don&#x27;t get excited by much, but they DO get excited by this product, because it WORKS!</li>
            <li>the price was right</li>
            <li>I can see and feel a difference in my skin right after it is washed off.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>It is just not the right product for my skin.</li>
            <li>Doesnt do so much for my blemishes, but my face does feel clean, and refreshed after the mask.</li>
            <li>This product produced rough, dry patches on my face after using it as a mask, but I have found that it makes a wonderful spot treatment.  </li>
            <li>The treatment hardens leaving the formula on my face where it belongs instead of on my pillow case where most formulas generally end up.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t even work at all to be honest, i put this one for like 2 months and my face still looked exactly the same as when i first put it..</li>
            <li>I tried this mask as a 10 minute full mask and as a 10 minute spot mask and as an overnight spot treatment but really saw no improvement at all.</li>
            <li>I had used the purple Avon cleanser/mask for a long time, which I really liked and stayed on well.  </li>
            <li>It dried it out even more, and made me break out more.</li>
            <li>also got here SUPER fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve previously used the product and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some bump under my skin, i used benzoyl proxide and clindamycin ,nothing really work , but since I&#x27;m using this product ,my skin is so soft and without any break out , i love this product and i recommend it to everyone .</li>
            <li>it works very fast.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff defenitley worth a splurge !</li>
            <li>but it takes a few times maybe before you see those kind of results.. but works better than most of the other stuff I bought before.</li>
            <li>My daughter used the 3 step process every night for the first five days, without any problems.</li>
            <li>the first couple times I used it.</li>
            <li>I tried using the Proactiv system &amp; my skin went from having an occasional break out to having MANY blemishes &amp; pimples.</li>
            <li>5 big fat stars for this one for sure.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it.</li>
            <li>(Proactiv products are mostly for people with light/ teen acne).</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great addition to the regular proactiv program, but this is really the only part I use.</li>
            <li>Finally, after a couple more months I looked at the end and saw it had expired in 2007...</li>
            <li>On a lighter note, if it is not expired, this product works very well!</li>
            <li>Definitely recomend it! :)</li>
            <li>Most likely if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, what you have is a mite condition or bedbug condition</li>
            <li>I love using masks with all kinds of different benefits!</li>
            <li>The first time I tried the Refining Mask by Proactiv</li>
            <li>but the product arrived and it is exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to order more from this same vendor</li>
            <li>more irritated and red.</li>
            <li>This is the first Proactiv product I bought</li>
            <li>so when I wake up in the mornings my face feels so much clearer and fresh.</li>
            <li>It works fast too!</li>
            <li>SO FAST!</li>
            <li>no uncomfortable....</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>and I most likely will not buy this again.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call this a mask.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>It really is well worth the money</li>
            <li>Once you can get past the smell and are aware that taking it off fully might take more than a minute then you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I use Proactive cleansing facial wash, treatment cream and my favorite: this mask.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t leave it on a second more than the 10 minutes suggested.</li>
            <li>I would look into a pill called Doxycycline, it kills the bacteria within the body that creates the acne in the first place.</li>
            <li>I use it as a spot treatment and it works very well!</li>
            <li>WORKS!IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>Sure beats paying regular price at the mall.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve very familiar with facial products.</li>
            <li>not much for acne marks but great for skin overall!!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>I use it mostly for spot treatment for a breakout since my skn is very sensitive and most acne treatments are too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li>really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time.</li>
            <li>I have not used it as a full face mask yet, but I have not had any adverse reaction so far, and hope that will continue.</li>
            <li>The claim to reduce acne is true, sulfur naturally kills bacterial acne and therefore will help acne.</li>
            <li>It helps prevent breakouts and helps current breakouts heal super quickly.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and was the product my son needed to clear up his acne</li>
            <li>I buy this mask for my 17 year old granddaughter and it clears up her face quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and it does sort of dry your face out but not horrible.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m single</li>
            <li>the proactive had a large crack in the bottom and product was smeared all over inside of envelope.  </li>
            <li>I use this on spots where i might have breakouts or even large pores.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, great price, really does remove acne pimple and drains pus without busting pimple in a day or two, if pimple kinda big &amp; red might take a few days more..</li>
            <li>I only use it at need and that seems to be getting the job done just fine.</li>
            <li>They come once every month at a very high price, unless you make it known that you do not want the product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing they have tried that really does a SUPER job on their acne!  </li>
            <li>When I called proactiv I was told just the tube would cost around $30, then I was told it would be cheaper for me to buy the whole &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; for $29.99 and get the mask as a free gift (smaller size mask) FYI</li>
            <li>Real stuff.</li>
            <li>Sulfur works really well though, and that&#x27;s whats in this.</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;ve had this product for a month now, I can&#x27;t really tell whether it has any effect on my skin.  </li>
            <li>bought proactive package, and didnt use it much, except this mask</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to buy the whole Proactiv system</li>
            <li>This product works really well.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like this mask quite well.</li>
            <li>Much rather purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel really cleaned out afterwards, without drying you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My forehead tends to be oily and this mask really helps with that quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>I expected this product to work better than it did, truth be told.</li>
            <li>Also fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace my empty bottle of DERMAdoctor Ain&#x27;t Misbehav&#x27;in sulfur mask which I do like better because of the lid pump, it doesn&#x27;t smell like baby butt cream like proactive</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much for black/white heads.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>It does a really god job of drying the pimple out if worn through the night.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this refining mask reduce my acne problem without me having to intaking any medication.</li>
            <li>In my experience this product works very well as an overnight treatment.</li>
            <li>warning, can be very drying.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>I figured this wouldn&#x27;t work which is why I didn&#x27;t purchase the whole line or order from proactive.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>And its much cheaper here on amazon.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son, and it really works.  </li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is much cheaper than the proactiv website where they want you to buy their &amp;#34;system&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>this would auto-sign me up for the monthly proactiv system to be sent to me, and auto charge my CC!.&lt;br /&gt;***Thank goodness for Amazon where I can get the bigger tube for just $6.50 + free shipping with student prime.</li>
            <li>REally gets rid of acne fast.</li>
            <li>and it really makes a noticeable difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li>i expected more from the product w/</li>
            <li>so I can sleep comfortably and wake up with smaller zits as well!!</li>
            <li>i couldn&#x27;t believe the price and this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>hmmm maybe proactive just doesn&#x27;t work for me, and i have bought the whole system as a teenager...</li>
            <li>I really like using this as a mask and for spot treatment.  </li>
            <li>very useful&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
            <li>This purifying mask really does reduce the look and size of pores.  </li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth, pores are smaller, and skin has a clarified appearance.</li>
            <li>You can really see a difference.</li>
            <li>have used the whole line before</li>
            <li>However, the Proactiv Soution Refinding Mask really does help.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using it!</li>
            <li>but it did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>It clears stuff up really well.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my face too.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I rinse or scrub afterwards with a face towel, the smell still lingers.    </li>
            <li>It really does leave my skin softer and shrinks the pores.  </li>
            <li>I was totally pleased that it arrived well before expected.</li>
            <li>I really like this mask.  </li>
            <li>My face suffers from both of these factors greatly!</li>
            <li>I use this as overnight treatment for pimples, and have had as much luck with it as I&#x27;ve had with any benzoyle peroxide product.</li>
            <li>it can be very drying.</li>
            <li>Proactive Solution Refining Mask really does work, and it saved my skin.</li>
            <li>I was amazed on how fast it cleared spots up.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;d been buying this mask in the stores and paying twice as much.  </li>
            <li>Really ??  </li>
            <li>And it really helps to get rid of all the acne on your face.</li>
            <li>Be it that i have very oily skin..</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING for me.  </li>
            <li>All I know is that benzoyl peroxide really helps my skin.</li>
            <li>It worked with my acne, but I really don&#x27;t get much of zits.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it as a mask (spread over my whole face and washed off) because it&#x27;s too drying for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Sulfur products work very well on my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this mask feels when I use it.  </li>
            <li>I  do not have acne, but I do have very severe eczema.</li>
            <li>and it really helps.  </li>
            <li>Works fast and since I have oily/combination skin</li>
            <li>Going even further, if you work out daily, there is nothing better than working out, taking a long hot shower, slapping on a mask and enjoying a cup of tea afterwords.</li>
            <li>Most of the time it works over night if I catch them early enough.</li>
            <li>So far so good, but I have to wait to see the effect the product can provide after a few weeks.</li>
            <li>three years old at the time of purchase!!!</li>
            <li>Dont expect it to clear up anything huge, minor blemishes it will clear up, and smooth out your skin, but, if you&#x27;re breaking out, you will continue to break out.</li>
            <li>It works great as a traditional mask; I cover the blackhead prone areas and recent blemishes and am left with a more healed, less irritated face.</li>
            <li>She was excited, because it is the only thing that works on her acne without causing her pain or anything.</li>
            <li>Once you order from an advertisement or a special in the newspaper or visa advertisement, the company just automatically sends shipments of their product at two to three times the introductive price and you are obligated to pay for them, unless you choose to pay to have them sent back.  </li>
            <li>Like countless others, I purchased ProActiv products from a specially priced offer, which included reoccurring shipments of products.</li>
            <li>I love the mask because it actually works and does not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>I use benzoyl peroxide (Neutrogena Clear Pore) wash every day; this mask is for the major clean up duty.</li>
            <li>I apply it to any new large break out pimples.</li>
            <li>The only product in the entire Proactiv system that I actually saw good results with is this refining</li>
            <li>It effectively dries out oily skin, but does not cause excessive drying as the higher-concentration benzoyl peroxide treatments can do.</li>
            <li>Not sure how effective it will be if I continue using it.</li>
            <li>I usually steam my face first---the directions says to apply to dampened skin--then apply the mask, wait 15 or 20 minutes (the directions say 10 minutes, but I like to wait a bit longer) then removed with warm water, or a moist washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling super clean and tight.....</li>
            <li>this mask has been the best spot treatment, the smell is off putting and a little hard to get use to</li>
            <li>When contacted the distributor they told me to mail it back to them at my cost with a card inside the original package (which was covered with the cream) saying we wanted a new one shipped to us.   </li>
            <li>but this I couldn&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stopped using the rest of the Proactiv as I have found better for less.</li>
            <li>- so think a less potent rotten-egg type smell).</li>
            <li>I initially thought i would try it because i am a daily make-up wearer &amp; thought if my skin was good/clear now, than using Proactiv would make it even BETTER.</li>
            <li>This product is decent for it&#x27;s money.</li>
            <li>Main point: this stuff doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for a few times, but i feel good when I put it on.</li>
            <li>Of course it depends on what type of skin you have, but I find this does work decently well as a spot treatment for me.</li>
            <li>The main disadvantage though is the smell.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s also because I&#x27;m getting older, but I think this mask has a lot to do with it.</li>
            <li>I thought the $500 Chanel cream was the only product that worked well and quickly.</li>
            <li>left them even more red...</li>
            <li>My daughters use this particular item from the line to &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; treat a pimple before it develops.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s either ready to be squeezed if you&#x27;re into that or it has disappeared completely!</li>
            <li>If you use Proactiv but can&#x27;t get rid of blackheads, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My granddauter has been using this since high school.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for spot treatment.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>The real question is do you want to have clear skin for a day and then wake up the next morning only to have more acne?</li>
            <li>I tried the Proactive system when I was in high school.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, to all, for blemishes</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone with acne.</li>
            <li>The blemish I covered the night before is either completely gone (95% of the time) or SIGNIFICANTLY better (the other 5% of the time).</li>
            <li>This refining mask is (for me) far too strong to apply to my entire face, which is neither sensitive nor oily.&lt;br /&gt;However, it works wonders when used as a spot treatment for those stubborn pimples that do appear from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Even without the proactiv system you can just put this on your clean face for ten min until it dries then just rinse for a few seconds since it comes off incredibly easy and when it&#x27;s off your face is immediately smooth and soft and looks almost air brushed since your pores will be invisible immediately.</li>
            <li>Of the entire line, the mask is hands down my favorite!</li>
            <li>I love this little mask.  </li>
            <li>I love this little proactiv, as soon as u wash it off</li>
            <li>In my repertoire I currently have this product, Queen Helene, Clean and Clear benzoyl peroxide scrub, L&#x27;Oreal toner, Biore strips, and the Olay Pro-X system.</li>
            <li>This mask smells very unpleasant--just like sulfur--and I cannot consciously recommend this product after my own negative experience.</li>
            <li>and it really helps clear it up without overdrying.</li>
            <li>Ive ordered this mask directly from proactive and the consistency was much thicker than when I ordered through amazon.</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel so, so soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>about 98% of the time this will stop a developing pimple overnight and on those rare occasions they get bigger but will fade away over time.</li>
            <li>Recommend to use on those spot out breaks and monthly on normal skin with min outbreak.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I over live for this product..</li>
            <li>I have used this as a mask and it really does help to bring all the stuff out of your face, BUT what I mostly use it for is it I feel a pimple coming or when that decides to come about through the night OR that dreaded hormonal pimple that comes and is hard as rock</li>
            <li>though i&#x27;ve outgrown my acne over the years i have to say this is the only mask that actually does zap huge zits and make them dissapeer.</li>
            <li>I had some whiteheads on my chin area and so far this mask has dried most of them up.  </li>
            <li>will dry up acne QUICK.</li>
            <li>When you first use this stuff it does help your skin somewhat, but after awhile your skin becomes more resistant and I found that every place you would dab this shit it would actually do the exact opposite of what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li>The instructions on the package make it very clear this is an acne treatment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 22 and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive skin, try a spot test on your neck or something to see how you react to it before putting it all over your face</li>
            <li>i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It smells a little funky, but leaves my skin soft and feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>It helps to keep my skin clear (in conjunction with the other Proactiv 3-step products) &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>and my skin will stay clear!</li>
            <li>I use the wash and this poroduct - keeps my skin clear and almost glowing!</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>My skin is just normal and this helps keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>Instead of damaging the outer layer of skin to shrink pimples, it heals from the instead and makes my skin soft and glowing!</li>
            <li>Most of my acne clusters were gone within a few weeks!</li>
            <li>but I get dryness afterwards and perhaps more breakouts, so I&#x27;m not sure if it works.</li>
            <li>i used this product the first time i got it, it did not get rid of my acne, but it did reduced it, and then the next 3 days my acne would increase.</li>
            <li>Its the exact same product.</li>
            <li>I had used proactive for many years in the past.  </li>
            <li>all noticed a big difference the first night she used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different products and it seems like nothing really works except few products that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Put a little on your acne before bed and it clears up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean as deep as I would like it to, but it does get the basic job done.</li>
            <li>The other nice thing is that you do not have to purchase the entire LINE of products from Proactive or have them talk you into the &amp;#34;auto&amp;#34; ship- that was always a big turn off for me with Proactive.</li>
            <li>Not too messy and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve used tons of acne products, and when I say tons I mean pretty much everything that&#x27;s available in stores, and then several prescription products.</li>
            <li>I tried this one night at a friend&#x27;s house, when a rather large pimple was just starting to show it&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>I am a little skeptical about it being the real deal , tonight is the first night I applied the mask , hopefully I&#x27;m not disappointed in the morning :)</li>
            <li>overnight\\&quot; effect that many customers swear by in the commercial; it did succeed in drying up my acne, relieving any active zits of their redness, and generally accelerating the rate at which they healed.</li>
            <li>PLUS, IT ACTUALLY SMELLS DECENT!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product for when my skin feels dull or I see blackheads - you put it on for 5 minutes then wash it off.  </li>
            <li>but stinks to no end like sulfer and bleaches anything it touches lol</li>
            <li>but my face was as clear as it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li>having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does work, though, as I saw my skin clear up after about 5 uses.</li>
            <li>Anytime I have a problem zit, or need to have amazingly clear skin for an event, I use this product.</li>
            <li>It helps clear my skin with just one use.</li>
            <li>and I wake up with clear skin.</li>
            <li>I tried everything I could find to clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li>AS WELL AS CLEAR MY SKIN UP.</li>
            <li>This was not my experience, but I do feel it helps blemishes to clear faster than without it.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>Helps to clear up my face and refine my pores.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, the next morning when I looked in the mirror, my blemish had completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>My pimples literally clear up overnight.</li>
            <li>Product worked well to clear up breakout without over drying the skin.</li>
            <li>I have used it as a spot treatment myself and find that it will clear up a breakout over night.</li>
            <li>Helps my son keep his skin clear.</li>
            <li>but it never worked to clear his skin.</li>
            <li>67 years old with ACNE?</li>
            <li>It completely reduced the size of the pimple and diminished the redness.  </li>
            <li>Well the mask has completely burned my daughters face.</li>
            <li>As far as the Refining Mask-</li>
            <li>Usually by it directly from poractiv, but</li>
            <li>Benzoyl Peroxide gives my extremely sensitive skin a severely allergic reaction, but this-</li>
            <li>But this massive advertised product doesn&#x27;t really work for me.   </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I suffer from adult acne.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t use much so it should last for a while</li>
            <li>I still use it because I feel like it&#x27;s at least doing something to make my skin better.</li>
            <li>but it really helps to use overnight on cystic acne especially.</li>
            <li>It dries COMPLETELY so it doesn&#x27;t rub off on my pillow or end up in my hair</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but overall it works really well.</li>
            <li>YOU HAVE SENSITIVE OR ACNE PRONE SKIN, PLEASE GIVE THE PROACTIV REFINING MASK</li>
            <li>If you leave the product on overnight, you will be pleasantly surprised when the sun comes up.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 13 year old daughter, she uses it twice a week.  </li>
            <li>I had my old tubes to compare the strength.  </li>
            <li>She has moderate acne and uses this product once a week along with the Proactive 3 pc Gentle Formula Clarifying Cleanser, Toner, Lotion.  </li>
            <li>I bought Adult Acnomel instead and I will continue to use that.</li>
            <li>In the middle of the night, I woke up because my face felt really itchy, but I didn&#x27;t think anything of it.</li>
            <li>a complete acne&lt;br /&gt;regime.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it works for it</li>
            <li>I have used this for years directly on a blemish.  </li>
            <li>Wow, $6 for a miracle pimple blaster.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it as a mask--a bit too drying for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Seriously it really does help reduce your pimples the next day or in a couple days.</li>
            <li>Only thing I&#x27;ve found that really fades and eliminates scars and blemishes.</li>
            <li>I tried the whole Proactiv treatment system but found that the only product that worked for me is the Refining Mask.</li>
            <li>By the next morning or the morning after for the real stubborn zits, they gone.</li>
            <li>This cleans it and the sulfur ingredient makes my skin soft again and helps with  the inflammation of the hives and cracked skin.</li>
            <li>Does not work nearly as well as Acne Free&#x27;s brand of sulfur mask for me, but still helped clear up a few blemishes as an overnight spot treatment; with two-three treatments, of course.</li>
            <li>It did make my face feel tight and clean</li>
            <li>Whenever I see or feel a breakout coming, I dab a little bit of this product on that spot and the size reduces significantly.</li>
            <li>i guess it for persons who  just want to get rid of very very very mild small bumps.</li>
            <li>This works great on my face especially when I have small pimples, I just put a little on my face for&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>I tried tons of products to get my constant acne to clear up, but it would only work for two weeks and then come back full force.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 years old and have battled moderate to severe acne on my face (mainly forehead and chin area) since high school and have tried just about every acne product under the sun that you can buy in stores as well as tried a couple of different prescriptions from my doctor, but NOTHING has worked.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this mask for the past several years and love it.  </li>
            <li>and it definitely works it made my pores a lot smaller the first time i use it.</li>
            <li>If you have large painful red nodular acne this is a great product to use.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t get my skin back to normal for weeks.</li>
            <li>Its not as expensive as other high end masks and works remarkably well for me.  </li>
            <li>Too bad they don&#x27;t sell the whole line at this good a discount</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m 30 and my skin has dried out, I use this mask once, or twice a week to clear my pores and to calm inflamed pimples.</li>
            <li>can really make your skin dry.</li>
            <li>It will probably be at least a week before she is able to use the 3 step process again, and then she will only use the mask as a spot treatment as needed.  </li>
            <li>I have wasted a lot of money on many products, but have found that this was money well spent.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and clear after using it for only a week.</li>
            <li>No harsh side effects like most acne products have, no drying out of skin or making it worse.  </li>
            <li>The night I put it on, I smoothed a thin layer on all over my problem areas on my face, left it on for 5 minutes, and washed it off with warm water.</li>
            <li>which is really lame because it worked wonderfully at first on most of my &#x27;open&#x27; pimples.</li>
            <li>i have a pretty greasy face, but use other acne products.</li>
            <li>I apply a small amount to clear skin before going to bed and it clears up quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I had an allergic reaction to this, or if my skin is just super sensitive.</li>
            <li>I do notice that when he skips a day or two, the acne comes back full force; however he is very active in sports activities and doesn&#x27;t wash his face as often as he should.</li>
            <li>There are very few items that I&#x27;ve found to really help with large pores and oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I generally try to use this mask once per week to help with acne, and it does help control acne.</li>
            <li>I used Proactiv as a teenager to keep my skin clear, and they sent the refining mask as an extra &#x27;gift&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I will say that following the instructions on this cream works well and helps clear acne.</li>
            <li>and it is starting to clear her face.</li>
            <li>She is still quite young, but I was concerned the problem would only worsen in the coming years</li>
            <li>However, when i have popped the blemish (yes, i know that any dermatoligist recommends NOT doing this) &amp; used the refining mask over night for several nights, then the blemish does seem to disappear (completely) within a week or so.</li>
            <li>I say dual action because this actually makes a stupendous spot treatment as well.</li>
            <li>I may be an adult, but I am still plagued by occasional acne and have bumps under the skin.</li>
            <li>My 12 year old has been breaking out since last year.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After far too years with acne I finally found this.</li>
            <li>Apparently, both she and her friend used it as a mask and spot treatment at night.</li>
            <li>When I was younger (teens and early twenties)</li>
            <li>My left eye became completely swollen and irritation all around my eye area.  </li>
            <li>, I will apply the refining mask to that area and the next day it will be completely gone.</li>
            <li>All Natural Acne Spot Treatment &amp;#x2605; Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!]].    </li>
            <li>I have suffered with adult onset cystic acne and regular acne for years.</li>
            <li>And within the last 5 years I have also developed mild rosacea that manifests in little red pimples predominantly on my nose that I want gone!  </li>
            <li>I say this cautiously because it may be disastrous for some of you with super sensitive skin, but I love the sensation, since I am always worried that my strips will dislodge something but not get it totally up</li>
            <li>I just bought a 60 day supply of Proactiv at the mall for my 12 year old daughter who has been consistently but mildly breaking out for the past few months.</li>
            <li>I certainly agree with the other reviewers about using after the shower.</li>
            <li>Six months later I broke out again due to stress but after taking the remaining two weeks of the remedy pills I have been basically acne-free for years, and only use the Proactiv Refining Mask every six months or so for the rare zit.</li>
            <li>It can be pretty drying though, so you may need to exfoliate for the slight skin peeling, and don&#x27;t forget to moisturize.  </li>
            <li>I have a very oily face and due to my job a lot of stress.</li>
            <li>This was my very 1st proactive purchase, and I will def be venturing out with other Proactive brand products.</li>
            <li>It dried up pimples real fast; it is part of my facial regime that i have been using it for over 6 years.</li>
            <li>However, my wife absolutely HATES the smell from the active ingredient SULFUR.</li>
            <li>Your pores will be wide open and ready.    </li>
            <li>However, when I applied this as a mask to my entire face and left it on for the recommended 10 minutes, it completely tore up my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a lot more expensive to buy directly or from the mall kiosks, so I stocked up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always tacky/sticky on my face and never dry</li>
            <li>Did not dry out skin.</li>
            <li>It did not dry at all on my face and all the ones I had purchased directly from proactive at a much higher cost in the past</li>
            <li>It does not dry like a normal mask, but rather has a gooey, sticky, wet feeling.  </li>
            <li>This does really help with reducing acne, I see major improvement if left on over night, other than that the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care for proactiv as a company due to the number of times they over charged me and added fees and double shipped orders then charged me for both.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Nature&#x27;s Cure for Men\\&quot; also worked fast for my teen nephew, and he spent the rest of his teen years acne-free!</li>
            <li>It cleared up anything the first few times.</li>
            <li>Its a much watered down version.</li>
            <li>I tried the whole proactive package for several months with no success.  </li>
            <li>However, the scent was not overwhelming and I was able to ignore it after a few nights.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s main active ingredient is sulfur</li>
            <li>Skin looks younger and does not dry skin.</li>
            <li>I use it 3 times a week, but if you have sensitive skin you should probably only use it once or twice a week because it can dry your skin out.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for my hormonal acne, I think it helped a little bit, but it&#x27;s definetley not a miracle product.</li>
            <li>I have been use proactiv, the effect can also, the price is very cheap, much cheaper than taobao, suggested that the occasional use, daily use, the result is bad, doubt may contain hormones</li>
            <li>My son suffers from cystic acne and this mask will clear up the most subborn of pimples.</li>

            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great price and no monthly fee coming out of my account</li>

            <li> This stuff is so great</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>

            <li> I do not like dealing with the Proactive ordering system, and was happy to find product on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another great use for this mask is as a blemish treatment; whenever I have a pimple, I apply a dot-size amount of the mask to the area and wear it overnight.  </li>

            <li> Works well to help fight acne and keep your skin looking good.</li>
            <li> She had gorgeous skin</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily skin in the summer and somewhat drier skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> This is just as good but a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good acne mask.</li>
            <li> its a good deal for proactive, but didn&#x27;t work for my skin.</li>
            <li> Best experience buying this product at a cheap price</li>
            <li> I loved this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter has used this product before and loved it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works that good</li>
            <li> The price was good for a product that works well.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money.  </li>
            <li> The price is good.</li>
            <li> This is excellent for spot treating acne, leaving on overnight or using as a full face mask and rinsing off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to have my very own!</li>
            <li> very good  product for a  cheap price .  </li>
            <li> Glad to have found this and at a great price</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> - I love what it does for my skin!</li>
            <li> I just ordered some more!</li>
            <li> How many people can say THAT about an acne zapping product?!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Make sure it is not expired before you order!</li>
            <li> and I love the glow it gives my skin!</li>
            <li> My daughter tried it too - and she was so pleased with the results, she bought her own tube!</li>
            <li> My grand kids SWEAR by this product!  </li>
            <li> Love this product and use it all the time!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Works better then prescription medication from a doctor!</li>
            <li> But I absolutely love this mask!</li>
            <li> Love Proactiv!</li>
            <li> What I do is use Dessert Essence face wash (which is amazing by the way, go ahead and look for it here on amazon.</li>
            <li> I have the orange one and it has AMAZING reviews), anyways I have use the Dessert Essence face wash</li>
            <li> Having used this product before,I know what an amazing and effective item it is on treating blemishes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really amazing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had amazing results.</li>
            <li> My face felt amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> Nice earthy smell,too.  </li>
            <li> Another tip: If you like strips like me, try putting the mask on after using the strips (you&#x27;ll want to rinse your face with warm water in between).</li>
            <li> I found the mask to be so-so, but it must be said that Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand</li>
            <li> (could be longer if you want), then rinsed off with warm water and cleanser</li>
            <li> Sulfur is making a comeback, after being a popular anti-acne medication years ago.  </li>
            <li> The seller put their own sticker on the box saying it was 2.5 ounces, but the printing on the Proactiv box says 1 ounce, and</li>
            <li> Honestly this is my holy grail spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I apply, hang out for twenty or thity minutes and rinse with warm water, or exfoliate with a warm wash cloth.</li>
            <li> She likes the mask, it has a nice smell and makes her face feel refreshed.  </li>
            <li> i bought this for the fact that most reviews were fairly good, tried it a couple of times.</li>
            <li> This is good too, but I feel there are better cheaper items out there.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend money on this, for your own benefit.</li>
            <li> I have done my own experiment where I tested the refining mask on its own</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and it really does work.  </li>
            <li> This is the one item you should definitely own.</li>
            <li> As others have said, this stuff doesn&#x27;t smell too great, but the smell is absolutely worth the results!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product this still makes my skin feel clean,  so it may depend on your condition.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great for teenagers, young adults or anyone who wants to have great skin.</li>
            <li> I have had struggles with skin issues since high school and would have done anything to have perfect skin.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to be able to order them on my own timeline.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, I think it&#x27;s great and the easiest way to get it quick is from Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I have been using the refining mask for many years, and I love it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and love it.</li>
            <li> Its always nice to be able to purchase those salon/spa products on Amazon and have them shipped within 2 or 3 days.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> By far the best mask I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get the refining mask after hearing all the good things about it on TV.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see that I could order it by itself and for such a great price.</li>
            <li> this is a sulfur based acne product, smells funny, works great.</li>
            <li> So happy when I used this for the first time.</li>
            <li> great way to heal pimples fast and make them disappear overnight!</li>
            <li> Super product!!</li>
            <li> (very important to use a cleanser or else</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> After 4 times nightly apps, the zit is mostly gone.  </li>
            <li> I have been through so many too...</li>
            <li> I love this product it does work overnight</li>
            <li> I love this mask.</li>
            <li> love the mask, i use if for overnight and anytime i have a problem area coming on i</li>
            <li> I really like to use this weekly as a great mask for my acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of zits and most of them cause permanent scaring...</li>
            <li> How often can you say that about most products.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful facial mask.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> how many times I washed my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> works okay - not as well as i hoped</li>
            <li> I love the proactiv refining mask.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> With that said, it is not an overnight magic mask.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products from proactiv, and I will re-purchase this product. :)</li>
            <li> Many friends have said it does not work.  </li>
            <li> Better buying here then from the malls in the kiosk, you will spend a lot more then here.</li>
            <li> but it seems to love.</li>
            <li> and it really worked great.</li>
            <li> and the proactive has a greater sulfur percent and also 2.5 oz for $10 give or take.</li>
            <li> It is more convenient buying here instead of the Proactiv website.</li>
            <li> , if it works, I will buy more.</li>
            <li> I love the Proactive skin care</li>
            <li> Love the proactive face mask.</li>
            <li> as most sulfur is - but now in pharmaceuticals its scent is masked by fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like pro-activ, but I LOVE this mask :)  </li>
            <li> i even boke out more</li>
            <li> /&gt;good buy, good price, worth it.</li>
            <li> I would not be able to keep my acne under control.  </li>
            <li> It works even better than the lotion.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use the entire Proactiv line, but this mask is awesome.</li>
            <li> This refining mask was just ok...</li>
            <li> this mask literally must be magic.</li>
            <li> love love love love.</li>
            <li> I am glad I am able to buy that separately.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this refining mask by proactiv.</li>
            <li> Love love love this mask.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Works ok but is overpriced</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as magical as the &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED SO MANY ACNE PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> and it really works great.</li>
            <li> I also use it at night to target a specific area of breakout if needed and it works great!!!</li>
            <li> Our son believes this is a magic cream.  </li>
            <li> I hope it&#x27;s a product I&#x27;ll be able to obtain from here on out. &#x3D;}</li>
            <li> Cleans pores out better than most cleansers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best of proactive&#x27;s products if you get the occasional pimple.</li>
            <li> Glad to buy this product from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One application (or the most two) used to eliminate any erupting &amp;#34;blemish&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s my favorite proactive product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a spot corrector.  </li>
            <li> you just have to put it in the spot were you need it the most.</li>
            <li> glad I made the purchase</li>
            <li> so i am glad that i read some review and ordered it and it came before its suppose to.</li>
            <li> Acnomel also has sulfur but the combination in the Acnomel works much better than in this mask.</li>
            <li> Works better then</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin more polish.</li>
            <li> If used twice in a week, I get better results.</li>
            <li> Love proactiv products</li>
            <li> and my skin feels so much better.</li>
            <li> Its important to moisturize with step three!</li>
            <li> and on top of that I saw no results from using this.</li>
            <li> It is the best facial products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I feel cosmetic planets sulfur mask is better.</li>
            <li> like I said when used correctly its magic :)</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel that it worked any better than anything else I had tried already.</li>
            <li> I have had severe acne for years now, and i used this on top of Accutane.</li>
            <li> I know better now.</li>
            <li> its okay.  </li>
            <li> This product works okay for me.</li>
            <li> u feel a difference its the best facial cleanser any1 can have!</li>
            <li> This is what really takes care of my acne and I&#x27;m so happy it works for my skin.</li>
            <li> My face is satisfied.</li>
            <li> but when I feel or see a red bump forming underneath my skin (the prelude to a wonderful full-blown zit!)</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this refining mask, and love than I can buy it here without subscribing through the company as I can&#x27;t use the rest of the products.</li>
            <li> Dries pimples up fast and leaves skin feeling silky smooth!!!  </li>
            <li> This one SHRINKS my pores to almost non-existance and because it has incredible drying agents it really gets rid of existing pimples quickly when used as an Overnight Spot Treatment.</li>
            <li> this mask is just magic, one application and it cleans up any stuborn pimple so quick, so effective.  </li>
            <li> The acne on my forehead had faded significantly!  </li>
            <li> The best part about this stuff is that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin overly dry.  </li>
            <li> I would easily purchase more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Strongly suggest anyone suffering with acne buy this immediately so you can enjoy the rest of your life acne-free!</li>
            <li> The tube is huge, effective and cheap.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of removing old skin and refreshing the face</li>
            <li> Great for mild acne &amp; during the hot months in the summer.</li>
            <li> I am not acne prone, but I love how smooth and even textured my skin is after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Acne Free&#x27;s spot 10% Benzoyle peroxide treatment, but this face mask works even better.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love it and now that i know how cheap it is on amazon</li>
            <li> AND MOST IMPORTANTLY</li>
            <li> Its pretty good it does tighten your pores and makes your skin smooth it draws out the dirt.the</li>
            <li> My seller was The Acne Prevention Place, fast shipping and good packaging.</li>
            <li> The speed at which I was able to get a blemish free face, upon receiving the product very quickly, makes for for an A+ in my book.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t think that it would benefit very sensitive skin types, as sulfur can cause more harm than good.</li>
            <li> Also, I just happen to LOVE the smell, and using sulphur was unique for me.</li>
            <li> Have tried other sulfur based products and this works the best out of all.</li>
            <li> It is excellent for acne whether young or older!</li>
            <li> This is for sure a great deal for an add-on item which only costs you a couple bucks!</li>
            <li> Easy application and removal.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this purchase of Proactive Refining Mask and will buy more of this product and brand in the future.</li>
            <li> It was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> Strong sulfer scent   </li>
            <li> not have a strong smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer a strong supported as I was before. .</li>
            <li> The sulphur smell is quite strong  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is beautiful for when my skin acts up before my period, or when i have a big bump comming</li>
            <li> If the refining function is true, then I will add more contents to this review.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great , clears acne, so does clearskin acne kit, clean and clear face wash, and queen helene</li>
            <li> I first used this from a free sample and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> It works best after a shower when skin is soft and the \\&quot;gunk,\\&quot; in your Tzone is soft, too.</li>
            <li> I notice a huge difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love proactiv, and this mask makes my feel fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not only a miracle cream I have used for years but a great value as well.</li>
            <li> Great product,  the entire family uses it.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it great at combating the acne itself, it reduced redness quite a bit as well.</li>
            <li> All in all, it works the same and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous mask that makes your face look and feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> Worked great as a hormone-crazed teen, too.</li>
            <li> A lot of people have had success with it, and I am sure that it is not a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> I got the product and the shipping was smooth</li>
            <li> But the refining mask is a great skin care &amp;#34;staple&amp;#34; for a twice a month deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I do enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 18 and have light, acne prone combination skin.</li>
            <li> It was a free trial size-</li>
            <li> I spot treat lightly at night and in the morning</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li> Great for those acne prone teens or those of us in our latter 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> B00LFT0CFI TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment &amp;#x2605;</li>
            <li> It makes your face look &amp; feel really smooth, but thats about IT.</li>
            <li> have dried and worked wonderfully at getting rid of a pimple overnight.  </li>
            <li> I always have a tube available.</li>
            <li> I love this product, this was actually my favorite item from the whole kit.</li>
            <li> Works good on clearing up your face, takes a few treatments to see results, but one they start its good...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good mask but don&#x27;t put it near your eyes because of the sulfur in the product.  </li>
            <li> According to my son, this is the absolute best for diminishing acne marks, especially pimples and zits that are just beginning to form.</li>
            <li> I mean, it is a good mask to use here &amp; there, but its no miracle worker, and def does NOTTT \\&quot;zap pimples away overnight\\&quot; as advertised lol</li>
            <li> I would also recommend using it right after you come out of the shower, as your skin is thoroughly moisturized and your pores are in better shape for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very rarely I would get it.</li>
            <li> It is also great as a spot treatment if you feel a blemish starting - dries it right up!  </li>
            <li> :) just be aware it does bleach clothing and hair and don&#x27;t put huge amounts</li>
            <li> leaves my face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great for frequent use, with a higher end brand once a month or so.</li>
            <li> Not terrible but Your not getting your full moneys worth.</li>
            <li> As an adult I have occassional acne when I spend too much time smoking and drinking and partying like a rockstar, and this is the perfect arsenal in my fight to stay young and handsome looking.</li>
            <li> I suspect it is much too strong to use as directed by most.</li>
            <li> but nothing too overpowering, worth the results!</li>
            <li> but I have been using it for a while and dont feel that it is original</li>
            <li> The first day I used this product I fell in love with it</li>
            <li> There is a significant decrease in her acne.</li>
            <li> Put moisturizer first, then apply on top of acne or pimple.</li>
            <li> Good product helps my skin to feel and look better even helps when I have a break out to clear it up faster thanks</li>
            <li> Remember, for BEST results, use this mask after your shower, or steam your face carefully over a pot of hot water with a towel (to catch the steam) and apply when skin is warm and soft. &#x3D;</li>
            <li> Effectively helps to cleanse existing acne and to prevent new acne from forming.</li>
            <li> Love being able to buy the one product that I need instead of dealing with Proactive directly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a refreshing mask that leaves such a nice &#x27;clean&#x27; feeling.    </li>
            <li> When you buy the mask directly from proactive you will pay much more (like $20 or $30 more).</li>
            <li> All in all a great product, but if you have dry skin already, you may want to pass this up.</li>
            <li> /month just to clean your pores.</li>
            <li> It works GREAT to dry it out ~ overnight.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel, so smooth, soft, and tingly clean!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fair price for something i feel has a huge potential to work on most peoples acne problems, because it really helps mine</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the formula was officially changed or what, but this refining mask product has not been nearly as effective as it was before when it was not so much a flat cream as it was an exfoliating and refreshing face mask.</li>
            <li> After that week though, I stopped using on large areas (my jawline, where I breakout the most).</li>
            <li> The before and after is TV-worthy…it clears your skin right up!  </li>
            <li> Love The way it make my face look clear and fresh !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only good things about Proactiv&#x27;s line, IMO.</li>
            <li> I think the products themselves probably DO benefit someone with severe acne or very oily skin, but i am guessing that it was OVER drying my skin &amp; creating more problems over all.</li>
            <li> I really love the proactiv refining mask, but I didn&#x27;t want the whole product line.</li>
            <li> It feels good to have this product in my bag of tricks for sudden flare-ups.</li>
            <li> &quot; - it&#x27;s true</li>
            <li> and it really does make your skin look better.  </li>
            <li> Good product, and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s very affordable here on amazon, unlike the proactiv website  .</li>
            <li> Arrived fast love the product</li>
            <li> yes it is true.  </li>
            <li> this is good for getting the bumps away but it drys my face and if you stop use it the bumps will come back</li>
            <li> 2.5 Oz last a good while.</li>
            <li> i love this mask so much.</li>
            <li> However, I rarely need to use the Proactiv Refining Mask anymore because my acne has been cured by a homeopathic remedy available at Amazon.com but is cheaper at Wal-mart:</li>
            <li> I originally tried this product when I was 15 and now 6 years later its still my favorite blemish clearer :)</li>
            <li> The active ingredient (sulfur 8%) is great for healing acne.</li>
            <li> This mask makes my face feel so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> I use this and the medicated soap and it leaves me skin feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Leaves face fresh, clean and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the item shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> And if I don&#x27;t catch it in time, the mask helps it go away quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment.</li>
            <li> but this seems to get them under control quickly.  </li>
            <li> I saw this advertised on tv as a quick overnight remedy for blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate that it can be used as a quick remedy or an overnight mask.</li>
            <li> If you have persistent acne or mild acne</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for offering such a great product to us.</li>
            <li> plus I got it fast its a big savings totally happy</li>
            <li> Love being able to purchase Proactiv products without having to go through the actual Proactiv company and to sign up for the program</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find this as an individual purchase.  </li>
            <li> It makes for a good excuse to take a long soak in the tubby and makes my face feel really good.</li>
            <li> But this was such a fantastic buy and great price,I will certainly buy more from this seller in the future!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know if the product is just too strong or my skin is not use to it, but it made me break out really</li>
            <li> But the way I use it works great, and it lasts a really long time since I don&#x27;t use much at a time.</li>
            <li> When I washed it off the next day in the shower, my face looked SO much better!  </li>
            <li> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I PURCHASED ANY PROACTIVE PRODUCT AND IM HOOKED!</li>
            <li> I started using it before I got pregnant with my six year old daughter, when I was told that I would not be able to take my acne medications during a pregnancy.</li>
            <li> THE TV.IT CAME IN A NICE LITTLE PACKAGE FOR A VERY CHEAP PRICE</li>
            <li> Doesnt work as advertised on tv, but leaves skin VERY smooth and soft</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t see any significant or even minor change on my skin while using this product.</li>
            <li> The mask did calm the blemish and it made it easier for me to remove.  </li>
            <li> The treeactiv oil is amazing as well, just wish I would have figured this out ten years ago!</li>
            <li> Fresh well within expiration dates.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> She says it even hurts to smile.   </li>
            <li> It was worth a try</li>
            <li> Within 24 more hours it has healed completely.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy to find it on Amazon and the size is larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> I am now completely acne free and have been for years!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> For me it took two months, but it was well worth waiting</li>
            <li> This is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> but fresh and youthful.  </li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but I have to use several layers for it to be somewhat effective against my acne...</li>
            <li> I use it most frequently as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> This is the only item in the Proactiv kit that has been continuously effective, to me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much cheaper and more convenient to buy right here on Amazon rather than going through Proactiv directly, which can be a huge pain.  </li>
            <li> Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands....</li>
            <li> When I first ordered Proactiv, I recieved a small sample of the Refining Mask and I loved it!</li>
            <li> The other reason I LOVED this purchase was the affordable price.  </li>
            <li> I had very severe acne growing up and all throughout most of high school.</li>
            <li> Young people don&#x27;t get excited by much, but they DO get excited by this product, because it WORKS!</li>
            <li> the price was right</li>
            <li> I can see and feel a difference in my skin right after it is washed off.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> It is just not the right product for my skin.</li>
            <li> Doesnt do so much for my blemishes, but my face does feel clean, and refreshed after the mask.</li>
            <li> This product produced rough, dry patches on my face after using it as a mask, but I have found that it makes a wonderful spot treatment.  </li>
            <li> The treatment hardens leaving the formula on my face where it belongs instead of on my pillow case where most formulas generally end up.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t even work at all to be honest, i put this one for like 2 months and my face still looked exactly the same as when i first put it..</li>
            <li> I tried this mask as a 10 minute full mask and as a 10 minute spot mask and as an overnight spot treatment but really saw no improvement at all.</li>
            <li> I had used the purple Avon cleanser/mask for a long time, which I really liked and stayed on well.  </li>
            <li> It dried it out even more, and made me break out more.</li>
            <li> also got here SUPER fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used the product and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some bump under my skin, i used benzoyl proxide and clindamycin ,nothing really work , but since I&#x27;m using this product ,my skin is so soft and without any break out , i love this product and i recommend it to everyone .</li>
            <li> it works very fast.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff defenitley worth a splurge !</li>
            <li> but it takes a few times maybe before you see those kind of results.. but works better than most of the other stuff I bought before.</li>
            <li> My daughter used the 3 step process every night for the first five days, without any problems.</li>
            <li> the first couple times I used it.</li>
            <li> I tried using the Proactiv system &amp; my skin went from having an occasional break out to having MANY blemishes &amp; pimples.</li>
            <li> 5 big fat stars for this one for sure.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it.</li>
            <li> (Proactiv products are mostly for people with light/ teen acne).</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great addition to the regular proactiv program, but this is really the only part I use.</li>
            <li> Finally, after a couple more months I looked at the end and saw it had expired in 2007...</li>
            <li> On a lighter note, if it is not expired, this product works very well!</li>
            <li> Definitely recomend it! :)</li>
            <li> Most likely if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, what you have is a mite condition or bedbug condition</li>
            <li> I love using masks with all kinds of different benefits!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried the Refining Mask by Proactiv</li>
            <li> but the product arrived and it is exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to order more from this same vendor</li>
            <li> more irritated and red.</li>
            <li> This is the first Proactiv product I bought</li>
            <li> so when I wake up in the mornings my face feels so much clearer and fresh.</li>
            <li> It works fast too!</li>
            <li> SO FAST!</li>
            <li> no uncomfortable....</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> and I most likely will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call this a mask.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> It really is well worth the money</li>
            <li> Once you can get past the smell and are aware that taking it off fully might take more than a minute then you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I use Proactive cleansing facial wash, treatment cream and my favorite: this mask.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave it on a second more than the 10 minutes suggested.</li>
            <li> I would look into a pill called Doxycycline, it kills the bacteria within the body that creates the acne in the first place.</li>
            <li> I use it as a spot treatment and it works very well!</li>
            <li> WORKS!IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> Sure beats paying regular price at the mall.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve very familiar with facial products.</li>
            <li> not much for acne marks but great for skin overall!!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> I use it mostly for spot treatment for a breakout since my skn is very sensitive and most acne treatments are too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time.</li>
            <li> I have not used it as a full face mask yet, but I have not had any adverse reaction so far, and hope that will continue.</li>
            <li> The claim to reduce acne is true, sulfur naturally kills bacterial acne and therefore will help acne.</li>
            <li> It helps prevent breakouts and helps current breakouts heal super quickly.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and was the product my son needed to clear up his acne</li>
            <li> I buy this mask for my 17 year old granddaughter and it clears up her face quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and it does sort of dry your face out but not horrible.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m single</li>
            <li> the proactive had a large crack in the bottom and product was smeared all over inside of envelope.  </li>
            <li> I use this on spots where i might have breakouts or even large pores.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great price, really does remove acne pimple and drains pus without busting pimple in a day or two, if pimple kinda big &amp; red might take a few days more..</li>
            <li> I only use it at need and that seems to be getting the job done just fine.</li>
            <li> They come once every month at a very high price, unless you make it known that you do not want the product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing they have tried that really does a SUPER job on their acne!  </li>
            <li> When I called proactiv I was told just the tube would cost around $30, then I was told it would be cheaper for me to buy the whole &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; for $29.99 and get the mask as a free gift (smaller size mask) FYI</li>
            <li> Real stuff.</li>
            <li> Sulfur works really well though, and that&#x27;s whats in this.</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;ve had this product for a month now, I can&#x27;t really tell whether it has any effect on my skin.  </li>
            <li> bought proactive package, and didnt use it much, except this mask</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy the whole Proactiv system</li>
            <li> This product works really well.  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like this mask quite well.</li>
            <li> Much rather purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel really cleaned out afterwards, without drying you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My forehead tends to be oily and this mask really helps with that quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> I expected this product to work better than it did, truth be told.</li>
            <li> Also fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my empty bottle of DERMAdoctor Ain&#x27;t Misbehav&#x27;in sulfur mask which I do like better because of the lid pump, it doesn&#x27;t smell like baby butt cream like proactive</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much for black/white heads.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> It does a really god job of drying the pimple out if worn through the night.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this refining mask reduce my acne problem without me having to intaking any medication.</li>
            <li> In my experience this product works very well as an overnight treatment.</li>
            <li> warning, can be very drying.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> I figured this wouldn&#x27;t work which is why I didn&#x27;t purchase the whole line or order from proactive.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> And its much cheaper here on amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son, and it really works.  </li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is much cheaper than the proactiv website where they want you to buy their &amp;#34;system&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> this would auto-sign me up for the monthly proactiv system to be sent to me, and auto charge my CC!.&lt;br /&gt;***Thank goodness for Amazon where I can get the bigger tube for just $6.50 + free shipping with student prime.</li>
            <li> REally gets rid of acne fast.</li>
            <li> and it really makes a noticeable difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li> i expected more from the product w/</li>
            <li> so I can sleep comfortably and wake up with smaller zits as well!!</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t believe the price and this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> hmmm maybe proactive just doesn&#x27;t work for me, and i have bought the whole system as a teenager...</li>
            <li> I really like using this as a mask and for spot treatment.  </li>
            <li> very useful&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
            <li> This purifying mask really does reduce the look and size of pores.  </li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth, pores are smaller, and skin has a clarified appearance.</li>
            <li> You can really see a difference.</li>
            <li> have used the whole line before</li>
            <li> However, the Proactiv Soution Refinding Mask really does help.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using it!</li>
            <li> but it did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> It clears stuff up really well.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on my face too.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I rinse or scrub afterwards with a face towel, the smell still lingers.    </li>
            <li> It really does leave my skin softer and shrinks the pores.  </li>
            <li> I was totally pleased that it arrived well before expected.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask.  </li>
            <li> My face suffers from both of these factors greatly!</li>
            <li> I use this as overnight treatment for pimples, and have had as much luck with it as I&#x27;ve had with any benzoyle peroxide product.</li>
            <li> it can be very drying.</li>
            <li> Proactive Solution Refining Mask really does work, and it saved my skin.</li>
            <li> I was amazed on how fast it cleared spots up.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;d been buying this mask in the stores and paying twice as much.  </li>
            <li> Really ??  </li>
            <li> And it really helps to get rid of all the acne on your face.</li>
            <li> Be it that i have very oily skin..</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING for me.  </li>
            <li> All I know is that benzoyl peroxide really helps my skin.</li>
            <li> It worked with my acne, but I really don&#x27;t get much of zits.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it as a mask (spread over my whole face and washed off) because it&#x27;s too drying for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Sulfur products work very well on my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this mask feels when I use it.  </li>
            <li> I  do not have acne, but I do have very severe eczema.</li>
            <li> and it really helps.  </li>
            <li> Works fast and since I have oily/combination skin</li>
            <li> Going even further, if you work out daily, there is nothing better than working out, taking a long hot shower, slapping on a mask and enjoying a cup of tea afterwords.</li>
            <li> Most of the time it works over night if I catch them early enough.</li>
            <li> So far so good, but I have to wait to see the effect the product can provide after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> three years old at the time of purchase!!!</li>
            <li> Dont expect it to clear up anything huge, minor blemishes it will clear up, and smooth out your skin, but, if you&#x27;re breaking out, you will continue to break out.</li>
            <li> It works great as a traditional mask; I cover the blackhead prone areas and recent blemishes and am left with a more healed, less irritated face.</li>
            <li> She was excited, because it is the only thing that works on her acne without causing her pain or anything.</li>
            <li> Once you order from an advertisement or a special in the newspaper or visa advertisement, the company just automatically sends shipments of their product at two to three times the introductive price and you are obligated to pay for them, unless you choose to pay to have them sent back.  </li>
            <li> Like countless others, I purchased ProActiv products from a specially priced offer, which included reoccurring shipments of products.</li>
            <li> I love the mask because it actually works and does not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> I use benzoyl peroxide (Neutrogena Clear Pore) wash every day; this mask is for the major clean up duty.</li>
            <li> I apply it to any new large break out pimples.</li>
            <li> The only product in the entire Proactiv system that I actually saw good results with is this refining</li>
            <li> It effectively dries out oily skin, but does not cause excessive drying as the higher-concentration benzoyl peroxide treatments can do.</li>
            <li> Not sure how effective it will be if I continue using it.</li>
            <li> I usually steam my face first---the directions says to apply to dampened skin--then apply the mask, wait 15 or 20 minutes (the directions say 10 minutes, but I like to wait a bit longer) then removed with warm water, or a moist washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling super clean and tight.....</li>
            <li> this mask has been the best spot treatment, the smell is off putting and a little hard to get use to</li>
            <li> When contacted the distributor they told me to mail it back to them at my cost with a card inside the original package (which was covered with the cream) saying we wanted a new one shipped to us.   </li>
            <li> but this I couldn&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using the rest of the Proactiv as I have found better for less.</li>
            <li> - so think a less potent rotten-egg type smell).</li>
            <li> I initially thought i would try it because i am a daily make-up wearer &amp; thought if my skin was good/clear now, than using Proactiv would make it even BETTER.</li>
            <li> This product is decent for it&#x27;s money.</li>
            <li> Main point: this stuff doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few times, but i feel good when I put it on.</li>
            <li> Of course it depends on what type of skin you have, but I find this does work decently well as a spot treatment for me.</li>
            <li> The main disadvantage though is the smell.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s also because I&#x27;m getting older, but I think this mask has a lot to do with it.</li>
            <li> I thought the $500 Chanel cream was the only product that worked well and quickly.</li>
            <li> left them even more red...</li>
            <li> My daughters use this particular item from the line to &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; treat a pimple before it develops.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s either ready to be squeezed if you&#x27;re into that or it has disappeared completely!</li>
            <li> If you use Proactiv but can&#x27;t get rid of blackheads, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My granddauter has been using this since high school.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for spot treatment.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> The real question is do you want to have clear skin for a day and then wake up the next morning only to have more acne?</li>
            <li> I tried the Proactive system when I was in high school.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, to all, for blemishes</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to anyone with acne.</li>
            <li> The blemish I covered the night before is either completely gone (95% of the time) or SIGNIFICANTLY better (the other 5% of the time).</li>
            <li> This refining mask is (for me) far too strong to apply to my entire face, which is neither sensitive nor oily.&lt;br /&gt;However, it works wonders when used as a spot treatment for those stubborn pimples that do appear from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Even without the proactiv system you can just put this on your clean face for ten min until it dries then just rinse for a few seconds since it comes off incredibly easy and when it&#x27;s off your face is immediately smooth and soft and looks almost air brushed since your pores will be invisible immediately.</li>
            <li> Of the entire line, the mask is hands down my favorite!</li>
            <li> I love this little mask.  </li>
            <li> I love this little proactiv, as soon as u wash it off</li>
            <li> In my repertoire I currently have this product, Queen Helene, Clean and Clear benzoyl peroxide scrub, L&#x27;Oreal toner, Biore strips, and the Olay Pro-X system.</li>
            <li> This mask smells very unpleasant--just like sulfur--and I cannot consciously recommend this product after my own negative experience.</li>
            <li> and it really helps clear it up without overdrying.</li>
            <li> Ive ordered this mask directly from proactive and the consistency was much thicker than when I ordered through amazon.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel so, so soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> about 98% of the time this will stop a developing pimple overnight and on those rare occasions they get bigger but will fade away over time.</li>
            <li> Recommend to use on those spot out breaks and monthly on normal skin with min outbreak.</li>
            <li> Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I over live for this product..</li>
            <li> I have used this as a mask and it really does help to bring all the stuff out of your face, BUT what I mostly use it for is it I feel a pimple coming or when that decides to come about through the night OR that dreaded hormonal pimple that comes and is hard as rock</li>
            <li> though i&#x27;ve outgrown my acne over the years i have to say this is the only mask that actually does zap huge zits and make them dissapeer.</li>
            <li> I had some whiteheads on my chin area and so far this mask has dried most of them up.  </li>
            <li> will dry up acne QUICK.</li>
            <li> When you first use this stuff it does help your skin somewhat, but after awhile your skin becomes more resistant and I found that every place you would dab this shit it would actually do the exact opposite of what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> The instructions on the package make it very clear this is an acne treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive skin, try a spot test on your neck or something to see how you react to it before putting it all over your face</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It smells a little funky, but leaves my skin soft and feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> It helps to keep my skin clear (in conjunction with the other Proactiv 3-step products) &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> and my skin will stay clear!</li>
            <li> I use the wash and this poroduct - keeps my skin clear and almost glowing!</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> My skin is just normal and this helps keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> Instead of damaging the outer layer of skin to shrink pimples, it heals from the instead and makes my skin soft and glowing!</li>
            <li> Most of my acne clusters were gone within a few weeks!</li>
            <li> but I get dryness afterwards and perhaps more breakouts, so I&#x27;m not sure if it works.</li>
            <li> i used this product the first time i got it, it did not get rid of my acne, but it did reduced it, and then the next 3 days my acne would increase.</li>
            <li> Its the exact same product.</li>
            <li> I had used proactive for many years in the past.  </li>
            <li> all noticed a big difference the first night she used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different products and it seems like nothing really works except few products that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Put a little on your acne before bed and it clears up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean as deep as I would like it to, but it does get the basic job done.</li>
            <li> The other nice thing is that you do not have to purchase the entire LINE of products from Proactive or have them talk you into the &amp;#34;auto&amp;#34; ship- that was always a big turn off for me with Proactive.</li>
            <li> Not too messy and goes on easily.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve used tons of acne products, and when I say tons I mean pretty much everything that&#x27;s available in stores, and then several prescription products.</li>
            <li> I tried this one night at a friend&#x27;s house, when a rather large pimple was just starting to show it&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> I am a little skeptical about it being the real deal , tonight is the first night I applied the mask , hopefully I&#x27;m not disappointed in the morning :)</li>
            <li> overnight\\&quot; effect that many customers swear by in the commercial; it did succeed in drying up my acne, relieving any active zits of their redness, and generally accelerating the rate at which they healed.</li>
            <li> PLUS, IT ACTUALLY SMELLS DECENT!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product for when my skin feels dull or I see blackheads - you put it on for 5 minutes then wash it off.  </li>
            <li> but stinks to no end like sulfer and bleaches anything it touches lol</li>
            <li> but my face was as clear as it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li> having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does work, though, as I saw my skin clear up after about 5 uses.</li>
            <li> Anytime I have a problem zit, or need to have amazingly clear skin for an event, I use this product.</li>
            <li> It helps clear my skin with just one use.</li>
            <li> and I wake up with clear skin.</li>
            <li> I tried everything I could find to clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li> AS WELL AS CLEAR MY SKIN UP.</li>
            <li> This was not my experience, but I do feel it helps blemishes to clear faster than without it.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> Helps to clear up my face and refine my pores.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, the next morning when I looked in the mirror, my blemish had completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> My pimples literally clear up overnight.</li>
            <li> Product worked well to clear up breakout without over drying the skin.</li>
            <li> I have used it as a spot treatment myself and find that it will clear up a breakout over night.</li>
            <li> Helps my son keep his skin clear.</li>
            <li> but it never worked to clear his skin.</li>
            <li> 67 years old with ACNE?</li>
            <li> It completely reduced the size of the pimple and diminished the redness.  </li>
            <li> Well the mask has completely burned my daughters face.</li>
            <li> As far as the Refining Mask-</li>
            <li> Usually by it directly from poractiv, but</li>
            <li> Benzoyl Peroxide gives my extremely sensitive skin a severely allergic reaction, but this-</li>
            <li> But this massive advertised product doesn&#x27;t really work for me.   </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I suffer from adult acne.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t use much so it should last for a while</li>
            <li> I still use it because I feel like it&#x27;s at least doing something to make my skin better.</li>
            <li> but it really helps to use overnight on cystic acne especially.</li>
            <li> It dries COMPLETELY so it doesn&#x27;t rub off on my pillow or end up in my hair</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but overall it works really well.</li>
            <li> YOU HAVE SENSITIVE OR ACNE PRONE SKIN, PLEASE GIVE THE PROACTIV REFINING MASK</li>
            <li> If you leave the product on overnight, you will be pleasantly surprised when the sun comes up.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 13 year old daughter, she uses it twice a week.  </li>
            <li> I had my old tubes to compare the strength.  </li>
            <li> She has moderate acne and uses this product once a week along with the Proactive 3 pc Gentle Formula Clarifying Cleanser, Toner, Lotion.  </li>
            <li> I bought Adult Acnomel instead and I will continue to use that.</li>
            <li> In the middle of the night, I woke up because my face felt really itchy, but I didn&#x27;t think anything of it.</li>
            <li> a complete acne&lt;br /&gt;regime.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it works for it</li>
            <li> I have used this for years directly on a blemish.  </li>
            <li> Wow, $6 for a miracle pimple blaster.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it as a mask--a bit too drying for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Seriously it really does help reduce your pimples the next day or in a couple days.</li>
            <li> Only thing I&#x27;ve found that really fades and eliminates scars and blemishes.</li>
            <li> I tried the whole Proactiv treatment system but found that the only product that worked for me is the Refining Mask.</li>
            <li> By the next morning or the morning after for the real stubborn zits, they gone.</li>
            <li> This cleans it and the sulfur ingredient makes my skin soft again and helps with  the inflammation of the hives and cracked skin.</li>
            <li> Does not work nearly as well as Acne Free&#x27;s brand of sulfur mask for me, but still helped clear up a few blemishes as an overnight spot treatment; with two-three treatments, of course.</li>
            <li> It did make my face feel tight and clean</li>
            <li> Whenever I see or feel a breakout coming, I dab a little bit of this product on that spot and the size reduces significantly.</li>
            <li> i guess it for persons who  just want to get rid of very very very mild small bumps.</li>
            <li> This works great on my face especially when I have small pimples, I just put a little on my face for&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> I tried tons of products to get my constant acne to clear up, but it would only work for two weeks and then come back full force.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and have battled moderate to severe acne on my face (mainly forehead and chin area) since high school and have tried just about every acne product under the sun that you can buy in stores as well as tried a couple of different prescriptions from my doctor, but NOTHING has worked.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this mask for the past several years and love it.  </li>
            <li> and it definitely works it made my pores a lot smaller the first time i use it.</li>
            <li> If you have large painful red nodular acne this is a great product to use.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t get my skin back to normal for weeks.</li>
            <li> Its not as expensive as other high end masks and works remarkably well for me.  </li>
            <li> Too bad they don&#x27;t sell the whole line at this good a discount</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m 30 and my skin has dried out, I use this mask once, or twice a week to clear my pores and to calm inflamed pimples.</li>
            <li> can really make your skin dry.</li>
            <li> It will probably be at least a week before she is able to use the 3 step process again, and then she will only use the mask as a spot treatment as needed.  </li>
            <li> I have wasted a lot of money on many products, but have found that this was money well spent.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and clear after using it for only a week.</li>
            <li> No harsh side effects like most acne products have, no drying out of skin or making it worse.  </li>
            <li> The night I put it on, I smoothed a thin layer on all over my problem areas on my face, left it on for 5 minutes, and washed it off with warm water.</li>
            <li> which is really lame because it worked wonderfully at first on most of my &#x27;open&#x27; pimples.</li>
            <li> i have a pretty greasy face, but use other acne products.</li>
            <li> I apply a small amount to clear skin before going to bed and it clears up quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I had an allergic reaction to this, or if my skin is just super sensitive.</li>
            <li> I do notice that when he skips a day or two, the acne comes back full force; however he is very active in sports activities and doesn&#x27;t wash his face as often as he should.</li>
            <li> There are very few items that I&#x27;ve found to really help with large pores and oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I generally try to use this mask once per week to help with acne, and it does help control acne.</li>
            <li> I used Proactiv as a teenager to keep my skin clear, and they sent the refining mask as an extra &#x27;gift&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I will say that following the instructions on this cream works well and helps clear acne.</li>
            <li> and it is starting to clear her face.</li>
            <li> She is still quite young, but I was concerned the problem would only worsen in the coming years</li>
            <li> However, when i have popped the blemish (yes, i know that any dermatoligist recommends NOT doing this) &amp; used the refining mask over night for several nights, then the blemish does seem to disappear (completely) within a week or so.</li>
            <li> I say dual action because this actually makes a stupendous spot treatment as well.</li>
            <li> I may be an adult, but I am still plagued by occasional acne and have bumps under the skin.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old has been breaking out since last year.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After far too years with acne I finally found this.</li>
            <li> Apparently, both she and her friend used it as a mask and spot treatment at night.</li>
            <li> When I was younger (teens and early twenties)</li>
            <li> My left eye became completely swollen and irritation all around my eye area.  </li>
            <li> , I will apply the refining mask to that area and the next day it will be completely gone.</li>
            <li> All Natural Acne Spot Treatment &amp;#x2605; Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!]].    </li>
            <li> I have suffered with adult onset cystic acne and regular acne for years.</li>
            <li> And within the last 5 years I have also developed mild rosacea that manifests in little red pimples predominantly on my nose that I want gone!  </li>
            <li> I say this cautiously because it may be disastrous for some of you with super sensitive skin, but I love the sensation, since I am always worried that my strips will dislodge something but not get it totally up</li>
            <li> I just bought a 60 day supply of Proactiv at the mall for my 12 year old daughter who has been consistently but mildly breaking out for the past few months.</li>
            <li> I certainly agree with the other reviewers about using after the shower.</li>
            <li> Six months later I broke out again due to stress but after taking the remaining two weeks of the remedy pills I have been basically acne-free for years, and only use the Proactiv Refining Mask every six months or so for the rare zit.</li>
            <li> It can be pretty drying though, so you may need to exfoliate for the slight skin peeling, and don&#x27;t forget to moisturize.  </li>
            <li> I have a very oily face and due to my job a lot of stress.</li>
            <li> This was my very 1st proactive purchase, and I will def be venturing out with other Proactive brand products.</li>
            <li> It dried up pimples real fast; it is part of my facial regime that i have been using it for over 6 years.</li>
            <li> However, my wife absolutely HATES the smell from the active ingredient SULFUR.</li>
            <li> Your pores will be wide open and ready.    </li>
            <li> However, when I applied this as a mask to my entire face and left it on for the recommended 10 minutes, it completely tore up my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a lot more expensive to buy directly or from the mall kiosks, so I stocked up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always tacky/sticky on my face and never dry</li>
            <li> Did not dry out skin.</li>
            <li> It did not dry at all on my face and all the ones I had purchased directly from proactive at a much higher cost in the past</li>
            <li> It does not dry like a normal mask, but rather has a gooey, sticky, wet feeling.  </li>
            <li> This does really help with reducing acne, I see major improvement if left on over night, other than that the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care for proactiv as a company due to the number of times they over charged me and added fees and double shipped orders then charged me for both.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Nature&#x27;s Cure for Men\\&quot; also worked fast for my teen nephew, and he spent the rest of his teen years acne-free!</li>
            <li> It cleared up anything the first few times.</li>
            <li> Its a much watered down version.</li>
            <li> I tried the whole proactive package for several months with no success.  </li>
            <li> However, the scent was not overwhelming and I was able to ignore it after a few nights.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s main active ingredient is sulfur</li>
            <li> Skin looks younger and does not dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use it 3 times a week, but if you have sensitive skin you should probably only use it once or twice a week because it can dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my hormonal acne, I think it helped a little bit, but it&#x27;s definetley not a miracle product.</li>
            <li> I have been use proactiv, the effect can also, the price is very cheap, much cheaper than taobao, suggested that the occasional use, daily use, the result is bad, doubt may contain hormones</li>
            <li> My son suffers from cystic acne and this mask will clear up the most subborn of pimples.</li>
            <li> The bottle is also a little different, maybe it is an older design...</li>
            <li> One word of caution, proactiv in general can dry my skin out a bit.</li>
            <li> ( i tend to develop redness or irritetion reaction after few weeks of using a particular medical cream)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now because I do have sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve had to forego almost any other product that bears the proactiv label.</li>
            <li> It was bright red and covered in hundreds of tiny little red blisters and it itched/burned like crazy.</li>
            <li> but I make sure to immediately use my normal products afterword to limit any bad reaction.  </li>
            <li> It may dry it up really fast, and your skin might get &#x27;flaky&#x27; but, i&#x27;d rather have a little patch of skin being flaky from peeling off and drying out the pimple, then having the pimple itself.</li>
            <li> The product smells similar but it is somehow a little different than the stuff I bought directly from the source.</li>
            <li> I still get the occasional pimple, but less frequently.</li>
            <li> Although my skin is very sensitive, I find that applying a thin layer rather than spreading it on think really makes a difference for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure if i&#x27;m using it to often or to much at once.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, it is not a magic potion capable of \\&quot;curing\\&quot; acne.</li>
            <li> Worked really well against my occasional breakouts, but had to stop using it when the products began irritating my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have complained that it dries out your skin, which can be true depending on what type of skin you have.</li>
            <li> When I use it again on the same area on the second day, the acne starts to disappear, and by the third day, it&#x27;s usually gone or nowhere near as visible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;BEST PART:&lt;br /&gt;it will take care of those big zits that are difficult to pop, speeds up the healing time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it feels gross if I attempt to sleep with it on my face when attempting to dry up an existing pimple before morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I do notice that I have far less acne when I use this.</li>
            <li> Anyway, since my face is so horribly dry now, I&#x27;m starting to break out again from my skin overproducing oils.</li>
            <li> One regular size tube lasts a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Also if you use it as a weekly mask it leaves your face feeling so tight, soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> It is possible the concentration of the active ingredients are lowered and, therefore, have a decreased effect compared to the original product.</li>
            <li> As long as you clean your face with soap and water or any other face cleaner, keep up with this a few days a week or everyday depends on the severity of an individuals acne/blackheads.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m older, but this mask is too harsh for my skin!</li>
            <li> My face will get scaly and very dry, besides the hives, and it will Crack open.</li>
            <li> then but I can clear them up within a few days.</li>
            <li> would recommend following the directions as stated on the product: wet the area before application, leave on for 10 minutes, and rinse off.</li>
            <li> I use, as long as I use the refining mask 2-3 times a week, my acne stays under control.</li>
            <li> Used this before during my teen years (now 26) product works just as expected.</li>
            <li> It worked for my minor acne problems.</li>
            <li> We tried Dermalogica, Obagi and Neutrogena with some help but her face was not clear.  </li>
            <li> It helps shrink the pimp, if not clear the pimple.  </li>
            <li> Since the spot treatment is a bit tough to get off in the morning, I use a makeup remover wipe and it comes right off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed by the next morning that my acne seemed smaller and less irritated.</li>
            <li> A few of my friends had a similar experience, and we all decided that we must be sensitive to the active ingredient in the Proactiv Solution Refining Mask: Sulfur.</li>
            <li> My professional homeopath was unable to address my acne yet within two weeks of taking only the pills (I found the topical solution too drying for my adult skin)</li>
            <li> Other then that, I totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> You only use a little, so my last one lasted 4 years and still worked just as well.  </li>
            <li> Use it every other day to help control breakouts and combat future breakouts!!!  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and for some reason, that is why I breakout.</li>
            <li> I do NOT suggest this product if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> so i rather have some dry skin than pimples</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re someone who has dry, acne-prone skin, you&#x27;ll have to use it sparingly, because it does really dry your skin.</li>
            <li> &quot;  Does dry you out too.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> I find that leaving it on any longer will make my skin too dry, as the product is intended to draw out the toxins on the affected area.</li>
            <li> I let it dry, and then I sleep with it</li>
            <li> It can over dry your skin if you do it too often</li>
            <li> I have neither dry nor oily skin.  </li>
            <li> It does dry your skin</li>
            <li> it works i dont like pro activ because it makes my face really dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just been applying a calendula cream for dry, chapped, burnt skin and it seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> I finally ordered the 2.5 oz Refining Mask a few weeks ago and my blackheads already appear much smaller!</li>
            <li> This is the proactiv three step systems secret weapon .it works like a charm and has two different applications that are very affective.</li>
            <li> and it dried my face out and left white flakes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll put it on any potential acne that is starting to appear and it clears it up within a few days.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately my pale skin turns beat red and stays red up to a day after use of this mask.</li>
            <li> It was extremely itchy, covered in small white bumps and big red blotches.</li>
            <li> I gave proactive another short, but proactiv let me down once again, i would not buy this once again..</li>
            <li> I use Proactiv Solution Refining Mask at least 3 times a week, I also use it as a spot treatment if I have new breakouts.</li>
            <li> Will dry it up over night!  </li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it is HIGHLY likely be disappointed</li>
            <li> As long as I use this mask regularly, I no longer have these heavy break outs.</li>
            <li> The pimple the next morning will be much less red and less inflamed.</li>
            <li> I ordered it online, it came in a bigger size that was less expensive and it came quickly.  </li>
            <li> However, during the investigation of my dispute, I received a ProActiv Collection notice for the same products which they previously acknowledged had not been delivered.</li>
            <li> She has been unable to use any of the products since, and even mild Cetiphil washes sting.</li>
            <li> just super uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The only upside is that it reduces blackheads a little bit but it makes my skin feel too dry.</li>
            <li> it became very dry.</li>
            <li> But like any other product, if you use it for a long time, the effectiveness wears off.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a little over a month, I finally gave up on it.  </li>
            <li> Add a little to a pimple before and what a big difference in the morning...</li>
            <li> Its more like a cleanser than anything, with a bad odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m long past being a teen</li>
            <li> If I feel a pimple starting under the skin and apply this to the area, in the morning it has come to the surface and dried out.  </li>
            <li> It is one of the few products from Proactiv that I would recommend for people with moderate to severe acne</li>
            <li> And I have used it on my entire face a few times as well as just on the spots.</li>
            <li> but this product is actually not too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> When this happens, stop using it for a few months and then go back to it.  </li>
            <li> 6% Sulfur is roughly what Murad and DDF masks have in them; they cost $30 for 2-3oz.  </li>
            <li> As a woman during my time of the month, my skin gets extra oily and I tend to break out heavily.</li>
            <li> I have been using Proactiv for a few years and have not needed to use it as regularly as I had in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> I dont know if it just my sking but its not really working...</li>
            <li> not much of a difference can be seen in her skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen it help reduce my spots (cystic acne with a few smaller surface spots).</li>
            <li> but over a few weeks of treatment the blackheads will get smaller and so will your pores.</li>
            <li> i got it sooner than i expected</li>
            <li> I dot it on trouble spots at night, and in the morning the pimples have gone away entirely or noticeably reduced in size.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted to let others know to be careful.  </li>
            <li> which is not a huge deal, but definitely something to consider.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-especially a thin layer left on over night (use old pillow case)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it totally slows down the pimple from rising to the surface, but when I also swab it with the treeactiv oil base, it actually retreats back into my skin, so it never really matures into a full blown pimple.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about others results, but it takes MONTHS of nighly application for the blemish to go down, then go away completely... or not at all.</li>
            <li> Just be careful of your clothing and other stuff-it bleaches clothing.  </li>
            <li> It gives a little extra boost to my typical regimen.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Can also leave it on all night and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used to use this in high school (about 12 years ago) and it always zapped my pimples without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this, with my heart 100% behind that.</li>
            <li> (A little tight, a little burning, but nothing major.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other acne products but nothing works.</li>
            <li> When I used proactiv, it did what every other face wash did.</li>
            <li> i used this every other day</li>
            <li> i have thrown away all of my other Proactiv products &amp; KEPT the refining mask.</li>
            <li> I have used Proactiv refining mask occasionally for the past five years.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after I ran out of my other container and did not want to deal with the proactiv company and their auto-renewal compliance.</li>
            <li> I used it as a spot treatment and left a small amount on over night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to order from a source other than proactive because they put you on the automatic shipments.</li>
            <li> Amazon sells this stuff at a lower price than other vendors.</li>
            <li> This item did not seem to help my grandson&#x27;s acne, even when used with the other Proactive products.  </li>
            <li> Been using the Proactive line for years due to menopausal pimples.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use proactive 3 step system, other times I use the Burt&#x27;s Bees brand or so on.</li>
            <li> The other Proactive products irritated my skin but this works well for spot treatments and also as a weekly mask if your skin is oily.</li>
            <li> They want you to bundle it with their other products.</li>
            <li> I use it every other night as a mask.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars due to that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the other proactiv treatments</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every other day as an all over face mask and leave it on while I sleep.</li>
            <li> I have tried it twice but have to agree with some other reviewers-</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical, not believing any of the commercials I saw on television.</li>
            <li> It is extremely watered down/diluted.</li>
            <li> I use this as an overnight treatment on my pimples and usually by the next day, the blemishes would have fade away or are gone.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t bother with any other proactive solution than this one.</li>
            <li> This refining mask works overnight, unlike the other products.</li>
            <li> This is for my son and a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> just a note you have to use it a couple times for it to go away over night does dry your skin a little</li>
            <li> I use a cotton swab to just dab a little bit on the surface of any pimples I have on my face, I let it dry, and I go to sleep with it on.</li>
            <li> Use refining mask (just a little) to dry up unwanted zits.</li>
            <li> Be very careful with this mask-</li>
            <li> Be very careful when purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Once you stop using the product, your acne will return unless you take active steps to maintain the health of your skin.</li>
            <li> I tried Proactiv, and it really only succeeded in drying my skin out and actually making my acne even worse.</li>
            <li> No tricks or imitation product.</li>
            <li> I put it on any active breakout I have and withing the next day it has gone down dramatically and within a few days its gone !</li>
            <li> Maybe it is just not right for my skin type.</li>
            <li> doesnt clear up the ance and it dried my skin out alot!!!</li>
            <li> and it was so hard to take off the massive pimples I get.</li>
            <li> (My acne was pretty bad especially on my cheeks..)</li>
            <li> I still have a few marks on my face from pimples a few months ago that have never completely gone away.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.  </li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t afford to purchase the entire kit offered by Proactiv, then buy THIS, at least.  </li>
            <li> usually give myself a facial using this mask once every few days...</li>
            <li> but it really feels uncomfortable on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a bigger bottle after receiving a few small samples.</li>
            <li> I have blackheads all over my nose and a few on my chin, and Proactiv never really helped with them.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but the business practices of this company are horrible.  </li>
            <li> Usually by morning the spot has reduced in size by at least half, or it&#x27;s completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put it overnight and sometimes in the morning the pimple has slim down.</li>
            <li> Makes your pimple go down overnight...</li>
            <li> Works quite well overnight to lessen the appearance of blemishes and it cuts down on the oil.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use the other ProActiv products, just this one!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I use from Proactiv, whenever I have a pimple I apply the mask at night and it&#x27;s usually gone by morning!</li>
            <li> recommend this to everyone who has experienced these annoying pimples.&lt;br /&gt;Within a couple of days, those ugly things are dried up and well on their way to complete healing.</li>
            <li> that would explain the slight differences.</li>
            <li> Significantly less acne within two uses.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is much less than going through ProActiv.</li>
            <li> So seriously folks, just dab it on spots only, and leave it over night.</li>
            <li> I suppose this is a slight allergic reaction to the sulfur, or maybe just over sensitivity.</li>
            <li> my pores were less noticeable after using it</li>
            <li> so no one else is subject to the side effect-smelliness of this product.</li>
            <li> Its a lot less than going through Proactiv themself.</li>
            <li> Skin is softer, pores less visible and blemishes reduced after one use.</li>
            <li> Kept using this with black skin</li>
            <li> reduces pore size and black heads.</li>
            <li> Apply it at night after washing your face when it is still slightly moist by rubbing a miniscule amount over any forming zits.</li>
            <li> In my experience this is not true.</li>
            <li> Since I have very sensitive skin, I have a hard time finding products that won&#x27;t irritate my skin or make the problem worse.</li>
            <li> It works at reducing the acne (but it doesn&#x27;t get rid of those little bumps)</li>
            <li> Just dab a little on each spot w/ a cotton swab and leave on overnight.</li>
            <li> When you stop using this products the acne comes back, but as least it gives you a break!</li>
            <li> In some commercials, endorsers say \\&quot;put a little dab on your acne and it will disappear over night!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> little goes along way</li>
            <li> The sulphur in this mask always kicks my zits little</li>
            <li> I dabbed a little on the pimple after washing my face, and crawled into bed.</li>
            <li> I dab a little of the mask on the pimple after cleaning my face at night.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear makeup because it looks weird with all the dry flakes peeling off, so I have no way of covering my red, blotchy face.</li>
            <li> As a 10 minute mask it  eliminates extra oil.as an overnight spot treatment it is a tough villain against pimple man</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t know how people can write good reviews for a product that stinks so bad.</li>
            <li> basic consumer protection statute enforced by the Commission is Section 5(a) of the FTC Act, which provides that \\&quot;unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce...are...declared unlawful.\\&quot; (15 U.S.C. Sec. 45(a)(1)\\&quot;</li>
            <li> i waited a few weeks and when i tried to start using it again i would break out wherever i put it.</li>
            <li> I had a few trouble spots on my face</li>
            <li> If used a few times a week, you&#x27;ll see results even if you don&#x27;t use the rest of ProActiv products.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I put it on a few problem areas on my face and went to bed and somehow it got into my eyes</li>
            <li> The smell only gets WORSE if you follow it with the Proactiv toner (step 2).</li>
            <li> This product is one of the few out there that alleviates my acne.  </li>
            <li> If Proactive is too harsh or it doesn&#x27;t work for you, you must try SEACRET mud mask.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of this stuff.</li>
            <li> This past winter, I got desperate and finally broke down and ordered the entire Proactiv 3-step system.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that tends to be on the dry side as it is, so finding something to treat my pimples without making them red and irritating my skin was impossible until now.</li>
            <li> the way, this product did absolutely nothing other than ad a bad smell to my face.</li>
            <li> I did not think anything would ever help my complexion and had given up on using anything but plain soap and water.</li>
            <li> Anything else was either drying me out or just plain ineffective.    </li>
            <li> I used it in the past and it seemed to only make my pimples worse..</li>
            <li> All it did was irritate my skin like crazy and made my face insanely red and excessively dry.  </li>
            <li> The Proactiv kit itself didn&#x27;t really work for me because it was too harsh, but the refining mask always helped clear up some of my worst acne.</li>
            <li> My daughter has used everything including the VERY expensive prescriptions, this product worked much better,&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> I was  a little skeptical that this would be actual proactive, but it was.</li>
            <li> It stopped a serious breakout in its tracks, which has never happened for me with any other product.</li>
            <li> and I also recommend rubbing raw honey afterwards for the scarring.</li>
            <li> I had a zit on my chin that was deep, painful, red and wouldn&#x27;t come to the surface.  </li>
            <li> Hate the scent and It doesn&#x27;t  work as quick as xout</li>
            <li> The only thing bad about it is at times it can dry out my face a little.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 3 weeks and it has helped with the redness (inflamed pores).</li>
            <li> I have been using for a few days already and have already noticed my skin clearing up!</li>
            <li> It is often believed that merely using a product can be the only change made to help your skin.</li>
            <li> I place a small dollop on each blemish and allow to sit overnight as I sleep.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on in the evening, go to bed with it still on, and wake up and wash it off.</li>
            <li> They are gone usually in 1-3 days.</li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve been having a few bouts of acne, so I decided to buy the refining mask by itself to help me with spot treatments.</li>
            <li> and it was not working like it had in the past.</li>
            <li> Usually, any blemishes were gone overnight, but not this time.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s usually gone by the morning.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for the past year</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past.</li>
            <li> Costs a fraction of what I&#x27;ve paid in the past.</li>
            <li> the small tube inside says 1 ounce.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this stuff for the past 4 years.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase this at the mall in the proactiv vending machine for about 20.00.</li>
            <li> I ordered a small tube and it lasts forever.  </li>
            <li> Results are not permanent, but for a few days at least, bye bye blackheads.</li>
            <li> This did not work like it has in the past.  </li>
            <li> i have used it twice a week ever since and no more break outs.</li>
            <li> I think this product is probably not suitable for some people.  </li>
            <li> Just cant stand the horrible chemical smell at all, the smells so strong</li>
            <li> It leaves a film/residue on my face even after scrubbing hard.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to buy just the mask by itself, or to find on proactiv&#x27;s website where to buy it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from acne!</li>
            <li> I have really bad acne which stems from my really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is not as thick and dries easier than the Rx version I had as well.</li>
            <li> Not very  attractive...</li>
            <li> My suggesting is try using a little bit on a small part of your have, and then use it in other areas if you do react badly.     </li>
            <li> It does have a baby butt cream smell but goes on smooth and works just as well, but I hate the screw on and off cap vs a snap on snap off cap-small issue but on a daily use it becomes annoying when you are tired and want to go to bed asap without acne in the am.</li>
            <li> its ridiculous.</li>
            <li> How absolutely disgusting the commercial is,you actually have a girl refer to the \\&quot;CRUD\\&quot; on our face....</li>
            <li> Smells a little weird</li>
            <li> Her face is visibly red, and chapped, as if she was recovering from a bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> The only thing the mask did for me was make my face smell bad</li>
            <li> but it is NOT a good Overnight Spot Treatment for existing pimples because it stays damp and gets all over my pillow</li>
            <li> use thin layer over night or thick mask for an hr.</li>
            <li> problem zits no more put it on and leave it on over night and the zit will be gone or went down where it doesn&#x60;t look so bad</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty horrible.  </li>
            <li> No more expensive prescriptions for us, We will buy again.</li>
            <li> I realize that products containing salicylic acid makes my acne worse.</li>
            <li> then, i stopped using it and broke out worse than i ever had in my life</li>
            <li> This mask should be applied in a thin layer, leave on for 15-30 minutes</li>
            <li> I apply a thin layer to my problem areas which is my forehead and chin.</li>
            <li> I tried proactiv it made me break out worse</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product you need, all others are crap.</li>
            <li> I think the TV advertisement is completely false...</li>
            <li> , it feels like a fake.</li>
            <li> My son has had issues with random breakouts and this, as is advertised... when you dab on spot at night - in the morning its either gone or noticably improved.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical and feared that it may be a knock off or damaged in some way</li>
            <li> I refrained from experimenting with the really expensive products because I wanted to save my money for college.</li>
            <li> like I did (silly me).</li>
            <li> but alas!  </li>
            <li> (so gross, i hate it!!!!!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, I&#x27;d recommend that you use a very thin layer of the product when you&#x27;re applying it to your skin.</li>
            <li> When I tried it, it made me breakout like crazy</li>
            <li> Extremely unhappy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Stinks and can bleach fabric if it rubs off onto clothes.</li>
            <li> so I had to rinse my eyes out with cold water.  </li>
            <li> I found the smell somewhat unpleasant - it reminded me of diaper cream...</li>
            <li> All of my life I suffered from bad acne.  </li>
            <li> Too bad the on-line information down-plays this fact.</li>
            <li> It doesnt smell, and people complain it does, so maybe I got a bad batch, or maybe it just doesnt smell, but</li>
            <li> i had horrifically painful cystic acne and proactiv</li>
            <li> This works, it is not a miracle over night fix your ugly ass</li>
            <li> I break out like crazy!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll probably just continue to order it off here instead of those stupid kiosks in the mall.</li>
            <li> Personally, I hate the Proactive product line.</li>
            <li> this is one of my HG spot treatments, even though i hate the rest of the line.</li>
            <li> I reccomend it to all teenagers who hate when a pimple surfaces and battle with the embarrasment they bring.</li>
            <li> Hate to admit, but I still fight breakouts at 67.......</li>
            <li> Very unhappy!</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me when used as spot treatment and it smells terrible.</li>
            <li> Proactive&#x27;s customer service is terrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible!  </li>
            <li> Horrible customer service, will never do business with again.</li>
            <li> The product works well, but their business ethics are horrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> The smell of this stuff is awful.  </li>
            <li> When I woke up in the morning, my face looked like I had the worst sunburn of my life.</li>
            <li> I swear by it for those annoying pms zit pop ups !</li>
            <li> All it did was have an awful stench and sticky texture which i dreaded.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it! 67 years old with ACNE? Proactive handles it all!</li>
            <li> Great for mild acne &amp; during the hot months in the summer.</li>
            <li> Best mask I have ever used. Even without the proactiv system you can just put this on your clean face for ten min until it dries then just rinse for a few seconds since it comes off incredibly easy and when it&#x27;s off your face is immediately smooth and soft and looks almost air brushed since your pores will be invisible immediately. Use once a week and the product will last forever so it&#x27;s not only a miracle cream I have used for years but a great value as well. Will purchase again and again and again.</li>
            <li> Real stuff. Well packaged. Fresh well within expiration dates. Expires in a year  enough to last 2 kids a year. Great deal. Thank you</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have really bad acne which stems from my really sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve tried other acne products but nothing works. I realize that products containing salicylic acid makes my acne worse. Sulfur works really well though, and that&#x27;s whats in this. I put it on my face at night, go to sleep and when i wake up, my breakouts are either gone or noticeably smaller. Great product! Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Would recommend it to any age group. Does what it says.</li>
            <li> Thank you! Everything was great!</li>
            <li> Great price and no monthly fee coming out of my account if I was to&lt;br /&gt;order from Proactive. That in itself is worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t quite see this as a miracle mask. Even though I&#x27;ve had this product for a month now, I can&#x27;t really tell whether it has any effect on my skin.  I doubt I&#x27;ll be ordering another bottle once the one I ordered runs out.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and was the product my son needed to clear up his acne</li>
            <li> Does this work for anyone? Based on my research, you need different dosage of benzoyl peroxide to heal your acne.  But Proactiv has same dosage of bezoyl peroxide in every sigle products.   It seems like it&#x27;s working in the beginning but it doesn&#x27;t work in the end!!!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and for some reason, that is why I breakout. When I used proactiv, it did what every other face wash did. It dried it out even more, and made me break out more. I do NOT suggest this product if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I can never commit to constantly using cleansing and medical creams,&lt;br /&gt;I bought proactive package, and didnt use it much, except this mask&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is hypoallergenic, because i&#x27;ve being using it for years, and it didnt irritate my sking, even when i over indulge in it ( i tend to develop redness or irritetion reaction after few weeks of using a particular medical cream)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is beautiful for when my skin acts up before my period, or when i have a big bump comming up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even use it under my makeup, it is white so it hides some of the redness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is one of the products i will never give up</li>
            <li> I buy this mask for my 17 year old granddaughter and it clears up her face quickly.  The smell isn&#x27;t great and she doesn&#x27;t use it often for that reason, but it works great.</li>
            <li> I had a zit on my chin that was deep, painful, red and wouldn&#x27;t come to the surface.  I got this out of desperation.  It works!  Before I went to bed, I globbed some on and put a band-aid on it.  It completely reduced the size of the pimple and diminished the redness.  The pain went away as well.  After 4 times nightly apps, the zit is mostly gone.  My only mistake is that I didn&#x27;t use it on consecutive nights.</li>
            <li> I just bought a 60 day supply of Proactiv at the mall for my 12 year old daughter who has been consistently but mildly breaking out for the past few months. She is still quite young, but I was concerned the problem would only worsen in the coming years and I wanted to help her as quickly as possible.   My daughter used the 3 step process every night for the first five days, without any problems. (A little tight, a little burning, but nothing major.) On the 6th night she applied the mask (as directed by the woman at the mall - once a week/all over for 10-15 minutes). Well the mask has completely burned my daughters face. She has been unable to use any of the products since, and even mild Cetiphil washes sting. Her face is visibly red, and chapped, as if she was recovering from a bad sunburn. She says it even hurts to smile.   It will probably be at least a week before she is able to use the 3 step process again, and then she will only use the mask as a spot treatment as needed.  Now I just want to spread the word to use the product cautiously.  I suspect it is much too strong to use as directed by most.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy the whole Proactiv system so I just went on Amazon to buy the mask.  This product works really well.  I noticed a difference in my skin the first couple times I used it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 3 weeks and it has helped with the redness (inflamed pores). I only use it at need and that seems to be getting the job done just fine.</li>
            <li> Personally, I hate the Proactive product line. When I tried it, it made me breakout like crazy and I couldn&#x27;t get my skin back to normal for weeks. However, this mask is awesome! It&#x27;s the only good things about Proactiv&#x27;s line, IMO. I try to use it 1-2 times a week.  It helps prevent breakouts and helps current breakouts heal super quickly. Smells a little weird (it&#x27;s the sulfur) but nothing too overpowering, worth the results! Totally recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using the rest of the Proactiv as I have found better for less. The one product that can&#x27;t be beat is the Refining Mask for acne. I have been through so many too...this to me is the best. I use it for middle-age acne and my daughter for her teen acne. It works!</li>
            <li> i used this every other day and i&#x27;ve got moderate acne but my face was as clear as it&#x27;s ever been. then, i stopped using it and broke out worse than i ever had in my life every place i had put it. i waited a few weeks and when i tried to start using it again i would break out wherever i put it. i still can&#x27;t use it without it breaking me out. which is really lame because it worked wonderfully at first on most of my &#x27;open&#x27; pimples.</li>
            <li> I was  a little skeptical that this would be actual proactive, but it was. it smells jus like the stuff. and it works like it.</li>
            <li> This product works for all ages. I am 47 and my girls, ages 10 and 14 use it too.  I will re-order this item.  It is a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; for my skin care!</li>
            <li> My teenage son occasionally gets breakouts; he puts this on at night and says that it works wonders overnight.</li>
            <li> I love this product it does work overnight just a note you have to use it a couple times for it to go away over night does dry your skin a little but i got mosterizer so i rather have some dry skin than pimples i woule defintly tell others</li>
            <li> I tried using the Proactiv system &amp; my skin went from having an occasional break out to having MANY blemishes &amp; pimples. I initially thought i would try it because i am a daily make-up wearer &amp; thought if my skin was good/clear now, than using Proactiv would make it even BETTER. Not the case at all. I think the products themselves probably DO benefit someone with severe acne or very oily skin, but i am guessing that it was OVER drying my skin &amp; creating more problems over all. As far as the Refining Mask- i have thrown away all of my other Proactiv products &amp; KEPT the refining mask. I have found over time that if i noticed an \\&quot;under the skin\\&quot; blemish occuring, i would put a dab of the mask on &amp; leave it over night for several nights. I&#x27;m not sure about others results, but it takes MONTHS of nighly application for the blemish to go down, then go away completely... or not at all. I still have a few marks on my face from pimples a few months ago that have never completely gone away. However, when i have popped the blemish (yes, i know that any dermatoligist recommends NOT doing this) &amp; used the refining mask over night for several nights, then the blemish does seem to disappear (completely) within a week or so. I think the TV advertisement is completely false... i have never had a blemish basically be gone overnight, but it DOES seem to help &amp; i still continue to use it as does my room mate.</li>
            <li> I have been using the refining mask for many years, and I love it! I am not acne prone, but I love how smooth and even textured my skin is after use. The active ingredient (sulfur 8%) is great for healing acne.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a few days already and have already noticed my skin clearing up! The price is affordable and it is the best acne treatment on the market!!! I don&#x27;t even use the other ProActiv products, just this one! Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this mask. I never tried any Proactive products before and after i bought this i was so happy. I had a few trouble spots on my face so i used this as a spot treatment overnight. It visible reduced the redness and made me pimples disappear faster. I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about when they say they have experienced irritation, breakouts or redness from using Proactiv, i didn&#x27;t experience that. But everyone is different.</li>
            <li> Son loves the product and I love that it is way cheaper than buying it at the kiosk at the mall!!</li>
            <li> I really love the proactiv refining mask, but I didn&#x27;t want the whole product line. I was happy to see that I could order it by itself and for such a great price. Only $5 total for product, as shipping was included!  Plus it was delivered in 2 days!  Very happy customer! :-)</li>
            <li> love the mask, i use if for overnight and anytime i have a problem area coming on i would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I really like to use this weekly as a great mask for my acne-prone skin. It helps to keep my skin clear (in conjunction with the other Proactiv 3-step products) &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of zits and most of them cause permanent scaring... so after deciding to buy the refining mask i tried it the same night i got it. This product is great! about 98% of the time this will stop a developing pimple overnight and on those rare occasions they get bigger but will fade away over time. I recommend this product 100%</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me when used as spot treatment and it smells terrible. It does, however, work for one of my friends. I think it depends on your skin chemistry. It was worth a try and since I ordered it on amazon it was actually affordable.</li>
            <li> Great product,  the entire family uses it.  Last forever and it works.  How often can you say that about most products.</li>
            <li> this product is all a big phony. It contains oil which makes me break out mor than I would without using anything at all. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful facial mask.  Nice earthy smell,too.  I like everything about it and use it on a weekly basis.</li>
            <li> Great size for the price  Strong sulfer scent   Doesnt work as advertised on tv, but leaves skin VERY smooth and soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m long past being a teen but I still get a breakout from time to time and it&#x27;s never convenient.  Just covering a blemish up doesn&#x27;t work...it inevitably reveals itself at some point during the day.  And within the last 5 years I have also developed mild rosacea that manifests in little red pimples predominantly on my nose that I want gone!  This Proactive Refining Mask has done the job.  If I apply this mask to my nose at night, the red bumps are gone in the morning.  If I feel a pimple starting under the skin and apply this to the area, in the morning it has come to the surface and dried out.  Within 24 more hours it has healed completely.  I have had struggles with skin issues since high school and would have done anything to have perfect skin.  It feels good to have this product in my bag of tricks for sudden flare-ups.</li>
            <li> This mask is AWESOME. In my repertoire I currently have this product, Queen Helene, Clean and Clear benzoyl peroxide scrub, L&#x27;Oreal toner, Biore strips, and the Olay Pro-X system. Let me say this is one of my favorites to use. I certainly agree with the other reviewers about using after the shower. Going even further, if you work out daily, there is nothing better than working out, taking a long hot shower, slapping on a mask and enjoying a cup of tea afterwords. Your pores will be wide open and ready.    I say dual action because this actually makes a stupendous spot treatment as well. So while I will use the mask once or twice a week, if anything... unpleasant....pops up I&#x27;ll put a dab of this on at night. Not only is it great at combating the acne itself, it reduced redness quite a bit as well. Also, I just happen to LOVE the smell, and using sulphur was unique for me. 5 big fat stars for this one for sure.     Another tip: If you like strips like me, try putting the mask on after using the strips (you&#x27;ll want to rinse your face with warm water in between). I say this cautiously because it may be disastrous for some of you with super sensitive skin, but I love the sensation, since I am always worried that my strips will dislodge something but not get it totally up and it will hang around. Also I feel like the mask closes up pores after they have been gutted by a strip</li>
            <li> I really like this mask quite well. The only thing bad about it is at times it can dry out my face a little. Other then that, I totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have used Proactiv refining mask occasionally for the past five years. I ordered this after I ran out of my other container and did not want to deal with the proactiv company and their auto-renewal compliance. The product smells similar but it is somehow a little different than the stuff I bought directly from the source. The bottle is also a little different, maybe it is an older design...that would explain the slight differences. All in all, it works the same and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so great - I love what it does for my skin!</li>
            <li> I love the mask because it actually works and does not dry my skin out. I have sensitive skin that tends to be on the dry side as it is, so finding something to treat my pimples without making them red and irritating my skin was impossible until now.</li>
            <li> Significantly less acne within two uses.</li>
            <li> I may be an adult, but I am still plagued by occasional acne and have bumps under the skin. This is a fabulous mask that makes your face look and feel cleaner. It reduces any bumps and red zits immediately plus can be used as an overnite spot treatment for a stubborn zit. Amazon&#x27;s price is much less than going through ProActiv. Great product. If used a few times a week, you&#x27;ll see results even if you don&#x27;t use the rest of ProActiv products.</li>
            <li> Love being able to buy the one product that I need instead of dealing with Proactive directly. Proactive&#x27;s customer service is terrible. Much rather purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I used Proactiv as a teenager to keep my skin clear, and they sent the refining mask as an extra &#x27;gift&#x27;. I&#x27;m now in my twenties and I still buy and use the refining mask even though I no longer need the rest of the line. It&#x27;s a refreshing mask that leaves such a nice &#x27;clean&#x27; feeling.    As an adult I have occassional acne when I spend too much time smoking and drinking and partying like a rockstar, and this is the perfect arsenal in my fight to stay young and handsome looking. Worked great as a hormone-crazed teen, too. Five stars.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve dabbled with several more expensive masks and nothing comes close to this one. Makes your face feel really cleaned out afterwards, without drying you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protip: put a dab on a burgeoning pimple before you go to sleep, and it&#x27;ll nip the thing in the bud. Works like a charm every time.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered Proactiv, I recieved a small sample of the Refining Mask and I loved it! I finally ordered the 2.5 oz Refining Mask a few weeks ago and my blackheads already appear much smaller! I have blackheads all over my nose and a few on my chin, and Proactiv never really helped with them. The Refining Mask works great for them. I use it 3 times a week, but if you have sensitive skin you should probably only use it once or twice a week because it can dry your skin out. I just skip the 3rd step of my Proactiv system (the Repairing Treatment lotion) on the nights I use the mask because using both the 3rd step and the mask can really make your skin dry. If you use Proactiv but can&#x27;t get rid of blackheads, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is decent for it&#x27;s money. I used it as a spot treatment and left a small amount on over night. It cleared up anything the first few times. Then it started to make me break out and i stopped using it for awhile. Tried it again and it did the same thing. Not sure if i&#x27;m using it to often or to much at once. Oh well.</li>
            <li> It is the only proactive product that I use.  It works at reducing the acne (but it doesn&#x27;t get rid of those little bumps) It can be pretty drying though, so you may need to exfoliate for the slight skin peeling, and don&#x27;t forget to moisturize.  I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> Have used this product before and like the results.  Usually by it directly from poractiv, but the price was right so I bought it on amazon.</li>
            <li> I found the mask to be so-so, but it must be said that Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch - you have to keep at it. Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results. This is the case for any acne treatment product really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time. So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it is not a magic potion capable of \\&quot;curing\\&quot; acne. Once you stop using the product, your acne will return unless you take active steps to maintain the health of your skin. It is often believed that merely using a product can be the only change made to help your skin. Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands.... having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it. If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it is HIGHLY likely be disappointed once you stop using Proactiv.</li>
            <li> I would give zero stars to this product, if I could.&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t know how people can write good reviews for a product that stinks so bad. OMG, I just could not stand the smell of this product on my face on the hours just after I used it... and it would stay no matter how many times I washed my face.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this product did absolutely nothing other than ad a bad smell to my face.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve used tons of acne products, and when I say tons I mean pretty much everything that&#x27;s available in stores, and then several prescription products. I tried Proactiv, and it really only succeeded in drying my skin out and actually making my acne even worse. The only product in the entire Proactiv system that I actually saw good results with is this refining mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the mask on my entire face, I just use it as an overnight spot treatment. I use a cotton swab to just dab a little bit on the surface of any pimples I have on my face, I let it dry, and I go to sleep with it on. Usually by morning the spot has reduced in size by at least half, or it&#x27;s completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re someone who has dry, acne-prone skin, you&#x27;ll have to use it sparingly, because it does really dry your skin.</li>
            <li> I use this mask all the time.  It&#x27;s great for oily skin!  The price on Amazon is the cheapest around and it comes sealed so you know it&#x27;s never been used.</li>
            <li> works okay - not as well as i hoped</li>
            <li> I love the proactiv refining mask. Love it. With that said, it is not an overnight magic mask. It will not get rid of your &#x27;flaw&#x27; overnight. However, it will reduce the size greatly. It may dry it up really fast, and your skin might get &#x27;flaky&#x27; but, i&#x27;d rather have a little patch of skin being flaky from peeling off and drying out the pimple, then having the pimple itself. One of my favorite products from proactiv, and I will re-purchase this product. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and have battled moderate to severe acne on my face (mainly forehead and chin area) since high school and have tried just about every acne product under the sun that you can buy in stores as well as tried a couple of different prescriptions from my doctor, but NOTHING has worked.  This past winter, I got desperate and finally broke down and ordered the entire Proactiv 3-step system.  As a bonus, this refining mask came with it.  The 3-step system was a total waste and did absolutely nothing for my acne whatsoever.  All it did was irritate my skin like crazy and made my face insanely red and excessively dry.  After using it for a little over a month, I finally gave up on it.  I then decided to give this refining mask a try.  I figured I had nothing to lose, so I applied it to my entire face after I took a shower and left it on all night.  To my amazement, the results were almost immediate after putting it on!  The big, red zits on my forehead almost immediately started to fade and shrink!  I was ecstatic!  I didn&#x27;t even have this result with prescription acne creams!  When I washed it off the next day in the shower, my face looked SO much better!  The acne on my forehead had faded significantly!  The best part about this stuff is that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin overly dry.  My forehead tends to be oily and this mask really helps with that quite a bit.  As others have said, this stuff doesn&#x27;t smell too great, but the smell is absolutely worth the results!  I now refuse to run out of this stuff and always keep an extra tube of it in the house.  It&#x27;s so much cheaper and more convenient to buy right here on Amazon rather than going through Proactiv directly, which can be a huge pain.  I now use this product about 3 times a week.  I put it on before I got to bed and leave it on all night.  I&#x27;m so happy with the results it gives me!  Don&#x27;t even think about wasting your time and money on the entire Proactiv 3-step system.  It&#x27;s horrible.  Just get this stuff!You won&#x27;t regret it!  I just ordered some more!</li>
            <li> Not worth it.  Is not how they describe it on t.v., \\&quot;Dab some on and pimple is almost gone when you wake up.\\&quot;  Does dry you out too.  Would NOT buy again.  Proactiv is overpriced.  Many friends have said it does not work.  Don&#x27;t be sucked in by the stars saying it works.  They are getting paid.</li>
            <li> I expected this product to work better than it did, truth be told. Its more like a cleanser than anything, with a bad odor. It does work, though, as I saw my skin clear up after about 5 uses. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and love it. Also fast shipping. Better buying here then from the malls in the kiosk, you will spend a lot more then here.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin. The fact that I can use the sulfur treatment on my face without a zing of pain emanating from my face attests to the wonders of this product. Now because I do have sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve had to forego almost any other product that bears the proactiv label. Benzoyl Peroxide gives my extremely sensitive skin a severely allergic reaction, but this- THIS my face cannot only withstand but it seems to love. It works great as a traditional mask; I cover the blackhead prone areas and recent blemishes and am left with a more healed, less irritated face. How many people can say THAT about an acne zapping product?! Recently, I&#x27;ve found it also does wonders as an overnight treatment. I place a small dollop on each blemish and allow to sit overnight as I sleep. The treatment hardens leaving the formula on my face where it belongs instead of on my pillow case where most formulas generally end up.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product! I have used proactive for many years and this mask is INCREDIBLE! I put a small amount on in the evening, go to bed with it still on, and wake up and wash it off. The blemish I covered the night before is either completely gone (95% of the time) or SIGNIFICANTLY better (the other 5% of the time). The sulfur in this product gives it an anti-inflammatory quality that is quite effective! The other reason I LOVED this purchase was the affordable price.  When you buy the mask directly from proactive you will pay much more (like $20 or $30 more). This price is absolutely incredible. I would recommend this mask to ANYONE.</li>
            <li> Anytime I have a problem zit, or need to have amazingly clear skin for an event, I use this product. I&#x27;m a fan of Acne Free&#x27;s spot 10% Benzoyle peroxide treatment, but this face mask works even better. I use it as overnight spot treatment or a mask. I&#x27;m always amazed by the results.</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible!  It leaves a film/residue on my face even after scrubbing hard.  I actually had to get my regular face cleanser and had to wash my face AGAIN after washing this mask off just so I could get this stuff off.  And in case your wondering, no this stuff did not improve my skin, even after several uses.   I&#x27;m going back to my Biore mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to order from a source other than proactive because they put you on the automatic shipments. This is for my son and a little goes a very long way. I was very happy to find it on Amazon and the size is larger than I expected. This is definately a great buy.</li>
            <li> The tube is huge, effective and cheap. I will buy this product every time I run out and I even bought some for my sister.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the formula was officially changed or what, but this refining mask product has not been nearly as effective as it was before when it was not so much a flat cream as it was an exfoliating and refreshing face mask. Main point: this stuff doesn&#x27;t work. It actually made me break out rather than making my skin clearer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my empty bottle of DERMAdoctor Ain&#x27;t Misbehav&#x27;in sulfur mask which I do like better because of the lid pump, it doesn&#x27;t smell like baby butt cream like proactive does and it really worked great. But the price is $45 plus shipping on Amazon for 2.3 oz. and the proactive has a greater sulfur percent and also 2.5 oz for $10 give or take. It does have a baby butt cream smell but goes on smooth and works just as well, but I hate the screw on and off cap vs a snap on snap off cap-small issue but on a daily use it becomes annoying when you are tired and want to go to bed asap without acne in the am.</li>
            <li> Received this product in a manilla envelope the proactive had a large crack in the bottom and product was smeared all over inside of envelope.  When contacted the distributor they told me to mail it back to them at my cost with a card inside the original package (which was covered with the cream) saying we wanted a new one shipped to us.   Horrible customer service, will never do business with again.</li>
            <li> I use this product differently. I apply it to any new large break out pimples. They are gone usually in 1-3 days. However, it did discolor my towels/washcloth. I changed them to white. Very good product.</li>
            <li> These reviews are supposed to be about the item, not if it worked for you. It arrived in perfect condition and sealed. It is more convenient buying here instead of the Proactiv website. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been dealing with acne for several years. I also tried this product. I&#x27;ve tried so many different products and it seems like nothing really works except few products that I&#x27;ve found. But this massive advertised product doesn&#x27;t really work for me.   I used their whole line for few months but No! It doesn&#x27;t work!!</li>
            <li> I have moderate acne and have been using this sulfur mask for about ten years now. It is one of the few products from Proactiv that I would recommend for people with moderate to severe acne (Proactiv products are mostly for people with light/ teen acne). This mask should be applied in a thin layer, leave on for 15-30 minutes (could be longer if you want), then rinsed off with warm water and cleanser (very important to use a cleanser or else traces of this stuff will remain and can clog pores). This mask helps reduce redness, tightens pores, and shrink some pimples. It doesn&#x27;t do much for black/white heads. One regular size tube lasts a long, long time. Amazon sells this stuff at a lower price than other vendors. My seller was The Acne Prevention Place, fast shipping and good packaging.</li>
            <li> I got the Proactiv Solution Refining Mask as a freebie with my purchase of a 90 day 5-step system, and for awhile, I was really happy with it. Although applying this mask as a spot treatment on my blemishes did not provide the \\&quot;and my pimple totally disappeared overnight\\&quot; effect that many customers swear by in the commercial; it did succeed in drying up my acne, relieving any active zits of their redness, and generally accelerating the rate at which they healed. However, when I applied this as a mask to my entire face and left it on for the recommended 10 minutes, it completely tore up my skin. It was extremely itchy, covered in small white bumps and big red blotches. A few of my friends had a similar experience, and we all decided that we must be sensitive to the active ingredient in the Proactiv Solution Refining Mask: Sulfur. This mask smells very unpleasant--just like sulfur--and I cannot consciously recommend this product after my own negative experience. However, I am not discounting this product as unworthy. A lot of people have had success with it, and I am sure that it is not a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; product. But I don&#x27;t think that it would benefit very sensitive skin types, as sulfur can cause more harm than good.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Proactiv products for several years.  This is great for blemishes and if you put it on overnight it clears it up by morning.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had very severe acne growing up and all throughout most of high school. The Proactiv kit itself didn&#x27;t really work for me because it was too harsh, but the refining mask always helped clear up some of my worst acne. Since I have very sensitive skin, I have a hard time finding products that won&#x27;t irritate my skin or make the problem worse. Lately, I&#x27;ve been having a few bouts of acne, so I decided to buy the refining mask by itself to help me with spot treatments. It&#x27;s still the same as it was 10 years ago! I use a small amount on a pimple and after the first application, the redness goes away. When I use it again on the same area on the second day, the acne starts to disappear, and by the third day, it&#x27;s usually gone or nowhere near as visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend following the directions as stated on the product: wet the area before application, leave on for 10 minutes, and rinse off. I find that leaving it on any longer will make my skin too dry, as the product is intended to draw out the toxins on the affected area. You can use it as a facial once in a while, but the size of the bottle is pretty small, so it lasts longer to use as a spot treatment. I would also recommend using it right after you come out of the shower, as your skin is thoroughly moisturized and your pores are in better shape for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I&#x27;d recommend that you use a very thin layer of the product when you&#x27;re applying it to your skin. Other reviewers have complained that it dries out your skin, which can be true depending on what type of skin you have. Although my skin is very sensitive, I find that applying a thin layer rather than spreading it on think really makes a difference for me.</li>
            <li> Im gonna start using this now, if it works, I will buy more. I will edit this review if proactiv worked.</li>
            <li> I have been using Proactiv for years now and won&#x27;t stop.  It is excellent for acne whether young or older!</li>
            <li> This item did not seem to help my grandson&#x27;s acne, even when used with the other Proactive products.  I think Proactive is over rated.</li>
            <li> I tried the whole proactive package for several months with no success.  The refining mask, however, reminded me of a product that had helped me years ago, but had since been discontinued.  I decided to order this product by itself and it&#x27;s working well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the item shipped quickly.  No complaints.  Great Service.</li>
            <li> Great product - my son is 15 and when he uses continuously it works great. I do notice that when he skips a day or two, the acne comes back full force; however he is very active in sports activities and doesn&#x27;t wash his face as often as he should.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great for teenagers, young adults or anyone who wants to have great skin. superfast shipping, good price, excellent seller. Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> This takes acne out back for a butt whuppin. Straight up DESTROYS acne dead in it&#x27;s tracks. This is priceless.</li>
            <li> THis mask is wonderful. It helps clear my skin with just one use. I can see and feel a difference in my skin right after it is washed off. I love it!</li>
            <li> I kid you not, this refining  mask is the one thing that makes Proactiv awesome. I use this overnight on any area I think may possibly have a pimple later and it works like a charm. I think it&#x27;s a great addition to the regular proactiv program, but this is really the only part I use. You can use this as a face mask and leave it on for about 15 minutes until it dries, and this is on your entire face. And then  you can do what a lot of people do with it which is use it for spot treatment. It does a really god job of drying the pimple out if worn through the night. I have the mini sample one that came with the 3 step proactiv and it has lasted me a while now, I&#x27;m still not done with it and I got it in august. And I have used it on my entire face a few times as well as just on the spots. SOoooooo, therefore I would recommend this to anyone who is already using the proactiv products and was like \\&quot;I dunno if i wanna try this...\\&quot; and also to anyone else who doesn&#x27;t even use proactiv, or uses it but not regularly or even follows the steps like meee.</li>
            <li> i have a pretty greasy face, but use other acne products. this is a sulfur based acne product, smells funny, works great. and it does sort of dry your face out but not horrible. i like that is something different then sasylic acid or benzoyle peroxide. arived in a gppd timely manner</li>
            <li> I think this product is probably not suitable for some people.  I have medium cystic acne, and this product just does not work for me at all.  I don&#x27;t see any changes in my condition.  I was really hoping this refining mask reduce my acne problem without me having to intaking any medication. But it doesn&#x27;t work for me at all. So i got back on the pill. So just a word of caution, if you have deep set cystic type acne, this probably won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy! I bought this for my wife and she used it for about a month and it was not working like it had in the past. Usually, any blemishes were gone overnight, but not this time. Finally, after a couple more months I looked at the end and saw it had expired in 2007...three years old at the time of purchase!!! Extremely unhappy with this purchase. Make sure it is not expired before you order! On a lighter note, if it is not expired, this product works very well!</li>
            <li> I love this product, this was actually my favorite item from the whole kit. What I do is use Dessert Essence face wash (which is amazing by the way, go ahead and look for it here on amazon. I have the orange one and it has AMAZING reviews), anyways I have use the Dessert Essence face wash and then I put this mask on spots and bumps only. I let it dry, and then I sleep with it, I don&#x27;t put it on my whole face because I only have a couple recurring problem areas and it would be a waste of product to put it on my entire face. So seriously folks, just dab it on spots only, and leave it over night. The bump part of it is literally GONE. I had a raised reddish bump on my chin, I put a tiny bit on, slept with it, and BAM. NO bump in the morning, it was flatter and smoother than Paris Hiltons tata&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product!!!</li>
            <li> This cream works well on blemishes. I put it overnight and sometimes in the morning the pimple has slim down.</li>
            <li> In my experience this product works very well as an overnight treatment. It effectively dries out oily skin, but does not cause excessive drying as the higher-concentration benzoyl peroxide treatments can do. Effectively helps to cleanse existing acne and to prevent new acne from forming.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great , clears acne, so does clearskin acne kit, clean and clear face wash, and queen helene face mask which also has sulfur</li>
            <li> this is one of my HG spot treatments, even though i hate the rest of the line. i use as a mask only when my face is in total chaos, otherwise a night time spot treatment that works wonders! warning, can be very drying.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin but this product is actually not too harsh for me. It does a great job of removing old skin and refreshing the face but I make sure to immediately use my normal products afterword to limit any bad reaction.  I use the refining mask once every two weeks or so and I love the glow it gives my skin!</li>
            <li> very good  product for a  cheap price .  it reduces pimple size and redness . I  use it  over night</li>
            <li> Been using the Proactive line for years due to menopausal pimples. Of the entire line, the mask is hands down my favorite!</li>
            <li> This product produced rough, dry patches on my face after using it as a mask, but I have found that it makes a wonderful spot treatment.  Just dab a little on each spot w/ a cotton swab and leave on overnight. I noticed by the next morning that my acne seemed smaller and less irritated. Not too messy and goes on easily.</li>
            <li> I have been use proactiv, the effect can also, the price is very cheap, much cheaper than taobao, suggested that the occasional use, daily use, the result is bad, doubt may contain hormones</li>
            <li> Delivered on time, a good plus. As long as you clean your face with soap and water or any other face cleaner, keep up with this a few days a week or everyday depends on the severity of an individuals acne/blackheads. It works really well. I leave it on overnight to let it do its thing and I wake up with clear skin.</li>
            <li> I suffer from adult acne.  The product works well as a night cream on new/old pimples.  Just be careful of your clothing and other stuff-it bleaches clothing.  It also works if you use it twice a week as a facial mask after you wash your face.  But like any other product, if you use it for a long time, the effectiveness wears off.  When this happens, stop using it for a few months and then go back to it.  My face has improved and I am happy with the results.  When you stop using this products the acne comes back, but as least it gives you a break!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, my skin loves it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get the refining mask after hearing all the good things about it on TV. I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since I was 15 and I am now 24. The only thing the mask did for me was make my face smell bad and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I figured this wouldn&#x27;t work which is why I didn&#x27;t purchase the whole line or order from proactive. Didn&#x27;t do anything. Might as well have used toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. Great product to eliminate zits. Stinks and can bleach fabric if it rubs off onto clothes.</li>
            <li> I used to use this in high school (about 12 years ago) and it always zapped my pimples without irritating my skin. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m older, but this mask is too harsh for my skin! It stings!! Still clears pimples though....just super uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This mask makes my face feel so fresh and clean.  I love the Proactive skin care Linda&#x27;s it is the only brand that works for me.</li>
            <li> I got the product and the shipping was smooth but I have been using it for a while and dont feel that it is original, it feels like a fake.</li>
            <li> Love the proactive face mask. Its the only proactive product I still use. And its much cheaper here on amazon. Definitely recomend it! :)</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Stops pimples from coming up (when you catch them before they break the surface)&lt;br /&gt;Kills the pimples already up&lt;br /&gt;Does not have a strong smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very drying&lt;br /&gt;Does not heal blemishes, just leaves them dryed out scabs&lt;br /&gt;Does nothing for blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had luck with this. It stopped a serious breakout in its tracks, which has never happened for me with any other product. After that week though, I stopped using on large areas (my jawline, where I breakout the most). I now only use it when I feel something coming up, and then moisterize the rest of my face. All in all a great product, but if you have dry skin already, you may want to pass this up.</li>
            <li> Having used this product before,I know what an amazing and effective item it is on treating blemishes.But this was such a fantastic buy and great price,I will certainly buy more from this seller in the future!</li>
            <li> Sulfur is making a comeback, after being a popular anti-acne medication years ago.  Back then, it was stinky - as most sulfur is - but now in pharmaceuticals its scent is masked by fragrance.  Regardless, the mask is great.  6% Sulfur is roughly what Murad and DDF masks have in them; they cost $30 for 2-3oz.  Proactiv is $5.  It doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate the skin.  Use once or twice a week on cleaned, moist skin.  I use benzoyl peroxide (Neutrogena Clear Pore) wash every day; this mask is for the major clean up duty.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing! This is the only product that I use from Proactiv, whenever I have a pimple I apply the mask at night and it&#x27;s usually gone by morning! I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> This product is the best spot treatment product I have tried.  My son has had issues with random breakouts and this, as is advertised... when you dab on spot at night - in the morning its either gone or noticably improved.  They sell this product at our local mall but you could not buy as a separate item and had to purchase entire kit.  Was happy to see it is now sold separately!  You don&#x27;t use much so it should last for a while</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product this still makes my skin feel clean,  so it may depend on your condition. I still use it because I feel like it&#x27;s at least doing something to make my skin better. Also it prevents acne. Most likely if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, what you have is a mite condition or bedbug condition</li>
            <li> My granddauter has been using this since high school. She puts in on each blemish the moment it appears. We giggle when she walks around at night with white dots on her face. It does work to make them go away faster. I reccomend it to all teenagers who hate when a pimple surfaces and battle with the embarrasment they bring.</li>
            <li> So happy when I used this for the first time. Left it on blemished overnight as it said to, and they were noticeably smaller the next day. I have not used it as a full face mask yet, but I have not had any adverse reaction so far, and hope that will continue. However, I have heard from others that it had the potential to bleach pillowcases, towels etc. which is not a huge deal, but definitely something to consider.</li>
            <li> This is excellent for spot treating acne, leaving on overnight or using as a full face mask and rinsing off. It can over dry your skin if you do it too often but it really helps to use overnight on cystic acne especially. It reduces the swelling visibly the following morning. When I use it as a mask, it reduces the redness as well. My daughter uses this as well and it has worked wonders for both of us. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old has been breaking out since last year. We tried Dermalogica, Obagi and Neutrogena with some help but her face was not clear.  This along with the Solution Repairing Treatment has worked great! We still use the Dermalogica Clearing skin wash and interchange it with the Obagi acne wash so I do not think which wash that you use matters.</li>
            <li> This refining mask is (for me) far too strong to apply to my entire face, which is neither sensitive nor oily.&lt;br /&gt;However, it works wonders when used as a spot treatment for those stubborn pimples that do appear from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone who has experienced these annoying pimples.&lt;br /&gt;Within a couple of days, those ugly things are dried up and well on their way to complete healing.</li>
            <li> I bought the Proactiv Solution Refining Mask to help control some stubborn pimples! Believe it or not, at 53 - I still get pimples! I saw all the advertisements for this product on tv and thought that I would give it a try. I can say it honestly works! My daughter tried it too - and she was so pleased with the results, she bought her own tube!</li>
            <li> The product is good, but the business practices of this company are horrible.  Once you order from an advertisement or a special in the newspaper or visa advertisement, the company just automatically sends shipments of their product at two to three times the introductive price and you are obligated to pay for them, unless you choose to pay to have them sent back.  You the customer are never asked if you would like another shipment.  They come once every month at a very high price, unless you make it known that you do not want the product.  You are not given the option to go to the store or kiosk and purchase what you want, when you want it.  The product works well, but their business ethics are horrible.</li>
            <li> Do NOT order this product. They will charge you even after you cancel your account. It&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> I love using masks with all kinds of different benefits! The claim to reduce acne is true, sulfur naturally kills bacterial acne and therefore will help acne. In some commercials, endorsers say \\&quot;put a little dab on your acne and it will disappear over night!\\&quot; In my experience this is not true. I generally try to use this mask once per week to help with acne, and it does help control acne. Sulfur is only proven to fight bacterial acne, not cystic.     Unfortunately my pale skin turns beat red and stays red up to a day after use of this mask. I suppose this is a slight allergic reaction to the sulfur, or maybe just over sensitivity. My suggesting is try using a little bit on a small part of your have, and then use it in other areas if you do react badly.     This is the only product from the proactiv line I use, although I have tried the entire line.</li>
            <li> All of my life I suffered from bad acne.  I was so self-conscious. I tried everything I could find to clear up my skin.  The first time I tried the Refining Mask by Proactiv I immediately so a difference.  My skin felt different.  I am now completely acne free and have been for years! I would highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from acne!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like pro-activ, but I LOVE this mask :)  If you leave it on a blemish over night the next morning it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li> doesnt clear up the ance and it dried my skin out alot!!! i even boke out more and it wasnt good at all</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have every used for my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After far too years with acne I finally found this. I did not think anything would ever help my complexion and had given up on using anything but plain soap and water. I finally ordered ProActiv and this item was part of the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy to find a great price and a great vendor of this product on Amazon. I was skeptical and feared that it may be a knock off or damaged in some way but the product arrived and it is exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to order more from this same vendor right away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fair price for something i feel has a huge potential to work on most peoples acne problems, because it really helps mine&lt;br /&gt;i have moderate acne and i bought this because i&#x27;ve used it before; me and my roommate both notice a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;BEST PART:&lt;br /&gt;it will take care of those big zits that are difficult to pop, speeds up the healing time.&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;like jessica simpson says, \\&quot;just a dab, that&#x27;s all you need\\&quot; - it&#x27;s true&lt;br /&gt;-especially a thin layer left on over night (use old pillow case)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good buy, good price, worth it.</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for the refining mask I would not be able to keep my acne under control.  My face cleansing routine varies. Sometimes I use proactive 3 step system, other times I use the Burt&#x27;s Bees brand or so on. No matter what brand or system I use, as long as I use the refining mask 2-3 times a week, my acne stays under control. As a woman during my time of the month, my skin gets extra oily and I tend to break out heavily. As long as I use this mask regularly, I no longer have these heavy break outs. This product is a must have for any acne sufferer!</li>
            <li> Tried the proactiv line several years ago. Worked really well against my occasional breakouts, but had to stop using it when the products began irritating my sensitive skin. But I did continue using the mask just as a spot treatment. As soon I feel a blemish emerging, I put on a dab and it&#x27;s usually gone by the morning. And if I don&#x27;t catch it in time, the mask helps it go away quickly. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is a life saver.  If you have a pimple starting you just put a dab of the mask on go to sleep and wake up the next morning and it is gone.  Also if you use it as a weekly mask it leaves your face feeling so tight, soft and refreshed.  Worth every penny</li>
            <li> All of the Proactiv products work for me.  I have neither dry nor oily skin.  My skin is just normal and this helps keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son, and it really works.  He uses it once a day all over his face after washing with Pan Oxyl 10% (found in Walmart and drug stores) at night, and leaves it on all night.  I have wasted a lot of money on many products, but have found that this was money well spent.  By the way, we found that the regular Proactiv Solution 3 step program did not work all that well for severe acne.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I PURCHASED ANY PROACTIVE PRODUCT AND IM HOOKED! IT WORKS LIKE A CLAY MASK, AND DOES REDUCE PORE SIZE NOTICEABLY AS WELL AS CLEAR MY SKIN UP. PLUS, IT ACTUALLY SMELLS DECENT!</li>
            <li> I had some whiteheads on my chin area and so far this mask has dried most of them up.  It does dry your skin so I wouldn&#x27;t use it often.</li>
            <li> Works great as others have stated. Use refining mask (just a little) to dry up unwanted zits. The price on Amazon is much cheaper than the proactiv website where they want you to buy their &amp;#34;system&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s hard to buy just the mask by itself, or to find on proactiv&#x27;s website where to buy it. When I called proactiv I was told just the tube would cost around $30, then I was told it would be cheaper for me to buy the whole &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; for $29.99 and get the mask as a free gift (smaller size mask) FYI this would auto-sign me up for the monthly proactiv system to be sent to me, and auto charge my CC!.&lt;br /&gt;***Thank goodness for Amazon where I can get the bigger tube for just $6.50 + free shipping with student prime.</li>
            <li> This product is terrific.  It works even better than the lotion.  REally gets rid of acne fast.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask for the past several years and love it.  I use it once or twice weekly and it really makes a noticeable difference on my skin.  I don&#x27;t like to use the entire Proactiv line, but this mask is awesome.</li>
            <li> This refining mask was just ok...i expected more from the product w/ the reviews i got from my friends. Only bought one tube and don&#x27;t plan on purchasing another. I used this mask 2-3 times a week after washing my face. It did make my face feel tight and clean but I still got break outs regularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used proactive products for 8+ years, as a teenager i had horrifically painful cystic acne and proactiv was my only saving grace. this mask literally must be magic. it smells gross cause it&#x27;s sulfur but when you wash it off it looks like your pores were sucked in and invisible. though i&#x27;ve outgrown my acne over the years i have to say this is the only mask that actually does zap huge zits and make them dissapeer. some people use this just for individual pimples however i prefer to use the mask all over 1-2 times a week. i absolutely love it and now that i know how cheap it is on amazon i&#x27;ll probably just continue to order it off here instead of those stupid kiosks in the mall. also got here SUPER fast. probably like 2 or 3 days. love love love love. so happy</li>
            <li> This is the only product I use from the Proactive line.  I do prefer Obagi for daily skin care.  But the refining mask is a great skin care &amp;#34;staple&amp;#34; for a twice a month deep cleaning.  Its not as expensive as other high end masks and works remarkably well for me.  Its always nice to be able to purchase those salon/spa products on Amazon and have them shipped within 2 or 3 days.  The other nice thing is that you do not have to purchase the entire LINE of products from Proactive or have them talk you into the &amp;#34;auto&amp;#34; ship- that was always a big turn off for me with Proactive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Proactive Refining Mask and the Acnefree Sulfur Mask so I will compare the two brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Proactive works well as a MASK and my pores were less noticeable after using it but it is NOT a good Overnight Spot Treatment for existing pimples because it stays damp and gets all over my pillow so it ends up in my hair. It&#x27;s always tacky/sticky on my face and never dry so it feels gross if I attempt to sleep with it on my face when attempting to dry up an existing pimple before morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Acnefree Sulfur Mask is OUTSTANDING!!!! This one SHRINKS my pores to almost non-existance and because it has incredible drying agents it really gets rid of existing pimples quickly when used as an Overnight Spot Treatment. It dries COMPLETELY so it doesn&#x27;t rub off on my pillow or end up in my hair so I can sleep comfortably and wake up with smaller zits as well!!</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of this stuff. I used it in the past and it seemed to only make my pimples worse.. more irritated and red. The only upside is that it reduces blackheads a little bit but it makes my skin feel too dry. I won&#x27;t be buying again</li>
            <li> The Refining Mask is the best defense against Acne.  The speed at which I was able to get a blemish free face, upon receiving the product very quickly, makes for for an A+ in my book.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and I haven&#x27;t found anything that works as well.  I am glad I am able to buy that separately.  You only use a little, so my last one lasted 4 years and still worked just as well.  I highly recommend it for spot treatment.</li>
            <li> Helps refine texture of skin,cleans pores and helps with acne. Did not dry out skin. use 2X week.will reorder again.</li>
            <li> Some people report that this is a miracle treatment that clears blemishes overnight. This was not my experience, but I do feel it helps blemishes to clear faster than without it. I have fairly sensitive skin and I did not find it to be overly drying, nor did it make blemishes more difficult to cover with make up. I used this as an overnight spot treatment. I found the smell somewhat unpleasant - it reminded me of diaper cream... Must be the sulfur. However, the scent was not overwhelming and I was able to ignore it after a few nights. Ultimately, when this tube runs out I will purchase it again. It&#x27;s not a miracle but it does help.</li>
            <li> This does really help with reducing acne, I see major improvement if left on over night, other than that the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t believe the price and this stuff really works. i put it on problem spots at night and by morning they are almost gone</li>
            <li> My grand kids SWEAR by this product!  It&#x27;s the only thing they have tried that really does a SUPER job on their acne!  If you can&#x27;t afford to purchase the entire kit offered by Proactiv, then buy THIS, at least.  Young people don&#x27;t get excited by much, but they DO get excited by this product, because it WORKS!</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t even work at all to be honest, i put this one for like 2 months and my face still looked exactly the same as when i first put it.. hmmm maybe proactive just doesn&#x27;t work for me, and i have bought the whole system as a teenager... I gave proactive another short, but proactiv let me down once again, i would not buy this once again..</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few times, but i feel good when I put it on. Not sure how effective it will be if I continue using it. This is for sure a great deal for an add-on item which only costs you a couple bucks!</li>
            <li> Excellent size and price. Love this product and use it all the time! Excellent spot treatment for breakouts. Quick shipment.</li>
            <li> this mask is just magic, one application and it cleans up any stuborn pimple so quick, so effective.  The best mask I ever tried over 15 years of fighting acne</li>
            <li> I do not like dealing with the Proactive ordering system, and was happy to find product on Amazon.  It is nice to be able to order them on my own timeline.  I really like using this as a mask and for spot treatment.  It smells a little funky, but leaves my skin soft and feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!  Have been using it for the past year and it really does make your skin look better.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Works good.. I&#x27;ve noticed a visual difference in my skin and some of the blackheads.. but it takes a few times maybe before you see those kind of results.. but works better than most of the other stuff I bought before.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  The other Proactive products irritated my skin but this works well for spot treatments and also as a weekly mask if your skin is oily.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care for proactiv as a company due to the number of times they over charged me and added fees and double shipped orders then charged me for both. That being said, I do enjoy this product. I have redness in my t-zone that this mask calms.</li>
            <li> I like this skin mask to sleep with over night, after its applied on my acne.  It helps shrink the pimp, if not clear the pimple.  Good product, and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> very useful&lt;br /&gt;use it in the night with a lot will work well&lt;br /&gt;good production and I got it on time</li>
            <li> The first day I used this product I fell in love with it but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it from the manufacturer. They want you to bundle it with their other products.</li>
            <li> It is just not the right product for my skin. I don&#x27;t notice any change all the time I use it.</li>
            <li> This works great on my face especially when I have small pimples, I just put a little on my face for&lt;br /&gt;5 mins then wash, and pimples start to fade.</li>
            <li> This is the first Proactiv product I bought and It is a great product, reduces the blemishes size and redness! I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for several years now and I love it! I started using it before I got pregnant with my six year old daughter, when I was told that I would not be able to take my acne medications during a pregnancy. The Proactiv commercials claim that you will see results in two weeks. For me it took two months, but it was well worth waiting for!,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually give myself a facial using this mask once every few days...occasionally as often as twice a week.  I love the way it makes my skin feel, so smooth, soft, and tingly clean!  I usually steam my face first---the directions says to apply to dampened skin--then apply the mask, wait 15 or 20 minutes (the directions say 10 minutes, but I like to wait a bit longer) then removed with warm water, or a moist washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great use for this mask is as a blemish treatment; whenever I have a pimple, I apply a dot-size amount of the mask to the area and wear it overnight.  After doing this for about two or three nights, the mask dries out the pimple.  It&#x27;s really amazing how well it works!  I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> great stuff. use as a mask or spot treatment. use thin layer over night or thick mask for an hr. retracts pores and smooths skin. will dry up acne QUICK. but stinks to no end like sulfer and bleaches anything it touches lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this since it came out years ago. I use it mostly for spot treatment for a breakout since my skn is very sensitive and most acne treatments are too harsh for my skin. I apply a small amount to clear skin before going to bed and it clears up quickly.</li>
            <li> This purifying mask really does reduce the look and size of pores.  SKin look more even toned and BEAUTIFUL!! LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> The instructions on the package make it very clear this is an acne treatment. Too bad the on-line information down-plays this fact. If you don&#x27;t have acne...pass this product by.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff.  It does wonders for her complexion. We will continue to buy this product in the future</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product for when my skin feels dull or I see blackheads - you put it on for 5 minutes then wash it off.  The before and after is TV-worthy…it clears your skin right up!  I use it 2-3x a week and it keeps my skin clear.  It is also great as a spot treatment if you feel a blemish starting - dries it right up!  (my teenage son tends to use it for that a lot)!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using Proactiv for a few years and have not needed to use it as regularly as I had in the beginning.  This refining mask will zap and blemished you have almost overnight and shrinks the appearance of pores. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I use it at night so when I wake up in the mornings my face feels so much clearer and fresh. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is the proactiv three step systems secret weapon .it works like a charm and has two different applications that are very affective. As a 10 minute mask it  eliminates extra oil.as an overnight spot treatment it is a tough villain against pimple man</li>
            <li> I ordered and paid for the 2.5 oz item as described in the photo and only received a 1.0 oz container.</li>
            <li> This works so well for acne, I have tried a lot of products and this is the BOMB. Get it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this refining mask by proactiv. It is the only product from their line that actually works for me. Whenever I see or feel a breakout coming, I dab a little bit of this product on that spot and the size reduces significantly. Definitely a must have for me.</li>
            <li> this mask has been the best spot treatment, the smell is off putting and a little hard to get use to but overall it works really well.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past. Great product, put it on a pimple, blemish etc, it shrinks it and soothes it. Takes about two days The end.</li>
            <li> After spending tons of money on a pricier Rx version, this product does the same thing. Works well to help fight acne and keep your skin looking good. It is not as thick and dries easier than the Rx version I had as well. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product...does what it advertses. Add a little to a pimple before and what a big difference in the morning...pimple is much smaller. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing.I bought this and the face wash. The wash helps but this just made big scabs on my face.</li>
            <li> This mask is AMAZING!! Not only does it refine your skin and provide a deep cleaning, but it practically gets rid of blemishes overnight. Skin feels smooth, pores are smaller, and skin has a clarified appearance. Love love love this mask.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and my teenage son now uses it as well.  Put a little on your acne before bed and it clears up very quickly.  No harsh side effects like most acne products have, no drying out of skin or making it worse.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> The mask is doing a great job in clearing up my complexion. I use it to spot treat blemishes overnight and often they are gone by morning.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Works ok but is overpriced</li>
            <li> My problem is blackheads and enlarged pores. This is the best product I&#x27;ve found so far. Costs a fraction of what I&#x27;ve paid in the past.</li>
            <li> For the money, it&#x27;s very good. Helps to clear up my face and refine my pores. My existing blemishes don&#x27;t go away overnight (darn), but I do notice that I have far less acne when I use this. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 18 and have light, acne prone combination skin. I tried tons of products to get my constant acne to clear up, but it would only work for two weeks and then come back full force. I refrained from experimenting with the really expensive products because I wanted to save my money for college. I didn&#x27;t know what to do. I was totally at a loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one day, I was hanging out with my friend and she told me about how she had cleared her recent breakout with Proactiv Refining Mask. Apparently, both she and her friend used it as a mask and spot treatment at night. She had gorgeous skin and I was so jealous. She told me to try it. So, I immediately took her advice, bought it online, and never looked back! Instead of damaging the outer layer of skin to shrink pimples, it heals from the instead and makes my skin soft and glowing! Most of my acne clusters were gone within a few weeks! It works fast too! If I feel a pimple coming on, I can spot treat that area overnight and my skin will stay clear! Since the spot treatment is a bit tough to get off in the morning, I use a makeup remover wipe and it comes right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE OR ACNE PRONE SKIN, PLEASE GIVE THE PROACTIV REFINING MASK A TRY! My skin gets ocassional pimples now and then but I can clear them up within a few days. I&#x27;m so happy with my skin its ridiculous. Big thank you from this teen!</li>
            <li> I like to use this as a spot treatment at night.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Love this product for many years!!!</li>
            <li> Of course it depends on what type of skin you have, but I find this does work decently well as a spot treatment for me. I have fairly oily skin in the summer and somewhat drier skin in the winter. The main disadvantage though is the smell. Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m single so no one else is subject to the side effect-smelliness of this product. (It&#x27;s main active ingredient is sulfur - so think a less potent rotten-egg type smell).</li>
            <li> ALSO USE AS A SPOT TREATMENT AT NIGHT! GREAT PRODUCT GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li> Does not work nearly as well as Acne Free&#x27;s brand of sulfur mask for me, but still helped clear up a few blemishes as an overnight spot treatment; with two-three treatments, of course. It&#x27;s not as magical as the &amp;#34;I wake up and there&#x27;s no acne!&amp;#34; commercial would lead one to believe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used the product and loved it.  However, the package I received was not 2.5 ounces.  It was a free trial size- 1 ounce- that I paid $9.95 for.  The seller put their own sticker on the box saying it was 2.5 ounces, but the printing on the Proactiv box says 1 ounce, and the small tube inside says 1 ounce.</li>
            <li> This product works well with the solution and blemish treatment. You can really see a difference. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this stuff for the past 4 years. It is my number one go to for spot treatment. Most of the time it works over night if I catch them early enough.</li>
            <li> Works better then prescription medication from a doctor!</li>
            <li> Best zit remover ever! It just dries them up before they even show up.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found this and at a great price&lt;br /&gt;I have used the whole line before but I find that the mask is a wonder&lt;br /&gt;A little goes along way</li>
            <li> My daughter uses proactiv. She ran out of the mask before her next shipment. This is just as good but a fraction of the cost. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Used this before during my teen years (now 26) product works just as expected. it literally dries out those bumps over night and tightens pores! i got my boyfriend hooked on this too.</li>
            <li> Product works well. If you leave the product on overnight, you will be pleasantly surprised when the sun comes up.</li>
            <li> This product has changed at some point over the years. It no longer works like it used to. I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> gift for my daughter, she loves the product!</li>
            <li> PROACTIVE REFINING MASK IS AWESOME!!! CLEARS UP ACNE SO FAST! I HAVE TRIED SO MANY ACNE PRODUCTS AND NOTHING COMES CLOSE, TO THE EFFECTIVNESS OF THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> minimized the appearance of my acne. works best as a spot treatment. not all over coverage. doesn&#x27;t have the best smell but i wouldn&#x27;t trade that for the effects it gives.</li>
            <li> Great product -received on time!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, I think it&#x27;s great and the easiest way to get it quick is from Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and it is an great acne fighter/controller. I recently bought it through Amazon.com and saved alot of money compared to buying it through Proactive which is the company which makes it. I use it on problem areas before I go to sleep and it really works great.</li>
            <li> Love this mask!!!  Use it every other day to help control breakouts and combat future breakouts!!!  I also use it at night to target a specific area of breakout if needed and it works great!!! Dries pimples up fast and leaves skin feeling silky smooth!!!  Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has oily or combination skin and is prone to breakouts.  Enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> I usually purchase this at the mall in the proactiv vending machine for about 20.00. This is well worth the price. Very happy with this and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This mask works wonders , over night I notice a big change .. I used it for almost a year than recently ran out . I love the fact that it&#x27;s very affordable here on amazon, unlike the proactiv website  . I am a little skeptical about it being the real deal , tonight is the first night I applied the mask , hopefully I&#x27;m not disappointed in the morning :) all in all i have had a great experience and reccomend this product .</li>
            <li> There are very few items that I&#x27;ve found to really help with large pores and oily skin.  However, the Proactiv Soution Refinding Mask really does help.  I first used this from a free sample and really liked it.  I ordered a small tube and it lasts forever.  This is not a product you need to use daily....I use it once a week.  But the effects seem to last.  It leaves my skin feeling super clean and tight.....no uncomfortable....but fresh and youthful.  I will definitely continue to purchase this.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by someone who does not like the proactive line, but only likes this product. This product works great! I use it every other night as a mask. I apply a thin layer to my problem areas which is my forehead and chin. I leave it on over night and then wash it off in the morning. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and my face has cleared up. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell, but it works well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 13 year old daughter, she uses it twice a week.  There is a significant decrease in her acne. I do believe you have to use all four products (Acne treatment kit) in order to see improvements! Bottom line it does assist with her acne prevention.</li>
            <li> I dont know if it just my sking but its not really working... I put it on as directed but I guess I have to keep waiting but I have had it fir two weeks..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my hormonal acne, I think it helped a little bit, but it&#x27;s definetley not a miracle product.</li>
            <li> Our son believes this is a magic cream.  Breakouts are a big problem for him but this seems to get them under control quickly.  Highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
            <li> Honestly this is my holy grail spot treatment. I am someone who doesn&#x27;t have severe acne but I get some occasional pimples. Anyways, when u feel a pimple coming, immediately apply this product and leave it on overnight. The pimple the next morning will be much less red and less inflamed. Also for cystic pimples this product helps so once applied the pimple disappears. A must have for any teenager or anyone dealing with any acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask for years. When I was younger (teens and early twenties) I had oily acne prone skin and used the entire Proactiv system. Now that I&#x27;m 30 and my skin has dried out, I use this mask once, or twice a week to clear my pores and to calm inflamed pimples. It works best after a shower when skin is soft and the \\&quot;gunk,\\&quot; in your Tzone is soft, too. I apply, hang out for twenty or thity minutes and rinse with warm water, or exfoliate with a warm wash cloth. Results are not permanent, but for a few days at least, bye bye blackheads. Remember, for BEST results, use this mask after your shower, or steam your face carefully over a pot of hot water with a towel (to catch the steam) and apply when skin is warm and soft. &#x3D;o)</li>
            <li> I was once a Proactiv user and eventhough my skin is oily it became very dry. I quit using Proactiv and then realized I needed to use a spot treatment. I tried everything but it either left me looking blotchy or it overdried my skin. I ordered just this refining mask and use everytime I feel something coming on. It works over night! I spot treat lightly at night and in the morning I do the same under my makeup. I LOVE IT!! I hope it&#x27;s a product I&#x27;ll be able to obtain from here on out. &#x3D;}</li>
            <li> Works good on clearing up your face, takes a few treatments to see results, but one they start its good...thank you proactive</li>
            <li> I had some acne for years. I tried proactiv it made me break out worse then I ever have. I stopped using it and it went away. The only thing that helped was the refining mask which I swear by. I sometimes get those blackheads on my tzone they disappear over night. Its just amazing!</li>
            <li> Great for exfoliation.  I would recommend regular usage, once or twice per week.  Cleans pores out better than most cleansers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best of proactive&#x27;s products if you get the occasional pimple. I use it whether or not I&#x27;m using their cleanser/toner/etc. ~Once/month just to clean your pores. I still get the occasional pimple, but less frequently. Maybe it&#x27;s also because I&#x27;m getting older, but I think this mask has a lot to do with it.</li>
            <li> I will say that following the instructions on this cream works well and helps clear acne. Glad to buy this product from Amazon.com. This product does what it is suppose to! I recommend this product. -@eplusq</li>
            <li> I use Proactiv Solution Refining Mask at least 3 times a week, I also use it as a spot treatment if I have new breakouts. The sulfur dries the pimples out over night and absorbs excess oil from my skin. I highly recommend using it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this several times over the last 10+ years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It used to work like a charm but I&#x27;m wondering if they increased the volume of the product while decreasing the strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One application (or the most two) used to eliminate any erupting &amp;#34;blemish&amp;#34;. Not so any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had my old tubes to compare the strength.  I&#x27;m no longer a strong supported as I was before. .</li>
            <li> I saw this advertised on tv as a quick overnight remedy for blemishes.  I had used the purple Avon cleanser/mask for a long time, which I really liked and stayed on well.  My intention was to leave it on as an overnight &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; mask but it really feels uncomfortable on my skin.  It does not dry like a normal mask, but rather has a gooey, sticky, wet feeling.  I did not notice any quicker blemish response with this product compared to clearasil, clearzit, clean&amp;clear, oxy, etc... and I most likely will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good mask but don&#x27;t put it near your eyes because of the sulfur in the product.  Admittedly, I put it on a few problem areas on my face and went to bed and somehow it got into my eyes so I had to rinse my eyes out with cold water.  The mask did calm the blemish and it made it easier for me to remove.  It&#x27;s a good acne mask.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but I have to use several layers for it to be somewhat effective against my acne...</li>
            <li> I use this as well as my husband and it&#x27;s my favorite proactive product. I use it on an as-needed basis on just blemish spots.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask for about 12 years !! Love The way it make my face look clear and fresh !! A must have !!</li>
            <li> I use it most frequently as a spot treatment. It works well for that. I will use it as a mask occasionally.</li>
            <li> I heard this product was a life-saver for some customers but it did absolutely nothing for me. Blemishes still there day one, day two, and up to day 5!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call this a mask.  It&#x27;s more like a spot corrector.  The smell of this stuff is awful.  I gave it 3 stars due to that fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, this didn&#x27;t work at all for me, but I have friends who swear by this product.</li>
            <li> It clears stuff up really well. I will be buying this again soon. It is gentle on my face too.</li>
            <li> By far the best mask I&#x27;ve ever used! I don&#x27;t use the other proactiv treatments but this I couldn&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> Works well with a moisturizer under the product. Put moisturizer first, then apply on top of acne or pimple. I will re purchase.</li>
            <li> you just have to put it in the spot were you need it the most. every morning &amp; night. glad I made the purchase</li>
            <li> It works very good and helps with acne scars too. It makes your skin clearer. Great product buy it you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> Works well to give my skin a clearer look. Seems to make pores smaller (or give the appearance).    However, my wife absolutely HATES the smell from the active ingredient SULFUR. No matter how much I rinse or scrub afterwards with a face towel, the smell still lingers.    The smell only gets WORSE if you follow it with the Proactiv toner (step 2). Yuck...</li>
            <li> it works i dont like pro activ because it makes my face really dry but this one work so i am glad that i read some review and ordered it and it came before its suppose to.</li>
            <li> not much for acne marks but great for skin overall!! and acne prong oily skin.. everyone in my family uses it and loves it arrived on time great price</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I&#x27;m 22 and have very sensitive skin. I break out like crazy! I&#x27;ve been using this every other day as an all over face mask and leave it on while I sleep. I&#x27;ve had amazing results. Works on all acne!</li>
            <li> I got this hoping my son would use it and that didn&#x27;t happen.  I&#x27;ve tried it once and my skin didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know if the product is just too strong or my skin is not use to it, but it made me break out really bad.&lt;br /&gt;smells awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will not buy again, giving this product away.</li>
            <li> I love this little mask.  I use it every now and then when I am doing makeover night at the house.  It really does leave my skin softer and shrinks the pores.  You can also put it on a blemish overnight and it will reduce the size of it and take away the redness.</li>
            <li> I was totally pleased that it arrived well before expected. Would definately recommend as the price is great as well.</li>
            <li> My Teenaged daughter received this on Christmas day as a stocking stuffer.  She has moderate acne and uses this product once a week along with the Proactive 3 pc Gentle Formula Clarifying Cleanser, Toner, Lotion.  She likes the mask, it has a nice smell and makes her face feel refreshed.  It&#x27;s Jan. 11th and not much of a difference can be seen in her skin.</li>
            <li> just what i was looking for. Its a lot less than going through Proactiv themself. I would buy individually everytime.</li>
            <li> I do not think I will buy this again. I have tried it twice but have to agree with some other reviewers- I haven&#x27;t seen it help reduce my spots (cystic acne with a few smaller surface spots). I bought Adult Acnomel instead and I will continue to use that. Acnomel also has sulfur but the combination in the Acnomel works much better than in this mask. I tried this mask as a 10 minute full mask and as a 10 minute spot mask and as an overnight spot treatment but really saw no improvement at all. Maybe it is just not right for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I use this on spots where i might have breakouts or even large pores. I notice a huge difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast love the product</li>
            <li> The sulphur in this mask always kicks my zits little as*es. I can&#x27;t live without it. It&#x27;s Always in my bathroom cabinet. Basic Essential.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I had an allergic reaction to this, or if my skin is just super sensitive. I have never had a reaction to any skin care product like I did with this one. The night I put it on, I smoothed a thin layer on all over my problem areas on my face, left it on for 5 minutes, and washed it off with warm water. My face felt amazing. In the middle of the night, I woke up because my face felt really itchy, but I didn&#x27;t think anything of it. When I woke up in the morning, my face looked like I had the worst sunburn of my life. It was bright red and covered in hundreds of tiny little red blisters and it itched/burned like crazy. That night, my skin began peeling and hasn&#x27;t stopped peeling for the last 4 days. I can&#x27;t wear makeup because it looks weird with all the dry flakes peeling off, so I have no way of covering my red, blotchy face. I&#x27;ve just been applying a calendula cream for dry, chapped, burnt skin and it seems to be helping. Anyway, since my face is so horribly dry now, I&#x27;m starting to break out again from my skin overproducing oils. I definitely wish I&#x27;d never tried this product. If you have very sensitive skin, try a spot test on your neck or something to see how you react to it before putting it all over your face like I did (silly me).</li>
            <li> I tried this one night at a friend&#x27;s house, when a rather large pimple was just starting to show it&#x27;s head. I dabbed a little on the pimple after washing my face, and crawled into bed. Much to my surprise, the next morning when I looked in the mirror, my blemish had completely disappeared. No red spot, no swelling, gone. I&#x27;m so excited to have my very own!</li>
            <li> Trying to get rid of the blackheads on your nose? This works, it is not a miracle over night fix your ugly ass but over a few weeks of treatment the blackheads will get smaller and so will your pores.</li>
            <li> My son uses this product and when he remembers to apply it,&lt;br /&gt;it works great!  I recommend it as one part of a complete acne&lt;br /&gt;regime.</li>
            <li> Overnight fix for my pimples.  I use the wash and this poroduct - keeps my skin clear and almost glowing!</li>
            <li> I use this and the medicated soap and it leaves me skin feeling clean and fresh.  I have sensitive skin and it works for it</li>
            <li> Used for 2 months now-is a good product for its price, not he best I have used but one of the more affordable. Great for frequent use, with a higher end brand once a month or so.</li>
            <li> I originally tried this product when I was 15 and now 6 years later its still my favorite blemish clearer :)</li>
            <li> Hate to admit, but I still fight breakouts at 67.......yes it is true.  I have used this for years directly on a blemish.  Will dry it up over night!  Works better then the prescription Metro Gel 1%!  Save some money, use this product and get results!</li>
            <li> Hate the scent and It doesn&#x27;t  work as quick as xout</li>
            <li> It dried up pimples real fast; it is part of my facial regime that i have been using it for over 6 years.</li>
            <li> I have added this to my weekly skin regimen. I ordered a bigger bottle after receiving a few small samples. It gives a little extra boost to my typical regimen. I use it weekly because daily might lead to dryness. It is one of the only things that works for the tiny blackheads on my nose. And I&#x27;ve tried a lot of face products!</li>
            <li> this is good for getting the bumps away but it drys my face and if you stop use it the bumps will come back</li>
            <li> Great product. Leaves face fresh, clean and rejuvenated. Easy application and removal. Skin looks younger and does not dry skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask.  It leaves my skin more polish. If used twice in a week, I get better results.</li>
            <li> Love proactiv products</li>
            <li> I have a very oily face and due to my job a lot of stress. My face suffers from both of these factors greatly! My cousin swore by Proactiv and she gave me some of the products, this being one of them. So I gave it a try. To my amazement after one use I could see a difference in my pores on my nose. I now use the face cleansing system and this product. It really is well worth the money and my skin feels so much better. One word of caution, proactiv in general can dry my skin out a bit. Its important to moisturize with step three!</li>
            <li> Works great on blackheads.</li>
            <li> I just used a dab to cover a zit at night and by morning, the zit is either gone or noticeably on its way.</li>
            <li> Great as a spot treatment. My pimples literally clear up overnight. Very nice! And it&#x27;s so cheap. Wow, $6 for a miracle pimple blaster. I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> I stopped using the 3-step system since i believe my skin got immune to it after while but I will never stop using this mask. Skin is softer, pores less visible and blemishes reduced after one use. Once you can get past the smell and are aware that taking it off fully might take more than a minute then you&#x27;ll love it. This is a must-have for me</li>
            <li> This was my very 1st proactive purchase, and I will def be venturing out with other Proactive brand products. Doesnt do so much for my blemishes, but my face does feel clean, and refreshed after the mask. My pores are also minimized which is what I was looking for too.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the few out there that alleviates my acne.  I appreciate that it can be used as a quick remedy or an overnight mask.</li>
            <li> I use it often and i see a difference in my skin. Works as a mask and an overnight treatment for problem areas</li>
            <li> I use this as overnight treatment for pimples, and have had as much luck with it as I&#x27;ve had with any benzoyle peroxide product. I haven&#x27;t tried it as a mask--a bit too drying for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> i bought this for the fact that most reviews were fairly good, tried it a couple of times. Just cant stand the horrible chemical smell at all, the smells so strong I always end up with a headache. and on top of that I saw no results from using this. yeah its a good deal for proactive, but didn&#x27;t work for my skin.</li>
            <li> I tried tons of different products and nothing was working. I&#x27;m on 30 meds daily and it made be have tons of acne that I&#x27;ve never had as a teenager. I&#x27;m 29 now. I use Proactive cleansing facial wash, treatment cream and my favorite: this mask. I sleep with it on as well. It takes about a week for 95% of acne to disappear. If Proactive is too harsh or it doesn&#x27;t work for you, you must try SEACRET mud mask. It is the best facial products I&#x27;ve ever used. I worked for Estée Lauder at Nordstrom for three years so I&#x27;ve very familiar with facial products. I know what works and what doesn&#x27;t. I thought the $500 Chanel cream was the only product that worked well and quickly. I stand corrected.</li>
            <li> This is the only item in the Proactiv kit that has been continuously effective, to me.  Everything else dries my face out.</li>
            <li> Be very careful with this mask- it can be very drying. Don&#x27;t leave it on a second more than the 10 minutes suggested. It does sort of even out the skin tone but I get dryness afterwards and perhaps more breakouts, so I&#x27;m not sure if it works.</li>
            <li> I feel cosmetic planets sulfur mask is better. This is good too, but I feel there are better cheaper items out there.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I get a deep under the skin cyctic acne. when one starts to come up and hurt, i douse it i this mask overnight and it prevents the cyst from further developing! great way to heal pimples fast and make them disappear overnight!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing I swear by it for those annoying pms zit pop ups ! I put it on any active breakout I have and withing the next day it has gone down dramatically and within a few days its gone ! I can&#x27;t live without this stuff defenitley worth a splurge !:) just be aware it does bleach clothing and hair and don&#x27;t put huge amounts it can burn your face but don&#x27;t let that freak u out like I said when used correctly its magic :)</li>
            <li> Love this. I have been using this product for 8 years. Now my daughter is using it...... She loves it.</li>
            <li> I use this mask for when my skin is breaking out and it really helps clear it up without overdrying.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical, not believing any of the commercials I saw on television. However, once I ordered it through Amazon and tried it, it was amazing!!  Proactive Solution Refining Mask really does work, and it saved my skin. I would easily purchase more when I run out. Super product!!</li>
            <li> Great Product as always. 2.5 Oz last a good while.</li>
            <li> When you first use this stuff it does help your skin somewhat, but after awhile your skin becomes more resistant and I found that every place you would dab this shit it would actually do the exact opposite of what it&#x27;s suppose to do. The real question is do you want to have clear skin for a day and then wake up the next morning only to have more acne? If you have persistent acne or mild acne I would look into a pill called Doxycycline, it kills the bacteria within the body that creates the acne in the first place. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> i love this mask so much. i have very sensitive skin so i was sort of nervous buying a product online that i have never used. i bought it i got it sooner than i expected and it definitely works it made my pores a lot smaller the first time i use it. however i dont recommend using it daily may once or three times a week.</li>
            <li> I tried the Proactive system when I was in high school. I didn&#x27;t feel that it worked any better than anything else I had tried already. But I absolutely love this mask! I use it as a spot treatment and it works very well!</li>
            <li> This product gave me an allergic reaction. My left eye became completely swollen and irritation all around my eye area.  I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Good product helps my skin to feel and look better even helps when I have a break out to clear it up faster thanks</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, to all, for blemishes and I also recommend rubbing raw honey afterwards for the scarring.</li>
            <li> I have had severe acne for years now, and i used this on top of Accutane. I have never had an acne product work, but this did. I was amazed on how fast it cleared spots up. It didn&#x27;t heal everything, but that&#x27;s just because my acne was severe. I would recommend this product for people who have any type of acne.</li>
            <li> Be very careful when purchasing this product. It is extremely watered down/diluted. It is possible the concentration of the active ingredients are lowered and, therefore, have a decreased effect compared to the original product.</li>
            <li> Product worked well to clear up breakout without over drying the skin. Recommend to use on those spot out breaks and monthly on normal skin with min outbreak.</li>
            <li> YES! IT WORKED JUST LIKE ON THE TV.IT CAME IN A NICE LITTLE PACKAGE FOR A VERY CHEAP PRICE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT WORKS!IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me my pimples actually stayed the same. and it was so hard to take off the massive pimples I get. left them even more red...</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t see any significant or even minor change on my skin while using this product. All it did was have an awful stench and sticky texture which i dreaded. Don&#x27;t spend money on this, for your own benefit.</li>
            <li> Makes your pimple go down overnight... and if you use it during the day, it keeps on working! Great product... I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with oily skin...</li>
            <li> This refining mask is the best! My skin is so soft and clear after using it for only a week.</li>
            <li> So far so good, but I have to wait to see the effect the product can provide after a few weeks. If the refining function is true, then I will add more contents to this review. Thanks Amazon for offering such a great product to us.</li>
            <li> Ive ordered this mask directly from proactive and the consistency was much thicker than when I ordered through amazon. Its a much watered down version. Not terrible but Your not getting your full moneys worth.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty horrible.  This seems to be the only thing that helps!  I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;d been buying this mask in the stores and paying twice as much.  I ordered it online, it came in a bigger size that was less expensive and it came quickly.  I wish I could have back all those years I bought this at the mall but alas!  I cannot.  I know better now.</li>
            <li> How absolutely disgusting the commercial is,you actually have a girl refer to the \\&quot;CRUD\\&quot; on our face....Really ??  I dont now or have ever had CRUD on my face..</li>
            <li> Excellent soothing treatment mask for acne and blemishes , easy application and removal, very effective mask for face , reduces inflammation</li>
            <li> I over live for this product.. it works very fast. And it really helps to get rid of all the acne on your face. I use this product every night and it works like a charm. Be it that i have very oily skin.. it does not irritate my face. I will continue. To purchase this produc for life!!</li>
            <li> I have used this as a mask and it really does help to bring all the stuff out of your face, BUT what I mostly use it for is it I feel a pimple coming or when that decides to come about through the night OR that dreaded hormonal pimple that comes and is hard as rock I apply this on it over night or over 2 nights and BAM! It&#x27;s either ready to be squeezed if you&#x27;re into that or it has disappeared completely! Great for those acne prone teens or those of us in our latter 20&#x27;s that still get these freak breakouts. Also works for your backnce (my term for back acne)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the big deal is about this stuff.  It really didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING for me.  It gets watery too when it isn&#x27;t opened for awhile.  Smells funky too.  I will stick with just using the Repairing Treatment.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> It doesnt smell, and people complain it does, so maybe I got a bad batch, or maybe it just doesnt smell, but its okay.  Dont expect it to clear up anything huge, minor blemishes it will clear up, and smooth out your skin, but, if you&#x27;re breaking out, you will continue to break out.</li>
            <li> i like it. have oily skin, proactive combination doesnt work for me but this mask does. Like it and will order in future</li>
            <li> Best experience buying this product at a cheap price plus I got it fast its a big savings totally happy</li>
            <li> This product works okay for me. It doesn&#x27;t clean as deep as I would like it to, but it does get the basic job done. I can&#x27;t complain about that.</li>
            <li> I love this little proactiv, as soon as u wash it off u feel a difference its the best facial cleanser any1 can have!</li>
            <li> Its pretty good it does tighten your pores and makes your skin smooth it draws out the dirt.the only downside is it has an odor.</li>
            <li> Kept using this with black skin and it dried my face out and left white flakes. I think i may return it.</li>
            <li> I ordered and paid for the 2.5 oz item as described in the photo and only received  a 1.0 oz container.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My son suffers from cystic acne and this mask will clear up the most subborn of pimples. I have used it as a spot treatment myself and find that it will clear up a breakout over night.</li>
            <li> Love being able to purchase Proactiv products without having to go through the actual Proactiv company and to sign up for the program</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  It makes my skin feel clean and soft.  It is also great for pimples.  I dab a little of the mask on the pimple after cleaning my face at night.  The pimple will be gone, or well on its way to gone, by the next morning.</li>
            <li> This is a must!! Seriously it really does help reduce your pimples the next day or in a couple days. I use this as an overnight treatment on my pimples and usually by the next day, the blemishes would have fade away or are gone. I got this through Beauty N Stuff within a week, ordered on a Sunday and got it Friday. This is what really takes care of my acne and I&#x27;m so happy it works for my skin. I used the Proactive set about two years ago with this refining mask and it definitely cleared up my acne within weeks. (My acne was pretty bad especially on my cheeks..) All I know is that benzoyl peroxide really helps my skin. Since Proactive&#x27;s too pricey, I use Ancefree which is similar. And I just use the refining mask with it. My face is satisfied. (:</li>
            <li> Stuff is AMAZING!! Works every time!</li>
            <li> One of my beauty favorites</li>
            <li> The proactive refining mask is the only product out of the entire proactive product line that worked for me. Anything else was either drying me out or just plain ineffective.    I don&#x27;t use this every day but when I feel or see a red bump forming underneath my skin (the prelude to a wonderful full-blown zit!), I will apply the refining mask to that area and the next day it will be completely gone. One thing to note here is that I also use a tea tree based acne oil at the SAME time, [[ASIN:B00LFT0CFI TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment &amp;#x2605; All Natural Acne Spot Treatment &amp;#x2605; Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!]].    I have done my own experiment where I tested the refining mask on its own and it totally slows down the pimple from rising to the surface, but when I also swab it with the treeactiv oil base, it actually retreats back into my skin, so it never really matures into a full blown pimple.    I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different but I wouldn&#x27;t bother with any other proactive solution than this one. I&#x27;ve tried them all and this one definitely works. The treeactiv oil is amazing as well, just wish I would have figured this out ten years ago!</li>
            <li> i just use it once and i didn&#x27;t feel obvious effect. but i also didn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;maybe several times later it will have effects.</li>
            <li> It worked with my acne, but I really don&#x27;t get much of zits. Very rarely I would get it. It worked for my minor acne problems.</li>
            <li> this mask does wonders. leaves my face feeling clean and smooth. reduces pore size and black heads. highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product didnt do justice to me like I hear every raving about. I mean, it is a good mask to use here &amp; there, but its no miracle worker, and def does NOTTT \\&quot;zap pimples away overnight\\&quot; as advertised lol.... It makes your face look &amp; feel really smooth, but thats about IT.</li>
            <li> Have used this stuff for many years and it works amazing!! Only thing I&#x27;ve found that really fades and eliminates scars and blemishes.</li>
            <li> Proactiv works for my skin, I use this mask about once a week to keep the blemishes and oil away. Some people use it as a spot treatment but I don&#x27;t see a difference</li>
            <li> Requested by my daughter at 14.  She says it&#x27;s the best thing for her acne.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great price, really does remove acne pimple and drains pus without busting pimple in a day or two, if pimple kinda big &amp; red might take a few days more..I love this product</li>
            <li> i used this product the first time i got it, it did not get rid of my acne, but it did reduced it, and then the next 3 days my acne would increase. if i used it as a mask the acne will disappear only for a while then boom its back. i guess it for persons who  just want to get rid of very very very mild small bumps.</li>
            <li> If you have large painful red nodular acne this is a great product to use. I would combine this with the bareMinerals acne treatment that you could use during the day under lotion or the Neutrogena acne on the spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I felt like as soon as I started using it, it worked amazingly!&lt;br /&gt;I always have problems with big pores and this cleared it all out. I would highly recommend this, with my heart 100% behind that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll put it on any potential acne that is starting to appear and it clears it up within a few days.  Love Proactiv!</li>
            <li> I use this product for pimple cream and I just love it. It heals my pimple the next day. I would recommend it as a pimple cream.</li>
            <li> I dot it on trouble spots at night, and in the morning the pimples have gone away entirely or noticeably reduced in size.  I don&#x27;t use it as a mask (spread over my whole face and washed off) because it&#x27;s too drying for my skin.  But the way I use it works great, and it lasts a really long time since I don&#x27;t use much at a time.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with adult onset cystic acne and regular acne for years. I tried the whole Proactiv treatment system but found that the only product that worked for me is the Refining Mask. However, I discovered that this product works best as an acne treatment instead of as a mask. Apply it at night after washing your face when it is still slightly moist by rubbing a miniscule amount over any forming zits. By the next morning or the morning after for the real stubborn zits, they gone. However, I rarely need to use the Proactiv Refining Mask anymore because my acne has been cured by a homeopathic remedy available at Amazon.com but is cheaper at Wal-mart: \\&quot;Nature&#x27;s Cure for Women/Females\\&quot; (there is also \\&quot;Nature&#x27;s Cure for Men/Males\\&quot;). My professional homeopath was unable to address my acne yet within two weeks of taking only the pills (I found the topical solution too drying for my adult skin) my acne was gone! Six months later I broke out again due to stress but after taking the remaining two weeks of the remedy pills I have been basically acne-free for years, and only use the Proactiv Refining Mask every six months or so for the rare zit. \\&quot;Nature&#x27;s Cure for Men\\&quot; also worked fast for my teen nephew, and he spent the rest of his teen years acne-free! Strongly suggest anyone suffering with acne buy this immediately so you can enjoy the rest of your life acne-free!</li>
            <li> My daughter has used this product before and loved it. So, when we saw this product on sale we bought 6 of them for her. She was excited, because it is the only thing that works on her acne without causing her pain or anything. She says that she uses it about 5 days a week and it is lessening her acne problem and it is starting to clear her face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works that good</li>
            <li> Met my expectations. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for eight years now and this is one of those things I MUST HAVE. Sulfur products work very well on my skin. I probably use once a month when I have my routine boil breakout around my chin area.</li>
            <li> This is the best mask I have found.  It can be drying at times but you can just dab the problem areas and stretch your money.</li>
            <li> My wife had used proactiv before so when my daughter was having acne problems then my wife asked me to order it. The price was good for a product that works well.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this mask feels when I use it.  Makes skin feel so, so soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> I use the proactiv solution refining mask about 3 times a week.  It makes for a good excuse to take a long soak in the tubby and makes my face feel really good.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product you need, all others are crap. This refining mask works overnight, unlike the other products.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this purchase of Proactive Refining Mask and will buy more of this product and brand in the future.</li>
            <li> I have always been told proactive is the best but this product just does not seem to make a difference</li>
            <li> Good value for the money.  This is a lot more expensive to buy directly or from the mall kiosks, so I stocked up.  Too bad they don&#x27;t sell the whole line at this good a discount</li>
            <li> Proactive products didn&#x27;t work for my daughter, but it has worked for some of her friends, so I didn&#x27;t want to give it 1 star.</li>
            <li> Like countless others, I purchased ProActiv products from a specially priced offer, which included reoccurring shipments of products. When I did not receive the products from my initial order,  I cancelled the order and future shipments. However, ProActiv continued to bill my credit card.    When I advised ProActiv of the billing errors, I was informed that the billings were valid because I had received the products. I turned the matter over to my credit card company who requested ProActive provide proof of delivery, which ProActiv did not produce.    Ultimately ProActiv admitted the products were not delivered and refunded all credit card billings. However, during the investigation of my dispute, I received a ProActiv Collection notice for the same products which they previously acknowledged had not been delivered. Currently, ProActiv is pursuing collection for those products.    A. Consumer Protection - [...]  \\&quot;The basic consumer protection statute enforced by the Commission is Section 5(a) of the FTC Act, which provides that \\&quot;unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce...are...declared unlawful.\\&quot; (15 U.S.C. Sec. 45(a)(1)\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love proactiv, and this mask makes my feel fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> Helps my son keep his skin clear.</li>
            <li> I  do not have acne, but I do have very severe eczema. My face will get scaly and very dry, besides the hives, and it will Crack open. Not very  attractive... This cleans it and the sulfur ingredient makes my skin soft again and helps with  the inflammation of the hives and cracked skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I put it on any problems I have and it really helps.  It was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> According to my son, this is the absolute best for diminishing acne marks, especially pimples and zits that are just beginning to form.</li>
            <li> Love it. Sure beats paying regular price at the mall. Its the exact same product. No tricks or imitation product. Got same results as the one I purchase at the mall. Same smell, same texture of the mask.</li>
            <li> An overnight drying solution for acne.  I use it to head off underground ones that are trying to surface and repeat offender areas.  But with my combination, middle-age skin, it&#x27;s not something I could use nightly as it would be too drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some bump under my skin, i used benzoyl proxide and clindamycin ,nothing really work , but since I&#x27;m using this product ,my skin is so soft and without any break out , i love this product and i recommend it to everyone .</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I purchased this through amazon prime,  the seller that sent it to amazon was The Acne Prevention Place.  I had used proactive for many years in the past.  Either the mask sold by The Acne Prevention Place and sent to amazon for prime is diluted somehow or proactive has changed the formula.  It did not dry at all on my face and all the ones I had purchased directly from proactive at a much higher cost in the past have dried and worked wonderfully at getting rid of a pimple overnight.  This did not work like it has in the past.  I just wanted to let others know to be careful.  Please write a review or comment if you had that same experience.</li>
            <li> I had purchased the Proactive line for my son about eight years ago for his acne but it never worked to clear his skin. My daughters use this particular item from the line to &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; treat a pimple before it develops. It works GREAT to dry it out ~ overnight. We don&#x27;t use it as a mask, only to spot treat a pimple.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have been using it for years to stop acne.  Its also great for spot treatment.The price is good.</li>
            <li> My daughter has used everything including the VERY expensive prescriptions, this product worked much better,&lt;br /&gt;We all noticed a big difference the first night she used it. No more expensive prescriptions for us, We will buy again.</li>
            <li> Works fast and since I have oily/combination skin it doesn&#x27;t dry it out. Have tried other sulfur based products and this works the best out of all. Can also leave it on all night and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this refining mask, and love than I can buy it here without subscribing through the company as I can&#x27;t use the rest of the products. It&#x27;s the best mask I have found, even better than Clinique that I used before!</li>
            <li> problem zits no more put it on and leave it on over night and the zit will be gone or went down where it doesn&#x60;t look so bad</li>
            <li> i get acne on my chest sometimes (so gross, i hate it!!!!!) and nothing has worked on it. not even the prescription creams and gels my dermatologist prescribed so i tried the refining mask about a year ago and there was a noticeable difference after one use. i have used it twice a week ever since and no more break outs. (it also really is a great spot treatment for my face)</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find this as an individual purchase.  This is an excellent product and it really does work.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am a menopausal woman who still gets the occasional pimple.  As soon as I feel one coming, on goes the refining mask, and by morning, it is well on its way out!</li>
            <li> This is actually the only Proactiv product that I like.  The sulphur smell is quite strong  but, hey that&#x27;s how sulphur smells. Works quite well overnight to lessen the appearance of blemishes and it cuts down on the oil.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this item. I always have a tube available. Highly recommend this to anyone with acne. This is the one item you should definitely own.</li>
