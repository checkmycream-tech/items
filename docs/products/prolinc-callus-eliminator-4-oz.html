            <li>Quick ship.</li>
            <li>Its great because in the salon sometimes they only leave it for a minute and take it off, but at home you can leave it on for 5 mins and it really does remove everything.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very aware of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Definitely definitely recommend this product of you really want to remove your calluses.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time or money.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to overdo it on first application.  </li>
            <li>I purchased directly from local nail supply store... Makes you wonder if they switched up the product inside the bottle.</li>

            <li> the directions said to let sit for 3-5 mins; it didn&#x27;t even take that long to work !!!</li>

            <li> This worked Wonders....the directions said to let sit for 3-5 mins; it didn&#x27;t even take that long to work !!! Amazing results. That says a lot coming from a person that NEVER writes product reviews. My feet are nice &amp; smooth !!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years after hearing Paula Begon recommend it.  Holy smokes does it ever leave my feet baby soft.  I bought this size for a trip, and one for my bridesmaid..........I can refill it over and over again from my large one.  There isn&#x27;t anything better for callus, seriously, this stuff is awesome!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!!!! My husband&#x27;s feet were very calloused  and this product  took it off so easy!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! !</li>
            <li> Works really well. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent for callous feet. My feet are so looking better everyday from continous use.</li>
            <li> Used with pumice stone and it works great.</li>
            <li> Too dangerous to use and too hard.</li>
            <li> Didnt work as well as the ProLinc I purchased directly from local nail supply store... Makes you wonder if they switched up the product inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> Works well. My feet are a lot smoother. Be careful it&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li> Dry feet  during the winters are no match for this product even if your feet are cracked(not to where flesh is exposed or it will burn). Soak your feet in warm water around 8 mins then slather this on leave for 3-5  mins the scrub off with one of those foot files and you&#x27;re done. Must buy item for those with dry and or cracked heels.</li>
            <li> This is what salons charge $5 extra a pedicure. Use this at home and get great results!!</li>
            <li> Simply unmatched great quality. Great product.Perfect. Quick ship. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;AMAZON ROCKS!!!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Use small amount.</li>
            <li> Seriously loved how this worked.  There is no comparison between this brand and any other I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with Mr. Pumice to slough my heels and underfoot area.  What can I say, I like to walk barefoot and there is a price to pay for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t awful, but scents matter to me and I&#x27;m very aware of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out that they now have an orange scent.  Oh my...I bought it and I adore it.  That one gets 5+ stars.</li>
            <li> This works just like the salon. Its great because in the salon sometimes they only leave it for a minute and take it off, but at home you can leave it on for 5 mins and it really does remove everything. Sometimes I get scare because it removes too much skin.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Amazing, Amazing stuff.  Be careful not to overdo it on first application.  You will love this...a pedicurist used it on me, and it was great.</li>
            <li> Nothing out there better, period.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and it doesn&#x27;t work at all. It is better to just soak your feet and use a file or pumice stone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this 3 times and have not noticed any improvement .</li>
            <li> My feet had horrible hard calluses from the shoes I wear that even a pedicure didn&#x27;t make much of a difference. But when I used this along with a foot grater thing after, all of my calluses were gone! Definitely definitely recommend this product of you really want to remove your calluses.</li>
            <li> Great product!  It works for me!</li>
            <li> This item work really good...</li>
            <li> Does nothing. Do not waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> Kind of amazing.  Being a Disbetic it&#x27;s always recommended not to use Calius removing tools so I use things such as this and am alwsys happy with the turnout.</li>
            <li> Product is amazing! Does what it says.</li>
            <li> Love it and it works GREAT!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I use it with a foot rasp and Nu Skin epoch heel cream and my feet are in better shape than they have been in a very long time!</li>
