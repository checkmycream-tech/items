            <li>Years ago Williams-Sonoma sold an heirloom tomato hand soap, and that&#x27;s stuck in my mind as the perfect tomato smell.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is so awesome and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>Works Great.</li>

            <li>It smells great</li>
            <li>I first started using \\&quot;Yes to\\&quot; products with their carrot hand cream, and was impressed-- and continue to be impressed.  </li>
            <li>This was recommended as a good non-moisturizing shower gel.  </li>
            <li>This product feels good/ smells good</li>
            <li>I loved the smell of this product and wished I could use it.</li>

            <li>Love the fragrance and the mildness of the soap.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the fresh scent that is not cloying like most body washes I have used.</li>
            <li>I thought that I&#x27;d get a premium body wash that I would enjoy</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff, it&#x27;s def worth a try.</li>
            <li>The texture is great, and it lathers really well without the harshness of Sodium laurel sulfate, which I really appreciate.</li>
            <li>Works OK, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but I was expecting it to have a clean, fresh smell like tomatoes,</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in any stores around me, so was excited I saw this and ordered it right</li>
            <li>The scent is light and sweet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not my favorite scent, but a good all-around natural bath gel.</li>
            <li>the others, this gel lathers up richly, and I don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get clean.  </li>
            <li>and i feel clean and</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive but this works wonderfully and it helps clear up any imperfections on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not smell like tomatoes, it has a fruity smell to it, which is light and fresh.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I love yesto products and didn&#x27;t smell it till I got home and was about to use it, I was very put off by the smell in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Sweet with a mild musk scent.</li>
            <li>This bodywash is 99.8% natural, has a nice lather, smells super yummy &amp; is very reasonably priced!  </li>
            <li>You can use very little of this product and so much foam develops which is great !</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and leaves you feeling clean, refreshed.</li>
            <li>The Yes To Tmatoes shower gel has such a nice mild fragrance about it...</li>
            <li>Timely, fresh, and always prompt.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is natural.</li>
            <li>And well so far I love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really a bad smell, but it is very like baby powder.</li>
            <li>The smell is refreshing compared to other body washes around, it&#x27;s unique but not overpowering (and no, it doesn&#x27;t smell like tomatoes).</li>
            <li>I appreciate the cruelty free and the fact that they are quality products almost completely natural.</li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t have to open the top.</li>
            <li>It has a rich lather and keeps your skin soft without feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the Yes to Tomatoes face products as well and can&#x27;t say enough good things for such an inexpensive product.</li>
            <li>...that&#x27;s what it said on the back, and it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li>The ratings fall a little short on the EWG review for chemicals, but overall I have been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>It cleans very well and makes your skin feel wholesome and super-squeegy-clean.</li>
            <li>The antioxidants and dead-sea minerals really do work, it leaves a somewhat \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; tingle on you for 10-15 minutes after you are out of the shower.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t lather very well.</li>
            <li>I really like the container</li>
            <li>It also bubbles up very well</li>
            <li>It has a nice, light scent and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>The smell is not overwhelming , just right. :-)</li>
            <li>This smells like something my grandma might have used or like some of the perfumes the older ladies at work wear.</li>
            <li>Decent price.</li>
            <li>I have skin allergies, but this particular shower gel doesn&#x27;t trigger it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so gentle and leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I took a chance on purchasing because I was running out, and wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love most YesTo products, but this shower gel was extremely disappointing.  </li>
            <li>Does it clear up my prone-to-break-out skin?  </li>
            <li>This stuff keeps my skin clear and actually smells really nice(not</li>
            <li>I like this line of products because it is mostly natural and made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>The see-through bottle makes it easy to see how much you have left, but also like the other gels, the lids seem to work poorly when the bottle is full</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t experience any irritation with this product despite my skin generally being sensitive, and the gel seems non-drying, even in the low-humidity of the mid-Atlantic winter.  </li>
            <li>I have an issue with body acne and this gel seemed to calm some of that down.</li>
            <li>My least favorite of the Yes-To shower gels because of the scent, but it works very well, as do the other Yes-To gels I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Helps with my acne too around my face, other shower gels I have to be super careful not to get near my face.</li>
            <li>If you are hoping for a fresh, garden inspired smell, don&#x27;t waste your time as this isn&#x27;t it!</li>
            <li>It just trickled and you had to squeeze it super hard.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that does not dry out my son&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>My sin has very oily skin but other products dry and irritate his skin.  </li>

            <li> My sin has very oily skin but other products dry and irritate his skin.  </li>
            <li> Not completely natural</li>
            <li> Unlike their other \\&quot;flavors\\&quot;, this gel doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the namesake fruit, instead it&#x27;s a generic floral-like scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I alternate with a moisturizing body wash every other day.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this daily for a while, I am not sure if it helps purify much, but its not as heavy or overly moisturizing as some, and it&#x27;s not drying either.</li>
            <li> This will last you a long time, you only need a small amount to lather your towel.</li>
            <li> You just push down on one side and it pops open on the other</li>
            <li> but it is healthier than other shower gels.</li>
            <li> I find all the other Yes</li>
            <li> It seemed very cologney and I was sad</li>
            <li> By itself, it has calmed by body acne down, but paired with the medicated cream...</li>
            <li> Maybe a little.  </li>
            <li> It can be a little drying</li>
            <li> Silly me to think this might actually smell like tomatoes!</li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t like is that is was extremely hard to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> /new-- you have to squeeze hard or pour</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m kinda addicted to it.</li>
            <li> For me, the worst thing about this particular product is the scent.  </li>
            <li> which it doesn&#x27;t - to me it smells like stale pipe tobacco.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>

            <li> This was recommended as a good non-moisturizing shower gel.  Works OK, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but I was expecting it to have a clean, fresh smell like tomatoes, which it doesn&#x27;t - to me it smells like stale pipe tobacco.  Years ago Williams-Sonoma sold an heirloom tomato hand soap, and that&#x27;s stuck in my mind as the perfect tomato smell.  Gonna keep looking ...</li>
            <li> The Yes To Tmatoes shower gel has such a nice mild fragrance about it...it&#x27;s just lovely. It cleans very well and makes your skin feel wholesome and super-squeegy-clean. The antioxidants and dead-sea minerals really do work, it leaves a somewhat \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; tingle on you for 10-15 minutes after you are out of the shower. Helps with my acne too around my face, other shower gels I have to be super careful not to get near my face. This stuff is so awesome and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Yes to Carrots and Yes to Cucumbers body wash but Yes to Tomatoes is definitely my favorite. I use the Yes to Tomatoes face products as well and can&#x27;t say enough good things for such an inexpensive product. The smell is refreshing compared to other body washes around, it&#x27;s unique but not overpowering (and no, it doesn&#x27;t smell like tomatoes). My skin is pretty sensitive but this works wonderfully and it helps clear up any imperfections on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would sell this in a bulk set of some sort so I could buy it seperately instead of add on only!</li>
            <li> My sin has very oily skin but other products dry and irritate his skin.  He loves this and uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> Silly me to think this might actually smell like tomatoes! This smells like something my grandma might have used or like some of the perfumes the older ladies at work wear. If you are hoping for a fresh, garden inspired smell, don&#x27;t waste your time as this isn&#x27;t it! Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Love this product line!  Will be ordering all of the products eventually.  Timely, fresh, and always prompt.  I am very pleased with the results, and am eager to try all of the product line.</li>
            <li> My son has been using the pore scrub for years but just found this item.  It works great.  This is the only product that does not dry out my son&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Works Great. Smells Great. Nice size. Decent price. Love that it is natural. What I didn&#x27;t like is that is was extremely hard to get out of the bottle. It just trickled and you had to squeeze it super hard.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on purchasing because I was running out, and wanted to try something new. I can&#x27;t get enough of this body wash. I love the fresh scent that is not cloying like most body washes I have used. The texture is great, and it lathers really well without the harshness of Sodium laurel sulfate, which I really appreciate.</li>
            <li> Not completely natural but it is healthier than other shower gels. This doesn&#x27;t lather very well. The scent is light and sweet. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase this because there are better options out there.</li>
            <li> My least favorite of the Yes-To shower gels because of the scent, but it works very well, as do the other Yes-To gels I&#x27;ve tried. Unlike their other \\&quot;flavors\\&quot;, this gel doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the namesake fruit, instead it&#x27;s a generic floral-like scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the others, this gel lathers up richly, and I don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get clean.  The see-through bottle makes it easy to see how much you have left, but also like the other gels, the lids seem to work poorly when the bottle is full/new-- you have to squeeze hard or pour slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation with this product despite my skin generally being sensitive, and the gel seems non-drying, even in the low-humidity of the mid-Atlantic winter.  This one, Yes to Carrots, and Yes to Blueberries are my winter bath \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; for their hydration and being non-drying. I first started using \\&quot;Yes to\\&quot; products with their carrot hand cream, and was impressed-- and continue to be impressed.  Of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried, Cucumbers and Carrots are my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not my favorite scent, but a good all-around natural bath gel.</li>
            <li> I thought that I&#x27;d get a premium body wash that I would enjoy and instead I got a burning skin that after several baths would not stop burning. I guess that would be the last time for me to try any &#x27; non animal tested &#x27; products on myself. Hope you were warned.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love most YesTo products, but this shower gel was extremely disappointing.  For me, the worst thing about this particular product is the scent.  I also find that some of their soaps and shampoos don&#x27;t lather as you would expect them to, this being one of them.  I will keep using YesTo products, but the YesTo tomatoes shower gel will definitely not be in my repertoire.</li>
            <li> I like this line of products because it is mostly natural and made in the USA.  Does it clear up my prone-to-break-out skin?  Maybe a little.  It has a nice, light scent and a little goes a long way so I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> ...that&#x27;s what it said on the back, and it&#x27;s true! These products are so easy to add into your routine! After using the face wash/scrub, moisturizer, blemish pen, wipes and acne cream with amazing results, I stumbled upon this on amazon. I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in any stores around me, so was excited I saw this and ordered it right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so gentle and leaves my skin so soft. By itself, it has calmed by body acne down, but paired with the medicated cream... just amazing. I wish these products were around fifteen years ago!</li>
            <li> This product feels good/ smells good while/and after you shower. You can use very little of this product and so much foam develops which is great ! Does not smell like tomatoes, it has a fruity smell to it, which is light and fresh. The smell is not overwhelming , just right. :-)</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps my skin clear and actually smells really nice(not like tomato).  It can be a little drying so I alternate with a moisturizing body wash every other day.</li>
            <li> My wife reviewed this product:&lt;br /&gt;I love the Yes To product line and this shower gel is no exception. I have an issue with body acne and this gel seemed to calm some of that down. The smell is pleasant - doesn&#x27;t smell like tomatoes - and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I am a big fan of the &amp;#34;Yes to!&amp;#34; line. I appreciate the cruelty free and the fact that they are quality products almost completely natural. I also bought this because one of the reviewers said it smelled like strawberries... Yeah it doesn&#x27;t. The smell is why only four stars. It&#x27;s not really a bad smell, but it is very like baby powder. Sweet with a mild musk scent. I do recommend it, but don&#x27;t expect to smell like strawberries. It has a rich lather and keeps your skin soft without feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> This shower gel smells like strawberries! It is very gentle and leaves you feeling clean, refreshed. This will last you a long time, you only need a small amount to lather your towel. I really like the container, you don&#x27;t have to open the top. You just push down on one side and it pops open on the other, i thought that was neat.</li>
            <li> I love almost all of the Yes To products!  This bodywash is 99.8% natural, has a nice lather, smells super yummy &amp; is very reasonably priced!  LOVE!</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and the mildness of the soap. I have skin allergies, but this particular shower gel doesn&#x27;t trigger it</li>
            <li> Every &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; product I tried irritated my skin. Not sure why. I loved the smell of this product and wished I could use it.</li>
            <li> I like the way my skin feels after a hike in our wilderness areas.&lt;br /&gt;The itches stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could find Yes To Tomatoes in my local stores.  I find all the other Yes To...&lt;br /&gt;products, but the Lycopene seems to do the trick for me.</li>
            <li> After finding the acne triple pack at target I wanted to try the body wash.  And well so far I love it.  It smells great and i feel clean and well my acne on my body is going away!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love yesto products and didn&#x27;t smell it till I got home and was about to use it, I was very put off by the smell in the bottle. It seemed very cologney and I was sad I had bought it...till I tried it. OMG! This stuff is amazing!!personally I like to take bubble baths with it and it feels awesome and leaves just the right amount of scent, I&#x27;m kinda addicted to it. It also bubbles up very well and I can even smell it in my hair the next day. I really love this stuff, it&#x27;s def worth a try. 😁</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  The ratings fall a little short on the EWG review for chemicals, but overall I have been very happy with it.  The scent is light and pleasant and it suds pretty good.  I have not noticed it to have a drying affect on my skin.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this daily for a while, I am not sure if it helps purify much, but its not as heavy or overly moisturizing as some, and it&#x27;s not drying either.</li>
