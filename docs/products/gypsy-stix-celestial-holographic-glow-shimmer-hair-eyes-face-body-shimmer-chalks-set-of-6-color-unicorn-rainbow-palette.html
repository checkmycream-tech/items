            <li>Good color selection.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t be anything which doesn&#x27;t grow out fairly soon</li>

            <li>love these.</li>
            <li>I would say I&#x27;m glad I got it for a dollar.</li>
            <li>The experiments yielded some fun colors in our hair.&lt;br /&gt;Since we have brown hair, they are not as brilliant as the model, but they still have some fun color pop.</li>
            <li>Daughter loved coloring her hair and as it washes right out didn&#x27;t cause a proiblem.</li>
            <li>We had fun with it, but it just doesn&#x27;t show up bright and rubs off easily.</li>
            <li>As a performer and trying to find new ways to add to my costumes these were great and added a great new look.</li>
            <li>I feel like these hair chalks work best for light to bleach blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Great for a 6 year old!</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t very bright even in my really blonde hair!</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you really want to color hair with a bright splash of color.</li>
            <li>Loved them and were fast and easy</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s kind of exactly what you would expect from a chalk pastel.</li>
            <li>The water in the tub during a shower is very pretty when you wash it out :)</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth</li>
            <li>Too light.  </li>
            <li>Innocent fun for all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too light even for bleached hair..</li>
            <li>We are so excited to use these to make mermaid hair stripes for Halloween.</li>
            <li>Great for light and dark hair.</li>
            <li>Used these for a Girl Scout booth at a local street fair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hilarious and I love the looks I get from younger people.</li>
            <li>They go on pretty bright but fade quickly, for me it only lasted maybe an hour or two of bright color on my blonde strands.</li>
            <li>I particularly like putting a streak of just one color near my ear on the underside of my hair so that surprising flash of color shows when I move my head.</li>
            <li>Easy and fast pops of color all over my head.</li>
            <li>wound up giving these to the kids - no shimmery effect an didn&#x27;t do much even on light hair.</li>
            <li>I like to use it to streak my hair for fun occasions.  </li>
            <li>these are a lot of fun.  </li>
            <li>The boys and girls are having fun chalking up their hair.  </li>
            <li>You have to use on damp hair for the color to pop out but totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>so these are fun</li>
            <li>Maybe  if you have light blonde hair these would work better.</li>
            <li>It is a fun item.</li>
            <li>The colors look strong and pretty right after coloring, but then they fade quite fast as your hair is exposed to wind, dust, and the hectic routine of walking around the university.</li>
            <li>and I like it because it washes right out</li>
            <li>You can basically wipe the color right out.</li>
            <li>It also disappears very fast.</li>
            <li>However, she very much likes the idea of them and the color selection.  </li>
            <li>it is good and you can&#x27;t really see the sparkles but other</li>
            <li>Coloring little girls&#x27; hair was a good fundraising activity.</li>
            <li>, she has very dark brown hair, but these chalks still show up fairly well on her.  </li>
            <li>first time using it - the package caught my eye while our grandsons were here, so I decided to make a rainbow in my hair.</li>
            <li>first, no one noticed what I&#x27;d done.</li>
            <li>My daughter has light brown hair and you can barely see the colors.  </li>
            <li>As this was our first foray into hair chalks, I don&#x27;t have anything to really compare how the application went.  </li>
            <li>I have blonde hair and it shows up very bright at first, but doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>Very neon when I tested it.</li>
            <li>She tried everyone of them on her hair and they did not show thru on her medium brown straight hair.</li>
            <li>I gave it three stars for price, &amp; fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>It works well enough on light brown hair.</li>
            <li>Bought these as something fun for my 7 year old.  </li>
            <li>if your worried about the chalk not showing up in your hair you wont have much of a problem with this one</li>
            <li>Definitely works better in wet, light colored hair.</li>
            <li>Granddaughters really like these.</li>
            <li>Do not expect an intense hair color.</li>
            <li>Gonna get some more for the other kids.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful in my hair, but a bit difficult to notice unless I rub the chalk in my hair over and over.</li>
            <li>Some colored dust on my hand, but not much and easy to wash</li>
            <li>Not too vibrant...</li>
            <li>The blue, however, became a soft green after the first day.&lt;br /&gt;Still, they are worth the price and make a cute change for the summer...</li>
            <li>Given that this is a chalk, it does not last long - a couple of hours at most.</li>
            <li>She has blonde hair, and I thought the colors were really fun.  </li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t terribly long lasting- makes it from before school to after school ok.  </li>
            <li>takes a little bit to really get the color strong</li>
            <li>but they work fine and were intact when I got they only they are smaller</li>
            <li>/&gt;It all washed out easily, did not leave a mess in the tub, and did not damage my hair.</li>
            <li>The title says that the color lasts up to 3 days - this is completely untrue!</li>
            <li>and it shows up vividly on me.  </li>
            <li>While the colors are very pretty, they are not very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this trend in hair, but quickly came to love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Purchased these for a Christmas gift for my 11 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 8 year old cousin for Xmas and she loves it.</li>
            <li>Gave to my 12 year old for Christmas</li>
            <li>My young daughter still gets a kick out of coloring her hair though</li>
            <li>I purchased these as a gift for my 9 yr old fashion designer daughter who just loves playing with her hair.  </li>
            <li>The pink is the lightest, but we find if we wet her hair a bit it works much better.  </li>
            <li>I have very light blonde hair, and I usually use these to color the tips of my hair.</li>
            <li>All the little girls (and Mom) thought this was cool.  </li>
            <li>I dipped two fingers in water, lightly dampened a small section of hair, and ran a chalk over it.</li>
            <li>I put some on Christmas morning and it was still lightly visible by bedtime on me, but I have very short hair and didn&#x27;t mess with it all day.</li>
            <li>My daughter is only 7 and it lasts a few hours on her, I assume it would last longer if she were a bit more stationary throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun for a little while.</li>
            <li>The color barely shows, nothing neon about it.  </li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s lots of fun for a little girl (and her mommy!)</li>
            <li>She has dark hair and it shows up really well and washes out without a problem.</li>
            <li>I have strawberry blonde hair and the color barely showed up.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this, however it came off in less than three hours.</li>
            <li>Took 1 whole chalk to put any color onto wet hair then made the hair feel dry and brittle.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s fun for a little while.</li>
            <li> The color barely shows, nothing neon about it.  </li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s lots of fun for a little girl (and her mommy!)</li>
            <li> She has dark hair and it shows up really well and washes out without a problem.</li>
            <li> I have strawberry blonde hair and the color barely showed up.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, however it came off in less than three hours.</li>
            <li> Took 1 whole chalk to put any color onto wet hair then made the hair feel dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I found them to be pretty dull.</li>
            <li> Color does not last long at all not even with hair spray.</li>
            <li> They make your hair feel dry and chalky, but obviously they&#x27;re chalk</li>
            <li> Tried rubbing it in dry and also rubbing it on wet hair but both times the color was barely visible.</li>
            <li> in fact, my husband loves it when I put a single color streak in my long white hair</li>
            <li> Didnt&#x27; work, smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> VBS is three hours long and you couldn&#x27;t see it by the end of it.</li>
            <li> There is actually a corally pink and a blue-pink, despite the colors  listed on the description.  </li>
            <li> This worked well on my hair but made it feel really dry and clumpy</li>
            <li> They will not deposit color if the hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I found yellow and green to be the ones that faded faster and pink and blue to be the ones that lasted longer.</li>
            <li> This was partially because my hair is dark blonde with a few perfectly white hairs and partially because only one lamp was on - and at its lowest setting.</li>
            <li> They are just not vibrant.</li>
            <li> They faded after a few hours of playing outside, but with 105 degree weather in Phoenix, it probably faded from the heat.</li>
            <li> My daughters found them harder to use than anticipated.</li>
            <li> just what we expected</li>
            <li> Just as expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how these would look on dark hair with the dry application that we used on blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> They opened the package and took turns trying it out on each other.</li>
            <li> These chalks don&#x27;t tangle my hair like the other set...</li>
            <li> These work as well as other hair chalks we&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> The color leaves your hair a little dry just because it is chalk</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my understanding that dark hair needs to be dampened a bit before hair chalk is applied.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t&#x27; use them very often, as they are difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> I had an easier time drawing on my sons head (probably cuz his hair is short) and it was difficult to color on my daughters long hair...</li>
            <li> and they in turn chalked up my little dog.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my little girl.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on dark hair!</li>
            <li> She can&#x27;t do it herself, as the chalk sticks are very hard and solid.  </li>
            <li> but she has very dark hair</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money if you are a brunette.</li>
            <li> which is not very bright at all.</li>
            <li> and you have to draw on your hair against a hard surface.</li>
            <li> Have to press really hard to get any color to transfer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like paint where it just goes on, you almost have to have a hard surface to draw on</li>
            <li> Very small</li>
            <li> The color is extremely subtle.</li>
            <li> A bit painful, actually.  </li>
            <li> Not particularly bright colors and chalk breaks, but</li>
            <li> They are also really messy and made my hair stiff and dirty feeling. :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about her going to school with crazy colors in her hair.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> She wanted color hair so bad.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> These were awful, and just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It was horrible and I regret buying it.</li>
            <li> Sticky and awful.</li>

            <li> Bright colors.  Doesn&#x27;t require water to apply.  Lasts for several days.  Easy to use.  Will buy more when needed.</li>
            <li> I have very light blonde hair, and I usually use these to color the tips of my hair. The color leaves your hair a little dry just because it is chalk and you have to draw on your hair against a hard surface. The colors look strong and pretty right after coloring, but then they fade quite fast as your hair is exposed to wind, dust, and the hectic routine of walking around the university. I found yellow and green to be the ones that faded faster and pink and blue to be the ones that lasted longer. The blue, however, became a soft green after the first day.&lt;br /&gt;Still, they are worth the price and make a cute change for the summer...</li>
            <li> Lasts 3 days as stated, choice of colors is good</li>
            <li> Didnt&#x27; work, smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Very neon when I tested it. I have blonde hair and it shows up very bright at first, but doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> they break easy but looks great in  hair and beard. Stats Ib for like a Day</li>
            <li> The title says that the color lasts up to 3 days - this is completely untrue! Given that this is a chalk, it does not last long - a couple of hours at most. The color is extremely subtle. Good color selection.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this trend in hair, but quickly came to love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every now and then, I crave a big change in my hair, but I am super-cautious about that change. It can&#x27;t be anything which doesn&#x27;t grow out fairly soon and it can&#x27;t damage my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These chalks are perfect for adding some oomph to your look. I particularly like putting a streak of just one color near my ear on the underside of my hair so that surprising flash of color shows when I move my head. You can, of course, apply it any way you like in any color or color combination you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first time using it - the package caught my eye while our grandsons were here, so I decided to make a rainbow in my hair. I dipped two fingers in water, lightly dampened a small section of hair, and ran a chalk over it. Easy and fast pops of color all over my head. Some colored dust on my hand, but not much and easy to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, no one noticed what I&#x27;d done. This was partially because my hair is dark blonde with a few perfectly white hairs and partially because only one lamp was on - and at its lowest setting. So, the colors blended in in that half-light. Under brighter lights, the color streaks showed up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all washed out easily, did not leave a mess in the tub, and did not damage my hair. I would definitely recommend Neon!!! Hair Shimmer Chalks Set of 6 Colors.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. Goes on smooth</li>
            <li> Daughter loved coloring her hair and as it washes right out didn&#x27;t cause a proiblem.</li>
            <li> i wish these worked on brown hair but they do not, also they tangle your hair even if you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> This worked well on my hair but made it feel really dry and clumpy</li>
            <li> it is good and you can&#x27;t really see the sparkles but other than that it&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> These chalk hair colors didn&#x27;t show up well in my hair. I figured with them being neon, they&#x27;d be really bright. I found them to be pretty dull.</li>
            <li> diffult to use but works well</li>
            <li> Horrible. Too light.  Zero shimmer. Very small</li>
            <li> These were awful, and just don&#x27;t work. Took 1 whole chalk to put any color onto wet hair then made the hair feel dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I like to use it to streak my hair for fun occasions.  It is easy to wash out. Great product.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t show up on my daughters hair...which is blonde! Have to press really hard to get any color to transfer and then it breaks.</li>
            <li> All the little girls (and Mom) thought this was cool.  They opened the package and took turns trying it out on each other.</li>
            <li> i thought this item was hair chalk pens but it had paper rapped around it</li>
            <li> I bought these for &amp;#34;crazy hair day&amp;#34; at vacation bible school. Both of my kids have blond hair. I had to go over and over with it to show up at all. VBS is three hours long and you couldn&#x27;t see it by the end of it. Too bad.</li>
            <li> these are a lot of fun.  Gave to grand kids and they in turn chalked up my little dog.  So cute.  No staining and washes out without any problem.  The boys and girls are having fun chalking up their hair.  Innocent fun for all.  Gonna get some more for the other kids.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes it and I like it because it washes right out</li>
            <li> Purchased these for a Christmas gift for my 11 year old daughter. She tried everyone of them on her hair and they did not show thru on her medium brown straight hair. I figured for lighter neon colors they would, but no and there wasnt any shimmer. She&#x27;s over it now. She had a good time opening it and trying to apply them on her hair but this isn&#x27;t a product I would recommend or purchase again. I gave it three stars for price, &amp; fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 8 year old cousin for Xmas and she loves it. She has dark hair and it shows up really well and washes out without a problem.</li>
            <li> It does not show any color on your hair!!!</li>
            <li> These chalks don&#x27;t tangle my hair like the other set... in fact, my husband loves it when I put a single color streak in my long white hair so I&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;weird&amp;#34; every time we go out to dinner.  It&#x27;s hilarious and I love the looks I get from younger people.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it were a bit longer lasting.  I got it for my daughter at Christmas, she has very dark brown hair, but these chalks still show up fairly well on her.  The pink is the lightest, but we find if we wet her hair a bit it works much better.  I&#x27;m a strawberry blonde and it shows up vividly on me.  I put some on Christmas morning and it was still lightly visible by bedtime on me, but I have very short hair and didn&#x27;t mess with it all day. My daughter is only 7 and it lasts a few hours on her, I assume it would last longer if she were a bit more stationary throughout the day.  Still, it&#x27;s lots of fun for a little girl (and her mommy!)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little girl. She wanted color hair so bad. It showed up on her hair. She has a medium brown hair. They are just not vibrant. They did color tho, sort of like the spray they use for halloween. They faded after a few hours of playing outside, but with 105 degree weather in Phoenix, it probably faded from the heat. I will write another review when we go update this weekend in cooler weather.</li>
            <li> Colors the hair just like a chalk would.... which is not very bright at all. I&#x27;m actually wondering what the difference between this and sidewalk chalk is. We had fun with it, but it just doesn&#x27;t show up bright and rubs off easily. I had an easier time drawing on my sons head (probably cuz his hair is short) and it was difficult to color on my daughters long hair... both are brunettes. It&#x27;s not like paint where it just goes on, you almost have to have a hard surface to draw on so I had my daughter put her hair on the table. It&#x27;s comes on very light, pastel like colors. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you really want to color hair with a bright splash of color. May end up using these on the sidewalk after all.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a music festival but couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get the color to last in hair. Tried rubbing it in dry and also rubbing it on wet hair but both times the color was barely visible. While my dislike could be a result of user error, the box did not come with instructions so I was using my best guess and that didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> I use them for  makeup too. Multi use product.</li>
            <li> Used these for a Girl Scout booth at a local street fair.  Coloring little girls&#x27; hair was a good fundraising activity.</li>
            <li> These work as well as other hair chalks we&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s the same (multiple) application process &amp; seal with hairspray.  I&#x27;m not sure how these would look on dark hair with the dry application that we used on blonde hair.  It&#x27;s my understanding that dark hair needs to be dampened a bit before hair chalk is applied.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work well at all.. It&#x27;s way too light even for bleached hair..</li>
            <li> Not what was described, and returned the item to seller.</li>
            <li> They flake off while applying them so do it outside.</li>
            <li> Gave to my 12 year old for Christmas but she has very dark hair so it doesn&#x27;t show up as well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy. Doesn&#x27;t work on dark hair!</li>
            <li> wound up giving these to the kids - no shimmery effect an didn&#x27;t do much even on light hair.</li>
            <li> I liked it! Shows up, although it&#x27;s not all that neon</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, however it came off in less than three hours. I tried it on three different people, all with different colors of hair, and it didn&#x27;t last for anyone. Not happy except it was cheap so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Kids were happy with them</li>
            <li> My daughters love the chalk. You have to use on damp hair for the color to pop out but totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Stayed in my hair. Awesome color.</li>
            <li> My daughters found them harder to use than anticipated.</li>
            <li> love these. takes a little bit to really get the color strong but i have platinum hair so these are fun</li>
            <li> The chalk in my daughter&#x27;s hair looks great! Not too vibrant...and it doesn&#x27;t last all day. Great for a 6 year old!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect a lot considering the price. The chalk does not show up well in darker hair and does not stay on at all. You can basically wipe the color right out. It&#x27;s fun for a little while. I would say I&#x27;m glad I got it for a dollar.</li>
            <li> Maybe  if you have light blonde hair these would work better. My daughter has light brown hair and you can barely see the colors.  It also disappears very fast. Doesn&#x27;t even last 3 hours let alone the 3 days it claims. My young daughter still gets a kick out of coloring her hair though and I like that I don&#x27;t have to worry about her going to school with crazy colors in her hair.</li>
            <li> Color does not last long at all not even with hair spray.</li>
            <li> We are so excited to use these to make mermaid hair stripes for Halloween. The experiments yielded some fun colors in our hair.&lt;br /&gt;Since we have brown hair, they are not as brilliant as the model, but they still have some fun color pop.</li>
            <li> just what we expected</li>
            <li> Very nice!  Works best on lighter hair, though!</li>
            <li> The color barely shows, nothing neon about it.  Maybe it would work well on blonde hair.  Don&#x27;t waste your money if you are a brunette.</li>
            <li> did not workat all only like aybe an hour did you actually see the color on hair</li>
            <li> Very entertaining for the price. Given to girls 5 to 7.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t very bright even in my really blonde hair! They also are virtually invisible after about an hour. Followed the directions to a T.</li>
            <li> As a performer and trying to find new ways to add to my costumes these were great and added a great new look. Loved them and were fast and easy</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a gift for my 9 yr old fashion designer daughter who just loves playing with her hair.  She loves these and the color does last for about 3 days.  The water in the tub during a shower is very pretty when you wash it out :)</li>
            <li> It works well enough on light brown hair. Not particularly bright colors and chalk breaks, but probably what one should expect.</li>
            <li> Bought these as something fun for my 7 year old.  She has blonde hair, and I thought the colors were really fun.  There is actually a corally pink and a blue-pink, despite the colors  listed on the description.  That worked perfectly for us.  The only thing that was tricky was actually getting the color applied to her hair.  She can&#x27;t do it herself, as the chalk sticks are very hard and solid.  I had to pinch her hair between my fingers and the chalk, pulling, to get any color to adhere to her hair.  A bit painful, actually.  As this was our first foray into hair chalks, I don&#x27;t have anything to really compare how the application went.  She doesn&#x27;t&#x27; use them very often, as they are difficult to apply.  However, she very much likes the idea of them and the color selection.  The color isn&#x27;t terribly long lasting- makes it from before school to after school ok.  But not all the way through til dinner.</li>
            <li> My granddaughters were delighted with this gift and now are wearing their hair in true rainbow colors.  It is a fun item.</li>
            <li> I bought four these because I needed to reach $35 for the shipping but they work fine and were intact when I got they only they are smaller then they seam and the color tends to fall out as you go. if your worried about the chalk not showing up in your hair you wont have much of a problem with this one</li>
            <li> Great for light and dark hair. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great for light colored hair.</li>
            <li> It was horrible and I regret buying it. Sticky and awful. You can&#x27;t even brush or comb your hair. Don&#x27;t !!!</li>
            <li> Just as expected.  Will be Xmas present.</li>
            <li> I feel like these hair chalks work best for light to bleach blonde hair. I have strawberry blonde hair and the color barely showed up. They are also really messy and made my hair stiff and dirty feeling. :(</li>
            <li> Definitely works better in wet, light colored hair. They will not deposit color if the hair is dry. They go on pretty bright but fade quickly, for me it only lasted maybe an hour or two of bright color on my blonde strands. No idea how they&#x27;re advertising it lasting three days...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color will deposit on your clothes and your hands if your touch your hair. They make your hair feel dry and chalky, but obviously they&#x27;re chalk so if you&#x27;re expecting something different then you might as well try temporary hair dye. The stick looks sparkly but it doesn&#x27;t appear that way in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s kind of exactly what you would expect from a chalk pastel.</li>
            <li> Granddaughters really like these. Colors were great.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t 100% impressed by this hair chalk. I purchased it to take it with me to a music festival. The colors are beautiful in my hair, but a bit difficult to notice unless I rub the chalk in my hair over and over. While the colors are very pretty, they are not very pigmented. Do not expect an intense hair color. However, the price is great for this pack. These would be great for a light colored hair and for an ombre look!</li>
