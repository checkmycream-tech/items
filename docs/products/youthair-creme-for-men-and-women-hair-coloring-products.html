            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I like about this kind of hair coloring</li>
            <li>My husband has used this product for years and always purchased it at a popular store, but they stopped carrying it for some reason.  </li>
            <li>Large bottle at a great price, and doubles as hair conditioner and styling cr&amp;egrave;me.</li>
            <li>It appears more natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping,  great product to keep the gray away.</li>
            <li>satisfied for the price.  </li>
            <li>the bottle says it works better in sunlight anyway.</li>
            <li>For many years I was a user of Grecian Formula Cream but for some reason they stopped making it.</li>
            <li>I have been using Youthair for more than 30 years, and I love it.</li>
            <li>They say its safe.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works great</li>
            <li>I would have giving this a 4 star, but the funky smell drops it one more star.</li>
            <li>What works best for me is simply to knock the gleam off the gray, producing a sort of steel tone..</li>
            <li>Youthair Creme is great because you are in control of how much coloring you get and where.</li>
            <li>will be ordering more as my supples get lower.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This works better than dying your hair and is easy to do.  </li>
            <li>Four stars because it has a light odor to it that I don&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li>They could easily charge more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works great, arrived pretty fast</li>
            <li>Works more quickly in sunshine, for some reason.  </li>
            <li>Works well , apply at least 5 times in a row to start seeing results but works great , just be patience and shake it well before use ,, good luck</li>
            <li>Smells like the original to.&lt;br /&gt;Cross</li>
            <li>He puts Youthhair Creme on his mustache and it looks very natural and nice.  </li>
            <li>What luck because this stuff is even better than the old Grecian Cream that I thought was fantastic until I found this.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine with me, as gray looks better than white at this stage in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Read the reviews on this product and decided it is worth giving it a try to see if it will help with the gray.  </li>
            <li>have used this product for the past 70 years.no more gray but better with light brown hair on my head</li>
            <li>Other than that it works fairly well.</li>
            <li>It left a brownish tint.&lt;br /&gt;Grecian formula liquid or cr√®me work better for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I feel everyone is different and clubman might work better for you.</li>
            <li>This is a larger amount for a better price.</li>
            <li>Better results from 2X daily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this locally; found it on Amazon at a better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will be the first time for me to try this product maybe over rating it, will update once I have used it for awhile.</li>
            <li>is that you choose your own level of color change, and the product reactivates your former natural hair color--to the degree you choose.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly what I ordered, and I am very please.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a few years, very satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>works very well for me.</li>
            <li>It works very well on my hair.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to be all the same ingredients at the Original Youthair that i have tried before.</li>
            <li>This is pretty natural looking.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use a light colored towel to dry off hair as some color may get on the towel.</li>
            <li>It is unconvincing if an older guy walks around with the hair color he had when he was 18.</li>
            <li>so far it looks and feels and applies the same as the original product brand of youthair.</li>
            <li>No drastic color change from normal hair color, use like hair tonic.</li>
            <li>TO KEEP THE NATURAL LOOK.</li>
            <li>Using on my temples and front where the grays are prevalent, within a week it was my natural brown color.</li>
            <li>difference here, is my color now is gray and not my natural brown.</li>
            <li>Looks natural color of my hair.</li>
            <li>It looks natural since it wont color your hair just all black, like hair colors would, but you have to apply it consistently.</li>
            <li>This is the product that all men and women, age 50 or above, should use to darken their hair and keep appearing young.</li>
            <li>ESSENTIALLY RESTORES MY HAIR TO ITS NATURAL COLOR.  </li>
            <li>The creme does not work as fast as I expected.</li>
            <li>Change can sometimes be good and sometimes bad......</li>
            <li>The bad news, not so good if you are indoors.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Change can sometimes be good and sometimes bad......</li>
            <li> The bad news, not so good if you are indoors.</li>
            <li> With the old supply I sometimes actually used small dabs on my face for the moisturizing effect, but I wouldn&#x27;t think of doing that with this new batch... unless I needed to vomit for some reason.</li>
            <li> Simply apply 2-3 times/week to keep the grey out.</li>
            <li> I threw the bottle away after the first few applications due to eye irritation and headaches.  </li>
            <li> ian 71 years old with varey little gray hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to be the same product by the same company, and produces the same results, but whereas the product purchased earlier had a very pleasing fragrance, this new supply smells literally BAD.  </li>
            <li> would end up with either all dark hair, or too much white.</li>
            <li> I simply mix this with some Volumax hair gel, shake up my little bottle, and use it like this.</li>
            <li> What little she had left when she was done was for me.</li>
            <li> You only need to use it a few times a week.  </li>
            <li> This product is simple to use, just rub a small amount into hair ( I apply small amount to back of head also where I need extra coverage )</li>
            <li> I bought this to replenish my supply of Youthair which I&#x27;d bought quite a few years ago at an Osco drug store and recently used</li>
            <li> so thought I&#x27;d try this after reading other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works on the same principle as Grecian Formula, costs less--smells no better, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had been using Just For Men for several years, very messy and needed help from my wife to apply.</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t like about regular hair color, besides reading how unhealthy the chemicals are for your skin and body, was she never quite got the &#x27;leave the side a little white&#x27; instructions</li>
            <li> My hair is dark.</li>
            <li> and we found it on Amazon, and for less money.  </li>
            <li> effective&lt;br /&gt;it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;it is hard to detect that you are using.</li>
            <li> Use it every day for thick wiree grey hair</li>
            <li> I use a little dab in my hand and rub it in my hair.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a little concerned about the lead.</li>
            <li> Id rather have little gray hair rather than having no hair</li>
            <li> My husband applies just a little here and there on his hair.  </li>
            <li> my husband uses it everyday and says it reakky works</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s not comfortable with the lead in it.</li>
            <li> He has black hair with the usual salt and pepper streaks.</li>
            <li> I usually apply after morning shower and found out it will stain and ruin your pillow cases even after having all day to absorb into hair.</li>
            <li> rub a small amount into palm.&lt;br /&gt;spread</li>
            <li> but too late to cancel.</li>
            <li> It is so thick you cant get it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The color is very subtle and he leaves a little gray in his hair and mustache.  </li>
            <li> It is not perfect but costs less than dying.</li>
            <li> at least in MY case, caused some &amp;#34;hair loss&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I hated their liquid</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the product that all men and women, age 50 or above, should use to darken their hair and keep appearing young.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try it to cover the gray.  I didn&#x27;t like the results.  It left a brownish tint.&lt;br /&gt;Grecian formula liquid or cr√®me work better for me.  It appears more natural.&lt;br /&gt;However, I feel everyone is different and clubman might work better for you.</li>
            <li> Just got is and it seems to be all the same ingredients at the Original Youthair that i have tried before. This is a larger amount for a better price. So I&#x27;m gonna give it a shot. Smells like the original to.&lt;br /&gt;Cross my fingers. Change can sometimes be good and sometimes bad...... so far it looks and feels and applies the same as the original product brand of youthair.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,  great product to keep the gray away.</li>
            <li> Works well , apply at least 5 times in a row to start seeing results but works great , just be patience and shake it well before use ,, good luck</li>
            <li> I love it! Great product, delivered as promised, just in time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product but never used it because it contains a substance that is thought cancerous.</li>
            <li> It works.  You only need to use it a few times a week.  I rub it on my temples when it is sunny out and any gray hair that was there is diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied for the price.  They could easily charge more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slight smell, but it fades as the day progresses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M ON MY SECOND BOTTLE.  ESSENTIALLY RESTORES MY HAIR TO ITS NATURAL COLOR.  BE SURE TO APPLY IT EVENLY, AND FOR BEST RESULTS, I APPLY IT EVERY NIGHT.  MY WIFE HAS NOT TRIED IT BECAUSE I HAVE TO SHAMPOO MY HAIR DAILY TO KEEP THE NATURAL LOOK.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what I do daily....works very well for me. I have wavy hair, so while I&#x27;m happy with the darkening aspect of Youthair, I desired a bit more hold. Soooooooo.....I simply mix this with some Volumax hair gel, shake up my little bottle, and use it like this. Perfect....plus the bottle says it works better in sunlight anyway. I used to apply at night. This way it&#x27;s in my hair all day.</li>
            <li> this is one great probduct youthair it colors just the gray hair the more you use the darker your hair gets ive been useing this for years ian 71 years old with varey little gray hair it works.</li>
            <li> works great, arrived pretty fast</li>
            <li> Use after shower in the morning. I use a little dab in my hand and rub it in my hair. comb out.</li>
            <li> Using on my temples and front where the grays are prevalent, within a week it was my natural brown color. Loved the results. Now I use it 2-3 times a week to maintain. Large bottle at a great price, and doubles as hair conditioner and styling cr&amp;egrave;me.</li>
            <li> For many years I was a user of Grecian Formula Cream but for some reason they stopped making it. I hated their liquid so began a search for another product when I found Youthair Cream. What luck because this stuff is even better than the old Grecian Cream that I thought was fantastic until I found this. It works great and I am about to reorder.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it. He has black hair with the usual salt and pepper streaks. It looks natural since it wont color your hair just all black, like hair colors would, but you have to apply it consistently. It works best, if you spend some time in the sunlight, since that activates it faster. Four stars because it has a light odor to it that I don&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li> this comes in handy to help cover some of my greys been using it for yrs and works great everytime</li>
            <li> The creme does not work as fast as I expected. Moreover, it provides a yellowish color - it didn&#x27;t happen with the one I bought from a shop two years ago.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what I ordered, and I am very please. I have been using Youthair for more than 30 years, and I love it.</li>
            <li> my husband uses it everyday and says it reakky works</li>
            <li> I never wanted to be a \\&quot;Q\\&quot; tip. This stuff works.</li>
            <li> Perfect  For Husband&#x27;s Need&#x27;s Works  Great!!!  Been Using for years!!!!  Thnxs for Marketing this product!!!</li>
            <li> It will darken the gray a bit. Blend it in, but not cover it as a dye. I can not convince him to use a dye, but he will use this product. You must protect your hair from sunlight after use. Sunlight will turn the color to a yellow.</li>
            <li> This product does work to keep the gray at bay but I&#x27;m a little concerned about the lead. That being said the ones without it don&#x27;t work as well. They say its safe.</li>
            <li> The website states this can be used on a beard. However, actual product states it contains lead and should not be used anywhere on the face. This is deceptive advertising.</li>
            <li> It works very well on my hair.  I would recommend to anyone to use this product.  It does what it&#x27;s made for.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again.  John</li>
            <li> This works better than dying your hair and is easy to do.  Simply apply 2-3 times/week to keep the grey out.</li>
            <li> Used it years ago and went on line to find out if it was still being make. Found it at Amozon  works great. My hair is dark.</li>
            <li> BEWARE ... at least in MY case, caused some &amp;#34;hair loss&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I think this item is working the way it was described. I follow the direction on how to use it and it look like my hair color is getting darker.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years, very satisfied with the results.  Best product of this type I have found</li>
            <li> This does work and my hair is very white. It is not perfect but costs less than dying. Also after several months of dye, my hair was several colors. This is pretty natural looking. Better results from 2X daily. Don&#x27;t use a light colored towel to dry off hair as some color may get on the towel.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.</li>
            <li> The good news, it works great if you are out in the sun alot. The bad news, not so good if you are indoors. I usually apply after morning shower and found out it will stain and ruin your pillow cases even after having all day to absorb into hair.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this creme for years and dearly loves it.</li>
            <li> Warning; Contains Lead, a cancer causing substance. I return it after reading the label.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works great</li>
            <li> have used this product for the past 70 years.no more gray but better with light brown hair on my head</li>
            <li> I would have giving this a 4 star, but the funky smell drops it one more star. My hair is getting white and I&#x27;m wanting to hold on to what&#x27;s left of my color so thought I&#x27;d try this after reading other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this my wife used to &#x27;add&#x27; me to her monthly color program. What little she had left when she was done was for me. What I didn&#x27;t like about regular hair color, besides reading how unhealthy the chemicals are for your skin and body, was she never quite got the &#x27;leave the side a little white&#x27; instructions down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would end up with either all dark hair, or too much white. Either way it simply looked like I was coloring my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with this product, I simply rub some into my hair in the morning, comb, and continue on with my day. Shower out at night and use again when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find I use it about once a week to help maintain my color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference here, is my color now is gray and not my natural brown. That&#x27;s fine with me, as gray looks better than white at this stage in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if they could only do something about that u u u u u s m e l l !</li>
            <li> I used this product back in 2009, now its 2013 and decided id give a review. I was hoping this would work, and it gave me permanent hair loss. Dont use this s***! Id rather have little gray hair rather than having no hair</li>
            <li> This product works. I had been using Just For Men for several years, very messy and needed help from my wife to apply.This product is simple to use, just rub a small amount into hair ( I apply small amount to back of head also where I need extra coverage ) Four applications did the trick, I did not need to reapply for two weeks.Looks natural color of my hair.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for some time now and easiest way to get rid of gray with no hassle. No drastic color change from normal hair color, use like hair tonic.</li>
            <li> Got this for hubby. He&#x27;s not comfortable with the lead in it. I&#x27;m returning and going to order the one that has no lead in it.</li>
            <li> Good item I like its way of darkening hair color, good product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this locally; found it on Amazon at a better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product. Works on the same principle as Grecian Formula, costs less--smells no better, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this kind of hair coloring is that you choose your own level of color change, and the product reactivates your former natural hair color--to the degree you choose. What works best for me is simply to knock the gleam off the gray, producing a sort of steel tone.. (I leave my hair silver at the temples by not applying any Youthair there.)  For me this degree of change takes about a week of daily use, followed by use twice a week to maintain the effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I am after is verisimilitude: It is unconvincing if an older guy walks around with the hair color he had when he was 18. Youthair Creme is great because you are in control of how much coloring you get and where.</li>
            <li> I threw the bottle away after the first few applications due to eye irritation and headaches.  Did not work out for me.</li>
            <li> rub a small amount into palm.&lt;br /&gt;spread it around&lt;br /&gt;cost effective&lt;br /&gt;it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;it is hard to detect that you are using.</li>
            <li> It is so thick you cant get it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Works well but can irritate your skin if in constant contact with your skin over time. But it does work well on your hair.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this product for years and always purchased it at a popular store, but they stopped carrying it for some reason.  So he wanted me to look on line for it and we found it on Amazon, and for less money.  This is the only hair coloring product that he will use.  Personally, I don&#x27;t like the product for the simple fact that it will discolor your pillowcases and it has a smell to it that I don&#x27;t care for.  Other than that it works fairly well.</li>
            <li> Works more quickly in sunshine, for some reason.  Does take quite a bit of time, but no one can tell I&#x27;ve done anything.</li>
            <li> Use it every day for thick wiree grey hair</li>
            <li> This will be the first time for me to try this product maybe over rating it, will update once I have used it for awhile. Read the reviews on this product and decided it is worth giving it a try to see if it will help with the gray.  Do not want to dye my hair but would like some help with the gray.</li>
            <li> My husband applies just a little here and there on his hair.  He puts Youthhair Creme on his mustache and it looks very natural and nice.  The color is very subtle and he leaves a little gray in his hair and mustache.  He buys it all the time.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replenish my supply of Youthair which I&#x27;d bought quite a few years ago at an Osco drug store and recently used up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be the same product by the same company, and produces the same results, but whereas the product purchased earlier had a very pleasing fragrance, this new supply smells literally BAD.  With the old supply I sometimes actually used small dabs on my face for the moisturizing effect, but I wouldn&#x27;t think of doing that with this new batch... unless I needed to vomit for some reason.</li>
            <li> Great product, great value</li>
            <li> Contains lead. Tried to cancel order after found out but too late to cancel.</li>
            <li> The product works well for me. The items were received in goood time.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more as my supples get lower.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to my friends</li>
