            <li>Great product a must buy..</li>
            <li>you should see good results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good if you just don&#x27;t want bacteria in your hair just in case because things can spread to your scalp through your hair and from your hands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells pleasant, cleans good without over-stripping the hair and scalp, and the conditioner is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>This shampoo plus conditioner has a pleasant mild floral scent, helps to calm the itching but did not solve my problem.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner have a great scent,  but so far I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my hair.</li>

            <li>This leaves my hair so clean and soft afterwards.</li>

            <li>Help relieved the redness and itch of the scalp and leaves your hair with a extra clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Did not ease scalp-itch as quickly as some other products, so have not used it consistently.  </li>
            <li>It helped me clear my scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nearly every OTC shampoo and conditioner out there.</li>
            <li>I found I am washing my hair less often because my hair feels healthy and not weighed down.  </li>
            <li>totally self conscious as to how my hair looks when using this product.  </li>
            <li>It seems to completely strip my hair &amp; makes it totally flat looking.</li>

            <li> I think this brand does help to make the itch less intense</li>
            <li> Today I used just the shampoo &amp; Head &amp; Shoulders conditioner, hair still kinda flat but no oily scalp.  </li>
            <li> Scalp always dry and itchy, embarrassing flaking and scaling, etc.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp and I have to use a very harsh prescription shampoo before this which leaves my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> but only temporary for a few hours.</li>
            <li> All tho it only works after a few weeks..</li>
            <li> have very fine hair, which was also shedding an awful lot (in addition to the horrid flaking of the scalp), and I&#x27;ve noticed in the two weeks I&#x27;ve been using this, that not only has the scaling been DRAMATICALLY cut back, but I&#x27;ve noticed my shedding isn&#x27;t as pronounced.</li>
            <li> I do not use this shampoo if I am going somewhere &amp; go back to my usual products</li>
            <li> I found that I could only use it for a few consecutive days as it made my hair limp.</li>
            <li> A bit harsh</li>
            <li> &amp; that did help but just for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I had some trouble with the delivery and customer service</li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t mine, you will like this regardless.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> My scalp has not got worse</li>
            <li> The conditioner is especially hard to get rinsed out.  </li>
            <li> my flare ups were so painful I couldn&#x27;t sleep.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to order this again :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Rich consistency and pleasant fragrance.  Did not ease scalp-itch as quickly as some other products, so have not used it consistently.  Perhaps consistent, daily use would give good cumulative results.&lt;br /&gt;Negative:  Ingredients aren&#x27;t listed on bottle.</li>
            <li> I guess it is working well for me, I have some bumps all over my scalp as well as pimples and this shampoo is definitely reducing the occurrence.</li>
            <li> This stuff felt like it damaged my hair but It did what it was supposed to. A bit harsh</li>
            <li> This product works OK, but it&#x27;s not a cure. I found that I could only use it for a few consecutive days as it made my hair limp. I have long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner have a great scent,  but so far I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my hair. I only been using it for two weeks, maybe I&#x27;ll give it more time and see.</li>
            <li> Shampoo contains carcinogen cocamide DEA.&lt;br /&gt;[...] os-carcinogens-center-for-environmental- health_n_3831982.html.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cocamide DEA was added to the California list of harmful chemicals in 2012 after the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) published its review of the chemical’s safety.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> It helped me clear my scalp. The product seams to be working and doing as advertised, however it is not a permanent solution.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like it helped after using two bottles of shampoo and one of conditioner. I would request my money back.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all for me</li>
            <li> I am on the fence about these products. I have baby fine hair.  Have had problems with itchy scalp &amp; causing sores since the beginning of the summer with the hot weather. I tried Head &amp; Shoulder Itchy Scalp shampoo &amp; conditioner &amp; that did help but just for a few hours. I think this brand does help to make the itch less intense so but only temporary for a few hours. I have been using it for about a week. The conditioner is especially hard to get rinsed out.  Thought maybe I was using to much but made sure I rinsed a lot &amp; I still had oily hair at the scalp.  It seems to completely strip my hair &amp; makes it totally flat looking. Today I used just the shampoo &amp; Head &amp; Shoulders conditioner, hair still kinda flat but no oily scalp.  I do not use this shampoo if I am going somewhere &amp; go back to my usual products so I have some body &amp; volume to my hair....totally self conscious as to how my hair looks when using this product.  I would recommend it to someone &amp; tell them about my experience with the oily scalp problem.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. My granddaughter had a scalp infection and these products cleared it after a week.</li>
            <li> Did not help me... In just two weeks my scalp became very inflamed. I thought it was just part of the process so I continued using it. Once the third week was up heading in my fourth I noticed I was having more shed and my flare ups were so painful I couldn&#x27;t sleep. I just went back to head and shoulder in the blue bottle the medicated one and although it doesn&#x27;t cure it it makes it bearable</li>
            <li> This product irritated my scalp.</li>
            <li> This shampoo plus conditioner has a pleasant mild floral scent, helps to calm the itching but did not solve my problem. My scalp has not got worse but I don&#x27;t feel it has gotten better either. Will be going to the dermatologist for a second opinion.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product did any good.  Just seemed to make my hair feel like it got stripped and did nothing for my scalp itchiness.</li>
            <li> This product works. Help relieved the redness and itch of the scalp and leaves your hair with a extra clean feeling. All tho it only works after a few weeks..mabe 3 to 4 weeks you should see good results. I dont recommend leaving it in your more than 3 to 4 mins at a time. Wash thoroughly after use. Use 2 to 3 times a week and wash hair twice per use.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers up very good and the conditioner makes your hair very soft.  It stands up to its product.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner! It leaves my hair clean, fresh and lusterous. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Compare with the first time order !&lt;br /&gt;The prodact is diferent ...!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to order this again :((...&lt;br /&gt;Is completly different discolored ...starting from the botle end the shoompo !!</li>
            <li> Really can&#x27;t say how well it works.  I ordered the Emu shampoo and conditioner, or thought I did.  When this arrived I found out I couldn&#x27;t return it for the products I really wanted,  The A-Z return policy provided a refund, and the product went to a charity that provides these kinds of products to folks who can&#x27;t afford them.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp and I have to use a very harsh prescription shampoo before this which leaves my hair very dry. This leaves my hair so clean and soft afterwards. Love this stuff! I wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> Healthy Hair Plus shampoo is great.  Your hair is left feeling clean, soft, and smells great.  I found I am washing my hair less often because my hair feels healthy and not weighed down.  I had some trouble with the delivery and customer service took care of the problem immediately!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly every OTC shampoo and conditioner out there. Even went &amp;#34;no &#x27;poo&amp;#34; for a while (doing baking soda wash, with an apple cider vinegar as a rinse), to no avail. Scalp always dry and itchy, embarrassing flaking and scaling, etc. You know the deal. Hell, you&#x27;re researching anti-fungal shampoos! You KNOW the itch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this. Seriously. GET IT NOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells pleasant, cleans good without over-stripping the hair and scalp, and the conditioner is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair, which was also shedding an awful lot (in addition to the horrid flaking of the scalp), and I&#x27;ve noticed in the two weeks I&#x27;ve been using this, that not only has the scaling been DRAMATICALLY cut back, but I&#x27;ve noticed my shedding isn&#x27;t as pronounced.</li>
            <li> Great product a must buy..</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo came so fast. It has helped my dandruff problem were nothing else helped tried everything.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair because I&#x27;m basically full Sicilian. I bought this because I had a skin thing happening and I wanted to play it safe with my scalp so I got this with only one person having reviewed it. It smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out. At least it didn&#x27;t mine, you will like this regardless. It&#x27;s also good if you just don&#x27;t want bacteria in your hair just in case because things can spread to your scalp through your hair and from your hands. I love it.</li>
