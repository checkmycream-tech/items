            <li> I got this for my mom as she&#x27;s lately been complaining about her skin starting to look less tight. Here&#x27;s her feedback: She does notice some tightening effects, however the smell isn&#x27;t the best, so she uses it mostly on her upper arms. It does seem to be working on her arms so she doesn&#x27;t mind the smell. So far so good!</li>

            <li> Have used Reventin for about a month. The product feels great on my skin, but haven&#x27;t noticed a marked change in skin taughtness. Maybe after the second jar . . .</li>
            <li> Was sceptical but it works fairly well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom. She is older and loves trying new aging creams. So far she hasn&#x27;t noticed a huge difference, but she has a small one. Hopefully after using it longer it will be more noticeable. The cream smells really good. Kind of a minty smell. It rubs into the skin well. I bought these at a discounted price in order to give my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Great product. You will see the results on the third day.</li>
            <li> SMELLS LIKE MENTHOLATUM! NOT GOOD.</li>
            <li> This cream didn&#x27;t do anything  for me,  I&#x27;ve used it for 3 weeks ago. Too bad I can&#x27;t  return it  and get my money back.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any changed using this product so far.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it is one of the best neck cream that i have used. Also the price is affordable.</li>
            <li> Did not see any change</li>
            <li> waste of money...only a moisturizer..firms nothing</li>
            <li> The Reventin Neck Firming Cream is  a wonderful product! My neck looks and  feels so fresh just after using it for a short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;Increased dermal density and elasticity&lt;br /&gt;Visibly reduced lines and noticeably tighter skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I can see a difference in the firmness of my neck.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> When I was first offered this item during a promotion for my honest opinion I was very hesitant, mostly because, well, I had never thought about my neck. it has always been so veiny and ugly I had just given up on  it, it had never occurred to me that I might be what i had or had not been doing for it. So I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;It came very quickly and is very securely closed.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very lite pleasant smell to it. I applied it to my neck before i went to bed the first night and I was impressed with how well it soaked right in without any greasy feeling at all. I didnt notice any difference at all the next morning. Then I applied it again yesterday morning and again last night. When I got out of the shower this morning my husband was staring at me and of course being a man you know I just &amp;#34;knew &amp;#34; what he was  after.&lt;br /&gt;He just didnt know what was different, he couldnt put his finger on why I looked so different.&lt;br /&gt;NOW: I can , cut, curl and dye my hair and this man will not notice!!&lt;br /&gt;He noticed!  I looked in the mirror and sure enough the veins are disappearing!&lt;br /&gt;I dont know if it is this cream in particular or just the fact that I gave it some attention, but I do not care...... I will be purchasing more of this!</li>
            <li> really like it  I can feel the difference</li>
            <li> Great product... love it- Use it every night... lets see results soon.</li>
            <li> Thick hand cream is same thing... i used 4-5 times only</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say whether or not this works. I keep hoping. I have had lots of compliments recently - people wondering what I&#x27;m doing, so maybe it is noticeable to others more than it is to me.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer, but did not do much for my turkey neck.  Guess I&#x27;ll just keep doing my exercises.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> This cream does not firm the neck area. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Okay, really didn&#x27;t see a difference in my neck!</li>
            <li> no way to tell how effective this product was; I didn&#x27;t like the way it smelled, kinda chemical like</li>
            <li> so far it&#x27;s an ok product. don&#x27;t much like the smell. softens neck lines some.</li>
            <li> This cream is so affordable!  I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and already see results!</li>
            <li> Simply put, this product does not work. You may as well buy any generic moisterizer from your local drugstore or use coconut oil, which I have found to work much better - and it smells better, too! Save your money.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and I got it well before I expected!!  It has a really nice scent as well!</li>
            <li> Works okay.  But no better than other creams at your local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer but I saw no change with any firming. I would be skeptical of the picture.</li>
            <li> Your neck won&#x27;t look like you are 20 yrs. old but it sure makes a difference.  For the two previous ladies - put a sealing cream on top.</li>
            <li> So far so good, awaiting more noticeable results.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t  seen a drastic  change, but do see some improvement!!</li>
            <li> I am trying this...it seems good...I am also using it on the front and back of my neck and chest area.</li>
            <li> I am 76 years old and truly needed HELP.  This cream is wonderful and will continue to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Have bought three so far.  I first looked like a rooster neck now so much better.  REALLY.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Isabel</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT DIDN&#x27;T DO ANYTHINNG TO TIGHTEN THE SKIN ON MY NECK. AND SINCE I CAN&#x27;T GET A REFUND EXCEPT TO SEND THE PRODUCT BACK UNOPENED, I&#x27;M OUT THE MONEY AND NO RESULTS.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy this again....not great...</li>
            <li> NO STAR. CREAM SMELLED LIKE A DEAD ANIMAL. I THINK IT WAS &#x27;ROTTEN&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Been using for over 1 month.</li>
            <li> Well, I have been using it for two months and it has definitely improved my neck. It is firmer and less turkey neck. I would definitely buy it again and it lasts a long time. I haven&#x27;t even used half the jar. It was a great price and lasts long and works on firming the neck area.</li>
            <li> I find it to have firmed up the skin on my neck. It absorbs easily and is not at all greasy-feeling.</li>
