            <li>The length is perfect; it can reach every part of the back without any strain.  </li>
            <li>so he is able to get the spots where he needs it...  </li>
            <li>I personally love the collapsable one.  </li>
            <li>Back scratchers make GREAT gifts!!</li>
            <li>It really is cute, but works well too.  </li>
            <li>to order more Cactus Buddies for my home and as gifts.</li>
            <li>The only problem was it lost one of the eyes the moment I took it out of the box :D</li>
            <li>Any way it would be better if the cactus had 2 eyes.</li>
            <li>I thought it was adorable.</li>
            <li>but I tried it , I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>it turned out to be the best back scratcher i have ever used!</li>
            <li>More pressure &#x3D; more aggressive.</li>
            <li>This scratcher is perfect for him, the handle is pleanty long</li>
            <li>The Cactus Buddy is a great little product...makes a great gift.  </li>
            <li>Very cheaply made it is extremely cheaply made but still very funny!</li>
            <li>Plus it is quite adorable which is good if you want adorable as a feature of your back stratcher.  </li>
            <li>but it scratches her itches just fine.</li>
            <li>This is a great back scratcher for the money.  </li>
            <li>I just love it, and it makes me smile every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I also bought some great back scratchers at backscratcherworld.com.  </li>
            <li>Very fun</li>
            <li>so we bought a new one which my husband is enjoying and now keeps out of the puppy&#x27;s reach!</li>
            <li>Just received this back scratcher and it&#x27;s my new \\&quot;best friend\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>My mom wanted a unique backscratcher for christmas.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 scratchers on Amazon for a friend who loves back scratches and this one was voted by far the best.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re the kind of person who would like cheese graters shaped like mice or pancake spatulas shaped like guitars, you&#x27;ll probably love this back scratcher.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer had stated that the bristles don&#x27;t look like what it in the picture, which is true.</li>
            <li>So I decided to take a chance that it would be a good scratcher in addition to the obvious cuteness factor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll make for a good white elephant gift.</li>
            <li>Whereas with a mouth (smile or not) you get the feeling, however imagined, of a friendly relationship.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s &#x27;hair&#x27; like bristles provides the best relief possible for a back that needs scratching.  </li>
            <li>Love this back scratcher so much more than the bamboo ones I also ordered.  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome idea for a back scratcher but the product is a big failboat.</li>
            <li>Yes, I tried to use super clue and put it on its place, but eye didn&#x27;t want to stay there...</li>
            <li>Very cute back scratcher</li>
            <li>The ones I bought on line are not quite as good, but they are far better than a plastic or wooden hand on a stick.</li>
            <li>It is the little things in life that make it great.</li>
            <li>The product is fun and useful my husband loves it and praises it every time he uses it.</li>
            <li>I definatly would recommend this useful but fun product.</li>
            <li>He gives a good, efficient, gentle to moderate scratch depending on pressure without taking your skin off.  </li>
            <li>It came earlier than expected and was packed in a tube so that it was in perfect condition when it arrived.</li>
            <li>but my daughters smile was worth it.</li>
            <li>Bought one originally for my husband several years ago and he loved it and it held up well until our 10 month old puppy got ahold of it and pulled the bristles</li>
            <li>I prefer to use a good sharp corner in the house though.</li>
            <li>They are suitable for decoration only.</li>
            <li>I first bought one of these cakky scratchers in a gift shop near the grand canyon because i thought it was so funny.</li>
            <li>The handle is nice and long for getting all your itchy spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She says he has a nice long handle that reaches all those places that your fingers can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a nice product.</li>
            <li>I constantly have itch on m back and this item is very handy.</li>
            <li>Just wanted to say that this company puts customer satisfaction first and for that I am grateful.  </li>
            <li>Love this back scratcher</li>
            <li>With many back scratchers you end up leaving marks on the skin as you attempt to relieve the itch, this one prevents that.  </li>
            <li>It is more than just a back scratcher, it has personality!</li>
            <li>Pretty cute and quirky item.</li>
            <li>Funny gag git</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S FUNNY</li>
            <li>I need an aggressive back scratch, and most scratchers won&#x27;t even come close to relieving my itches.</li>
            <li>Got this as a gift for a loved one this past Christmas</li>
            <li>the scratching is less effective.</li>
            <li>It gives just enough of a scratch without drawing blood -- which some of the bamboo back scratchers are prone to do -- and it&#x27;s really cute!  </li>
            <li>It works really well and does not leave scratch marks.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>w/ real cactus look and accesories.  </li>
            <li>It works really well, too.</li>
            <li>and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>I was suprised with how fast the \\&quot;scrather thorns\\&quot; came out..</li>
            <li>Ships fast everything came as described</li>
            <li>My college age child liked it so much that the back stratcher somehow made it into his luggage to go back to school.</li>
            <li>AND REALLY SCRATCHES</li>
            <li>Cactus has nice plastic spines that are flexible so they don&#x27;t cut (like a carpentry nail or real cactus spine would), but with moderate pressure they give a very aggressive back scratch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This thing is ineffective as a back scratcher and suitable only as a conversation piece or for bonking the dog on the butt when he misbehaves.</li>
            <li>Received my order quickly with a personal \\&quot;Thanks\\&quot; written on the packing slip...</li>
            <li>They are not as stiff and look more like real cactus needles.</li>
            <li>The little spines on the cactus were most dissappointing.</li>
            <li>I bought the Cactus Buddy Back Scratcher as a fun gift of my husband.</li>
            <li>I was expecting them to be firm and scratch-tastic, but they were flimsy and more for decoration.</li>
            <li>They carry the Cactus Buddy and a HUGE variety of quality hardwood, telescoping, and other specialty scratchers.  </li>
            <li>I give these to my friends who come to visit (I live in Arizona)  </li>
            <li>Otherwise your new cactus buddy is mute and mutant looking</li>
            <li>/&gt;the scratcher part is very soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles aren&#x27;t hard or rough, but they are very effective.</li>
            <li>I first wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to be too hard on your back</li>
            <li>My son had shoulder surgery and really wanted a back scratcher.</li>
            <li>Granted I have a 4 year old that was checking it out...</li>
            <li>The bristles are just soft vinyl with no strength to them.</li>
            <li>Not too soft or too rough, just right.  </li>
            <li>Go for the silver collapsable one or the thick wooden one at the top.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny and it really gets that itch because it scratches a much bigger area then all other back scratchers.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my 4 1/2 year old daughter since she decided she needed a back scratcher.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update June 2013:  his eyes have gone cloudy, and he&#x27;s lost a few bristles to curious cats, but I still love this back scratcher.  </li>
            <li>I chose a Cactus Buddy with a green bandana and googly eyes that were just right.</li>
            <li>&quot; were long, soft strips of plastic that couldn&#x27;t dust your furniture, let alone scratch an itch.</li>
            <li>Now that the dry winter weather is settling in, I&#x27;ll be putting him to use nearly every bedtime before tucking myself in.  </li>

            <li> It works really well and does not leave scratch marks.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> w/ real cactus look and accesories.  </li>
            <li> It works really well, too.</li>
            <li> and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> I was suprised with how fast the \\&quot;scrather thorns\\&quot; came out..</li>
            <li> Ships fast everything came as described</li>
            <li> My college age child liked it so much that the back stratcher somehow made it into his luggage to go back to school.</li>
            <li> AND REALLY SCRATCHES</li>
            <li> Cactus has nice plastic spines that are flexible so they don&#x27;t cut (like a carpentry nail or real cactus spine would), but with moderate pressure they give a very aggressive back scratch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing is ineffective as a back scratcher and suitable only as a conversation piece or for bonking the dog on the butt when he misbehaves.</li>
            <li> Received my order quickly with a personal \\&quot;Thanks\\&quot; written on the packing slip...</li>
            <li> They are not as stiff and look more like real cactus needles.</li>
            <li> The little spines on the cactus were most dissappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought the Cactus Buddy Back Scratcher as a fun gift of my husband.</li>
            <li> I was expecting them to be firm and scratch-tastic, but they were flimsy and more for decoration.</li>
            <li> They carry the Cactus Buddy and a HUGE variety of quality hardwood, telescoping, and other specialty scratchers.  </li>
            <li> I give these to my friends who come to visit (I live in Arizona)  </li>
            <li> Otherwise your new cactus buddy is mute and mutant looking</li>
            <li> /&gt;the scratcher part is very soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t hard or rough, but they are very effective.</li>
            <li> I first wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to be too hard on your back</li>
            <li> My son had shoulder surgery and really wanted a back scratcher.</li>
            <li> Granted I have a 4 year old that was checking it out...</li>
            <li> The bristles are just soft vinyl with no strength to them.</li>
            <li> Not too soft or too rough, just right.  </li>
            <li> Go for the silver collapsable one or the thick wooden one at the top.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny and it really gets that itch because it scratches a much bigger area then all other back scratchers.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 4 1/2 year old daughter since she decided she needed a back scratcher.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update June 2013:  his eyes have gone cloudy, and he&#x27;s lost a few bristles to curious cats, but I still love this back scratcher.  </li>
            <li> I chose a Cactus Buddy with a green bandana and googly eyes that were just right.</li>
            <li> &quot; were long, soft strips of plastic that couldn&#x27;t dust your furniture, let alone scratch an itch.</li>
            <li> Now that the dry winter weather is settling in, I&#x27;ll be putting him to use nearly every bedtime before tucking myself in.  </li>
            <li> The back scratcher was very poor quality over all with cheap materials for the price.  </li>
            <li> It has the feeling of using a hair brush on a long stick.  </li>
            <li> She took it to her friends on xmas day where they were all gather to open gifts and little cactus turn out to be the hit of the party out of all the gifts open that day!</li>
            <li> It was a little more expensive since it was not prime and we paid for shipping</li>
            <li> Not very much scratch factor.  </li>
            <li> Although I was disappointed with the quality of this product (it&#x27;s more a novelty than a functional back scratcher), I would order from this company again.</li>
            <li> The only issues is a slight design flaw.  </li>
            <li> Got one of these little guys for Xmas last year.  </li>
            <li> She helped me look on Amazon for a back scratcher and this little Cactus caught her eye.</li>
            <li> Not too rough but gets the itch out.  </li>
            <li> She loves it, and it is not so rough that it could scratch her skin</li>
            <li> Now, do I waste money sending it back?</li>
            <li> I feared the cactus needles would be too sharp but the problem is quite the opposite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still in one piece, unlike other back scratchers I&#x27;ve ordered in the past.  </li>
            <li> If you are a hard working Man and are average build or bigger</li>
            <li> Think: &#x27;angry red marks&#x27; to get what I call an acceptable back scratch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lack of a mouth on my new buddy&#x27;s face was so disturbing I had to draw one on with a sharpie.</li>
            <li> but it is not made to last, and if someone says it does they must have skin delicate as a mole rat!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Cactus Buddy for my husband, he has something called \\&quot;frozen shoulder\\&quot; and is unable to reach behind his back.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;s much less creepy if you draw a mouth.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s false advertising.</li>
            <li> the prickly parts were almost all out within a few weeks... :(  </li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these in Phoenix and unfortunately broke it.  </li>
            <li> My skeptical husband oohed and aahed after I had him try the &#x27;buddy&#x27;!</li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very unhappy!!!!!!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I give these to my friends who come to visit (I live in Arizona)  they work great and are a nice souvenier</li>
            <li> My son had shoulder surgery and really wanted a back scratcher. He loves it and says it works great. It&#x27;s comical and functional.</li>
            <li> I bought the Cactus Buddy Back Scratcher as a fun gift of my husband. The product is fun and useful my husband loves it and praises it every time he uses it. I definatly would recommend this useful but fun product.</li>
            <li> This is a great back scratcher for the money.  Not too rough but gets the itch out.  Bought one originally for my husband several years ago and he loved it and it held up well until our 10 month old puppy got ahold of it and pulled the bristles off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was so happy to see that it was still available so we bought a new one which my husband is enjoying and now keeps out of the puppy&#x27;s reach!</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say that this company puts customer satisfaction first and for that I am grateful.  Although I was disappointed with the quality of this product (it&#x27;s more a novelty than a functional back scratcher), I would order from this company again.</li>
            <li> Love this back scratcher</li>
            <li> The perfect amount of scratchiness!  I bought 3 scratchers on Amazon for a friend who loves back scratches and this one was voted by far the best.  Not too soft or too rough, just right.  Plus charming package to boot!</li>
            <li> The Cactus Buddy design with it&#x27;s &#x27;hair&#x27; like bristles provides the best relief possible for a back that needs scratching.  With many back scratchers you end up leaving marks on the skin as you attempt to relieve the itch, this one prevents that.  It has the feeling of using a hair brush on a long stick.  Additionally, it is cute!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My fiance and I have a joke that I&#x27;m going to sell his five o&#x27;clock shadow as a back scratcher!  No need now!  Someone already did!!!!!  This cactus scratcher is perfect for any itchy spot!  Get a million and give them to everyone.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a person on Earth who wouldn&#x27;t appreciate this!  And it arrived SUPER QUICK!!!!</li>
            <li> It works really well and does not leave scratch marks.  It hits the spot every time.</li>
            <li> Love this back scratcher so much more than the bamboo ones I also ordered.  The bristles have the perfect stiffness balanced with give.  Plus it is quite adorable which is good if you want adorable as a feature of your back stratcher.  The only issues is a slight design flaw.  The lack of a mouth on my new buddy&#x27;s face was so disturbing I had to draw one on with a sharpie. Seriously, it&#x27;s much less creepy if you draw a mouth.  Otherwise your new cactus buddy is mute and mutant looking and you feel like you&#x27;re exploiting it by using it.  Whereas with a mouth (smile or not) you get the feeling, however imagined, of a friendly relationship.</li>
            <li> Got one of these little guys for Xmas last year.  I thought it was hilarious and at the time didn&#x27;t know how dependent I&#x27;d become!  Now that the dry winter weather is settling in, I&#x27;ll be putting him to use nearly every bedtime before tucking myself in.  And after a year of use, he still makes us laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s made of fairly inexpensive materials, but don&#x27;t let that deter you.  He gives a good, efficient, gentle to moderate scratch depending on pressure without taking your skin off.  The handle is nice and long for getting all your itchy spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to buy a couple more as Xmas gifts this year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update June 2013:  his eyes have gone cloudy, and he&#x27;s lost a few bristles to curious cats, but I still love this back scratcher.  Husband has his own on his side of the bed.</li>
            <li> Just received this back scratcher and it&#x27;s my new \\&quot;best friend\\&quot;.  It gives just enough of a scratch without drawing blood -- which some of the bamboo back scratchers are prone to do -- and it&#x27;s really cute!  The length is perfect; it can reach every part of the back without any strain.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The needles are very different from what you see in the picture here on Amazon. Honestly, it&#x27;s false advertising. I&#x27;m quite upset. I feared the cactus needles would be too sharp but the problem is quite the opposite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the box and took a look at it, I thought maybe the needles had become flattened in shipping. This was not the case. The needles are simply very different from the photo. They just suck. When I tried using this on my back it felt like I was wiping my skin with a big plastic pickle. This is an awesome idea for a back scratcher but the product is a big failboat. Maybe it used to be a better quality (like the way the picture looks!) and they changed it? I&#x27;m very unhappy!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he absolutely loved it! His entire family wanted one as well!</li>
            <li> Very cute back scratcher w/ real cactus look and accesories.  Not very much scratch factor.  Great gift for someone who loves southwest look.</li>
            <li> I received this as a present for Christmas, and it was the hit of the party. Everyone wanted to try it. It is more than just a back scratcher, it has personality! I just love it, and it makes me smile every time I use it.</li>
            <li> This back scratcher is probably the cutest thing I&#x27;ve seen in a while. If you&#x27;re the kind of person who would like cheese graters shaped like mice or pancake spatulas shaped like guitars, you&#x27;ll probably love this back scratcher. It works really well, too. The bristles aren&#x27;t hard or rough, but they are very effective. Another reviewer had stated that the bristles don&#x27;t look like what it in the picture, which is true. They are not as stiff and look more like real cactus needles. However, the difference in shape does not affect the quality of back scratching you get from this thing. It takes care of your itch, but it doesn&#x27;t rip your skin off.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Cactus Buddy for my husband, he has something called \\&quot;frozen shoulder\\&quot; and is unable to reach behind his back.  This scratcher is perfect for him, the handle is pleanty long so he is able to get the spots where he needs it...  he&#x27;s quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> My skeptical husband oohed and aahed after I had him try the &#x27;buddy&#x27;! Bought this for his mother and he doesn&#x27;t know it yet, but one for our house as well!  Received my order quickly with a personal \\&quot;Thanks\\&quot; written on the packing slip... a nice touch when everything is so automated these days.</li>
            <li> This item just does NOT scratch the itch.  Go for the silver collapsable one or the thick wooden one at the top.  I personally love the collapsable one.  You can plant them all over the place or carry it in your purse for those especially itchy moments we all have.</li>
            <li> Pretty cute and quirky item. I constantly have itch on m back and this item is very handy. Love it!</li>
            <li> My mom wanted a unique backscratcher for christmas. So I choose this the catus buddy, and just hoped that it would work as good as it was cute. She took it to her friends on xmas day where they were all gather to open gifts and little cactus turn out to be the hit of the party out of all the gifts open that day! Everyone had to try him out and mom says that he works just great! She says he has a nice long handle that reaches all those places that your fingers can&#x27;t. It is the little things in life that make it great. Thanks for such a nice product. Anything that makes my mom happy is worth 5 stars to me.</li>
            <li> The Cactus Buddy is a great little product...makes a great gift.  It looks like they are almost sold out on here.  I also bought some great back scratchers at backscratcherworld.com.  They carry the Cactus Buddy and a HUGE variety of quality hardwood, telescoping, and other specialty scratchers.  Check them out!!  Back scratchers make GREAT gifts!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my husband.  It really is cute, but works well too.  It has become his \\&quot;Best Buddy\\&quot; and now I don&#x27;t have to scratch his back all the time!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 4 1/2 year old daughter since she decided she needed a back scratcher. She helped me look on Amazon for a back scratcher and this little Cactus caught her eye. She loves it, and it is not so rough that it could scratch her skin but it scratches her itches just fine. It came earlier than expected and was packed in a tube so that it was in perfect condition when it arrived. She now uses the tube for &amp;#34;Scratchy&#x27;s&amp;#34; home. It was a little more expensive since it was not prime and we paid for shipping but my daughters smile was worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he really likes it. It&#x27;s funny and it really gets that itch because it scratches a much bigger area then all other back scratchers.</li>
            <li> I was suprised with how fast the \\&quot;scrather thorns\\&quot; came out.. Granted I have a 4 year old that was checking it out... the prickly parts were almost all out within a few weeks... :(  It felt great while they were still in there.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for a loved one this past Christmas and they got a kick out of it! It also does the job when it comes to itchy backs! (:</li>
            <li> I debated as to whether to buy this or not based on the 20 existing reviews. Some said its great, some said its not. So I decided to take a chance that it would be a good scratcher in addition to the obvious cuteness factor. WRONG. The bristles are just soft vinyl with no strength to them. They are suitable for decoration only. This thing is ineffective as a back scratcher and suitable only as a conversation piece or for bonking the dog on the butt when he misbehaves. Now, do I waste money sending it back?</li>
            <li> Ships fast everything came as described but this product did not work well for me and has nothing to do with the seller it&#x27;s the product! It actually works well for a couple weeks but it is not made to last, and if someone says it does they must have skin delicate as a mole rat! If you are a hard working Man and are average build or bigger I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> Product not as advertised, not as pictured. \\&quot;Bristles\\&quot; were long, soft strips of plastic that couldn&#x27;t dust your furniture, let alone scratch an itch. And, I had to pay the postage to return it. Got the mailing label for nothing, though...woo-hoo. Worthless.</li>
            <li> Takes care of my itch just fine!</li>
            <li> This was a white elephant gift for a co-worker.........she loved it!  Very fun&lt;br /&gt;the scratcher part is very soft. Great gag gift!</li>
            <li> Funny gag git the color is totally off!  Very cheaply made it is extremely cheaply made but still very funny!</li>
            <li> WHATS TO SAY, TO ME THIS BACK SCRATCHER DOES WONDERS. GOOD JOB AND GOOD PRODUCT. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, I WILL ORDER MORE, THAT I CAN GUARANTEE</li>
            <li> I bought one of these in Phoenix and unfortunately broke it.  The ones I bought on line are not quite as good, but they are far better than a plastic or wooden hand on a stick.</li>
            <li> I bought my Cactus Buddy in Palm Springs in 2007 and he has been a constant companion ever since. I chose a Cactus Buddy with a green bandana and googly eyes that were just right. Mine is just like the picture. He is very effective and loved by all who meet him. I regret not buying more! That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here...to order more Cactus Buddies for my home and as gifts. Cactus Buddy is a lifesaver when you have an itch you otherwise can&#x27;t scratch.</li>
            <li> I liked the product. The only problem was it lost one of the eyes the moment I took it out of the box :D But it is something that doesn&#x27;t effect the scratching quality :D Any way it would be better if the cactus had 2 eyes. Yes, I tried to use super clue and put it on its place, but eye didn&#x27;t want to stay there...don&#x27;t know why...</li>
            <li> I received this Cactus Buddy Back Scratcher for Christmas. I thought it was adorable. I first wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to be too hard on your back but I tried it , I fell in love with it. Of course all my kids had to use it as well. My college age child liked it so much that the back stratcher somehow made it into his luggage to go back to school. I actually ordered another one for myself!!</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 and only 1 was not damaged.  The damaged was not done in shipping but obvious lack of quality control.  The back scratcher was very poor quality over all with cheap materials for the price.  They did give me a refund promptly for the 2 that were damaged.</li>
            <li> I first bought one of these cakky scratchers in a gift shop near the grand canyon because i thought it was so funny. it turned out to be the best back scratcher i have ever used!, the one i bought from amazon is not quite as good, the \\&quot;cakky spikes\\&quot; are longer &amp; softer so the scratching is less effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alright back scratcher. I prefer to use a good sharp corner in the house though. I know, I&#x27;m wierd. The little spines on the cactus were most dissappointing. I was expecting them to be firm and scratch-tastic, but they were flimsy and more for decoration. Oh well. It&#x27;ll make for a good white elephant gift.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband last Christmas and it&#x27;s still in one piece, unlike other back scratchers I&#x27;ve ordered in the past.  Still does a great job, too.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S FUNNY AND REALLY SCRATCHES GREAT.</li>
            <li> My sister got this and another type of scratcher as a gift for me several years ago.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only back scratcher I&#x27;ve found that even comes close to having a person do it. I need an aggressive back scratch, and most scratchers won&#x27;t even come close to relieving my itches. Think: &#x27;angry red marks&#x27; to get what I call an acceptable back scratch.&lt;br /&gt;The Cactus has nice plastic spines that are flexible so they don&#x27;t cut (like a carpentry nail or real cactus spine would), but with moderate pressure they give a very aggressive back scratch.&lt;br /&gt;The pressure you apply with it determines how aggressive a back scratch you get. More pressure &#x3D; more aggressive.</li>
            <li> I bought this in 2008 and still use it. It does a great job of scratching without hurting and still works as well as it did the first time.</li>
