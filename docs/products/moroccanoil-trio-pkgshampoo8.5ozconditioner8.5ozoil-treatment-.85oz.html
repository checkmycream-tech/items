            <li>Over the years, it has become very dry and frizzy and nothing that I tried made my hair feel or look as good as I wanted it to.  </li>
            <li>Until my daughter, who happens to have beautiful long, sleek hair naturally, told me about these products.</li>
            <li>Is it worth it?  </li>
            <li>Although it is pricey, def worth every penny</li>
            <li>to keep the aloe vera fresh.  </li>
            <li>After the first use I could see the difference and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t weight down the hair, gives great shine.&lt;br</li>

            <li>B002SRL764 Moroccan Oil Intense Hydrating Mask 8.5 oz]]</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all products by Moroccan oil!</li>
            <li>oh how fast it would make my hair grow.</li>
            <li>anyhow for my hair type its makes my hair feel and look better in conjunction with daily natural hair routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leave conditioner in for a few minutes and make sure you hair is really soaked before lathering shampoo in.</li>
            <li>I wish the conditioner were a little more moisterizing</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy, auburn hair that has a real tendancy to frizz.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair really soft, don&#x27;t use too much oil, keep it on the ends.</li>
            <li>but when used with the oil, i feel like my hair is very shiny and soft and voluminous.</li>
            <li>so i thought it was worth the extra expense to try.</li>
            <li>my iron etc is normal.</li>
            <li>It takes a few minutes less time to dry and style, and as an added bonus, it smells great, too!</li>
            <li>Long story short, Moroccan Oil just themselves got another loyal customer!</li>
            <li>However, the oil in these products is a dry touch oil that is quickly absorbed by your hair.</li>
            <li>My scalp is also naturally oily.</li>
            <li>It became really soft and shiny.  </li>

            <li>invested in Kent combs (believe they are seamless smoother on the hair and durable. )</li>
            <li>This costs a little bit, but girls---it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I bought new shampoo and conditioner at hair salon yesterday and the two smell completely different.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair soft, but not flat, even after coloring.</li>
            <li>I plan to re-order it again in the near future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m growing weak fine hair with no elasticity, breaks off or falls out by the roots.</li>
            <li>I have problem hair, and it has been much shiner, less frizzy and softer since I started using Moroccan oil.  </li>
            <li>Not only does this shampoo &amp; conditioner help tame my hair without weighing it down, but it also leaves it smooth &amp; silky.  </li>
            <li>I am an almost 50 year young female w/ wavy hair that has a tendency to be course &amp; very dry.</li>

            <li> The conditioner leaves my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair &amp; blow dry my hair straight every day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update:  I believe this shampoo and conditioner are not real.</li>
            <li> I will never use anything other than Morrocan Shampoo &amp; Conditioner along with the MORROCAN OIL TREATMENTt, which I believe to be the icing on the cake of this treatment trio.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half black and half white</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair shine, manageable, not frizzy and do not let the hair greasy like other the product I try with Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive but the products are exactly what I needed for my frizzy dry curls.</li>
            <li> I also apply a few drops of the Moroccanoil oil treatment on towel dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes hair manageable, shinny, easier to dry in less time!</li>
            <li> This product is NOT worth the money.   </li>
            <li> I received my products in less than 3 days.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also use aloe vera leaf juice and lil bit of lime and black tea from distilled water mix carrot seed oil, rosemary oil,basil oil with Eqyss conditioner to moisturize but have to refrigerate after each use.</li>
            <li> the only complaint is that the bottles are such thick plastic hard to squeeze our the products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products a little over a month</li>
            <li> Those little tips worked for me.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommmend anyone to waste their money on these!  </li>
            <li> I am not sure about the authenticity, however...</li>
            <li> I waited a few months to write this review because I wanted to see the short-term results I got from this product, and I can assure you that I&#x27;m now a believer!</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling and looking dirty...</li>
            <li> be just bad DNA although my family has long thick hair on both sides.</li>
            <li> I doubt that once you try it, you will be disappointed or go back to anything else!  </li>
            <li> Box was smashed and the seal of the conditioner was broken.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> , I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive because I&#x27;m probably going to use this product for the rest of my life...</li>
            <li> but I was not impressed with the way it arrived in the mail.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> They are quite expensive there.</li>
            <li> So unfortunately I have to stick with the styling products and not the shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> Since I was a teenager I have tried EVERYTHING from products written about in all the style magazines, to searching for and buying all those little \\&quot;treatment packages\\&quot; containing placenta, and God knows what else in every drugstore in a 10 mile radius of my home, to disgusting home remedies to try to moisturize and \\&quot;tame\\&quot; my hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked and I ended up spending rediculous amounts of money and smelling like something that went bad in your refridgerator.</li>
            <li> maybe i got the bad DNA.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate that feeling.   </li>

            <li> The oil is very good! The shampoo and conditioner are ok... Do not let to try the Hydrating Mask. Is absolutely wonderful!     [[ASIN:B002SRL764 Moroccan Oil Intense Hydrating Mask 8.5 oz]]</li>
            <li> I love these products.  The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair soft, but not flat, even after coloring. The treatment oil adds shine.  They all smell great.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT worth the money.   It left my hair feeling and looking dirty...I have tried it several times and always with the same results.   It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling nor looking good,letalone great!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommmend anyone to waste their money on these!  Never,will I purchase again!</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the authenticity, however... I ordered the set that was on the picture and description. Instead a got the regular one. Long story short, I ordered the ones that has those little colorful round and square colors on the bottle&#x27;s display, and got a different one.</li>
            <li> I have naturally fine, curly hair. I recently relaxed my hair, which caused a lot of damage. The Moroccanoil products have transformed my hair from damaged to super healthy. My hair is soft, shiny, and strong now. My scalp is also naturally oily. However, the oil in these products is a dry touch oil that is quickly absorbed by your hair. So don&#x27;t worry about it causing your hair to become super oily. This is amazing stuff. Do yourself a favor and get some!!  ;-)</li>
            <li> I am an almost 50 year young female w/ wavy hair that has a tendency to be course &amp; very dry. Since I was a teenager I have tried EVERYTHING from products written about in all the style magazines, to searching for and buying all those little \\&quot;treatment packages\\&quot; containing placenta, and God knows what else in every drugstore in a 10 mile radius of my home, to disgusting home remedies to try to moisturize and \\&quot;tame\\&quot; my hair. Nothing worked and I ended up spending rediculous amounts of money and smelling like something that went bad in your refridgerator. Until my daughter, who happens to have beautiful long, sleek hair naturally, told me about these products. I tried them and at once I reaized that I have found exactly what I have been looking for for 30+ years. The smell is fabulous, but much more than that the condition of my hair has improved so much more than I could ever have imagined. My hair is so soft, so shiny and feels amazing to the touch. My stylist said she is so impressed that she has told her other clients about these wonderful products. I will never use anything other than Morrocan Shampoo &amp; Conditioner along with the MORROCAN OIL TREATMENTt, which I believe to be the icing on the cake of this treatment trio.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive.  Is it worth it?  Also a yes.  I love this stuff.  I have problem hair, and it has been much shiner, less frizzy and softer since I started using Moroccan oil.  I used to use aveda but now will use Moroccan oil for my hair and aveda for face.  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This is the most fragrant musky smelling hair product on the market for curly or straight hair.  It helps with the most troublesome fly aways and makes you feel luxurious ;0</li>
            <li> This product has given me back beautiful hair! Over the years, it has become very dry and frizzy and nothing that I tried made my hair feel or look as good as I wanted it to.  But this stuff really works!!!! I have naturally wavy, auburn hair that has a real tendancy to frizz.  I  wanted smooth, silky, beautiful hair without a lot of product and definitely without feeling like I had stuff in my hair. I hate that feeling.   This costs a little bit, but girls---it is definitely worth it! I doubt that once you try it, you will be disappointed or go back to anything else!  I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li> Ive heard a lot of good things about the leave in treatment so I tried it, I loved it, so I got the smapoo and cnditioner too. I&#x27;m half black and half white so i have fine difficult hair, this product is AWESOME keeps my hair so and smooth and fabulous, I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive because I&#x27;m probably going to use this product for the rest of my life...</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil is the best Shampoo, Conditioner &amp; Oil Treatment Kit.  This product soften your hair, makes it smooth silky and zero frizz.  This was product was recommended by my hairdresser.  I plan to re-order it again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I waited a few months to write this review because I wanted to see the short-term results I got from this product, and I can assure you that I&#x27;m now a believer! Moroccan Oil is all it&#x27;s cracked up to be. I definitely have noticed an improvement in my previously dry and damaged hair. It&#x27;s noticably softer, shiner, and easier to manage. It takes a few minutes less time to dry and style, and as an added bonus, it smells great, too! The Moroccan Oil products aren&#x27;t cheap, but they are a worthwhile investment for sure, since I now have fewer split ends and am able to get hair cuts less often. Long story short, Moroccan Oil just themselves got another loyal customer!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair &amp; blow dry my hair straight every day. Not only does this shampoo &amp; conditioner help tame my hair without weighing it down, but it also leaves it smooth &amp; silky.  I also apply a few drops of the Moroccanoil oil treatment on towel dry hair.  I love the Moroccanoil hair products.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely great, my hair is wonderful and it smells great. My hair has never been better.  I received my products in less than 3 days.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the entire product line.  Leaves hair soft and shiny and I love the smell!</li>
            <li> I brought it for my daughter and she loves it. Leaves the hair shine, manageable, not frizzy and do not let the hair greasy like other the product I try with Moroccan oil. The smell is amazing... highly recommended!</li>
            <li> These products were recommended by my daughter who is a stylist. She is using them herself. Although a little expensive, it&#x27;s worth buying good quality products like these, I would say EXCELLENT! I&#x27;ve been using these products a little over a month and I have experienced a great change in my hair like; the texture, softness and shine. Their worth buying!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and i got ir super fast!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002DC78T4 Moroccanoil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner &amp; Treatment .85oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products both are great--and I love the smell!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these both to anyone with color treated hair, my hair was somewhat dry and looking brittle even though it wasn&#x27;t.  After the first use I could see the difference and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t weight down the hair, gives great shine.&lt;br /&gt;A sample of Moroccan oil was enclosed they are generous with that product (4).  It aids in drying hair and give beautiful luster. And the fragrance is wonderful and lasting!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been thinking of buying do so by all means!! the only complaint is that the bottles are such thick plastic hard to squeeze our the products.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil products are simply fantastic!!  I especially love the Moroccan oil you leave in your hair before blow drying.  Your hair will never look better!  I highly recommend all products by Moroccan oil!</li>
            <li> I love my Moroccanoil! I have gone from long to short hair and it works perfectly for both lengths.</li>
            <li> My favorite products! It smells so good.</li>
            <li> I like this product and I love the smell but I was not impressed with the way it arrived in the mail. Box was smashed and the seal of the conditioner was broken. When I opened the product, it had not been packed properly. Disappointed. I won&#x27;t make the mistake of buying this product online again.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair really soft, don&#x27;t use too much oil, keep it on the ends. Leave conditioner in for a few minutes and make sure you hair is really soaked before lathering shampoo in. Those little tips worked for me. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite set!  Leaves my hair feeling soft, clean and with light fragrant. Will order this set again.</li>
            <li> Very good product, my hair is silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing! Not fake or watered down like some hair products on Amazon that are a great price but not the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair soft and shiny without being limp or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Note if you&#x27;ve never used the Moroccan oil...a litle goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I love the lather and smell. I wish the conditioner were a little more moisterizing but when used with the oil, i feel like my hair is very shiny and soft and voluminous. Too soon to tell if it is better for the long term health of my hair. Expensive but my hair is need of some damage therapy so i thought it was worth the extra expense to try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive but the products are exactly what I needed for my frizzy dry curls. Would reccommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> I started using this product and noticed a big difference in my hair.  It became really soft and shiny.  Even my hairstylist noticed.  Although it is pricey, def worth every penny</li>
            <li> This is the best &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; for Moroccanoil. I love the shampoo and conditioner, but can&#x27;t afford to use it all the time. I use the oil treatment consistently, and it is great. I think that these are really good products.</li>
            <li> These product were purchased as gifts for our relatives in Brazil, before our trip there. They are quite expensive there. Both our daughter and daughter-in-law enjoyed them and were pleased.</li>
            <li> Love my moroccan oil, and especially love that all 3 products came in a combo pack.  Convenient and reasonably priced compared to buying each product individually.</li>
            <li> Great Product for anyone who has dry, frizzy, course hair.  It makes hair manageable, shinny, easier to dry in less time!</li>
            <li> I love the Moroccanoil products It makes my hair feel like I have just left the salon. It keeps my hair shiny, strong, and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I believe this shampoo and conditioner are not real. I have been using it and my hair did not feel great anymore I used my mother&#x27;s which she bought in a salon and wow my hair felt great again. I bought new shampoo and conditioner at hair salon yesterday and the two smell completely different. And my hair came out shiny again.</li>
            <li> I have long hair for a guy and this is the best shampoo and conditioner that I have ever used. Everything else either eaves my hair too oily or looking like a haystack. The hair oil is just the ticket for getting a nice healthy sheen and glow once my hair is clean. I have been using this brand for about three years now and can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the oil, but I&#x27;ve noticed that with the shampoo and conditioner my hair started to shed A LOT MORE! So unfortunately I have to stick with the styling products and not the shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> my iron etc is normal. next step is scalp biopsy . ..i have done the biotin. it does work. my hair does grows fine. ...thats not a problem for me. I&#x27;m growing weak fine hair with no elasticity, breaks off or falls out by the roots. spend more energy money into keeping my hair and the length. also thyroid is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moroccanoil hair product line is divine and &#x27;ITs a 10&#x27; is 2nd best on my 3c,4a,4b  hair texture&lt;br /&gt; compared to Amika, nexus, terax, photo, frederic fekkai, giovanni, joico, affirm, dudleys, shea moisture, Design essential etc. ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also use aloe vera leaf juice and lil bit of lime and black tea from distilled water mix carrot seed oil, rosemary oil,basil oil with Eqyss conditioner to moisturize but have to refrigerate after each use. to keep the aloe vera fresh.  seal with coconut, grape seed oil,  overnight.&lt;br /&gt;also invested in Kent combs (believe they are seamless smoother on the hair and durable. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;might be just bad DNA although my family has long thick hair on both sides. maybe i got the bad DNA. anyhow for my hair type its makes my hair feel and look better in conjunction with daily natural hair routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i alternate between 2x week between &#x27; Is A 10&#x27; AND Moroccan hydrate+repair system. only regret is. taking so long to try it along time ago. I LOVE line systems!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time. Exactly as described. I love the smell of the product. However, since I am new user i am not sure oh how fast it would make my hair grow. But i have seen it in many hair salons in the city so  I am assuming it should be good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the shampoo and conditioner but the actual oil leave in product is wonderful! The conditioner leaves my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel great!! Excellent product! The conditioner is a great moisturizer and left my hair feeling silky and smooth!</li>
