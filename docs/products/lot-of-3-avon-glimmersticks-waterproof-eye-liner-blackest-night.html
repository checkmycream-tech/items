            <li>Love the bundle</li>
            <li>I HAVE USED THIS AVON PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS.</li>
            <li>I WILL LOOK YOU UP WHEN ITS TIME TO BUY MORE.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>My favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Though applying eye shadow over top helps with the smudging to some extent.</li>
            <li>Wears well,and easy to apply</li>
            <li>This product rolls on easily and lasts a while; however, it is supposed to be waterproof</li>
            <li>Pretty embarrassing when you are at a special function!!</li>
            <li>Great for people who dislike the harshness of traditional eyeliner pencils.</li>
            <li>The color is spot on, and the formula goes on smooth and even, without any clumps.</li>
            <li>Overall good one for a price..</li>
            <li>These were priced right and came quickly.</li>
            <li>I apply on my lids and so within three or four hours, I will have to come back to line once more, yet, it is always a clean line and never smudges.  </li>
            <li>The product goes on easy, and the color is fine, however, the claim that it is waterproof or smudge proof is totally not the case.</li>
            <li>Soft and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>And it really is waterproof!</li>
            <li>Shipped really fast too!</li>
            <li>, I will never buy another eyeliner other than this kind.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Goes on so smoothly and has a very deep color that lasts (and stays put) all day!</li>
            <li>No complaint&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>I normally buy the cheapest eyeliner I can find</li>
            <li>Awesome combo of these eyeliners, dark black, don&#x27;t spread much un less</li>
            <li>must use makeup remover to take it off completely!</li>
            <li>Love Glimmersticks, the black waterproof!!</li>
            <li>Soft enough not to hurt, but really sticks!  </li>

            <li> Love Glimmersticks, the black waterproof!!</li>
            <li> Soft enough not to hurt, but really sticks!  </li>
            <li> Though It doesn&#x27;t dry, so if you have oilier skin that tends to smudge makeup, this will end up leaving smudges everywhere especially if you rub your eyes in the slightest, even if you use eye shadow primer.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to arrive but was not in a hurry for them, not a problem.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long</li>
            <li> Stays on for a long time, depending on how you apply it.  </li>
            <li> I literally have to take a tissue to get rid of the black mess under my eyes (which wipes off my other makeup).</li>
            <li> and I still find black under my eyes at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> STOCK UP FOR A FEW MONTHS -</li>
            <li> Bought these to stock up as it is very difficult to reliably go to the store to get Black eyeliner that is waterproof or meet with my Avon lady to get this eye liner in particular.  </li>
            <li> ( I also usually prefer the stick you sharpen as opposed to the ones you twist, like these)</li>
            <li> Hard to find anywhere as Avon is out.</li>
            <li> but I decided I was tired of my eyeliner running for no reason</li>
            <li> As I paid for the shipping for three I am disappointed.</li>

            <li> Wears well,and easy to apply</li>
            <li> Took a long time to arrive but was not in a hurry for them, not a problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this years ago from an Avon rep.  The product goes on easy, and the color is fine, however, the claim that it is waterproof or smudge proof is totally not the case. After an hour or two of wearing this, I have racoon eyes.  I literally have to take a tissue to get rid of the black mess under my eyes (which wipes off my other makeup). Pretty embarrassing when you are at a special function!! I&#x27;ll be searching for another eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner ever. I hope they never stop making it! It lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Wonderful girt. Love the bundle</li>
            <li> I love these eyeliners!!!! So glad they came in a set of 3!</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS AVON PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS. THIS IS THE ONLY EYELINER THAT WORKS FOR ME. IT DOES NOT IRRATATE MY EYES.</li>
            <li> no this was falsly advertised i only received one not three which is what I paid for.  As I paid for the shipping for three I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> GRETA COLORS AND GREAT PRODUCT - LOVE THE COLORS.  I ALWAYS STOCK UP FOR A FEW MONTHS - BUT I KOW I WILL LOOK YOU UP WHEN ITS TIME TO BUY MORE.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner. Soft enough not to hurt, but really sticks!  Hard to find anywhere as Avon is out. These were priced right and came quickly.</li>
            <li> Goes on so smoothly and has a very deep color that lasts (and stays put) all day! I only use it on my upper lids above my eyelash line. When I go out after work, I do the quickest touch-up, but it&#x27;s not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;You must use makeup remover to take it off completely! If you don&#x27;t like using makeup remover, then don&#x27;t try this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! I normally buy the cheapest eyeliner I can find but I decided I was tired of my eyeliner running for no reason so I decided to try this stuff ( I also usually prefer the stick you sharpen as opposed to the ones you twist, like these) but oh man I love this stuff!! It lasts all day and it doesn&#x27;t run for no reason! And it really is waterproof!</li>
            <li> Soft and easy to apply. Great for people who dislike the harshness of traditional eyeliner pencils. Though It doesn&#x27;t dry, so if you have oilier skin that tends to smudge makeup, this will end up leaving smudges everywhere especially if you rub your eyes in the slightest, even if you use eye shadow primer.

            <li> Love Glimmersticks, the black waterproof!! I have been using for years and nothing compares!! Shipped really fast too!</li>
            <li> This product rolls on easily and lasts a while; however, it is supposed to be waterproof and I still find black under my eyes at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Awesome combo of these eyeliners, dark black, don&#x27;t spread much un less u sleep wearing them, not 100% water proof. Overall good one for a price..I am very satisfied buying them</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are my favorites. They last all day and they do not run.  I also like the fact that I do not have to sharpen a pencil; I just turn the pencil and its good to go.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and inexpensive too</li>
            <li> Best eyeline I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Love this! The color is spot on, and the formula goes on smooth and even, without any clumps. It lasts all day long and I never have to reapply. Awesome!</li>
            <li> love these! They last all day and they&#x27;re waterproof. my eyes tend to water a lot and it stays on even through that, I will never buy another eyeliner other than this kind. No complaint&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner and excellent price.</li>
            <li> My favorite eye liners by far...highly recommended!</li>
