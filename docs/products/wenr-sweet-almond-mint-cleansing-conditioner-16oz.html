            <li>I wish I could have seen my own face because I&#x27;m sure it was a hilarious combination of impending doom and hysteria</li>
            <li>this is my favorite one.</li>
            <li>I have already ordered more.</li>
            <li>bought this on  another web site love this product will purchase again.</li>
            <li>My mom ordered Wen and despite my refusing to use it, I gave it a shot and fell in love.</li>
            <li>Love all of the products.  </li>
            <li>The styling crème is also phenomenal.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>

            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I LOVE WEN.</li>
            <li>I really love this product</li>
            <li>I am so glad I can get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am not losing a handful of hair with every shampooing any more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using Wen (S.A.M.) for 3 years and love it.</li>
            <li>Most comments come from men.</li>
            <li>Now all I use is Wen with a much better outcome.</li>
            <li>Just love this Wen Sweeet Almond Mint cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>when i brought wen shampoo a couple of years ago , i loved it, i have very curly hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I like the product, but after a couple of consecutive uses my hair was full of static.</li>
            <li>, i use more like a really full conditioner</li>
            <li>I have used it for 6 months, I love it but make sure and compare ingredients, there are many fakes on the market that do not work as well as the real produces</li>
            <li>Quick delivery!</li>
            <li>I really love this product and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>My  hair is shinier, healthier, and feels fantastic.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great when your hair and scalp need a break from regular shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>It is so great to have your shampoo and conditioner in one&lt;br /&gt;item, especially when you travel.  </li>
            <li>for full and heavy hair; AWESOME!</li>
            <li>I ordered this product thinking that it had the original Wen formula; however, upon receiving my package I learned that this was a counterfeit of the original Wen.</li>
            <li>This is the original WEN.  </li>
            <li>My hair doesnt feel clean.</li>
            <li>The Sweet Almond Mint smells so clean....</li>
            <li>ive been receiving WEN through Amazon for several years and have always received a good product.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with how my hair looks</li>
            <li>After I shower I use one pump&#x27;s worth of the product (as well as some argon oil) and apply it to the ends.</li>
            <li>get it for special occasion as I can not pay that much for every day&#x27;s use</li>
            <li>I did not even attempt to use it because I am not going to pay full price for something that is claiming to be the real Wen when in fact it is not and could potentially cause more damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>It takes more pumps to have that same WEN feel on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Really does what it claims!</li>
            <li>my hair is fine and tends to be less oily than most people.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>Out of the ones I have tried I would have to say this is my second favorite.</li>
            <li>I noticed after the first use that my hair seems easier manage and healthier.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Not like teenage zits more like large, sore, boils, on my face.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel nice and soft but by the 2nd day after wash</li>
            <li>Great product as all wen products I have used like no other shampoo you have used wont go back to regular shampoo</li>
            <li>The mint products of Wen are also great for people with scalp issues, i.e. itching, flaking, psoriasis as the mint which is actually menthol sooths and cools the scalp down.</li>
            <li>The first time I rinsed, I could feel that &#x27;squeak clean&#x27; that you would only get when using a shampoo without conditioner.</li>
            <li>she loves it so much.</li>
            <li>I use about 10 pumps and really work it through my hair.</li>
            <li>Did not use as much as recommended.</li>
            <li>Absolute one of my favorites</li>
            <li>Much softer and healthier.</li>
            <li>However, to my surprise, my hair dried smooth and tangle free and it actually felt amazingly clean.</li>
            <li>I have used WEN in the past and didn&#x27;t think I liked it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been able to reduce my hair washing from every day to every third day, which is something I never thought was possible.</li>
            <li>But my hair is not dry and frizzy, and not conditioner oily or heavy, My hair is clean and healthy and natural looking.</li>
            <li>If you were to classify hair as dry/normal/oily, I would say mine is normal and</li>
            <li>and it calm it down and was so soft right away</li>
            <li>I usually do not care about shampoo.</li>
            <li>The first one I ordered didn&#x27;t come with a pump, but the second one did.</li>
            <li>My nine year old daughter could sell you on this</li>
            <li>Hair is soft, not greasy.</li>
            <li>and i put on my hear a 20 minutes, make my hair so soft</li>
            <li>My hair has life again and I am 66 years old.</li>
            <li>The texture and condition of my hair has completely changed.</li>
            <li>I do not use it as directed, I use regular shampoo and conditioner and then use this as a leave in since it costs so much BUT</li>
            <li>The first three ingredients contain alcohol which is known to dry out your hair.</li>
            <li>If the price was normal I would only buy this</li>
            <li>I have used it several times now and all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>makes my hair too oily too quick because I usually wash my hair every 3 days now</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous about trying WEN because I have fine hair and always thought it would weigh it down and make it look greasy.</li>
            <li>I think it really just comes down to what hair type you have.  </li>

            <li> I was a little nervous about trying WEN because I have fine hair and always thought it would weigh it down and make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> I think it really just comes down to what hair type you have.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, dry, wavy/curly, very frizzy hair that gets very oily at the roots, for which I have to wash my hair every day, only perpetuating the drying out of my ends.</li>
            <li> Because I have long hair and have to use so much,  I only use it about once a week</li>
            <li> This helps to tame my hair and makes it so soft.</li>
            <li> Although my hair is thin, it has tons of body and volume and you&#x27;d never know how thin it actually is without touching it.</li>
            <li> and I try to use as little as possible when washing !</li>
            <li> It was a bit weird at first because even with the use of sulfate-free shampoos, I was used to SOME amount of sudsing.</li>
            <li> wish it came in a larger size :-/</li>
            <li> but I am not willing to do the auto-ship system.</li>
            <li> I have tried other shampoos without sulfates, etc.</li>
            <li> but this time it left my hair greasy and dull</li>
            <li> After leaving the beauty supply store, pre Wen, I would spend at least 75.00-80.00 on shampoo, conditioner, detanglers, weekly deep conditioners and products to make hair shinier.</li>
            <li> Wish it would come down it</li>
            <li> It falls out less</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have to wonder how old it is or if it&#x27;s been siting in a cold warehouse for too long.</li>
            <li> All those products made my hair dull and heavy.</li>
            <li> bad old stuff get rid of it</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling dirty and looked greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li> (that feeling is no good for frizzy hair).</li>
            <li> no good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why some think Wen is so expensive.</li>
            <li> but everything just makes my hair insanely greasy looking or flat to my skull.</li>
            <li> I hate how expensive it is</li>
            <li> and all of them were very disappointing.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Wen user for 2 years! My nine year old daughter could sell you on this she loves it so much. this is my favorite one. my hair feels and smells amazing because of this stuff. you have to follow directions to get results.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product! I was a little nervous about trying WEN because I have fine hair and always thought it would weigh it down and make it look greasy. I have used it several times now and all I can say is WOW! I have already ordered more.</li>
            <li> bought this on  another web site love this product will purchase again. have to spread through hair to work well allow to set. then rinse.</li>
            <li> I have had hair care nightmares beyond belief. I have thin, dry, wavy/curly, very frizzy hair that gets very oily at the roots, for which I have to wash my hair every day, only perpetuating the drying out of my ends. Although my hair is thin, it has tons of body and volume and you&#x27;d never know how thin it actually is without touching it. I have used EVERYTHING under the sun to control frizz while keeping the body of my hair but everything just makes my hair insanely greasy looking or flat to my skull. My mom ordered Wen and despite my refusing to use it, I gave it a shot and fell in love. It was a bit weird at first because even with the use of sulfate-free shampoos, I was used to SOME amount of sudsing. I use about 10 pumps and really work it through my hair. The first time I rinsed, I could feel that &#x27;squeak clean&#x27; that you would only get when using a shampoo without conditioner. I wish I could have seen my own face because I&#x27;m sure it was a hilarious combination of impending doom and hysteria (that feeling is no good for frizzy hair). However, to my surprise, my hair dried smooth and tangle free and it actually felt amazingly clean. I&#x27;ve also been able to reduce my hair washing from every day to every third day, which is something I never thought was possible. I really love this product and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have used WEN in the past and didn&#x27;t think I liked it.  Now I am using WEN every time I wash my hair and it is so completely different. My  hair is shinier, healthier, and feels fantastic.  I will never use anything else.  Love all of the products.  The styling crème is also phenomenal.</li>
            <li> ive been receiving WEN through Amazon for several years and have always received a good product. This shipment does not seem to work as well going on my hair.  It takes more pumps to have that same WEN feel on my hair.  I have to wonder how old it is or if it&#x27;s been siting in a cold warehouse for too long.</li>
            <li> It works for me and I love it</li>
            <li> I use this all the time and I also use it on my one year olds son&#x27;s hair which is curly.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but after a couple of consecutive uses my hair was full of static.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 3 years now &amp; it&#x27;s taken 10 yrs off my hair.  The key to using WEN is to wash with a sudsing shampoo every 7 or 8 days to prevent hair from getting &amp;#34;too conditioned&amp;#34;.  Would have given 5 stars except that this time is was delievered without a pump which has been a pain in the butt.</li>
            <li> love love love this product,  does great on my locs. wonderful conditioneer, cleanser and body wash... sweet almond mint is my fav!!</li>
            <li> Love this cleansing conditioner.  Great service, thank you!</li>
            <li> Did not use as much as recommended. Have short hair, used two pumps.  Hair is soft, not greasy. Will keep using.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, i use more like a really full conditioner and i put on my hear a 20 minutes, make my hair so soft</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Really does what it claims! Love my hair!  I have used this product for two years and have been completely happy with it!  I can recommend it with total confidence!</li>
            <li> Did not like the product at all!! It left my hair feeling dirty and looked greasy. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I chose 5 stars because I believe this is a great product.  I think it makes my hair thicker and it gets me away from shampoos with chemicals.  I recommend Wen.</li>
            <li> when i brought wen shampoo a couple of years ago , i loved it, i have very curly hair and it calm it down and was so soft right away, it was awesome but this time it left my hair greasy and dull, i used it the same way i did last time but it didnt work the same way, i dont know why but i wont buy it again, thank you for listening</li>
            <li> I ordered this product thinking that it had the original Wen formula; however, upon receiving my package I learned that this was a counterfeit of the original Wen. The first three ingredients contain alcohol which is known to dry out your hair. I did not even attempt to use it because I am not going to pay full price for something that is claiming to be the real Wen when in fact it is not and could potentially cause more damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s so easy to use and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;Just wish it came in a larger size :-/</li>
            <li> Great product as all wen products I have used like no other shampoo you have used wont go back to regular shampoo</li>
            <li> Doesnt work for me. My hair doesnt feel clean.</li>
            <li> If the price was normal I would only buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could afford it because it is amazing. It leaves you hair so nice, shining, feels healthy, manageable, and so pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get it for special occasion as I can not pay that much for every day&#x27;s use</li>
            <li> Always a happy user of wen !</li>
            <li> Have not used shampoo in years...my hair is fine and tends to be less oily than most people.This gives my hair what it needs.</li>
            <li> I LOVE WEN. Makes my hair shiney. It falls out less and I never have split ends while using it. I hate how expensive it is and I try to use as little as possible when washing ! Wish it would come down it price bc I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product. comes with pump needed nozzle. Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I really love this product but I am not willing to do the auto-ship system. I am so glad I can get it through Amazon. My hair has life again and I am 66 years old. I am not losing a handful of hair with every shampooing any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use another shampoo. Used WEN for a while, then when I ran out, I switched to a knockoff brand. Never again will I make that mistake!  WEN IS AWESOME! I always get a lot of compliments on my hair when I use WEN on a regular basis. I am now a 100% WEN girl ;)  Not every scent is for every type of hair but this one works great for me.</li>
            <li> I got a good price on this product. The product arrived promptly and just as advertised.  Good service.</li>
            <li> bad old stuff get rid of it no good</li>
            <li> I did like what the product did for my hair.  But then, things changed drastically.  I started having severe acne breakouts.  Not like teenage zits more like large, sore, boils, on my face.  These are the kind that leave scars.  Discontinuing the product solved the problem.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Wen hair care products for over 6 months now. Overall I am very pleased with how my hair looks and I would not go back to regular shampoos and conditioners. Out of the ones I have tried I would have to say this is my second favorite. I think it really just comes down to what hair type you have.  If you were to classify hair as dry/normal/oily, I would say mine is normal and the one that works the best so far is the Cucumber Aloe.</li>
            <li> I noticed after the first use that my hair seems easier manage and healthier. Because I have long hair and have to use so much,  I only use it about once a week but it does make a difference! I will probably order again from Amazon when this bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> Love Wen!  Wish the gallon size would return and all the shippers were reliable.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I ordered. This is the original WEN.  I have been using it for a while and it&#x27;s great when your hair and scalp need a break from regular shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> for full and heavy hair; AWESOME!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel nice and soft but by the 2nd day after wash I have to wash again makes my hair too oily too quick because I usually wash my hair every 3 days now I have to wash every day. It smells good I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day.</li>
            <li> The Sweet Almond Mint smells so clean....I love it. I use this product as a leave in conditioner only. After I shower I use one pump&#x27;s worth of the product (as well as some argon oil) and apply it to the ends. This helps to tame my hair and makes it so soft.</li>
            <li> Absolute one of my favorites</li>
            <li> This product is the best. I usually do not care about shampoo. After receiving this as a gift, I am hooked. There is no foaming. It&#x27;s thick. But my hair is not dry and frizzy, and not conditioner oily or heavy, My hair is clean and healthy and natural looking. It&#x27;s a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen (S.A.M.) for 3 years and love it. I have long, thick hair. The texture and condition of my hair has completely changed. Much softer and healthier. I am 57 y/o and people tell me all the time that I have the hair of an 18 y/o. Most comments come from men. I need no conditioner or detanglers or leave-in treatments. All those products made my hair dull and heavy. I hi-light my hair and Wen keeps my hair in great condition. I have tried other shampoos without sulfates, etc. and all of them were very disappointing. I don&#x27;t understand why some think Wen is so expensive. After leaving the beauty supply store, pre Wen, I would spend at least 75.00-80.00 on shampoo, conditioner, detanglers, weekly deep conditioners and products to make hair shinier. Now all I use is Wen with a much better outcome. The mint products of Wen are also great for people with scalp issues, i.e. itching, flaking, psoriasis as the mint which is actually menthol sooths and cools the scalp down. I couldn&#x27;t be without my Wen and thank you Amazon for stocking this item. I have had NO problems with my Wen coming from Amazon. I am a Wen girl!</li>
            <li> MY girlfriend loves it, what can I say.</li>
            <li> The first one I ordered didn&#x27;t come with a pump, but the second one did.</li>
            <li> I am in swimming pools daily and this is the only product I have found that helps pull the Cl2 ou of my hair.  I do not use it as directed, I use regular shampoo and conditioner and then use this as a leave in since it costs so much BUT even just doing that I have seen a big difference.</li>
            <li> Best hair product i&#x27;ve had and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I have used it for 6 months, I love it but make sure and compare ingredients, there are many fakes on the market that do not work as well as the real produces</li>
            <li> Just love this Wen Sweeet Almond Mint cleansing conditioner.  It is so great to have your shampoo and conditioner in one&lt;br /&gt;item, especially when you travel.  It leaves my hair so manageable and shiny.</li>
