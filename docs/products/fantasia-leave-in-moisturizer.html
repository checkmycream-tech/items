            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I got this because my scalp barely itches anymore.</li>
            <li>but overall I think it&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
            <li>I put this in a applicator bottle, filled it to about 2 oz and added like 5 or 6 drops of peppermint drops to it, shook it up and applied it to my scalp.</li>

            <li>I have been using this product for at least 10 years, and continue to find it excellent.  </li>

            <li>Thank you Fantasia that your product isn&#x27;t a fairy-tale but the REAL Deal Holyfield!!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for allowing me to continue using this product and for Cosmetic Solutions for getting it here quick!</li>
            <li>This product makes his hair soft, shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It is a thin (almost watery) liquid that does a wonderful job of conditioning scalp without making hair greasy.</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s worth taking the gamble on.</li>
            <li>Im natural, but I use this product more when I had braid extensions</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I put this in my hair right after I finish washing it and before&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For about 15 years I used the product without Aloe but in the last few years I find the Aloe product works best for me.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it since the first couple of tries...will give it another shot soon and see what happens.</li>
            <li>The results are totally consistent - I can always count on how my hair will look.  </li>
            <li>I do love the regular Fantasia Leave in Treatment</li>
            <li>I love this product and will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li>It is great for dry scalp and repairs dry or damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I use their Tea Shampoo and may try their Pure Aloe Shampoo which is supposed to also help with adding/retaining moisture.</li>
            <li>I have been using IC moisturizer for 25 years and in all that time this is the only product upon which I can rely to give me just the texture I desire for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really care for this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way it feels on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It has the consistency of water; could be fragrant water in a bottle, I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t really have a scent.  </li>
            <li>I really like how this worked on my hair</li>
            <li>moisture very hydrating</li>
            <li>but this one really did increase the moisture in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a clear leave-in moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t leave a white film on my hair like most conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my hair, neither bad nor good, so it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>will NOT wash my hair Without IC. Combs out Instantly leaving  my hair light, soft &amp; manageable, no split ends, no frizz &amp; no build up.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend that if you have wavy hair that&#x27;s not out of control.</li>
            <li>I normally use the IC Leave in Hair Treatment which has been my go to leave in for years now.  </li>
            <li>According to the post office individual I talked to, this is becoming a much larger problem than in the past with many sellers of product.  </li>
            <li>She stated that many people will not complain to the seller, due to smaller cost differences than mine in some instances....</li>
            <li>My skin remains about 95% clear of psoriasis as a result of using this Fantasia Leave</li>
            <li>But when I do my hair is shining and soft.</li>
            <li>I saw this product being used by some one on you tube to set their hair as they transition from relaxed hair to natural hair.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never been able to grow it very long without it looking limp and stringy.</li>
            <li>I live half of the year in Florida and the sun is very drying.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle...makes your  hair soft and manageable all day.</li>
            <li>I LOVE using the product on my long thick, dry, curly hair!</li>

            <li> I LOVE using the product on my long thick, dry, curly hair!</li>
            <li> Even though I regularly use the more expensive shampoo&#x27;s &amp; conditioner&#x27;s, Washing my hair without applying this product after towel dry, means 45 to 60 minutes to comb out my hair and any comb stretches my hair in doing so.</li>
            <li> From the reviews, it seems I&#x27;m the only person that&#x27;s had trouble with it thus far, so</li>
            <li> OK, so maybe that&#x27;s a little dramatic.</li>
            <li> I had to pay the post office an extra $2.20, due to the seller not providing the correct postage.  </li>
            <li> It dries looking stringy, dry, split &amp; the ends of my hair brake</li>
            <li> This conditioner was recommended to me and I could not live without it.</li>
            <li> I truly need this product for my skin and use it as not only a hair product but also in the shower to cleanse my entire body, head to toe, then rinse as usual.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry</li>
            <li> This product I apply on wet hair and leave it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use this product because my hair is not curly and thick enough; it made my hair look oily.</li>
            <li> Left my hair a little stiff and dried out</li>
            <li> Will not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes it without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little scratch here or there, but</li>
            <li> I agree i wish it was a spray bottle because you can waste a lot of the product in the bottle...</li>
            <li> Lite oil to moisturize your hair everyday or before styling.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make it limp like some conditioners do.</li>
            <li> I recommend adding a few drops of peppermint oil to this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The other days I do a regimen of thick leave in conditioner followed by gel and hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have a dry, itchy, scalp and it gets worse when I have a sew in</li>
            <li> I live in a small town and once they stopped carrying this product I was very sad.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a product that is not tested on animals that works as well as this one does.</li>
            <li> In Hair and Scalp Treatment in place of common shampoos and liquid soaps.</li>
            <li> My experience is that you really can&#x27;t go wrong with any products in the IC line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to hear they have discontinued it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really disappointing...</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed to discover it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to find!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this along with my IC heat protectant, which I love, but didn&#x27;t notice anything exceptional. I haven&#x27;t used it since the first couple of tries...will give it another shot soon and see what happens.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for this product.  Left my hair a little stiff and dried out</li>
            <li> I think this a great product.  Gives moisture to my hair and is non-greasy.  I agree i wish it was a spray bottle because you can waste a lot of the product in the bottle...but overall I think it&#x27;s a great product.  I will be buying another bottle.  It also makes my hair easier to comb.</li>
            <li> Lite oil to moisturize your hair everyday or before styling. Will not weigh it down.Helps keep your hair healthy also.</li>
            <li> I have been using IC moisturizer for 25 years and in all that time this is the only product upon which I can rely to give me just the texture I desire for my fine hair.  The results are totally consistent - I can always count on how my hair will look.  Don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it, but it works for me.  Sally discontinued it and I am so glad I found it here on Amazon!  For about 15 years I used the product without Aloe but in the last few years I find the Aloe product works best for me.</li>
            <li> I like this...This is my second bottle...makes your  hair soft and manageable all day. Great for AA hair. 1 of my future staples!</li>
            <li> IC&#x27;s Fantasia leave-in moisturizing treatment is 100% effective. I&#x27;ve 4B type hair and I&#x27;d must admit that when I&#x27;d shampooed my hair 2x and didn&#x27;t condition and put this product in and picked it I&#x27;d was truly amazed that it was a struggle free process!!!  Before this product, I&#x27;d have to hold back tears or just cry, moan and groan because of the pain, and bear the scars of a swollen sore scalp!! Thank you Fantasia that your product isn&#x27;t a fairy-tale but the REAL Deal Holyfield!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 10 years, and continue to find it excellent.  Aphogee shampoo for damaged hair, Clairol conditioner (the one that comes with the hair color kit), and Fantasia leave in treatment - these 3 steps - is a winning combination!</li>
            <li> OK, so maybe that&#x27;s a little dramatic. But my hair is super fine and I&#x27;ve never been able to grow it very long without it looking limp and stringy. This conditioner was recommended to me and I could not live without it. It gives my hair a lot of body, it is healthy looking and feeling. There is no build-up. I could not be happier with this product. My hair even looks good after sleeping on it, and now it&#x27;s longer than it has been in years. I was buying it at Sally&#x27;s but they discontinued it, so I will be buying it here from now on.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I thought I would give this a try. After several uses (about 3 weeks) I didn&#x27;t see any changes in my skin or hair. Though I don&#x27;t doubt that this is a nice product, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Very good product! It was shipped very fast! Definitively, I&#x27;ll buy more!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried finding this product for years now.  I am so glad I checked Amazon. This product works right away to protect my relaxed hair from breakage!</li>
            <li> My stylist sold me some of this initially.  I really like the way it feels on my hair.  I wash my hair and put it up in a turban towel while applying my makeup.  Then I use this product before combing out.  I think it helps with combing out, too.  My only issue is with the packaging.  I transfer the product to a spray bottle because I find that easier to apply.  The product is watery and just pouring it into my hand to put on my hair didn&#x27;t work for me.  Even considering that, I give it five stars.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to find! Love the way it makes my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> He has curly hair that is out of control most of the time. This product makes his hair soft, shiny and healthy looking. It doesn&#x27;t make it limp like some conditioners do. This company does not test on animals and that was a big plus for us. It is hard to find a product that is not tested on animals that works as well as this one does. I couldn&#x27;t use this product because my hair is not curly and thick enough; it made my hair look oily. I do love the regular Fantasia Leave in Treatment and I highly recommend that if you have wavy hair that&#x27;s not out of control.</li>
            <li> I have used this off and on for years. It is a thin (almost watery) liquid that does a wonderful job of conditioning scalp without making hair greasy. Used to buy at Sally&#x27;s, but couldn&#x27;t find on store shelves anymore.</li>
            <li> love the scent, let me wait and see how good it will be to my hair</li>
            <li> The product itself is wonderful, but I have to note that shipping on this was a problem, as per extra costs.  I had to pay the post office an extra $2.20, due to the seller not providing the correct postage.  I have the receipt from the post office, as well as taking a picture of the difference noted on the package by the post office.  According to the post office individual I talked to, this is becoming a much larger problem than in the past with many sellers of product.  She stated that many people will not complain to the seller, due to smaller cost differences than mine in some instances....but I believe that this is an issue that should be addressed.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me except make my 3C hair stick together and harden. It has the consistency of water; could be fragrant water in a bottle, I really don&#x27;t know. It smells nice, though, so that&#x27;s a thing. I was excited to try this product, since this brand produces some incredible shine sprays. It&#x27;s really disappointing... From the reviews, it seems I&#x27;m the only person that&#x27;s had trouble with it thus far, so maybe it&#x27;s worth taking the gamble on. But I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this in years and it is still a great product.  I put this in my hair right after I finish washing it and before&lt;br /&gt;I put any oils on my scalp.  It&#x27;s still  I good product I just hope they don&#x27;t change the formula.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years but now the store where I use to buy it no longer carrys it.  For me it&#x27;s a great product.  Maybe because I have curly hair and I don&#x27;t have to rinse it out.  Also it doesn&#x27;t really have a scent.  Thanks Amazon for allowing me to continue using this product and for Cosmetic Solutions for getting it here quick!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Fantasia IC leave in hair moisturizer for many years.  There is Nothing else like it.. Even though I regularly use the more expensive shampoo&#x27;s &amp; conditioner&#x27;s, Washing my hair without applying this product after towel dry, means 45 to 60 minutes to comb out my hair and any comb stretches my hair in doing so. It dries looking stringy, dry, split &amp; the ends of my hair brake off.&lt;br /&gt;I will NOT wash my hair Without IC. Combs out Instantly leaving  my hair light, soft &amp; manageable, no split ends, no frizz &amp; no build up. This leave in Moisturizer feels like water on my hands, but works like a Miracle on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product , but Im protein sensitive which means I dont use it as often. But when I do my hair is shining and soft. Im natural, but I use this product more when I had braid extensions</li>
            <li> I saw this product being used by some one on you tube to set their hair as they transition from relaxed hair to natural hair.  I really like how this worked on my hair</li>
            <li> I originally heard about this moisturizer through YouTube and decided to give it a try. I have a dry, itchy, scalp and it gets worse when I have a sew in and I&#x27;ve been trying different products to see which one would relieve the itch. I&#x27;m so happy I got this because my scalp barely itches anymore. I would recommend putting this in an applicator bottle or spray bottle if you use it on your scalp during a sew in/braids. I put this in a applicator bottle, filled it to about 2 oz and added like 5 or 6 drops of peppermint drops to it, shook it up and applied it to my scalp. The cooling sensation from the peppermint oil feels so good on my scalp! The product alone with no peppermint oil works, but after 4 hours or so, my scalp began to itch. I recommend adding a few drops of peppermint oil to this moisturizer. Your hair will not itch for days. Maybe a little scratch here or there, but it&#x27;s worth it. I love this product and will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I LOVE using the product on my long thick, dry, curly hair! I live in a small town and once they stopped carrying this product I was very sad. Determined to find this product on Amazon.com........... Whhhaaallaa I was in luck finding a store front that carries it. My hair is very dry and if I do not use leave in conditioners&#x27;, my hair looks like a giant birds nest . This product I apply on wet hair and leave it. It is great for dry scalp and repairs dry or damaged hair. I use it once a week, therefore, the 12oz bottle should last me a month or two. The other days I do a regimen of thick leave in conditioner followed by gel and hairspray.</li>
            <li> moisture very hydrating luv luv luv</li>
            <li> Item received as described.</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition that is exacerbated by using shower gels, soaps, and shampoos that contain surfactants (chemicals that make bubbles/suds). I found this product, IC Moisturizer Treatment with Aloe, about 7 years ago and was buying it from Sally&#x27;s. I was quite disappointed to discover it was discontinued. I truly need this product for my skin and use it as not only a hair product but also in the shower to cleanse my entire body, head to toe, then rinse as usual. My skin remains about 95% clear of psoriasis as a result of using this Fantasia Leave In Hair and Scalp Treatment in place of common shampoos and liquid soaps. Am so relieved to have found another source for ordering this product. I was ordering it from Sally&#x27;s in case lots. Their loss.</li>
            <li> I normally use the IC Leave in Hair Treatment which has been my go to leave in for years now.  I bought this to help add more moisture to my hair and I loved it.  Both products give your hair super shine and gloss but this one really did increase the moisture in my hair.  I&#x27;m glad I decided to give it a try.  I will rotate them both in my hair care routine.  I use their Tea Shampoo and may try their Pure Aloe Shampoo which is supposed to also help with adding/retaining moisture. My experience is that you really can&#x27;t go wrong with any products in the IC line.</li>
            <li> I live half of the year in Florida and the sun is very drying. I use this product every day in my hair to keep the moisture in and to keep it healthy and shiny</li>
            <li> I love this product for my hair. It moisturizes it without weighing my hair down. I&#x27;m sad to hear they have discontinued it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my hair, neither bad nor good, so it&#x27;s okay. I was expecting great things.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I was looking for a clear leave-in moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t leave a white film on my hair like most conditioners.  This one does the trick.  Perfect for wash-n-goes!  No complaints here.</li>
            <li> i love fantasia products</li>
            <li> Great seller.  Great product.</li>
