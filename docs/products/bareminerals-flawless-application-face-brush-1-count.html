            <li>Works great, until the wires come out.</li>
            <li>Seller has this brush at a great price too.  </li>
            <li>Thought this was a good deal.  </li>
            <li>Good customer service.</li>
            <li>GONNA LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>While not my first face brush fom this company, I got a great deal on it and its handle is my favorite color!</li>
            <li>Nice product delivered in a timely manner :)</li>
            <li>Its size allows for easy travel in my purse cosmetics bag, too!</li>
            <li>Love this brush....</li>
            <li>Love the color :)</li>
            <li>Love it ...</li>
            <li>I use it mostly for my all over face color and radiances.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for loose powder.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;squatty\\&quot; handle makes application easy to control.</li>
            <li>The product was shipped very quickly and I received it within 4 days of purchasing it.</li>
            <li>Rare Ltd. Edition Bare Escentuals Flawless Face Brush is incredibly gorgeous and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a teal, I would say, than the BRIGHT turquoise blue.</li>
            <li>This brush is cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Exact same as my original at a fraction of price !!!!</li>
            <li>Its handle is small but the bristles are wonderful.</li>
            <li>The blue isn&#x27;t quite as bright as the picture shows.</li>
            <li>This is not the &amp;#34;full coverage&amp;#34; full size brush...</li>
            <li>It first it worked just fine</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft and it really provides good coverage.</li>
            <li>but it is still a pretty color!</li>
            <li>it is much smaller and more like the mineral vail application brush for a light coverage.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast, product just as in picture, and in original packaging.</li>
            <li>Still the fantastic quality I was expecting from this brush (which I had bought to replace one that is 6 years old!)</li>
            <li>:) I have had no issues with loose hairs from this brush as of yet and am thrilled overall with it.</li>
            <li>This brush is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more as my collection of BE make up increases.</li>
            <li>I was getting a good deal for &#x27;the real thing&#x27;, but these brushes are no better than what you would get for $2 at a Walgreens.</li>
            <li>I love my limited edition</li>
            <li>It is also a nice color if you like a little splash of color in your make-up box.</li>
            <li>Very versatile.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I love the whole bare Escentuals line, especially the make up.</li>
            <li>I have the exact same brush but the original that comes in the starter kit, and comparing this LE one to the original, the bristles were NOT soft at all, didn&#x27;t blend, barely applies any foundation!</li>
            <li>Love the teal color as well....adds a splash of color to the sea of black handled brushes I have.</li>
            <li>Brand new merchandise.</li>
            <li>This item is high quality and has a soft touch to your face when using it.</li>
            <li>it is very soft and gets the job done well.  </li>
            <li>Green color is \\&quot;fun\\&quot;, and the small length(4.5\\&quot;) fits great in my cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li>The brush was a litte smaller than I expected but is very soft and works well; it shipped to me very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be as soft as the bare minerals brush.</li>
            <li>Do not buy this brush if you are looking to get the quality of the real bare minerals/escentuals brushes.  </li>
            <li>Bare Essentials brush!</li>
            <li>I received this brush when I purchased my Bare Escentual cosmetic bag.  </li>
            <li>It is a legitimate Bare Escentuals brush (I worry I&#x27;ll get a knock off sometimes when I order online)</li>
            <li>It has all the quality of Bare Escentuals brushes.  </li>
            <li>It is the bare essentials brush</li>

            <li> Bare Essentials brush!</li>

            <li> It is a legitimate Bare Escentuals brush (I worry I&#x27;ll get a knock off sometimes when I order online)</li>
            <li> It has all the quality of Bare Escentuals brushes.  </li>
            <li> It is the bare essentials brush</li>
            <li> I am currently using it with my Tranlsucent Mineral Veil loose powder.</li>
            <li> Good make-up brush for power or base or whatever.  </li>
            <li> I kept it, not worth the effort to take back.</li>
            <li> but it is still &#x27;rough&#x27; in application.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected !</li>
            <li> What a let down.</li>
            <li> I believe that is the secret for proper application.</li>
            <li> The bristles keep falling out and it feels harsh against skin.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are rough, and the applications is not good.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item as a stocking stuffer for my mother who is obsessed with Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a small brush.</li>
            <li> But the brush hairs are really hard.  </li>
            <li> (I was worried like the previous review it may be fake)</li>
            <li> The seller failed to mention the fact that this is a blush brush, not designed for an all-over mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> I am planning to try mineral makeup base for the 1st time that I ordered from Amazon as soon as it gets here so this item will get used a lot.</li>

            <li> I received this brush when I purchased my Bare Escentual cosmetic bag.  This brush works great with my powder foundation, powder bronzer, or just to blend. The \\&quot;squatty\\&quot; handle makes application easy to control. Green color is \\&quot;fun\\&quot;, and the small length(4.5\\&quot;) fits great in my cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> This item is high quality and has a soft touch to your face when using it. It&#x27;s perfect for loose powder. I am planning to try mineral makeup base for the 1st time that I ordered from Amazon as soon as it gets here so this item will get used a lot. Hope this is helpful.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a stocking stuffer for my mother who is obsessed with Bare Minerals. It has the \\&quot;i.d. bareminerals\\&quot; brand on it. (I was worried like the previous review it may be fake) The blue isn&#x27;t quite as bright as the picture shows. It&#x27;s more of a teal, I would say, than the BRIGHT turquoise blue. but it is still a pretty color! MOM&#x27;S GONNA LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> What a let down. I thought this would be as soft as the bare minerals brush. I believe that is the secret for proper application. The brush is on the coarse side. I even bought conditioning brush cleaner but it is still &#x27;rough&#x27; in application. The seller failed to mention the fact that this is a blush brush, not designed for an all-over mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> Love this brush....it is very soft and gets the job done well.  Great brush for a great price! Love the teal color as well....adds a splash of color to the sea of black handled brushes I have.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, product just as in picture, and in original packaging. Still the fantastic quality I was expecting from this brush (which I had bought to replace one that is 6 years old!)</li>
            <li> Works great, until the wires come out. then your left with access on your shirt. no bueno</li>
            <li> The picture makes this brush look bigger than it is.  It&#x27;s just a small brush. I am looking for a big poofed out one.  I kept it, not worth the effort to take back.</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly as described. It is a legitimate Bare Escentuals brush (I worry I&#x27;ll get a knock off sometimes when I order online) Love the color :)</li>
            <li> I love the whole bare Escentuals line, especially the make up. Their application brushes are some of the best. The product was shipped very quickly and I received it within 4 days of purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Nice product delivered in a timely manner :)</li>
            <li> Just as I expected ! Love it ... Exact same as my original at a fraction of price !!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great BE brush!  Very versatile.  I use it mostly for my all over face color and radiances.  Applies the product beautifully and evenly.  Seller has this brush at a great price too.  Will definitely be ordering more as my collection of BE make up increases.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and it really provides good coverage.</li>
            <li> This brush is cheaply made.  The bristles keep falling out and it feels harsh against skin.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This Rare Ltd. Edition Bare Escentuals Flawless Face Brush is incredibly gorgeous and soft. I am currently using it with my Tranlsucent Mineral Veil loose powder. While not my first face brush fom this company, I got a great deal on it and its handle is my favorite color! :) I have had no issues with loose hairs from this brush as of yet and am thrilled overall with it. Its size allows for easy travel in my purse cosmetics bag, too!</li>
            <li> It has all the quality of Bare Escentuals brushes.  Good make-up brush for power or base or whatever.  It is also a nice color if you like a little splash of color in your make-up box.</li>
            <li> Thought this was a good deal.  But the brush hairs are really hard.  This is not a quality brush and I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great brush, just what I needed!</li>
            <li> This brush is really awesome. I bought it for some upcoming travel. It&#x27;s totally going to act as my mineral foundation, blush and bronzer applicator during a two week trip to Europe. Its handle is small but the bristles are wonderful. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The brush was a litte smaller than I expected but is very soft and works well; it shipped to me very quickly.  If nothing else, I&#x27;ll keep it in my travel make up bag.</li>
            <li> Brand new merchandise. Wrapped and everything. Very happy customer. I love my limited edition Bare Essentials brush! Good customer service.</li>
            <li> It first it worked just fine but now after several uses, they fibers come out onto my face. So do I already have to buy another one??</li>
            <li> Do not buy this brush if you are looking to get the quality of the real bare minerals/escentuals brushes.  This is a knock off.  The bristles are rough, and the applications is not good.  I bought this thinking I was getting a good deal for &#x27;the real thing&#x27;, but these brushes are no better than what you would get for $2 at a Walgreens.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful makeup brush! It is the bare essentials brush and I paid a lower price when I bought it then I could get from the company.</li>
            <li> I have the exact same brush but the original that comes in the starter kit, and comparing this LE one to the original, the bristles were NOT soft at all, didn&#x27;t blend, barely applies any foundation!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this brush</li>
            <li> This is not the &amp;#34;full coverage&amp;#34; full size brush...it is much smaller and more like the mineral vail application brush for a light coverage.</li>
