    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I find it to work fairly well ..</li>
            <li>Also, the Air Cutter is louder in noise than most hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>I would give it a prize for the most unuseful thing you could ever buy :))</li>
            <li>I,m satisfied having purchasd it .Been</li>
            <li>I think it may work on a toddler with wispy fine hair.</li>
            <li>After not seeing results I opened the cut hair storage receptical to observe a fine powder of my hair clippings.  </li>
            <li>Cheap construction.</li>
            <li>I was excited for the arrival of this item.  </li>
            <li>Directions advised of clean hair and with conditioner, no dice still.  </li>
            <li>Thought this would be cool design,</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work worth a damn .</li>
            <li>I have used a Flobee and a robo cutter with the vacuum cleaner attached and find this the most convenient cutter available.</li>
            <li>Has no vacuum, the Aircut is far superior, read the testimonials on their website.</li>
            <li>For best results, hair must have been recently shampood and thoroughly dried without conditioner.</li>
            <li>The customer reviews will hold much more weight with me in the future because of the lack of purpose this product holds.  </li>
            <li>It works exactly as advertized.</li>
            <li>Only for waking up the neighbors :).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be interested to hear what others thought.</li>
            <li>I was really disapointed at this one.</li>
            <li>very noisy.</li>
            <li>The main problem is a lack of suction.</li>
            <li>Seeing there were more positive reviews than negative</li>
            <li>all in one, no need to drag out the vacuum any more.</li>
            <li>The one star is for the vender.the delivery was far ahead of time and the return policy was what Amazon advised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The AIRCUTTER is a complete piece of junk.</li>
            <li>If you have baby fine hair this product might, maybe, work for you; otherwise, buy a flowbee and a vacuum that&#x27;s not too loud or heavy.</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your time or money, does not cut and does not vacuum.  </li>
            <li>I think there was some kind of mix up in the shipping room, the packaging suggested this was a preveously returned unit because the adapter bags were not taped closed and the wire on the transformer electrical supply did not have the usual wire keeper around it, also the manufacturers box was taped closed roughly with clear tape.&lt;br</li>

            <li> the vacuum is weak and does not pull the hair up well enough to get an even cut, also it is so cheaply made that if you dropped it or wasn&#x27;t extremely careful cleaning the screen it would be history.  </li>
            <li> This machine states it has a powerful vacuum and several sharp cutting teeth that whisk away hair.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Blower/vacuum not strong enough.</li>
            <li> Little suction and only cut less than a centimeter of hair.  </li>
            <li> does not have enough vacum power,the inserts for the lenth of hair to be cut are hard to remove.</li>
            <li> It is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> My opinion: This unit is a little over priced.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product is a complete bust!  </li>
            <li> Cuts very small amounts at a time, so it takes a long time for longer hair.</li>
            <li> In reality, I spent about 30 minutes roving the Air Cutter up and down the side of my head using the larger hair cutting tool.  </li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I gave this product a chance despite the bad reviews because I really wanted it to work!  </li>
            <li> I purchased another hoping I just got a bad one the first time</li>
            <li> At least not for me.</li>
            <li> Yup, might work well for someone with only one or two hairs needing cutting.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on thick, course hair.</li>
            <li> and so I would have parts on hand if the second one went bad.  </li>
            <li> Now it might be because I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, hardly any suction, a total miss.</li>
            <li> I apply a leave-in conditioner after cutting.</li>
            <li> this is useless will not cut anything !</li>
            <li> WORST PRODUCT EVER......</li>
            <li> I guarantee this is the worst product ever.</li>
            <li> Horrible item, it does have suction but does nothing.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible, it is a rip off of the Aircut.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is definatley not what I had hoped for!  Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this for the following reasons:  the vacuum is weak and does not pull the hair up well enough to get an even cut, also it is so cheaply made that if you dropped it or wasn&#x27;t extremely careful cleaning the screen it would be history.  In my opinion it is a gimmic item!</li>
            <li> Hubcap says&lt;br /&gt;  I was really disapointed at this one. Seeing there were more positive reviews than negative I ordered one. When I received it it would not cut hair, the cutter mechanism did not function properly.I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;  The one star is for the vender.the delivery was far ahead of time and the return policy was what Amazon advised.&lt;br /&gt;  I think there was some kind of mix up in the shipping room, the packaging suggested this was a preveously returned unit because the adapter bags were not taped closed and the wire on the transformer electrical supply did not have the usual wire keeper around it, also the manufacturers box was taped closed roughly with clear tape.&lt;br /&gt;  My opinion: This unit is a little over priced.</li>
            <li> does not have enough vacum power,the inserts for the lenth of hair to be cut are hard to remove. very noisy.</li>
            <li> I was excited for the arrival of this item.  Unboxed it, had the missus plug it up and try it out on me.  Very disappointed, hardly any suction, a total miss. Directions advised of clean hair and with conditioner, no dice still.  I think it may work on a toddler with wispy fine hair.</li>
            <li> WORST PRODUCT EVER......I bought the Air Cutter from reading the engineering, design, and sales literature; which was the mistake.  The customer reviews will hold much more weight with me in the future because of the lack of purpose this product holds.  This machine states it has a powerful vacuum and several sharp cutting teeth that whisk away hair.  In reality, I spent about 30 minutes roving the Air Cutter up and down the side of my head using the larger hair cutting tool.  After not seeing results I opened the cut hair storage receptical to observe a fine powder of my hair clippings.  The machine did not cut my hair.  I couldn&#x27;t feel my hair being cut at all.  Also, the Air Cutter is louder in noise than most hair dryers.  Thus, perhaps the purpose of this machine is to simply make noise.  I guarantee this is the worst product ever.</li>
            <li> I have used a Flobee and a robo cutter with the vacuum cleaner attached and find this the most convenient cutter available. It works exactly as advertized. For best results, hair must have been recently shampood and thoroughly dried without conditioner. I apply a leave-in conditioner after cutting. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work worth a damn . Nuff said!!</li>
            <li> This thing does not cut hair. It does not do anything that they advertised. I would give it a prize for the most unuseful thing you could ever buy :))- you cannot use it for anything. Only for waking up the neighbors :).</li>
            <li> Horrible item, it does have suction but does nothing.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  Does not work.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product zero stars (because that is what it deserves) but I could not.  Like another reviewer, I gave this product a chance despite the bad reviews because I really wanted it to work!  Little suction and only cut less than a centimeter of hair.  Must be something in the design.  I don&#x27;t know but it DOES NOT WORK.  At least not for me. I tried several times and read the directions over and over...I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Did not have enough power to do the job.  It is not worth the money. I tried it once and threw it in the garbage.  What a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> The cutters quit working after 4 haircuts. Cheap construction. I purchased another hoping I just got a bad one the first time and so I would have parts on hand if the second one went bad.  Same experience with the second one. Junk.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible, it is a rip off of the Aircut. I know, our family owns both. The AIRCUTTER is a complete piece of junk. Has no vacuum, the Aircut is far superior, read the testimonials on their website.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve cut my son&#x27;s hair with scissors and a flowbee for ten years.  Thought this would be cool design, all in one, no need to drag out the vacuum any more. Unfortunately this product is a complete bust!  The main problem is a lack of suction. It could not even come close to doing the job. If you have baby fine hair this product might, maybe, work for you; otherwise, buy a flowbee and a vacuum that&#x27;s not too loud or heavy.</li>
            <li> As noticed by others, this product is a total ripoff. NO SUCTION AT ALL!! Yup, might work well for someone with only one or two hairs needing cutting. Boy, what was I thinking that day?</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on thick, course hair. Blower/vacuum not strong enough. Cuts very small amounts at a time, so it takes a long time for longer hair.</li>
            <li> I find it to work fairly well .. I,m satisfied having purchasd it .Been using it for well over a year .</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I was hoping but for the price can&#x27;t complain. Changed it to a 1 star after buying the flowbee and seen what it was suppose to do!!</li>
            <li> I used all different guards but none of them cut my hair.  Now it might be because I have very thick hair so others may like this product.  I&#x27;m just sayin it didn&#x27;t cut mine.  I&#x27;d be interested to hear what others thought.</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your time or money, does not cut and does not vacuum.  Wish I would have read review before ordering!!!</li>
            <li> this is useless will not cut anything ! total scam !</li>
