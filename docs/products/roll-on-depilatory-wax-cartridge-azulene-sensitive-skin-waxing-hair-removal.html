            <li>but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Roller doesn&#x27;t work good.  </li>
            <li>thing good about it is the convenience of rolling.</li>

            <li>Very nice and easy to use wax.</li>
            <li>This worked great on my skin with a light dusting of powder and paper strips.</li>
            <li>Pleasant and comparably easy to apply and take off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cheap and the quality is good.</li>
            <li>very gentle on the skin and very effective in removing even short hair!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li>Much more cleaner than using one of those tub-like waxes and wax warmers, but won&#x27;t get rid of more stubborn hair.</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>Ok for waxing at home</li>
            <li>So, I love it.</li>
            <li>This is probably my most preferite type of wax.</li>
            <li>I have used many types of wax bfr</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin so soft and take all the hair out!!!</li>
            <li>Gentle and soft, it doesn&#x27;t hurt when you take it off from the skin</li>
            <li>Previously whenever i waxed i would have smooth skin.</li>
            <li>It left dark patches on my skin after use, and within a week, my skin was more tanned than it ever was.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It says for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Even when i used it at very low temperatures, this wax left my skin burned and hurting for the coming 1 week, which is very unusual for a wax.</li>
            <li>I am still looking for a new one because the one that I bought left the wax too cool and not easy to apply.</li>

            <li> i bought the sensitive skin formula because I know that I&#x27;ve had previous reactions at salons, but this still leaves my skin pink and red for days!!!</li>
            <li> I liked it except if its not heated properly, it clings to your skin and difficult to remove !!</li>
            <li> bad thing I can say is that you need to make sure that you get a wax warmer that heats up to the proper temperature.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, dark hair.  </li>
            <li> My wife of course needed this to go along with the Belle Pink Depilatory Roll on Wax Heater</li>
            <li> I got dark patches on my skin after I waxed from this and the marks are not going.</li>
            <li> and they are too dark and noticeable.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for thick, course hair.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Too sticky, not easy to use</li>
            <li> Too thick, even after heating, threw it away.</li>
            <li> Wax is too thick.  </li>
            <li> This time was very thick</li>
            <li> not happy with this product</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, poor quality.</li>
            <li> Overall very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with this product!</li>
            <li> , i had a very tough time getting rid of this.</li>
            <li> so bad it is like gum !!</li>
            <li> Worst things ever.  </li>
            <li> They are just horrible.</li>
            <li> and this is the worst.</li>

            <li> I use this cartrige along with the Triple Roll On Depilatory Electric Wax Heater Warmer and I love it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue buying it... leaves my skin so soft and take all the hair out!!!</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, dark hair.  This worked great on my skin with a light dusting of powder and paper strips.</li>
            <li> This wax is awesome. I bought it to use at home but my wax lady uses it all the time. I have sensitive skin so this wax helps.&lt;br /&gt;Only bad thing I can say is that you need to make sure that you get a wax warmer that heats up to the proper temperature. I am still looking for a new one because the one that I bought left the wax too cool and not easy to apply.</li>

            <li> I took one month before I review this product. I got dark patches on my skin after I waxed from this and the marks are not going. I thought they would fade way but it&#x27;s been 1 month but the marks are still there and they are too dark and noticeable. Will never use this product again.</li>
            <li> Works well. Just need advice on clean up!</li>
            <li> not happy with this product</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with this product! What a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> so bad it is like gum !!</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect</li>
            <li> On time good product! As the description everything ok!</li>

            <li> This is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Worst things ever.  Roller doesn&#x27;t work good.  Wax is too thick.  They are just horrible.</li>
            <li> This time was very thick</li>
            <li> This is probably my most preferite type of wax. Gentle and soft, it doesn&#x27;t hurt when you take it off from the skin</li>
            <li> I have used many types of wax bfr and this is the worst. It sticks on skin like glue. I used diff things like oil, wipes, soap, scrub etc and the wax is still there. My underarms stick and it hurts to move my hands!! Also it does not remove hair from roots so u feel stubble. Previously whenever i waxed i would have smooth skin. After waxing with this one it feels like it does 2 days after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing good about it is the convenience of rolling. Overall very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be water soluble and it was not, but otherwise I guess wax is wax and takes hair off.</li>
            <li> Its very good this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cheap and the quality is good. It says for sensitive skin and it&#x27;s true. You should buy it</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for thick, course hair.</li>
            <li> We have bought this many times, ladies in my home loves it.</li>
            <li> My wife of course needed this to go along with the Belle Pink Depilatory Roll on Wax Heater but as a system she loves it!</li>
            <li> i might be the only one but my skin comes off complete.ly with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, poor quality.</li>
            <li> Even when i used it at very low temperatures, this wax left my skin burned and hurting for the coming 1 week, which is very unusual for a wax. It left dark patches on my skin after use, and within a week, my skin was more tanned than it ever was. Its probably because of the chemicals they use in the wax, but I definitely do not recommend it. Oh,and this was sticks to your skin like gum, i had a very tough time getting rid of this.</li>
            <li> Very nice and easy to use wax. Pleasant and comparably easy to apply and take off.</li>
            <li> Delivered in more than a month but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
