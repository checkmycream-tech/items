            <li>This one was the best option for me.</li>
            <li>This is an EXCELLENT product.</li>
            <li>Very good product for me anyway</li>
            <li>This is some incredible stuff.</li>
            <li>SOMEWHAT LIKE A MANURE FLY.</li>
            <li>Worked great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product without the worries of the lead component.</li>
            <li>Works great, faster than lead-based products.</li>
            <li>This product is great, it gets rid of the gray and also works to keep your hair in place.</li>
            <li>It is simply great for the work it does without containing lead.</li>
            <li>No one thinks he&#x27;s coloring, and he is so happy w/ the result.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job as a styling cream, which is a good thing, because you can&#x27;t use creams or gels when the product is in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did not do too good of a job.</li>
            <li>Product works good and well within time as mentioned on the box.</li>
            <li>will be very happy, GET THE LEAD FREE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product that i buyed</li>
            <li>Amazing....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to use a gentle soap (baby shampoo?)</li>
            <li>it is not as effective as the lead</li>
            <li>It would be nice to add some fragrance in the ingredients.     </li>
            <li>I was hoping Youthair would work better than the 5-minute dyes and give more control over hair color, but it looks like Youthair is not even as good as the dyes.</li>
            <li>I liked it even better than your product with lead.  </li>
            <li>All in all a okay product but far from perfect.</li>
            <li>SEEMS TO BE MORE OF A TEMPORARY MAKEUP LIKE EYE SHADOW.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gets better when it dries a bit, but you do need to rinse before bed or your pillow will stain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it is MUCH better smelling than the lead version</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Best colouring fluid ever tried.</li>
            <li>No smell, and most of all no lead.</li>
            <li>Works much better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Does not leave any stains , darkens hair as they say pretty good item</li>
            <li>If my hair were naturally brown (the color of the guy&#x27;s hair on the bottle) this product would be great.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not quite as easy to use as the Youthair Creme or Just For Men, or Grecian Formulas with Lead Acetate.</li>
            <li>I feel the product is okay and is good to matain your color between collorings but not as a complete replacement for men&#x60;s hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s No Reason for me to be untruthful in this review!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a great believer in reading feedback on something prior to buying that product, so in my truthful opinion ...</li>
            <li>It restores gray hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>I wish it were that easy for me.  </li>
            <li>I find the sulfur odor to be too strong to use Youthair during the day while at work.  </li>
            <li>This item works fine.</li>
            <li>Lead free and easy to use.</li>
            <li>ALSO IT LIGHTLY SHADES YOUR HAIR TO LIGHT BROWN</li>
            <li>This is also available at Rite Aid.</li>
            <li>The LEAD FREE Youthair works</li>
            <li>I have been using regular Youthair for a couple years now with great results.  </li>
            <li>Would be nice if there were a lead-free product like this, but this one just doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Do NOT buy the cheaper (original) version that CONTAINS LEAD ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay product; however, my husband needed too much time to color gray hair.</li>
            <li>I used a full tube</li>
            <li>have no doubt that the result would be good, as I have used similar Youth hair products.</li>
            <li>now, first the original with lead, then this LEAD FREE version, and after already getting TWO haircuts, have NOT needed too</li>
            <li>So the overall coloring is minimal--which is blond to very light brown with some hair still more close to gray.  </li>
            <li>The youth hair washes off when u wash your hair even with mild shampoo.</li>
            <li>this is my third order...not very good but better than other products.</li>
            <li>My wife loves it and so do i and no mess and easy folks!</li>
            <li>Gives a better and natural color look than dying hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Grecian is more natural</li>
            <li>Also, this no-lead product works better than the other youthhair leaded cream and better than Grecian formula, and it doesn&#x27;t feel toxic like the leaded based hair treatments sometimes felt.</li>
            <li>Going under the shower and shampooing my hair, the color came right off</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>BUT FROM FAR THEY APPEAR LIGHT BROWN</li>
            <li>is not an exact science despite both products are advertised to work in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Used regular youthair and it worked better than this product.  </li>
            <li>Firstly, I would like to mention that the product box and the cream tube do not have a production and expiry date.</li>
            <li>The product is pretty ineffective in comparison to others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I started seeing a difference within the first week.</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of funky... not quite chemical like other products, but not quite something you want to smell like.</li>
            <li>But to be fair, I have also used Just for Men and Grecian 5 (5-Minute Hair Color) and find both products to be barely satisfactory, as they don&#x27;t completely color gray hair to the natural color and trying to judge when to rinse to achieve desired results</li>
            <li>being said, it does restore some color, and can look nice and natural, unlike the painted look of some traditional 5-minute hair coloring dyes.</li>
            <li>After the first couple of weeks it looked promising as the grays were fading somewhat.</li>
            <li>However, I like brown better than grey.  </li>
            <li>He used the leaded first, but the result w/ lead free is the same  and healthier.</li>
            <li>It certainly has some sort of dye in it.</li>
            <li>One thing is certain:</li>
            <li>I have natural black hair and the best color i can get with this is a dark brown, it is also very messy to use at night and will stain anything it comes in contact with, i was really hoping for a good experience with this product, but find it is sitting in my medicine cabinet now</li>
            <li>when washing your hair, or just rinse your hair until it really needs a wash.</li>
            <li>you rinse out your hair before bed (to avoid a brown pillow) much of the darkness will rinse out.</li>
            <li>item can not cover up that much area</li>
            <li>but really you do.  </li>
            <li>(Youthair Creme Lead-Free )  as well as for the fast transport.  </li>
            <li>thanks  Marc</li>
            <li>This makes me to think that the product has more coloring effect than turning the gray hair to black hair, however on the prescription it says that \\&quot;...</li>
            <li>Though there is noticeable coloring, it&#x27;s not enough to get me to continue using the product daily to try to achieve better results.  </li>
            <li>Tried both, but the regular one in blue tube worked better.  </li>
            <li>A must use for all individuals 50 or older to transform their looks.</li>
            <li>I would think I&#x27;ve inhaled more lead from leaded gasoline than I could get from leaded Youthair if I used a whole bottle on my head everyday for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>I have to say it&#x27;s the only product that works so quick.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a year, and only gives a kind of dark yellow color to my gray hair, but it is easy to use with no mess.</li>
            <li>and this product worked much faster and better, forget negative reviews and try it for yourself at this price what do you have to lose you</li>
            <li>With the dyes, you can end up with results that are too light or too dark depending on when you rinse.</li>
            <li>Before that I used the tonic, I guess the liquid works a little to get my gray hair darker, but the smell is strong.</li>
            <li>So, you can&#x27;t understand whether the product old or new.   </li>
            <li>It covers grey quickly (3 days), but it the color wipes off on light color fabrics, especially when wet.</li>
            <li>If you go to the chlorinated swimming pool, the color disappears, and you have to apply intensely to get back to normal within a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li>Firstly, the guy on the box is a complete Photoshop job, it&#x27;s the same photo</li>
            <li>Its unique formula provides long lasting, natural results\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll probably agree that the two minor caveats associated with this product (funny scent and potential for staining) far outweigh the dangers of rubbing a toxic, heavy metal, known carcinogen into your scalp :)</li>
            <li>product is not as fast acting as the products with Lead Acetate.</li>
            <li>It will rub off on nearly everything your hair comes in contact with.</li>
            <li>This stuff reeks like sulphur, mats your hair and is far from conditioning like it says.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to meet my expectation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the only tip i have is keep your hair shorter than normal or thinned a bit as you cant use Gel or conditioner during the process so my hair gets a bit wild!    </li>
            <li>No dyes, no mess?</li>
            <li>I was looking for a lead free and more natural product because I am afraid of the long term side effects we can get using harmfull chemicals</li>
            <li>The same warning is on all new gas cooking grills (that food is going inside our bodies).    </li>
            <li>it is very good.&lt;br /&gt;However, one bottle I bought the cream&#x27;s color was white but the next bottle I bought the cream&#x27;s color was into brown.</li>
            <li>I bought the product with high hopes, thinking it would be the same as the regular youthair creme, just without&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband uses this to keep from going so white and looking way toooooo old.  </li>
            <li>and I certainly hope that on research I do NOT find other items that I did not buy and DID NOT PAY FOR.  </li>
            <li>Very efficient, even though it may fade some due to chlorine in the swimming pool.  </li>

            <li> The same warning is on all new gas cooking grills (that food is going inside our bodies).    </li>
            <li> it is very good.&lt;br /&gt;However, one bottle I bought the cream&#x27;s color was white but the next bottle I bought the cream&#x27;s color was into brown.</li>
            <li> I bought the product with high hopes, thinking it would be the same as the regular youthair creme, just without&lt;br</li>

            <li> MY HAIR BEGAN TO ACQUIRE A STRANGE TINT</li>
            <li> As tutty said, it only tones down graying and hair \\&quot;will appear yellow brown under the lights.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It might look and feel greasy after application but don&#x27;t be bothered as it will dry out without any traces.</li>

            <li> My grayish-white hair was dyed light brown all the way to the roots and looked artificial and just not natural at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has to be used a little differently.</li>
            <li> I leave it on for only a few hours at night time and wash it out for the level of color</li>
            <li> It also claims to be a no-dye product but even though it comes out of the tube white, it darkens on your hair and then rubs off on a towel (even hours later when it has dried, leaves dark residue on a pillow and rinses out dark in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I used it daily after showering at the gym (so my hair was a little damp), and saw results in a little under 3-weeks.</li>

            <li> THE PROBLEM IS IT WASHES OFF WITHIN A DAY WHEN YOU SHAMPOO AFTER FOLLOWING ALL THE DIRECTIONS. SO UNLESS YOU KEEP APPLYING DAILY, ITS NOT GOING TO WORK. THEY NEED TO MAKE IT STAY ATLEAST A WEEK.    ALSO IT LIGHTLY SHADES YOUR HAIR TO LIGHT BROWN AND WHEN YOU WATCH IT CLOSELY THEY ARE STILL GRAY BUT FROM FAR THEY APPEAR LIGHT BROWN THAT TOO IF YOU APPLY DAILY WHICH IS HARD TO DO....    BOTTOM LINE: IT DOES NOT WORK...DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> SEEMS TO BE MORE OF A TEMPORARY MAKEUP LIKE EYE SHADOW. IT COMES OUT OF THE TUBE IN A STRANGE BROWN COLOR. IF YOU WASH YOUR HAIR UNDER THE SHOWER SEVERAL DAYS AFTER USING IT YOU WILL SEE THE  BROWN COLOR IN THE RINSE WATER. EVEN IF YOUR HAIR ONLY GETS STEAMED IN THE SHOWER THE COLOR WILL RUB OFF ON THE TOWEL. AFTER SEVERAL DAYS OF USING THE PRODUCT MY HAIR BEGAN TO ACQUIRE A STRANGE TINT SOMEWHAT LIKE A MANURE FLY. I DISCONTINUED USAGE AND WENT BACK TO THE REGULAR VERSION OF THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lead free and more natural product because I am afraid of the long term side effects we can get using harmfull chemicals do hide your gray hair. This one was the best option for me. It slightly changes your hair color (makes your natural hair a little darker) but nobody actually notice and it covers your gray hair. I  definetely like this product. If you are looking for a less chemical product I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I switched to this after reading about Lead Acetate. That is some nasty stuff, and it is used in most products that eliminate gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not as fast acting as the products with Lead Acetate. But it also doesn&#x27;t cause Cancer if you accidentally get it on your skin or even worse, if you have a cut or abrasion on your hands or scalp when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has to be used a little differently. When you apply it, you have to leave it in for several hours. The smell is kind of funky... not quite chemical like other products, but not quite something you want to smell like. (Almost a \\&quot;nutty\\&quot; odor)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will turn noticeably darker immediately after applying. This change is not permanent, and it&#x27;s not color-fast! It will rub off on nearly everything your hair comes in contact with. It&#x27;s gets better when it dries a bit, but you do need to rinse before bed or your pillow will stain. It&#x27;s best to use a gentle soap (baby shampoo?) when washing your hair, or just rinse your hair until it really needs a wash. It does a good job as a styling cream, which is a good thing, because you can&#x27;t use creams or gels when the product is in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you rinse out your hair before bed (to avoid a brown pillow) much of the darkness will rinse out. However, each application does increase the amount of darker hair that remains. (And gray reduction, which is why we bought it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... it&#x27;s not quite as easy to use as the Youthair Creme or Just For Men, or Grecian Formulas with Lead Acetate. But if you do 5 minutes of research about Lead Acetate... you&#x27;ll probably agree that the two minor caveats associated with this product (funny scent and potential for staining) far outweigh the dangers of rubbing a toxic, heavy metal, known carcinogen into your scalp :)</li>
            <li> This is really heavy on your hair so forget about wearing it during the day. It also smells pretty bad. I am not sure what that smell is but it is not pleasant. I could not do it everyday to see if it really worked. When I used it It definitely covered my gray hair until I showered. I do not know if the color would hold after a while, I did not do it for the 4 weeks (recommended) to talk about that.</li>
            <li> I feel the product is okay and is good to matain your color between collorings but not as a complete replacement for men&#x60;s hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very coarse sideburn hairs and a lot of gray on the sides of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item can not cover up that much area and if you try to make it work you will have blotches of the product stain your skin no matter how well you comb it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is MUCH better smelling than the lead version and I feel safer using it it is not as effective as the lead version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium brown hair with a bit of red in it and daily use turned my hair to a dark ash blond but allowed the gray to be seen on the coarse side burn hair and did nothing in the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say you do not need styling products when you use this product but really you do.  It does help somewhat to hold hair in place but so does tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever they use in this product needs to be stronger.  Using larger allotments does not seem to help as you end up getting the brown patches on your scalp that I previously mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also seems to clog the pores on my scalp and I wonder if this will hinder future hair growth.  All in all a okay product but far from perfect.</li>
            <li> I have been using Youthair (Lead-Free formula) for 4 weeks and I&#x27;m disappointed with the results. I have brown to medium brown hair. I find the sulfur odor to be too strong to use Youthair during the day while at work.  Though the odor isn&#x27;t real bad, it&#x27;s nevertheless noticeable. In an office setting, the last thing I want is a sulfur smell emanating from my hair. So after the first few applications I decided to only apply it first thing after arriving home from work--which means it was on my hair for at least 12 hours until showering the next morning.  On weekends, I would leave in all day.    After the first couple of weeks it looked promising as the grays were fading somewhat. However, the fading seems to have reached maximum results. So the overall coloring is minimal--which is blond to very light brown with some hair still more close to gray.  My results look no better than the color chart results on the box after 1 week of use. Though there is noticeable coloring, it&#x27;s not enough to get me to continue using the product daily to try to achieve better results.  As tutty said, it only tones down graying and hair \\&quot;will appear yellow brown under the lights.\\&quot; Actually, under moderate lighting, my grays are closer to blond. The instructions say to use a \\&quot;small amount daily\\&quot; until desired results are achieved, then twice a week thereafter. The problem is that I don&#x27;t see the desired results or anything close despite using Youthair every day for about 4 weeks.  I agree with the others who said Youthair is not a replacement for hair dye.    But to be fair, I have also used Just for Men and Grecian 5 (5-Minute Hair Color) and find both products to be barely satisfactory, as they don&#x27;t completely color gray hair to the natural color and trying to judge when to rinse to achieve desired results is not an exact science despite both products are advertised to work in 5 minutes. With the dyes, you can end up with results that are too light or too dark depending on when you rinse. I was hoping Youthair would work better than the 5-minute dyes and give more control over hair color, but it looks like Youthair is not even as good as the dyes.</li>
            <li> Did not do too good of a job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product that i buyed (Youthair Creme Lead-Free )  as well as for the fast transport.  thanks  Marc</li>
            <li> If my hair were naturally brown (the color of the guy&#x27;s hair on the bottle) this product would be great.  I don&#x27;t know how the advertisement can say this has no dyes - it is brown.    However, I like brown better than grey.  Also, this no-lead product works better than the other youthhair leaded cream and better than Grecian formula, and it doesn&#x27;t feel toxic like the leaded based hair treatments sometimes felt.</li>
            <li> Amazing.... two applications and the gray was gone.....This is some incredible stuff.</li>
            <li> Product works good and well within time as mentioned on the box. Gives a better and natural color look than dying hair.</li>
            <li> yes it does and it does not look like a hair dye ( whcih it isnt of course)    the only tip i have is keep your hair shorter than normal or thinned a bit as you cant use Gel or conditioner during the process so my hair gets a bit wild!    My wife loves it and so do i and no mess and easy folks!</li>
            <li> Very efficient, even though it may fade some due to chlorine in the swimming pool.  Overall it&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This product works period I used GF for months and this product worked much faster and better, forget negative reviews and try it for yourself at this price what do you have to lose you will be very happy, GET THE LEAD FREE</li>
            <li> This item does not work . It takes a long time to see results that has a horrible odor. This is the worse purchase over the internet I have done. Lost my money</li>
            <li> It certainly has some sort of dye in it. If you shampoo, it fades. If you go to the chlorinated swimming pool, the color disappears, and you have to apply intensely to get back to normal within a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it does restore some color, and can look nice and natural, unlike the painted look of some traditional 5-minute hair coloring dyes.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t try it out long enough to see if it works</li>
            <li> Used regular youthair and it worked better than this product.  Tried both, but the regular one in blue tube worked better.  Takes about a month and is not die at all.  Still salt and pepper, but way less gray.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time. The youth hair washes off when u wash your hair even with mild shampoo. It sort of only tones downs the gray down. At times your hair will appear yellow brown under the lights. Not recommended</li>
            <li> I have natural black hair and the best color i can get with this is a dark brown, it is also very messy to use at night and will stain anything it comes in contact with, i was really hoping for a good experience with this product, but find it is sitting in my medicine cabinet now, i wont be buying this again</li>
            <li> Worked great.  I liked it even better than your product with lead.  I leave it on for only a few hours at night time and wash it out for the level of color I like.  Then it lasts about 3 weeks.  Be careful of staining anything you rub against it and stay away from bare skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product; however, my husband needed too much time to color gray hair. This is also available at Rite Aid.</li>
            <li> This is a great product without the worries of the lead component. A must use for all individuals 50 or older to transform their looks.</li>
            <li> Best colouring fluid ever tried. Does not leave any stains , darkens hair as they say pretty good item , I repeated purchase twice already</li>
            <li> This is an EXCELLENT product. Do NOT buy the cheaper (original) version that CONTAINS LEAD ... that one smells, and stains towels, pillow cases etc. The LEAD FREE Youthair works just as well with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just give it about 3-weeks to &amp;#34;kick-in&amp;#34;. I used it daily after showering at the gym (so my hair was a little damp), and saw results in a little under 3-weeks. I been using YOUTHAIR for about 3-months now, first the original with lead, then this LEAD FREE version, and after already getting TWO haircuts, have NOT needed too die my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s No Reason for me to be untruthful in this review!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a great believer in reading feedback on something prior to buying that product, so in my truthful opinion ... YOUTHAIR 100% WORKS ... period.</li>
            <li> Works great, faster than lead-based products.</li>
            <li> This product is great, it gets rid of the gray and also works to keep your hair in place. My hair looks darker just after a few minutes after applying it. No smell, and most of all no lead.</li>
            <li> I bought YOUTHAIR cream for my boyfriend as a gift from Amazon.com. But then, he mentioned these complain on the below....  Firstly, I would like to mention that the product box and the cream tube do not have a production and expiry date. So, you can&#x27;t understand whether the product old or new.   Secondly, the photos on the box have false effect that both of them have the same person&#x27;s smiling and mimics which is impossible when you are taken two different photos in different days. This makes the customer skeptical about the effects of the product. Personally, when I have seen these photos I thought that these two photos made on a photo editing software (like Photoshop).   Thirdly; after applying the product, it has a very nasty smell, which is very disturbing. It would be nice to add some fragrance in the ingredients.     After applying the product,  if you wipe with a paper towel with making a little press on your hair, it dyes the towel with brown color.  This makes me to think that the product has more coloring effect than turning the gray hair to black hair, however on the prescription it says that \\&quot;...youthful color without dyes, peroxide or lead. Its unique formula provides long lasting, natural results\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I DID NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM.  On reviewing my account, I am finding other items that I did not purchase and I certainly hope that on research I do NOT find other items that I did not buy and DID NOT PAY FOR.  Please review my account and edit it (Amazon) as I am going to be doing the same on my end.</li>
            <li> Maybe is because my hair is black. I used a full tube and I did not see results. Before that I used the tonic, I guess the liquid works a little to get my gray hair darker, but the smell is strong.</li>
            <li> I bought the product with high hopes, thinking it would be the same as the regular youthair creme, just without&lt;br /&gt;the lead-acetate. I tried it three times, each time with the same result: The creme worked like a regular hair dye, coloring the hair&lt;br /&gt;in a fake-looking tone not resembling my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair color after just a few hours of treatment.My grayish-white hair was dyed light brown all the way to the roots and looked artificial and just not natural at all. Going under the shower and shampooing my hair, the color came right off and I was back to my grayish-white hair. I repeated the process the next day, and one day after. Same results. So I am back to my trusted regular youthair creme (which I have uised for over 20 years). I&#x27;m just not gonna worry about the lead-acetate anymore. One thing is certain: The &amp;#34;unleaded&amp;#34; youthair sucks!</li>
            <li> I have been using regular Youthair for a couple years now with great results.  As noted the lead free stains, washes out and is just plain messy.  If I wanted a tan/brown towel, or shower floor, I would use dye. I&#x27;ll go back to the stuff fortified with lead.    I would like to address the warning on the regular version.  The same warning is on all new gas cooking grills (that food is going inside our bodies).    I would think I&#x27;ve inhaled more lead from leaded gasoline than I could get from leaded Youthair if I used a whole bottle on my head everyday for the rest of my life. (tongue in cheek)</li>
            <li> It restores gray hair very quickly.I have to say it&#x27;s the only product that works so quick.It is simply great for the work it does without containing lead.I recommend this.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this to keep from going so white and looking way toooooo old.  He loves it.  No one thinks he&#x27;s coloring, and he is so happy w/ the result.  He looks like a blonde going gray but has for about 5 years now.  He uses a fingernail size daily.  Just a little dab&#x27;ll do you.  I wish it were that easy for me.  He used the leaded first, but the result w/ lead free is the same  and healthier.</li>
            <li> very dark black. washes out and down the drain.  Stopped using it.  A waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grecian is more natural</li>
            <li> this is my third order...not very good but better than other products.</li>
            <li> Works well, color is a little lighter more like dark brown instead of jet black color that I have</li>
            <li> I wish I would have read the reviews before buying this product. Firstly, the guy on the box is a complete Photoshop job, it&#x27;s the same photo just a mirrored image and he doesn&#x27;t even have any grey in his facial hair. This stuff reeks like sulphur, mats your hair and is far from conditioning like it says. If you have to stop using regular conditioner this product will make you look like you need a shower. No dyes, no mess? No way, I was totally embarrassed at the gym when I was sweating brown and it turned my grey towel brown. It&#x27;s unfortunate but this product is no solution for greying hair.</li>
            <li> This item works fine. It covers grey quickly (3 days), but it the color wipes off on light color fabrics, especially when wet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year, and only gives a kind of dark yellow color to my gray hair, but it is easy to use with no mess.</li>
            <li> Lead free and easy to use. I look 10 yrs younger!</li>
            <li> It may work for others. But this creme did not work for me. I gave up using it after 30 days and seeing no changes. Went back to tinting my gray hair</li>
            <li> Works much better than I thought it would. Very good product for me anyway, maybe doen&#x27;t work well for everyone though as some has left reviews saying.</li>
            <li> I have not been using this one before. So far it seems to meet my expectation.&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt that the result would be good, as I have used similar Youth hair products.</li>
            <li> The product is pretty ineffective in comparison to others I&#x27;ve used.  It also claims to be a no-dye product but even though it comes out of the tube white, it darkens on your hair and then rubs off on a towel (even hours later when it has dried, leaves dark residue on a pillow and rinses out dark in the shower.  Used it consistently for two weeks and found it very disappointing and basically a waste of money.  Would be nice if there were a lead-free product like this, but this one just doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> it is very good.&lt;br /&gt;However, one bottle I bought the cream&#x27;s color was white but the next bottle I bought the cream&#x27;s color was into brown.</li>
            <li> I started seeing a difference within the first week. It might look and feel greasy after application but don&#x27;t be bothered as it will dry out without any traces. It doesn&#x27;t stain the pillowcase. A little goes a long way,  i highly recommend this product. I will order again from the same seller. Very fast shipping.</li>
