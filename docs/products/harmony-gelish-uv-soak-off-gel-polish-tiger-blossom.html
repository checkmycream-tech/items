            <li>Beautiful vibrant color.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to put too many coats on.</li>
            <li>It would look great with a tan, but looks good on my Irish skin too.</li>
            <li>Love itGreat color......</li>
            <li>love that I can get what I want when I want it.</li>

            <li>Product last and looks great!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the Gelish brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used a coat of this with a coat of Samuri on top, which gives it more of a cranberry look.</li>
            <li>I love the gelish system and have started to collect a lot of the colors.  </li>
            <li>BUT, I&#x27;m so glad I ended up getting this one.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love Gelish products, but I still need to master the art if application.</li>
            <li>I was even able to take the laundry out of the dryer as soon as I was done.</li>
            <li>This one of my favorite colors by gelish.</li>
            <li>but I am so glad I bought this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a nail technician, but I love how my nails turn out when I use it, and this is one of my favorite go-to colors.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite Gelish polish purchase to date.</li>
            <li>Get a lot more for your money.  </li>
            <li>The perfect mix of red and orange for a summer time &amp;#34;pop of red&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I find the color to fun and bright but still office appropriate.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the color.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise you can see them so prominently I just won&#x27;t wear it on my fingers.</li>
            <li>It turned out more orangey than I thought it would be</li>
            <li>I love Gelish Brand.  </li>
            <li>It becomes a vibrant coral color and looks great with a tan.  </li>
            <li>Perfect color for all summer long.</li>
            <li>but it is a bright coral, much like OPI&#x27;s Guy Meets Galveston, which is one of my favorite colors</li>
            <li>I just love gelish and how easy it is to apply...</li>
            <li>But before the blister I LOVED this stuff I can not say enough good about it.</li>
            <li>Going to be a fun summer color, I&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin with a yellow undertone.</li>
            <li>It is pretty bright orange, and does look pretty nice.</li>
            <li>This is a bold orangeish red that is perfect for summer.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to work with</li>
            <li>Its a beautiful coral color (looks red in bottle).</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s super cute.</li>
            <li>Love Gelish and this is my new favorite nail color :)</li>
            <li>(See photo.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glossy, bright and vivid, and applies smoothly and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the colour is just great - it is between light red and orange!</li>
            <li>I had no problems with curing it under my U Spicy LED light.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions precisely</li>
            <li>It also depends on the light.</li>
            <li>The color is a beautiful and bright darker orange (between regular orange and red).</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really pretty with any of the glitter polishes over top of it.</li>
            <li>I am posting this review so that people know that even if you follow the directions and fully cure the product you can develop an allergy (though it appears to be rare); it did not even occur to me that this could happen!</li>
            <li>It is a little more orange than I thought it would be, but nonetheless it&#x27;s still a great color.</li>
            <li>This orange-red color (obviously more red than orange) is great for when I&#x27;m feeling sassy and fun ;)&lt;</li>
            <li>Easy to order shipped right to my door...</li>
            <li>Have not used it yet, but the key is the color and it is great...not too bright for me, but not neon, which is not my taste.</li>
            <li>It stayed bright and  shiny the entire time.</li>
            <li>It has a red undertone which kinda throws it off for me, but it gives you good coverage with two coats.</li>
            <li>i recieved quickly.</li>
            <li>Great bright orange color that is a little on the red side!  </li>
            <li>This color is very pretty like the picture; however, this color does shrink and wrinkle.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty color.  </li>
            <li>It IS kind of an orangey red, but there&#x27;s something more vibrant to it which, like many of the gelish colors, is more obvious out in the sunlight.  </li>
            <li>This is a bright salmon color not orange like I expected.</li>
            <li>i recomend it for fresh summer look.</li>
            <li>I am in love with the Gelish system so far.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of an old timey WWII lady :-)</li>
            <li>warm red / orange.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this right away because I was not crazy about an orangish shade</li>
            <li>This is one of the first gelish colors that I bought, and it is fun, vibrant, and chip free.</li>
            <li>Tiger blossom is such a great red...</li>
            <li>Very accurate color as I look back at the color swatch.  </li>
            <li>It is orange-y red, but definitely more on the orange side.</li>
            <li>I was initially turned off by the description of this color being and orangey-red because I tend to like the more berry colored polishes.  </li>
            <li>Personally I prefer the more muted tones like Exhale.</li>
            <li>I found instructions online and followed them exactly.</li>
            <li>This color looks more orange than red on me, which I like.</li>
            <li>I only wish this was a bit more salmon than neon.</li>
            <li>I really like this polish!</li>
            <li>Such a fun color!!</li>
            <li>the color is beautiful not your typical red, I will buy this again!!</li>
            <li>Love this color, so much fun for summer, but not too bright or crazy that you can&#x27;t wear it to work.</li>
            <li>used it for the first time last week before a short vacation, and a week later, it looks as good as the day I applied it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very vibrant</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very vibrant and is applied evenly in just two coats.  </li>
            <li>on nice and lasts the typical 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>it is very bright and almost has a deep pink look if that sounds possible.</li>
            <li>Sort of a cross between bright orange and pink</li>
            <li>thanks you for the product (Harmony Gelish UV Soak Off Gel Polish Tiger Blossom)</li>
            <li>The color is very  close to the swatch pictured.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this color!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really orange.</li>
            <li>I really like this color.</li>
            <li>The Harmony website also has very accurate color samples if you&#x27;re looking for other colors.  </li>
            <li>and I am usually a pretty busy gal</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how long it lasted and was actually a bit upset that I could not get the polish to come off very easily.</li>
            <li>my new fave!</li>
            <li>A great addition, especially if you&#x27;re looking for a red that isn&#x27;t too dark.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s high gloss for weeks</li>
            <li>This color is really pretty much the same as the picture.....</li>
            <li>I expected it to be more red</li>
            <li>I use this brand of polish usually with no problem but this color (which I Love) seems to ripple and bubble.</li>
            <li>This is a vibrant color and the online picture is very close to the actual color.</li>
            <li>The polish last 4 weeks or more, doesn&#x27;t lose its luster, and makes the nail slightly harder!!!</li>
            <li>I recommend this color for the summer season or any time you want a loud pop on your fingers.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I still developed an allergy to the product.</li>
            <li>The product would not cure completely and bubbles.</li>
            <li>and my hands see a lot of action.</li>
            <li>An orangy-red that isn&#x27;t too orange (I am usually classified as a \\&quot;winter\\&quot;, and it looks fine on me).</li>
            <li>orange kind of has a slight pink but definitely orange.</li>
            <li>I would not considered a full coral because I don&#x27;t think it has enough pink.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super pale and I get compliments on it all the time.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty reddish orange color, it lasts just as long as any other gelish color.  </li>
            <li>I know the pictures usually don&#x27;t reflect the actual color very well, but this one is pretty close.</li>
            <li>Almost a hot pink mixed with salmon tones.</li>
            <li>It is a thicker polish, so be sure to use thin coats.</li>
            <li>This particular color is a little thicker than other ones I&#x27;ve used, but I still did 3 coats anyways because I like a really bold color.</li>
            <li>I only have 5 or 6 different colors of the Gelish, but this one is my new favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although it is a little more orange than the picture shows, as I thought the picture looked a little pinkish.</li>
            <li>I went for a manicure a few months ago at a higher end salon and they used Gelish polish on my nails.</li>
            <li>In 20 minutes, my nails were completely polished and dry.</li>
            <li>You have to focus on painting it on thin and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>

            <li> This color is kind of a jelly finish.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice orange, somewhat coral color.</li>
            <li> This color looks very &#x27;orange&#x27; but it is actually a nice coral color and looks great on almost all skin tones!</li>
            <li> Nicely represented in the photos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saving tons of money doing my own nails</li>
            <li> I would rate this a warm color.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice color.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice summer color, orange but not neon</li>
            <li> I assume the original is a great product, but you will receive \\&quot;Tiger Blossum.\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of gel polishes and Gelish is by far the best quality.  </li>

            <li> Beautiful vibrant color.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to put too many coats on.</li>
            <li> It would look great with a tan, but looks good on my Irish skin too.</li>

            <li> Product last and looks great!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the Gelish brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used a coat of this with a coat of Samuri on top, which gives it more of a cranberry look.</li>
            <li> I love the gelish system and have started to collect a lot of the colors.  </li>
            <li> BUT, I&#x27;m so glad I ended up getting this one.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love Gelish products, but I still need to master the art if application.</li>
            <li> I was even able to take the laundry out of the dryer as soon as I was done.</li>
            <li> This one of my favorite colors by gelish.</li>
            <li> but I am so glad I bought this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a nail technician, but I love how my nails turn out when I use it, and this is one of my favorite go-to colors.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite Gelish polish purchase to date.</li>
            <li> Get a lot more for your money.  </li>
            <li> The perfect mix of red and orange for a summer time &amp;#34;pop of red&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I find the color to fun and bright but still office appropriate.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the color.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise you can see them so prominently I just won&#x27;t wear it on my fingers.</li>
            <li> It turned out more orangey than I thought it would be</li>
            <li> I love Gelish Brand.  </li>
            <li> It becomes a vibrant coral color and looks great with a tan.  </li>
            <li> Perfect color for all summer long.</li>
            <li> but it is a bright coral, much like OPI&#x27;s Guy Meets Galveston, which is one of my favorite colors</li>
            <li> I just love gelish and how easy it is to apply...</li>
            <li> But before the blister I LOVED this stuff I can not say enough good about it.</li>
            <li> Going to be a fun summer color, I&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin with a yellow undertone.</li>
            <li> It is pretty bright orange, and does look pretty nice.</li>
            <li> This is a bold orangeish red that is perfect for summer.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to work with</li>
            <li> Its a beautiful coral color (looks red in bottle).</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s super cute.</li>
            <li> Love Gelish and this is my new favorite nail color :)</li>
            <li> (See photo.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glossy, bright and vivid, and applies smoothly and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the colour is just great - it is between light red and orange!</li>
            <li> I had no problems with curing it under my U Spicy LED light.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions precisely</li>
            <li> It also depends on the light.</li>
            <li> The color is a beautiful and bright darker orange (between regular orange and red).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really pretty with any of the glitter polishes over top of it.</li>
            <li> I am posting this review so that people know that even if you follow the directions and fully cure the product you can develop an allergy (though it appears to be rare); it did not even occur to me that this could happen!</li>
            <li> It is a little more orange than I thought it would be, but nonetheless it&#x27;s still a great color.</li>
            <li> This orange-red color (obviously more red than orange) is great for when I&#x27;m feeling sassy and fun ;)&lt;</li>
            <li> Easy to order shipped right to my door...</li>
            <li> Have not used it yet, but the key is the color and it is great...not too bright for me, but not neon, which is not my taste.</li>
            <li> It stayed bright and  shiny the entire time.</li>
            <li> It has a red undertone which kinda throws it off for me, but it gives you good coverage with two coats.</li>
            <li> i recieved quickly.</li>
            <li> Great bright orange color that is a little on the red side!  </li>
            <li> This color is very pretty like the picture; however, this color does shrink and wrinkle.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty color.  </li>
            <li> It IS kind of an orangey red, but there&#x27;s something more vibrant to it which, like many of the gelish colors, is more obvious out in the sunlight.  </li>
            <li> This is a bright salmon color not orange like I expected.</li>
            <li> i recomend it for fresh summer look.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the Gelish system so far.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of an old timey WWII lady :-)</li>
            <li> warm red / orange.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this right away because I was not crazy about an orangish shade</li>
            <li> This is one of the first gelish colors that I bought, and it is fun, vibrant, and chip free.</li>
            <li> Tiger blossom is such a great red...</li>
            <li> Very accurate color as I look back at the color swatch.  </li>
            <li> It is orange-y red, but definitely more on the orange side.</li>
            <li> I was initially turned off by the description of this color being and orangey-red because I tend to like the more berry colored polishes.  </li>
            <li> Personally I prefer the more muted tones like Exhale.</li>
            <li> I found instructions online and followed them exactly.</li>
            <li> This color looks more orange than red on me, which I like.</li>
            <li> I only wish this was a bit more salmon than neon.</li>
            <li> I really like this polish!</li>
            <li> Such a fun color!!</li>
            <li> the color is beautiful not your typical red, I will buy this again!!</li>
            <li> Love this color, so much fun for summer, but not too bright or crazy that you can&#x27;t wear it to work.</li>
            <li> used it for the first time last week before a short vacation, and a week later, it looks as good as the day I applied it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very vibrant</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very vibrant and is applied evenly in just two coats.  </li>
            <li> on nice and lasts the typical 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> it is very bright and almost has a deep pink look if that sounds possible.</li>
            <li> Sort of a cross between bright orange and pink</li>
            <li> thanks you for the product (Harmony Gelish UV Soak Off Gel Polish Tiger Blossom)</li>
            <li> The color is very  close to the swatch pictured.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this color!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really orange.</li>
            <li> I really like this color.</li>
            <li> The Harmony website also has very accurate color samples if you&#x27;re looking for other colors.  </li>
            <li> and I am usually a pretty busy gal</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how long it lasted and was actually a bit upset that I could not get the polish to come off very easily.</li>
            <li> my new fave!</li>
            <li> A great addition, especially if you&#x27;re looking for a red that isn&#x27;t too dark.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s high gloss for weeks</li>
            <li> This color is really pretty much the same as the picture.....</li>
            <li> I expected it to be more red</li>
            <li> I use this brand of polish usually with no problem but this color (which I Love) seems to ripple and bubble.</li>
            <li> This is a vibrant color and the online picture is very close to the actual color.</li>
            <li> The polish last 4 weeks or more, doesn&#x27;t lose its luster, and makes the nail slightly harder!!!</li>
            <li> I recommend this color for the summer season or any time you want a loud pop on your fingers.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I still developed an allergy to the product.</li>
            <li> The product would not cure completely and bubbles.</li>
            <li> and my hands see a lot of action.</li>
            <li> An orangy-red that isn&#x27;t too orange (I am usually classified as a \\&quot;winter\\&quot;, and it looks fine on me).</li>
            <li> orange kind of has a slight pink but definitely orange.</li>
            <li> I would not considered a full coral because I don&#x27;t think it has enough pink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super pale and I get compliments on it all the time.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty reddish orange color, it lasts just as long as any other gelish color.  </li>
            <li> I know the pictures usually don&#x27;t reflect the actual color very well, but this one is pretty close.</li>
            <li> Almost a hot pink mixed with salmon tones.</li>
            <li> It is a thicker polish, so be sure to use thin coats.</li>
            <li> This particular color is a little thicker than other ones I&#x27;ve used, but I still did 3 coats anyways because I like a really bold color.</li>
            <li> I only have 5 or 6 different colors of the Gelish, but this one is my new favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although it is a little more orange than the picture shows, as I thought the picture looked a little pinkish.</li>
            <li> I went for a manicure a few months ago at a higher end salon and they used Gelish polish on my nails.</li>
            <li> In 20 minutes, my nails were completely polished and dry.</li>
            <li> You have to focus on painting it on thin and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I think I will have to look for another color to go over the top to tame it down a little when I use it again.  </li>
            <li> Since then, my husband bought me a UV light because he got tired of me sitting on the couch waiting for my nails to dry only to mess them up and start over the next night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also made several other separate purchases from them without issue.</li>
            <li> Sally sells bottles half the size for same amount of money.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few colors that actually resembles the picture shown!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on Gelish and won&#x27;t buy any other brand.</li>
            <li> I also had no issues with its authenticity, which other reviewers have commented on.</li>
            <li> so I was very careful in applying the product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this color needs about 10 coats before my natural white tips disappear under this color.</li>
            <li> It will however wrinkle if you accidentally paint it on too thick and this is not a problem that i&#x27;ve had with other colors except for the white.  </li>
            <li> I have only one complaint about this product...</li>
            <li> It reads a little orange on me, but I like that.</li>
            <li> So when you use it try and paint it on as thin as possible to keep from shrinking.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;It goes on smoothly, no ripples or anything!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> then you dont know what you are missing.</li>
            <li> This polish has a thicker consistency than some of my other Gelish polishes, which I find easier to apply than those with a very thin consistency.</li>
            <li> I will also be using it with black in a couple weeks for Halloween!!!</li>
            <li> Polish goes on nicely (not too thin or thick).</li>
            <li> It goes on very thick.  </li>
            <li> It took 5 month before the painful blisters showed up under my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Overall, I do like this color. It&#x27;s very vibrant and I like that I don&#x27;t need to put too many coats on. I used two in the photo (see customer photos). It&#x27;s great for summer. It is orange-y red, but definitely more on the orange side. It is a thicker polish, so be sure to use thin coats. It would look great with a tan, but looks good on my Irish skin too.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this color choice.  It&#x27;s a very pretty summer coral and the quality seems very good.</li>

            <li> Absolutely love this product. The polish last 4 weeks or more, doesn&#x27;t lose its luster, and makes the nail slightly harder!!! LOVE this product!!!</li>
            <li> I know the pictures usually don&#x27;t reflect the actual color very well, but this one is pretty close. Although it is a little more orange than the picture shows, as I thought the picture looked a little pinkish. It&#x27;s an awesome color. Once I didn&#x27;t have time for 2 coats of color and was amazed at how well 1 coat turned out.</li>
            <li> Love this color, so much fun for summer, but not too bright or crazy that you can&#x27;t wear it to work.</li>
            <li> This is a great summer color. It is a little more orange than I thought it would be, but nonetheless it&#x27;s still a great color.</li>
            <li> use this brand exclusively</li>
            <li> I love the Gelish polish!  This color is really bright, like neon orange.  I think I will have to look for another color to go over the top to tame it down a little when I use it again.  It may look great for a pedicure this summer with a tan.</li>
            <li> the colour is just great - it is between light red and orange! i recomend it for fresh summer look.</li>
            <li> This color picture is spot on!  The Harmony website also has very accurate color samples if you&#x27;re looking for other colors.  This particular color is a little thicker than other ones I&#x27;ve used, but I still did 3 coats anyways because I like a really bold color.</li>

            <li> This is easily my favorite color for summer and has become the favorite of most of my clients as well!</li>
            <li> Great bright orange color that is a little on the red side!  One of my favorites this summer for sure!  I will also be using it with black in a couple weeks for Halloween!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty reddish orange color, it lasts just as long as any other gelish color.  It will however wrinkle if you accidentally paint it on too thick and this is not a problem that i&#x27;ve had with other colors except for the white.  You have to focus on painting it on thin and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a bright summer color, this one is it.  It is pretty bright orange, and does look pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I have a number of colors from Gelish, but this is one of my favorites. An orangy-red that isn&#x27;t too orange (I am usually classified as a \\&quot;winter\\&quot;, and it looks fine on me). Similar to the reds of the 1950s. I&#x27;ve also used a coat of this with a coat of Samuri on top, which gives it more of a cranberry look. A great addition, especially if you&#x27;re looking for a red that isn&#x27;t too dark.</li>
            <li> I love the gelish system and have started to collect a lot of the colors.  I was initially turned off by the description of this color being and orangey-red because I tend to like the more berry colored polishes.  BUT, I&#x27;m so glad I ended up getting this one.  The best way I can describe it is like a poppy color.  It IS kind of an orangey red, but there&#x27;s something more vibrant to it which, like many of the gelish colors, is more obvious out in the sunlight.  It becomes a vibrant coral color and looks great with a tan.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it on my fingers and toes and I can&#x27;t imagine changing it out any time soon.  Love it.</li>
            <li> i recieved quickly. would do buisness agian. thanks you for the product (Harmony Gelish UV Soak Off Gel Polish Tiger Blossom)</li>
            <li> This is a vibrant color and the online picture is very close to the actual color. I love Gelish products, but I still need to master the art if application. I recommend this color for the summer season or any time you want a loud pop on your fingers. Personally I prefer the more muted tones like Exhale. good luck in finding your colors!</li>
            <li> I like this color, but not a big fave. It has a red undertone which kinda throws it off for me, but it gives you good coverage with two coats.</li>
            <li> I went for a manicure a few months ago at a higher end salon and they used Gelish polish on my nails. I was amazed at how long it lasted and was actually a bit upset that I could not get the polish to come off very easily. Since then, my husband bought me a UV light because he got tired of me sitting on the couch waiting for my nails to dry only to mess them up and start over the next night. I found this polish and the starter kit on Amazon and decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s amazing! I found instructions online and followed them exactly. In 20 minutes, my nails were completely polished and dry. I was even able to take the laundry out of the dryer as soon as I was done. Plus, the color is beautiful and my nails feel stronger than ever. I can&#x27;t wait to see how they hold up. I&#x27;ve already told all my friends about how wonderful Gelish polish is!</li>
            <li> If your looking for a fun bright summer color this is perfect. Sort of a cross between bright orange and pink and it&#x27;s really pretty with any of the glitter polishes over top of it.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the Gelish system so far.  This color is kind of a jelly finish.  It goes on very sheer with one coat but evens out with two.  I expected it to be more red but it is a bright coral, much like OPI&#x27;s Guy Meets Galveston, which is one of my favorite colors so I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> This one of my favorite colors by gelish. The consistency is one of the better ones and the tiger lily orange is the perfect on trend color. love love love!</li>
            <li> This is a great color for summer it is what I would call an orange red it is very bright and almost has a deep pink look if that sounds possible. I didn&#x27;t buy this right away because I was not crazy about an orangish shade but I am so glad I bought this the color is beautiful not your typical red, I will buy this again!!</li>
            <li> I try this color because I want a color matches my hair color and skin tone, this color is perfect, I love it!!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this color! This is one of the first gelish colors that I bought, and it is fun, vibrant, and chip free. Tiger blossom is such a great red... It reminds me of an old timey WWII lady :-) I just love gelish and how easy it is to apply... I&#x27;m not a nail technician, but I love how my nails turn out when I use it, and this is one of my favorite go-to colors.  I&#x27;d recommend it as a must- have for anyone with a home gelish collection.</li>
            <li> This is a similar color to what I already have in another brand, but it&#x27;s in the Gelish system.  I love it and would recommend this color!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on Gelish and won&#x27;t buy any other brand. It wears like iron and covers in 2 coats. The Tiger Blossom color is one of my summer favorites. It&#x27;s perfect for anything you like to wear with coral in it, which I do a lot this time of year. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Bottle doesnt do this color justice. Its a beautiful coral color (looks red in bottle). Perfect color for all summer long.</li>
            <li> perfect color, perfect brand, its so pretty&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommenced it, i am very happy with the purchase. color is beautiful;</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Gelish polish purchase to date. The color is very  close to the swatch pictured. This color looks more orange than red on me, which I like. I have very fair skin with a yellow undertone. This polish has a thicker consistency than some of my other Gelish polishes, which I find easier to apply than those with a very thin consistency. I had no problems with curing it under my U Spicy LED light. I also had no issues with its authenticity, which other reviewers have commented on. I purchased my bottle from Beauty Shine. I&#x27;ve also made several other separate purchases from them without issue. I highly recommend this color!</li>
            <li> This is a nice orange, somewhat coral color. I would not considered a full coral because I don&#x27;t think it has enough pink. I do like it though and it is very fun and bright. I would recommend this if you like bright colors.</li>
            <li> Very accurate color as I look back at the color swatch.  I only wish this was a bit more salmon than neon.</li>
            <li> This color looks very &#x27;orange&#x27; but it is actually a nice coral color and looks great on almost all skin tones! I recommend this color if you are looking for a nice summer/fall color this year!</li>
            <li> Always buy my gel polishes on Amazon...much cheaper. This color is AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> Great summer color, love it!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product. I assume the original is a great product, but you will receive \\&quot;Tiger Blossum.\\&quot; It is not legitimate Gelish.</li>
            <li> This is a bright salmon color not orange like I expected. Still very pretty and great product!</li>
            <li> I only have 5 or 6 different colors of the Gelish, but this one is my new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time last week before a short vacation, and a week later, it looks as good as the day I applied it! (See photo.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glossy, bright and vivid, and applies smoothly and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this shade and the long-wearing properties of it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful summer orange!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT.  Get a lot more for your money.  Sally sells bottles half the size for same amount of money.  Will always buy here</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and does not bubble at all.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT summertime color!!! The perfect mix of red and orange for a summer time &amp;#34;pop of red&amp;#34; that isn&#x27;t so wintery. Love Gelish and this is my new favorite nail color :)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so I was very careful in applying the product. I followed the directions precisely and I still developed an allergy to the product. It took 5 month before the painful blisters showed up under my fingernails.  I tried giving my nails 2months off but the blisters came back faster that before. But before the blister I LOVED this stuff I can not say enough good about it. I am posting this review so that people know that even if you follow the directions and fully cure the product you can develop an allergy (though it appears to be rare); it did not even occur to me that this could happen!</li>
            <li> This is a bold orangeish red that is perfect for summer.  Really good color and no issues with application.  I find the color to fun and bright but still office appropriate.</li>
            <li> The color is great!!! - The quality of the polish is not. The product would not cure completely and bubbles. I had to reapply twice and still got bubbles on the sides of my nails.</li>
            <li> Such a fun color!! I would describe it as a bright orangish/red. Nicely represented in the photos. Color covered well with 2 coats. Going to be a fun summer color, I&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li> This color is very pretty like the picture; however, this color does shrink and wrinkle.  It goes on very thick.  So when you use it try and paint it on as thin as possible to keep from shrinking.  Very pretty color.  I do not regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> This orange-red color (obviously more red than orange) is great for when I&#x27;m feeling sassy and fun ;)&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly, no ripples or anything!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I have only one complaint about this product...I didn&#x27;t invent it. I love this stuff. If you haven&#x27;t tried gel polish then you dont know what you are missing. Perfect manicure and stays without chipping and it&#x27;s high gloss for weeks and I am usually a pretty busy gal and my hands see a lot of action. The best!!</li>
            <li> I really like this polish! It goes on evenly, it cures easily, it stays on! The color is a beautiful and bright darker orange (between regular orange and red).</li>
            <li> This is one of the few colors that actually resembles the picture shown! Great for summer. I received this product within 5 days of placing my order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of gel polishes and Gelish is by far the best quality.  The colors are gorgeous, it goes on easily, cures/dries quickly and lasts weeks!  I&#x27;m saving tons of money doing my own nails</li>
            <li> This is a great summer color.  It&#x27;s very vibrant and is applied evenly in just two coats.  I receive compliments on the color every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product, and a timely delivery. I checked all over and it was the best price there was.Only one problem. The color looks red in ALL pictures but it&#x27;s really orange. Not the vender&#x27;s fault. What more can I say!</li>
            <li> Beautiful vibrant color. Almost a hot pink mixed with salmon tones. (Pink/ orange blend) One of my favorites! Stays on for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even like red! This is like a reddish orange but it&#x27;s super cute. This is my go to color and it looks shiny and perfect at the 3 week mark! Definitely a must have!</li>
            <li> Love the color.  Perfect color for fall/winter. Do not need to put 3 or 4 coats to make it visible on your nails.</li>
            <li> I use this brand of polish usually with no problem but this color (which I Love) seems to ripple and bubble. I don&#x27;t put it on any differently and I can&#x27;t understand why it is doing this.</li>
            <li> This color looks alot like Cajun Shrimp by OPI.  It is a bright coral/orange color and great for the summer.  It stayed bright and  shiny the entire time.</li>
            <li> This is a nice bright orange color.  No red undertones.  I would rate this a warm color.  Looks nice with many things.</li>
            <li> I really like this color. I also like the product.  It was easy to work with and I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> warm red / orange. great color. perfect true match to the online swatch. two coats gets total coverage. my new fave!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful orange/pink color- perfect for spring and summer! Polish goes on nicely (not too thin or thick).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this color needs about 10 coats before my natural white tips disappear under this color. Otherwise you can see them so prominently I just won&#x27;t wear it on my fingers. I had this color on my toes and loved it. I got two compliments at the beach.</li>
            <li> This is one of the nicest, bright, summery colors there are.  It is wonderful!  It&lt;br /&gt;goes on nice and lasts the typical 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Wonderful spring color, bright and vivid.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great color. It turned out more orangey than I thought it would be but I still love it! It also depends on the light. I&#x27;ve had it on my toes for about 3 weeks now and it still hasn&#x27;t chipped!</li>
            <li> The colour is perfect</li>
            <li> nice color, good product</li>
            <li> I wear this in the summer and it&#x27;s a coral like red- I&#x27;m super pale and I get compliments on it all the time. It reads a little orange on me, but I like that.</li>
            <li> I love Gelish Brand.  This color is really pretty much the same as the picture.....it&#x27;s a nice color.  Delivery was quick and the product is excellent.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful color on any skin tone!! I recommend this product. I my order in a couple of days.. with no problem :D</li>
            <li> This is a really nice summer color, orange but not neon orange kind of has a slight pink but definitely orange.</li>
