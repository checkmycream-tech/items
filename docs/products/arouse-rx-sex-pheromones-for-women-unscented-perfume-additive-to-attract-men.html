            <li>, I will for sure let you know, and here&#x27;s hoping for the best (God!</li>
            <li>Went out to do some errands, and as I was walking by a man who was pumping gas, he smiled and said &#x27;Man!</li>
            <li>and I smiled to myself because it was this beautiful thing...</li>
            <li>This stuf is good</li>
            <li>All I  need is a couple of drops I&#x27;m good for a night on the town.  </li>
            <li>Every time I went out, and wore this, lets just say good things happened.</li>
            <li>he said you smell good what are you wearing...</li>
            <li>you smell good</li>
            <li>The good thing about this product is that you can&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t figure out why there are some good reviews on this item.</li>
            <li>At best, it has the smell of a cheap scented oil-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, does not feel greasy or conflict with perfume, and makes me feel good when i go out - like I&#x27;m wearing invisible armor or something!</li>
            <li>I have my fingers crossed that this will work for me :)!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Olive oil would work better!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing  </li>
            <li>It ended up being a great night of love making, but I wanted to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a fluke</li>
            <li>and I bought this to increase my chances of being popular with the guys while away at school.</li>
            <li>I honestly did not think this product would work.</li>
            <li>Order at your own risk.  </li>
            <li>#34;what are you wearing?&amp;#34; I smiled and said &amp;#34;I will never tell&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>but it seems effective on some individuals.</li>
            <li>and Im going to tell you my honest answer:</li>
            <li>Husband liked the perfume, but I wear it all the time.</li>
            <li>the kind you can get for $10 from someone at a sidewalk kiosk.</li>
            <li>Smells great for that special someone.</li>
            <li>&quot;.. I am very nice and friendly and flirt with men all the time.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this stuff to be honest.</li>
            <li>but it places these drops and wow wonderful....</li>
            <li>Honestly if this stuff worked they wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep it in stock.  </li>
            <li>The guy was kind of cute and was a lawyer.</li>
            <li>Received this very quickly and opened it up even quicker!</li>
            <li>She meet a great looking guy and is back to her happy self again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it had anything magical.</li>
            <li>guys dont even look at me i think they would notice me better before than now with this oil thingy  </li>
            <li>guys would notice me more n talk and</li>
            <li>but he wast tht way before using this product  ok</li>
            <li>Men are much more flirtatious around me when I am wearing them, and they also seem to be more receptive to my suggestions.</li>
            <li>Since she doesn&#x27;t need it any more, I use it now.</li>
            <li>I really wish that i culd say great things about this product</li>
            <li>Im a confident woman who lile to experiment to see if things are what ppl say they are.</li>
            <li>He told me he never wanted to have sex with me more</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to ask for more on my birthdays and any holidays.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sure it all the time, just when I&#x27;m in the mood.</li>
            <li>More men approach me today</li>
            <li>-Today I decided to put more of this thing on me..</li>
            <li>I invited some girlfriends over and ended up having more people than I had food for</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause men to fall at my feet professing undying love for me or anything like that</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Im not so sure about this stuff.</li>
            <li>I notice alot of Women paying attention to me and talking to me more.</li>
            <li>He was more touchy feelings all day and night.  </li>
            <li>There is definitely more bonding and sweetness from both side.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made sure to dab some on every time he is around.  </li>
            <li>I do get more attention from sales men when I wear it in stores</li>
            <li>, my boyfriend gets more amorous when I have it on, and I notice getting checked out more when I wear it.</li>
            <li>I have used this a there has been no change in the love life.</li>
            <li>I wore it dressed sexy and lounge around my mate hoping to excite him -</li>
            <li>Wife has more women hotting on her than guys and LOVES it</li>
            <li>I believe this has enhanced my power over most men though..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been noticing more attention from guys - albeit the delivery guys and waiters at my favorite restaurant -</li>
            <li>what is interesting is that during business meetings all the men hang on my every word.</li>
            <li>BUT u may want to try to to love ur self more and then mens will be attract it to u.</li>
            <li>Ok so I bought this to try it out on my husband...</li>
            <li>but I put way more than 2-3 drops</li>
            <li>Have tried another brand that I noticed better results with .</li>
            <li>He just couldn&#x27;t keep his hands off me! :)</li>
            <li>Yes when I put it on men became more sociable, I don&#x27;t think they desired to jump my bones</li>
            <li>, the guys look at me more, smiling me and even give me presents.</li>
            <li>I had this boost of confidence and he couldn&#x27;t stop touching me</li>
            <li>But I sure will try to find out.</li>
            <li>It gave me a dose of confidence also more men were looking at me, my guy is nicer to me when am wearing it.</li>
            <li>he was much more</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ll be able to buy another one..</li>
            <li>He struck up a conversation with me in the break room for the first time!!!</li>
            <li>I am attractive but older and wanted to see if this makes a difference to men around me.</li>
            <li>Everything seemed like the first day we met and he even told me he loved me and kissed me.</li>
            <li>It is much more economical and effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed men have been more sociable around me, and much more polite -- totally bizarre for people around my age group.</li>
            <li>however, he is much more attentive the days I wear it.</li>
            <li>and now he is more available and playful to be around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Item is perfect and as expected.</li>
            <li>I was cool, collected, and had on my best red lipstick.  </li>
            <li>it was kind of fun.</li>
            <li>At work, they are much more friendly...  </li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s odorless it is easy to mix in with any perfume I choose to wear that day.</li>
            <li>Let me first start by saying that I&#x27;m a pretty attractive gal to begin with.</li>
            <li>It really worked like magic!  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money, buy something sexy as a cream or perfume, that works better than this junk!</li>
            <li>but when I applied it according to the instructions, it had a huge effect on him.</li>
            <li>A freshman actually, and my Moyer bought this for me as a gift, to help me feel attractive.</li>
            <li>The temperature must be important to store it.</li>
            <li>very different lol</li>
            <li>In the beginning, I applied it after I applied a light spritz of perfume.</li>
            <li>so happy to send this back but do not except returns.</li>
            <li>Cerruti 1881 - a light floral fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be a lot of money to be made in the placebo effect</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Well I say I love it,real test hasn&#x60;t been done yet,but let me tell you if you&#x60;re in love with your best friend put some of this on!Of all people to turn on was my best buddy of 17 yrs.!Works a little too good!It was crazy didn&#x60;t expect it to work that good and fast!</li>
            <li>And when we made love that night, he was definitely more aggressive than normal.  </li>
            <li>Of the various perfumes I have used recommend Egyptian Goddess, Love or Rose - Auric Blends Fine Perfume Oil .... men are transformed from a kitten to a lion.</li>
            <li>We had a good laugh over this one and have resumed using the inexpensive Italian cologne he most enjoys:</li>
            <li>Try smiling at the person you are interested, crack a joke and ask questions... that seems to work much better.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s good for a mental boost, more than anything...</li>
            <li>I would recommend ( :) positive energy)</li>
            <li>- perhaps the people wearing this allowed their beast out to play a bit more and that&#x27;s what resulted in all the positive results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For sure a good attitude and a smile goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In addition, I tried just wearing it around town as a test to see if I got any special attention from men</li>
            <li>I use it 3 times a day for full effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I will say a good makeover will go a lot further in attracting men that this stuff ever will.  </li>
            <li>This is a good investment, I already order my second bottle !</li>
            <li>but I liked the quick response in the very beginning when I first used it.</li>
            <li>My husband is usually pretty touchy-feely and incredibly easy to turn on...</li>
            <li>I have had other pheromone products but the reviews on this were so great</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really have any kind of smell at all, and did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>i used it many times in many different situations</li>
            <li>really believe that most of the positive reviews about this pheromone bootle are fake,what a shame!</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t seem to mind the free drinks we rack up, haha!</li>
            <li>I use it before bedtime with my boyfriend and he seems to be more &amp;#34;in the mood&amp;#34; than normal when I wear it.</li>
            <li>My new hair cut worked better.</li>
            <li>Bought this product now I am married to a prince!</li>
            <li>I better stay far away from you!&amp;#34; I smiled back and went into the store.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think this is the right product.</li>
            <li>and even when running errands because, you never know where Mr. Right is hiding.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I just haven&#x27;t worn it to the right places?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with Arouse that I purchased an additional six bottles just to save on cost since it has become a daily ritual much like putting on shoes.</li>
            <li>Emperoro is Naked&amp;#34; when everyone else was admiring his fine new clothing.</li>
            <li>As already noted by another reviewer (who was immediately taken to task for expressing their opinion in their review..shocking), it is highly probable that most, if not all, of the reviews here are submitted by people who work for this company hence the high star rating.</li>
            <li>Nothing like using this little bottle up in about 2 weeks at best if you plan on following those instructions.</li>
            <li>I bought this along with some fun, sophisticated sex items to liven up my husband and my ten year marriage.</li>
            <li>No lie, this stuff is perfect revenge making in a tiny little bottle!</li>
            <li>Not only did he not &amp;#34;bond&amp;#34; with me more like it should be if the product had worked</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>This was the stuff that use to happen to me 10 years ago, before getting married and having kids...</li>
            <li>I really dont have a problem with getting a mans attention, just thought it would be fun.</li>
            <li>I am married and my husband was without giving attention me.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if its the placebo effect, but this product has definitely given me more confidence when it comes to conversations.  </li>
            <li>and I just feel sexier and therfore attract more attention or if the pheramones are doing the work, but I have seen a response to it over the last couple of months.</li>
            <li>Clearly, MOST of the reviews for this product were written by the same person.</li>
            <li>and is very oily !</li>
            <li>Pretty embarrased to say that I bought this because I feel tricked.</li>
            <li>i used more that 6 times as directed but no different.</li>
            <li>, i can not put anything higher than 1, id like to put 0 but 1</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>First time trying these products</li>
            <li>In the first 3 days I wore it</li>
            <li>he was being so nice to me which he hasn&#x27;t been lately due to our break up.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to any woman who wants more control over the opposite sex</li>
            <li>Noticed a positive difference.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone, It really does work ;)</li>
            <li>&amp; I feel I have more success with the other brands...</li>
            <li>This do not work, you have been warned, so do not waste your money, I really wish that it did, but lets be honest, theirs no such thing.</li>
            <li>There has been no dramatic change in guys around me</li>
            <li>not stop looking at me and win I left the ather guy that was in thare tearned and looked me up and down</li>
            <li>Its has been about 8 months (maybe more) and still single.</li>
            <li>Loool when I first got it, my boyfriend would sniff the spots where I secretly put it and get more sexually assertive.</li>
            <li>I am going out to meet new people, hopefully I run into Mr. Right</li>
            <li>The booths at the trade shows my company attend always use various gimmicks to attract people to them, free shirts, pens, trashy women in skimpy outfits, etc.</li>
            <li>Before I used these, I felt very under appreciated at the office.  </li>
            <li>This absolutely doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>&quot; crowd in high school and am looking to change that!</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell if this product really works.</li>
            <li>but it was very</li>
            <li>there really is something to it</li>
            <li>I have not had men taking that much notice just WOMEN.</li>
            <li>Once I noticed I was not getting any results, I switched to wearing it alone which really made no difference as I got no results at all.</li>
            <li>No \\&quot;extra\\&quot; attention, no whirling of heads, no secret crush asking me out - nothing.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>We may have put on too much, we were both in the car with the windows up</li>
            <li>and I got really zoned out</li>
            <li>and she got really talkative.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I use, this stuff does not work.  </li>
            <li>TO SEE WHAT IT&#x27;S REALLY ABOUT.</li>
            <li>Fast shiping , N O  D</li>
            <li>and I knew he was going to be \\&quot;ready for me\\&quot; even without the pheromones</li>
            <li>This really seems to work.</li>
            <li>I am real, and REALLY hoping this stuff works.</li>
            <li>had a bet with my friends to see if this really works</li>
            <li>she got no game play from the men...</li>
            <li>This stuff really works,My son father was coming to pick him up for a doctor appointment</li>
            <li>I dont get any smiles, or looks in fact I notice men and women both very indifferent with me.</li>
            <li>In fact he didn&#x27;t really pay much attention to her at all</li>
            <li>and there really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It is another product promising change in your life, but another product that doesn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li>but makes my adrenaline level go up like having too much caffeine.</li>
            <li>then my own perfume I wear everyday.</li>
            <li>Other pheromones have worked WAAAAY better.</li>
            <li>I also love that it is unscented because it doesn&#x27;t disturb my other fragrances.</li>
            <li>I seriously feel the reviewers who praise and refer to this as the magic of attraction are full of it.</li>
            <li>They seemed more alert &amp; flirtatious..with other women!</li>
            <li>I ordered this product hoping not to sexually attract potential employers, but to leave that &#x27;lasting impression&#x27; they just couldn&#x27;t put their finger on.</li>
            <li>I received more affection with my male counter part, prior to using this product, than I did after using it.</li>
            <li>I tried this product on several times as indicated ahead of team meetings lasting more than one hour and also at cocktail parties and bars.</li>
            <li>This item has absolutely no scent at all, so as far as I know, it might just be a bottle with nothing more than kitchen oil inside.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this but got nothing.  </li>
            <li>High hopes</li>
            <li>When i first used Arouse-Rx Sex Pheromones, right when i had put it on, i started feeling weird, a kind of feeling i haven&#x27;t experience before.</li>
            <li>And a little more touchy feely.</li>
            <li>i normally do wit out da pheremone.</li>
            <li>I did it a few more times and nothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not getting any younger and really want to get married.  </li>
            <li>What I do to attract new clients is wear pheromones.</li>
            <li>I gathered fewer new leads.</li>
            <li>And when he asked to take me home, I very clearly ripped him a new one.  </li>
            <li>The cute, younger checker at the grocery store who is usually just surfacey and polite, totally chatted me up, told me I looked familiar and he swore he knew me from somewhere and then brushed my hand with a smile on his face when he handed me my change.</li>
            <li>and I have not noticed any more attention than usual...</li>
            <li>(Hey...in today&#x27;s job market...I&#x27;m willing to try whatever to make me stand out from the 50 others applying for the same job!!)</li>
            <li>I do notice that when I wear this my hubby&#x27;s attitude changes and he seems more aggressive than usual.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money, doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money!</li>
            <li>I want to use it to give me an extra boost, so I can attract a man that I am interested in.</li>
            <li>I did get attention more than usual...</li>
            <li>Any other men didn&#x27;t pay any special attention...</li>
            <li>I feel less shy and just feel more outgoing, love it!</li>
            <li>I tried it at different times with men and women and did not notice any positive difference.</li>
            <li>No one will fall down at your feet, but I think people were friendly.</li>
            <li>I purchased Arouse Rx through the authorized dealer on eBay a little over a month ago after reading the fabulous reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>like wow this ish supposed to attract him not to ignore me</li>
            <li>I tried this product, applying it as directed, 3-4 times per day to wrists and neck for nearly two weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely odorless</li>
            <li>And there is definitely a reason why this stuff isn&#x27;t very well known or promoted...</li>
            <li>I am a well preserved 40 year old and he was probably in his early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Well this is the biggest gimmick I have found thus far.</li>
            <li>I have tried another phermone product that makes a wow</li>
            <li>(Factor in I have naturally lower amounts of estrogen)</li>
            <li>Okay, Representative-of-the-company, you could have at least changed up your writing style a bit.</li>
            <li>but so far.....</li>
            <li>so I had put some on the pressure points on my neck and wrist to see if this stuff really works all of a sudden</li>
            <li>I guess the placebo effect is alive and well</li>
            <li>For the record, men are NOT that sensitive that they can be turned on by a product that has no scent at all.  </li>
            <li>I tried much more expensive though but worth it.  </li>
            <li>My European husband had to laugh at how gullible Americans remain to the same huckster quackery that has been in vogue for hundreds of years.</li>
            <li>The only plus to using this product is that my wrists and neck are probably a bit more moisturized than usual because of applying oil to them three times daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my husband to look for to me much now and arrives from the strange work.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t give low ratings</li>
            <li>but I had no other choice on this product.</li>
            <li>I;m not hating this oil, I just think the other oils are a little better quality...</li>
            <li>I have pretty realistic expectations when it come to pheromones, however all the times I&#x27;ve worn the product on my neck and wrist and interacted with men and women, I&#x27;ve seen no meaningful result.</li>
            <li>The friendly people remained friendly and the cold ones remained so.</li>
            <li>but honestly it has failed me.</li>
            <li>My secret love potion.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products by this vendor and really like this one.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to wear it regularly &amp; hope for positive results like the other brand oils.</li>
            <li>So far I have only used them at work, but I plan on trying them out at a party next week.  </li>
            <li>The other \\&quot;good reviews\\&quot; on here are obviously fake also.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t tell anybody I ordered it and kept it hidden, as a test to see if it really worked.</li>
            <li>I wore it to various social situations including at school, at the store, at work, at parties, at clubs, and even around guys that I have known for years.</li>
            <li>You would be better off using water, saving the $30, and at the very least water will quench your thirst unlike this snake oil!</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is I felt a little strange after I put it on, almost buzzed.  </li>
            <li>I ended up getting hit on by the UPS guy, a fat man who took second prize at a local moustache competition, an old guy that lives out of his pickup near the park I work at and this sneaky little Mexican guy who works at the Shell.</li>
            <li>That can be a good or bad thing</li>
    </ol>

            <li> , I will for sure let you know, and here&#x27;s hoping for the best (God!</li>
            <li> Went out to do some errands, and as I was walking by a man who was pumping gas, he smiled and said &#x27;Man!</li>
            <li> and I smiled to myself because it was this beautiful thing...</li>
            <li> This stuf is good</li>
            <li> All I  need is a couple of drops I&#x27;m good for a night on the town.  </li>
            <li> Every time I went out, and wore this, lets just say good things happened.</li>
            <li> he said you smell good what are you wearing...</li>
            <li> you smell good</li>
            <li> The good thing about this product is that you can&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out why there are some good reviews on this item.</li>
            <li> At best, it has the smell of a cheap scented oil-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, does not feel greasy or conflict with perfume, and makes me feel good when i go out - like I&#x27;m wearing invisible armor or something!</li>
            <li> I have my fingers crossed that this will work for me :)!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Olive oil would work better!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing  </li>
            <li> It ended up being a great night of love making, but I wanted to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a fluke</li>
            <li> and I bought this to increase my chances of being popular with the guys while away at school.</li>
            <li> I honestly did not think this product would work.</li>
            <li> Order at your own risk.  </li>
            <li> #34;what are you wearing?&amp;#34; I smiled and said &amp;#34;I will never tell&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> but it seems effective on some individuals.</li>
            <li> and Im going to tell you my honest answer:</li>
            <li> Husband liked the perfume, but I wear it all the time.</li>
            <li> the kind you can get for $10 from someone at a sidewalk kiosk.</li>
            <li> Smells great for that special someone.</li>
            <li> &quot;.. I am very nice and friendly and flirt with men all the time.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this stuff to be honest.</li>
            <li> but it places these drops and wow wonderful....</li>
            <li> Honestly if this stuff worked they wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep it in stock.  </li>
            <li> The guy was kind of cute and was a lawyer.</li>
            <li> Received this very quickly and opened it up even quicker!</li>
            <li> She meet a great looking guy and is back to her happy self again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it had anything magical.</li>
            <li> guys dont even look at me i think they would notice me better before than now with this oil thingy  </li>
            <li> guys would notice me more n talk and</li>
            <li> but he wast tht way before using this product  ok</li>
            <li> Men are much more flirtatious around me when I am wearing them, and they also seem to be more receptive to my suggestions.</li>
            <li> Since she doesn&#x27;t need it any more, I use it now.</li>
            <li> I really wish that i culd say great things about this product</li>
            <li> Im a confident woman who lile to experiment to see if things are what ppl say they are.</li>
            <li> He told me he never wanted to have sex with me more</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to ask for more on my birthdays and any holidays.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sure it all the time, just when I&#x27;m in the mood.</li>
            <li> More men approach me today</li>
            <li> -Today I decided to put more of this thing on me..</li>
            <li> I invited some girlfriends over and ended up having more people than I had food for</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause men to fall at my feet professing undying love for me or anything like that</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Im not so sure about this stuff.</li>
            <li> I notice alot of Women paying attention to me and talking to me more.</li>
            <li> He was more touchy feelings all day and night.  </li>
            <li> There is definitely more bonding and sweetness from both side.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made sure to dab some on every time he is around.  </li>
            <li> I do get more attention from sales men when I wear it in stores</li>
            <li> , my boyfriend gets more amorous when I have it on, and I notice getting checked out more when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I have used this a there has been no change in the love life.</li>
            <li> I wore it dressed sexy and lounge around my mate hoping to excite him -</li>
            <li> Wife has more women hotting on her than guys and LOVES it</li>
            <li> I believe this has enhanced my power over most men though..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been noticing more attention from guys - albeit the delivery guys and waiters at my favorite restaurant -</li>
            <li> what is interesting is that during business meetings all the men hang on my every word.</li>
            <li> BUT u may want to try to to love ur self more and then mens will be attract it to u.</li>
            <li> Ok so I bought this to try it out on my husband...</li>
            <li> but I put way more than 2-3 drops</li>
            <li> Have tried another brand that I noticed better results with .</li>
            <li> He just couldn&#x27;t keep his hands off me! :)</li>
            <li> Yes when I put it on men became more sociable, I don&#x27;t think they desired to jump my bones</li>
            <li> , the guys look at me more, smiling me and even give me presents.</li>
            <li> I had this boost of confidence and he couldn&#x27;t stop touching me</li>
            <li> But I sure will try to find out.</li>
            <li> It gave me a dose of confidence also more men were looking at me, my guy is nicer to me when am wearing it.</li>
            <li> he was much more</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ll be able to buy another one..</li>
            <li> He struck up a conversation with me in the break room for the first time!!!</li>
            <li> I am attractive but older and wanted to see if this makes a difference to men around me.</li>
            <li> Everything seemed like the first day we met and he even told me he loved me and kissed me.</li>
            <li> It is much more economical and effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed men have been more sociable around me, and much more polite -- totally bizarre for people around my age group.</li>
            <li> however, he is much more attentive the days I wear it.</li>
            <li> and now he is more available and playful to be around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Item is perfect and as expected.</li>
            <li> I was cool, collected, and had on my best red lipstick.  </li>
            <li> it was kind of fun.</li>
            <li> At work, they are much more friendly...  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s odorless it is easy to mix in with any perfume I choose to wear that day.</li>
            <li> Let me first start by saying that I&#x27;m a pretty attractive gal to begin with.</li>
            <li> It really worked like magic!  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money, buy something sexy as a cream or perfume, that works better than this junk!</li>
            <li> but when I applied it according to the instructions, it had a huge effect on him.</li>
            <li> A freshman actually, and my Moyer bought this for me as a gift, to help me feel attractive.</li>
            <li> The temperature must be important to store it.</li>
            <li> very different lol</li>
            <li> In the beginning, I applied it after I applied a light spritz of perfume.</li>
            <li> so happy to send this back but do not except returns.</li>
            <li> Cerruti 1881 - a light floral fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be a lot of money to be made in the placebo effect</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Well I say I love it,real test hasn&#x60;t been done yet,but let me tell you if you&#x60;re in love with your best friend put some of this on!Of all people to turn on was my best buddy of 17 yrs.!Works a little too good!It was crazy didn&#x60;t expect it to work that good and fast!</li>
            <li> And when we made love that night, he was definitely more aggressive than normal.  </li>
            <li> Of the various perfumes I have used recommend Egyptian Goddess, Love or Rose - Auric Blends Fine Perfume Oil .... men are transformed from a kitten to a lion.</li>
            <li> We had a good laugh over this one and have resumed using the inexpensive Italian cologne he most enjoys:</li>
            <li> Try smiling at the person you are interested, crack a joke and ask questions... that seems to work much better.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s good for a mental boost, more than anything...</li>
            <li> I would recommend ( :) positive energy)</li>
            <li> - perhaps the people wearing this allowed their beast out to play a bit more and that&#x27;s what resulted in all the positive results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For sure a good attitude and a smile goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In addition, I tried just wearing it around town as a test to see if I got any special attention from men</li>
            <li> I use it 3 times a day for full effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I will say a good makeover will go a lot further in attracting men that this stuff ever will.  </li>
            <li> This is a good investment, I already order my second bottle !</li>
            <li> but I liked the quick response in the very beginning when I first used it.</li>
            <li> My husband is usually pretty touchy-feely and incredibly easy to turn on...</li>
            <li> I have had other pheromone products but the reviews on this were so great</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really have any kind of smell at all, and did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> i used it many times in many different situations</li>
            <li> really believe that most of the positive reviews about this pheromone bootle are fake,what a shame!</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t seem to mind the free drinks we rack up, haha!</li>
            <li> I use it before bedtime with my boyfriend and he seems to be more &amp;#34;in the mood&amp;#34; than normal when I wear it.</li>
            <li> My new hair cut worked better.</li>
            <li> Bought this product now I am married to a prince!</li>
            <li> I better stay far away from you!&amp;#34; I smiled back and went into the store.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think this is the right product.</li>
            <li> and even when running errands because, you never know where Mr. Right is hiding.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I just haven&#x27;t worn it to the right places?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with Arouse that I purchased an additional six bottles just to save on cost since it has become a daily ritual much like putting on shoes.</li>
            <li> Emperoro is Naked&amp;#34; when everyone else was admiring his fine new clothing.</li>
            <li> As already noted by another reviewer (who was immediately taken to task for expressing their opinion in their review..shocking), it is highly probable that most, if not all, of the reviews here are submitted by people who work for this company hence the high star rating.</li>
            <li> Nothing like using this little bottle up in about 2 weeks at best if you plan on following those instructions.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with some fun, sophisticated sex items to liven up my husband and my ten year marriage.</li>
            <li> No lie, this stuff is perfect revenge making in a tiny little bottle!</li>
            <li> Not only did he not &amp;#34;bond&amp;#34; with me more like it should be if the product had worked</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> This was the stuff that use to happen to me 10 years ago, before getting married and having kids...</li>
            <li> I really dont have a problem with getting a mans attention, just thought it would be fun.</li>
            <li> I am married and my husband was without giving attention me.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if its the placebo effect, but this product has definitely given me more confidence when it comes to conversations.  </li>
            <li> and I just feel sexier and therfore attract more attention or if the pheramones are doing the work, but I have seen a response to it over the last couple of months.</li>
            <li> Clearly, MOST of the reviews for this product were written by the same person.</li>
            <li> and is very oily !</li>
            <li> Pretty embarrased to say that I bought this because I feel tricked.</li>
            <li> i used more that 6 times as directed but no different.</li>
            <li> , i can not put anything higher than 1, id like to put 0 but 1</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> First time trying these products</li>
            <li> In the first 3 days I wore it</li>
            <li> he was being so nice to me which he hasn&#x27;t been lately due to our break up.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to any woman who wants more control over the opposite sex</li>
            <li> Noticed a positive difference.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone, It really does work ;)</li>
            <li> &amp; I feel I have more success with the other brands...</li>
            <li> This do not work, you have been warned, so do not waste your money, I really wish that it did, but lets be honest, theirs no such thing.</li>
            <li> There has been no dramatic change in guys around me</li>
            <li> not stop looking at me and win I left the ather guy that was in thare tearned and looked me up and down</li>
            <li> Its has been about 8 months (maybe more) and still single.</li>
            <li> Loool when I first got it, my boyfriend would sniff the spots where I secretly put it and get more sexually assertive.</li>
            <li> I am going out to meet new people, hopefully I run into Mr. Right</li>
            <li> The booths at the trade shows my company attend always use various gimmicks to attract people to them, free shirts, pens, trashy women in skimpy outfits, etc.</li>
            <li> Before I used these, I felt very under appreciated at the office.  </li>
            <li> This absolutely doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> &quot; crowd in high school and am looking to change that!</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell if this product really works.</li>
            <li> but it was very</li>
            <li> there really is something to it</li>
            <li> I have not had men taking that much notice just WOMEN.</li>
            <li> Once I noticed I was not getting any results, I switched to wearing it alone which really made no difference as I got no results at all.</li>
            <li> No \\&quot;extra\\&quot; attention, no whirling of heads, no secret crush asking me out - nothing.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> We may have put on too much, we were both in the car with the windows up</li>
            <li> and I got really zoned out</li>
            <li> and she got really talkative.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I use, this stuff does not work.  </li>
            <li> TO SEE WHAT IT&#x27;S REALLY ABOUT.</li>
            <li> Fast shiping , N O  D</li>
            <li> and I knew he was going to be \\&quot;ready for me\\&quot; even without the pheromones</li>
            <li> This really seems to work.</li>
            <li> I am real, and REALLY hoping this stuff works.</li>
            <li> had a bet with my friends to see if this really works</li>
            <li> she got no game play from the men...</li>
            <li> This stuff really works,My son father was coming to pick him up for a doctor appointment</li>
            <li> I dont get any smiles, or looks in fact I notice men and women both very indifferent with me.</li>
            <li> In fact he didn&#x27;t really pay much attention to her at all</li>
            <li> and there really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It is another product promising change in your life, but another product that doesn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> but makes my adrenaline level go up like having too much caffeine.</li>
            <li> then my own perfume I wear everyday.</li>
            <li> Other pheromones have worked WAAAAY better.</li>
            <li> I also love that it is unscented because it doesn&#x27;t disturb my other fragrances.</li>
            <li> I seriously feel the reviewers who praise and refer to this as the magic of attraction are full of it.</li>
            <li> They seemed more alert &amp; flirtatious..with other women!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product hoping not to sexually attract potential employers, but to leave that &#x27;lasting impression&#x27; they just couldn&#x27;t put their finger on.</li>
            <li> I received more affection with my male counter part, prior to using this product, than I did after using it.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on several times as indicated ahead of team meetings lasting more than one hour and also at cocktail parties and bars.</li>
            <li> This item has absolutely no scent at all, so as far as I know, it might just be a bottle with nothing more than kitchen oil inside.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this but got nothing.  </li>
            <li> High hopes</li>
            <li> When i first used Arouse-Rx Sex Pheromones, right when i had put it on, i started feeling weird, a kind of feeling i haven&#x27;t experience before.</li>
            <li> And a little more touchy feely.</li>
            <li> i normally do wit out da pheremone.</li>
            <li> I did it a few more times and nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not getting any younger and really want to get married.  </li>
            <li> What I do to attract new clients is wear pheromones.</li>
            <li> I gathered fewer new leads.</li>
            <li> And when he asked to take me home, I very clearly ripped him a new one.  </li>
            <li> The cute, younger checker at the grocery store who is usually just surfacey and polite, totally chatted me up, told me I looked familiar and he swore he knew me from somewhere and then brushed my hand with a smile on his face when he handed me my change.</li>
            <li> and I have not noticed any more attention than usual...</li>
            <li> (Hey...in today&#x27;s job market...I&#x27;m willing to try whatever to make me stand out from the 50 others applying for the same job!!)</li>
            <li> I do notice that when I wear this my hubby&#x27;s attitude changes and he seems more aggressive than usual.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money, doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money!</li>
            <li> I want to use it to give me an extra boost, so I can attract a man that I am interested in.</li>
            <li> I did get attention more than usual...</li>
            <li> Any other men didn&#x27;t pay any special attention...</li>
            <li> I feel less shy and just feel more outgoing, love it!</li>
            <li> I tried it at different times with men and women and did not notice any positive difference.</li>
            <li> No one will fall down at your feet, but I think people were friendly.</li>
            <li> I purchased Arouse Rx through the authorized dealer on eBay a little over a month ago after reading the fabulous reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> like wow this ish supposed to attract him not to ignore me</li>
            <li> I tried this product, applying it as directed, 3-4 times per day to wrists and neck for nearly two weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely odorless</li>
            <li> And there is definitely a reason why this stuff isn&#x27;t very well known or promoted...</li>
            <li> I am a well preserved 40 year old and he was probably in his early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Well this is the biggest gimmick I have found thus far.</li>
            <li> I have tried another phermone product that makes a wow</li>
            <li> (Factor in I have naturally lower amounts of estrogen)</li>
            <li> Okay, Representative-of-the-company, you could have at least changed up your writing style a bit.</li>
            <li> but so far.....</li>
            <li> so I had put some on the pressure points on my neck and wrist to see if this stuff really works all of a sudden</li>
            <li> I guess the placebo effect is alive and well</li>
            <li> For the record, men are NOT that sensitive that they can be turned on by a product that has no scent at all.  </li>
            <li> I tried much more expensive though but worth it.  </li>
            <li> My European husband had to laugh at how gullible Americans remain to the same huckster quackery that has been in vogue for hundreds of years.</li>
            <li> The only plus to using this product is that my wrists and neck are probably a bit more moisturized than usual because of applying oil to them three times daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my husband to look for to me much now and arrives from the strange work.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t give low ratings</li>
            <li> but I had no other choice on this product.</li>
            <li> I;m not hating this oil, I just think the other oils are a little better quality...</li>
            <li> I have pretty realistic expectations when it come to pheromones, however all the times I&#x27;ve worn the product on my neck and wrist and interacted with men and women, I&#x27;ve seen no meaningful result.</li>
            <li> The friendly people remained friendly and the cold ones remained so.</li>
            <li> but honestly it has failed me.</li>
            <li> My secret love potion.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products by this vendor and really like this one.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to wear it regularly &amp; hope for positive results like the other brand oils.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used them at work, but I plan on trying them out at a party next week.  </li>
            <li> The other \\&quot;good reviews\\&quot; on here are obviously fake also.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t tell anybody I ordered it and kept it hidden, as a test to see if it really worked.</li>
            <li> I wore it to various social situations including at school, at the store, at work, at parties, at clubs, and even around guys that I have known for years.</li>
            <li> You would be better off using water, saving the $30, and at the very least water will quench your thirst unlike this snake oil!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is I felt a little strange after I put it on, almost buzzed.  </li>
            <li> I ended up getting hit on by the UPS guy, a fat man who took second prize at a local moustache competition, an old guy that lives out of his pickup near the park I work at and this sneaky little Mexican guy who works at the Shell.</li>
            <li> That can be a good or bad thing</li>
            <li> I have tried a few others, with little to no results (see my previous reviews for more info)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t met anyone serious yet, so I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars, but I definitely feel like I&#x27;m on the right track.</li>
            <li> Not sure about if it really works or not.</li>
            <li> The first time I wore it he complained about getting a headache.  </li>
            <li> Note the generic names each reviewer has and the fact that each one has only reviewed one (perhaps two) other product approximately two to three days before leaving a fantastic review for this product.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical even though I know the powerful effect of naturally occurring pheremones.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it works every single time which is why I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars, but it definitely works.</li>
            <li> I do believe pheromones work as I have used pheromone products in the past before with decent results</li>
            <li> I love with me he cold</li>
            <li> I am not generally sensitive to products</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> , complete waste</li>
            <li> I extremely want to send it back to you because it does not work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to go back to my other stuff</li>
            <li> That same day I got hit on by about 2 other guys at the store.</li>
            <li> so it was tough to say if this product worked at first because an increase of  guys were looking at me anyways.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I should have done a little more digging before I shelled out $30 I could have spent on something</li>
            <li> But I am not sure if it&#x27;s the Pheromone or my natural \\&quot;Charm\\</li>
            <li> I received my bottle of Arouse-Rx this past Tuesday, so far I&#x27;ve worn the product all the times I&#x27;ve gone out, with no results.</li>
            <li> but becuase I put it on to see how my husband responded, I had it on and got nothing different from any other males at work etc!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other pheromone oil brands now (Both male &amp; female oils)</li>
            <li> So the bottle only lasted two and a half weeks.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to bring a little \\&quot;spice\\&quot; back into my marriage</li>
            <li> Not even a tiny little bit.</li>
            <li> I tried other products after this but was disappointed with them...will go back to this for sure.</li>
            <li> The only thing that changed was my little pink bottle of pheromones.</li>
            <li> I guess you might want to be careful when and where you use this cause</li>
            <li> He never really noticed me before, and now we have a date for the weekend.</li>
            <li> Before bed, I put a few drops on my neck as directed and waited to see what would happen next....</li>
            <li> I opened the package and was curious</li>
            <li> but it is not real in any way.</li>
            <li> Really, for almost $40 for this not only is it expensive, but I have noticed absolutely NO DIFFERENCE in others behaviors towards me when I&#x27;m wearing this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was curious.</li>
            <li> The next few times I wore it, it didn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
            <li> So a couple of weeks ago, I piled it on (on my neck AND wrists) and made a mental note to see if any guys would pay attention.</li>
            <li> I only wish there was a rating less than one star!</li>
            <li> Not that I was looking to attract someone other then my spouse, but I was curious to see if ANYONE had a response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A LITTLE FURTHER DOWN</li>
            <li> Maybe I should give it a little while long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen it happen to my other girlfriends who seem to always have men hitting on them but never me.  </li>
            <li> i did not like the product at all and is an utter waste of money !</li>
            <li> But hummmm it doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;ve put it on everyday an no action from my lover.</li>
            <li> Pissed the other too guys off, I imagine.</li>
            <li> It is hard to put on, which they didn&#x27;t explain about the dropper, and once you get it out of this dropper and onto your skin, it seems that you are the only one that knows you have it on.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, but it really doesn&#x60;t.</li>
            <li> its not real!!</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t mess up my perfume when I mix them together.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this product again, not worth time or money.</li>
            <li> not special compared to something else</li>
            <li> I noticed little to nothing out of the ordinary when I wear this oil versus the other brands...</li>
            <li> I like it guys seem to be a little nicer....</li>
            <li> It dosent work at all, I wasted 50$</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> so yes ppl dont waste ur money</li>
            <li> and the few times she has it has worked out for her.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few nights ago while out at a party</li>
            <li> This product is junk... Waste of money .  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> but no free drinks..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> so I waited a few days.</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> How can one possibly return bits of broken glass and a soaked envelope.</li>
            <li> Does not work, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I used it for a few weeks and nothing happened, not even my boyfriend noticed it.</li>
            <li> ladies or men, please dont waste your time and money on this.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money or time on this item.</li>
            <li> It is really a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I think it was just some plain oil.  </li>
            <li> , this is my FIRST review, however, it doesn&#x27;t mean I am FAKE!</li>
            <li> I bought this item thinking to spice up a slight slow time in a 12 year marriage.</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I thought oh no, this product is not mixing well with my body chemistry, what a waste of money!  </li>
            <li> Usually people want to strike up conversation with me</li>
            <li> Not sure this product works.</li>
            <li> ill never get back</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works or not...</li>
            <li> (sadly, the one I used is no longer on the market), but I do not believe this product lives up to the reviews.t before with decent results (sadly, the one I used is no longer on the market), but I do not believe this product lives up to the reviews.</li>
            <li> After all the positive reviews I hate to be a naysayer</li>
            <li> The day that I used it I hardly made any money.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s too hard to tell if it&#x27;s working anymore</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as my little secret for over a month now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not extremely thrilled.</li>
            <li> Well, I read almost all the reviews on here and, after despite the negative ones, I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> (I know he likes me as a friend at least).</li>
            <li> they are still mean to me like always.</li>
            <li> Also, men seem to be less shy when you are wearing it, but you have to be in close quarters -- it&#x27;s not going to attract people who can&#x27;t smell you.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I hated it so much because it does not work.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I feel like they give me a secret power.</li>
            <li> it is my secret weapon.</li>
            <li> I put 1-2 drops on my wrists and behind my ears and on the neck and there was NO result whatsoever..  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still tired from my weekend</li>
            <li> This crap is total SNAKE OIL!</li>
            <li> Received my package broken.</li>
            <li> I used it sparingly because I&#x27;m a poor college student</li>
            <li> so i guess a star which is another false advertising wuld hav to do.</li>
            <li> I saw this and my curiosity was stricken, Now i was a bit skeptical</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> so I was a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Well.. I bought this product and used it as recomended and unfortunately didn&#x27;t see the result as promissed..</li>
            <li> I noticed when he would get grumpy all I would have to do it go over next to him, he would forget about his bad mood, grab me and kiss me everywhere!!!</li>
            <li> Sorry I can&#x27;t change the stars.  </li>
            <li> sorry that is becasue</li>
            <li> This is 100% FAKE.</li>
            <li> How silly.</li>
            <li> This product turned out to be fake unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Update, it attracts cats, as weird as it sounds whatever is in it attracts cats not humans but cats.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using pheromone colognes time and my experiences with this product was very poor.</li>
            <li> AND I haven&#x27;t been out on one single date in three years since my divorce (pathetic</li>

            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference when I wear it with my fragrances.  Not sure about if it really works or not.</li>
            <li> It dosent work at all, I wasted 50$</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work!  I tried it at different times with men and women and did not notice any positive difference. In fact, I tried it with my then boyfriend too.  Not only did he not &amp;#34;bond&amp;#34; with me more like it should be if the product had worked, he was constantly upset with me for no reason, we got into a fight and broke up!  I think it was just some plain oil.  I don&#x27;t believe it had anything magical. I threw it out.  It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Bought this product now I am married to a prince! SIKE!!!! Nothing happened, guess that it what I get for thinking it would help.</li>
            <li> does not work at all!!</li>
            <li> So I bought this ish and guess what ive been using it like a dumbass and guess what it doesnt work guys dont even look at me i think they would notice me better before than now with this oil thingy  I do get hella close to the guy i like and talk to him but he seems like he ignores me im like wow this ish supposed to attract him not to ignore me so yes ppl dont waste ur money n just use urself personality and all tht to get guys  ima throw this away and be like i used to be tht way guys would notice me more n talk and the guy i like would talk back for a bit but now he seems scared lol so maybe this ish is scaring him or idk but he wast tht way before using this product  ok pues bye!!</li>
            <li> These pheromones don&#x27;t work miracles but used properly, they DEFINITELY work! Men are much more flirtatious around me when I am wearing them, and they also seem to be more receptive to my suggestions. I feel like they give me a secret power. I would recommend these to any woman who wants more control over the opposite sex</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a friend of mine who has been in a dating slump and was getting depressed. I convinced her to try some and the few times she has it has worked out for her. She meet a great looking guy and is back to her happy self again. Since she doesn&#x27;t need it any more, I use it now.</li>
            <li> The booths at the trade shows my company attend always use various gimmicks to attract people to them, free shirts, pens, trashy women in skimpy outfits, etc. What I do to attract new clients is wear pheromones. Since it&#x27;s odorless it is easy to mix in with any perfume I choose to wear that day. It seems to command the attention of both men and women. The one time I forgot to pack in my bag I gathered fewer new leads. Now, this never leaves my travel bag.</li>
            <li> I really wish that i culd say great things about this product but honestly it has failed me. Im a confident woman who lile to experiment to see if things are what ppl say they are. Ive been using this product for two weeks now hoping n thinkn that if i give it time maybe i would receive results. Ive followed directions n woore it without any perfume to see if it wuld work by itself. There were no guys eyeing me, or trying to speak wit me. So me beong the experimentor dat i am decidely to go about lile i normally do wit out da pheremone. Wore some perfume n i got sum attention thn. Which i am saying concerning me dis product is like throwin water on myself n dont work for me. Sorry to be crude but a zero rate from me because i wasnt desireable when i woee dis but seem lile a repellant. They wuldnt allow me to put zero stars so i guess a star which is another false advertising wuld hav to do.</li>
            <li> I saw this and my curiosity was stricken, Now i was a bit skeptical cause some review&#x27;s had said it never worked but you never know until you try it. So i put it on one night and my boyfriend couldn&#x27;t keep his hands off me! He told me he never wanted to have sex with me more (not that he didn&#x27;t want to before but this was just a added bonus) I love this stuff it is my secret weapon. I guess you might want to be careful when and where you use this cause you never know who might get close enough to you. I would recommend this to anyone, It really does work ;)</li>
            <li> I have used this product on several occasions now and I have not noticed any more attention than usual...not sure if it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Men act very different around me when I am wearing this pheromone.  At work, they are much more friendly...  and they seem to pay attention to what I say.  Before I used these, I felt very under appreciated at the office.  This has definitely made a difference.  So far I have only used them at work, but I plan on trying them out at a party next week.  I will let you know how it goes!!!</li>
            <li> This absolutely doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s a waste of money. I wore this and it had NO effect at all. I regret spending money on it and only have to blame myself. Other pheromones have worked WAAAAY better.</li>
            <li> No kidding, it works.  I have been wearing this and my boyfriend doeasn&#x27;t know however, he is much more attentive the days I wear it. Great!</li>
            <li> The product didnot work.Tryed for weeks it didnot do any thing for me.I would not purchase this product at all.</li>
            <li> Sorry but this stuff is the biggest scam I have ever come across.  I have not noticed anything different since I have been wearing Arouse, not even from my husband.  If you want to throw away your money then buy this product.  I normally don&#x27;t give low ratings but I had no other choice on this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in highschool. A freshman actually, and my Moyer bought this for me as a gift, to help me feel attractive. This really works! The hottest guy in school started to talk to me! And the jocks invited me to sit t there table! This stuf is good I&#x27;m going to ask for more on my birthdays and any holidays.</li>
            <li> I extremely want to send it back to you because it does not work. also if it is pheremon why isnt there any informaation about storage. The temperature must be important to store it.</li>
            <li> Since I started using Arouse-RX, every night is Lady&#x27;s Night for me. It&#x27;s  odorless so it doesn&#x27;t mess up my perfume when I mix them together. All I  need is a couple of drops I&#x27;m good for a night on the town.  It&#x27;s amazing  how well this stuff works.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product hoping not to sexually attract potential employers, but to leave that &#x27;lasting impression&#x27; they just couldn&#x27;t put their finger on. I wanted to use it to be remembered, essentially. (Hey...in today&#x27;s job market...I&#x27;m willing to try whatever to make me stand out from the 50 others applying for the same job!!) I tried this product, applying it as directed, 3-4 times per day to wrists and neck for nearly two weeks. I didn&#x27;t tell anybody I ordered it and kept it hidden, as a test to see if it really worked. My hubby didn&#x27;t treat me any differently, he didn&#x27;t even seem to notice a difference. Any other men didn&#x27;t pay any special attention...nothing. I know this type of thing does work...but I don&#x27;t think this is the right product. I&#x27;m wondering if it isn&#x27;t just water...with some type of oil base added. It has no smell...and evaporates almost immediately when applied.</li>
            <li> I wore this stuff at the office last week, and the guy that I&#x27;ve had my eye on for months kept walking by my desk... After the 3rd time, I knew that something was up. He struck up a conversation with me in the break room for the first time!!! He never really noticed me before, and now we have a date for the weekend. The only thing that changed was my little pink bottle of pheromones. I&#x27;m convinced this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this stuff to be honest. I do notice that when I wear this my hubby&#x27;s attitude changes and he seems more aggressive than usual. I don&#x27;t sure it all the time, just when I&#x27;m in the mood.</li>
            <li> I googled so I figured why not. Used as directed. Its has been about 8 months (maybe more) and still single. I would recommend ( :) positive energy)</li>
            <li> After 15 years of marriage, I felt the spark was fading in our bedroom. I read an article in the Times about pheromones and decided to try Arouse-Rx. It&#x27;s completely odorless so I was a bit skeptical.  Before bed, I put a few drops on my neck as directed and waited to see what would happen next.... It really worked like magic!  My husband couldn&#x27;t keep his hands off of me! It ended up being a great night of love making, but I wanted to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a fluke so I tried it a couple of nights later... the same thing happened again. Now when I&#x27;m in the mood I just dap some on and let nature take its course.</li>
            <li> It works! Never have I seen anything like it. More men approach me today and I&#x27;m over 50 than they have in years! I will continue using this product for years to come! Lol no joke!! :)</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money, doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a freshman starting college this year and I bought this to increase my chances of being popular with the guys while away at school. I wasn&#x27;t in the \\&quot;in\\&quot; crowd in high school and am looking to change that! I tried it a few nights ago while out at a party and I did notice lots of extra attention from the guys but didn&#x27;t end up hooking up with anyone. I have my fingers crossed that this will work for me :)!</li>
            <li> Well.. I bought this product and used it as recomended and unfortunately didn&#x27;t see the result as promissed.. I put 1-2 drops on my wrists and behind my ears and on the neck and there was NO result whatsoever..  -Today I decided to put more of this thing on me.. I put about 3-4 drops on each area I mentioned before and I even mixed about 10 drops with my Body-Lotion before I rubbed it on my body. Well.. I had some Men coming around me today, Talking and so.. But I am not sure if it&#x27;s the Pheromone or my natural \\&quot;Charm\\&quot;.. I am very nice and friendly and flirt with men all the time. I really can&#x27;t tell if this product really works. I wish I could say YES. isn&#x27;t it what we all want?..</li>
            <li> Heh, I got this just as an experiment... And there is definitely a reason why this stuff isn&#x27;t very well known or promoted...Because it doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> I received this on a Friday evening.  I opened the package and was curious so I put some on even though I wasn&#x27;t planning on being around any men that evening.  The first thing I noticed is I felt a little strange after I put it on, almost buzzed.  I invited some girlfriends over and ended up having more people than I had food for so I ordered a pizza.  The pizza delivery guy flirted with me and called me later that night, that HAS NEVER happened to me before. I&#x27;ve seen it happen to my other girlfriends who seem to always have men hitting on them but never me.  I am a well preserved 40 year old and he was probably in his early 20&#x27;s so I am so not going there but it was very flattering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have worn it out running errands, shopping and to church since then and have noticed reactions from different men.  It doesn&#x27;t cause men to fall at my feet professing undying love for me or anything like that, I don&#x27;t think anything will do that but I have definitely noticed a change in the way some men react to me now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now a believer in pheromones...there really is something to it and this isn&#x27;t just unscented oil for those of you who are debating on buying it.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with some fun, sophisticated sex items to liven up my husband and my ten year marriage. I honestly did not think this product would work. I was extremely skeptical even though I know the powerful effect of naturally occurring pheremones. My husband is usually pretty touchy-feely and incredibly easy to turn on...but when I applied it according to the instructions, it had a huge effect on him. I noticed when he would get grumpy all I would have to do it go over next to him, he would forget about his bad mood, grab me and kiss me everywhere!!! And when we made love that night, he was definitely more aggressive than normal.  I also noticed when I went to the store, men I would walk by would turn and look, not oogling per se, but like something caught their attention about me and they could not put their finger on it. The cute, younger checker at the grocery store who is usually just surfacey and polite, totally chatted me up, told me I looked familiar and he swore he knew me from somewhere and then brushed my hand with a smile on his face when he handed me my change. This was the stuff that use to happen to me 10 years ago, before getting married and having kids...it was kind of fun. :)  This product works. My secret love potion.</li>
            <li> THE ONLY REACTION FROM THIS WAS NOTHING ABOUT MY HUSBAND BUT MY FRIEND&#x27;S DOG WHO IS FEMALE BITE ME AFTER 8 YEARS KNOWING HER!!JAJAJAJA!!!I WAS THINKING IT WILL BE LIKE IN THE MOVIE OCEAN 12!!! AAHHH JAJAJAJAJA!!THIS DO NOT HAVE NOTHING TO BE WITH AMAZON I LOVE AMAZON!!</li>
            <li> I hated it so much because it does not work. I would say my fiancee does not care about it at all. He acts the same way. I do not think that helps. Do not waste your money, buy something sexy as a cream or perfume, that works better than this junk!</li>
            <li> I work in sales and was using arouse - rx to increase the attraction of male clients. The day that I used it I hardly made any money. Men paid no interest to me at all</li>
            <li> Im not so sure about this stuff. Maybe I got the mans formula. I notice alot of Women paying attention to me and talking to me more. My daughter is always telling me how good i smell! My son said I smelled like tuna fish!!! i did have tuna for lunch though. I really dont have a problem with getting a mans attention, just thought it would be fun. I have not had men taking that much notice just WOMEN. Oh well I like attention from anyone. My girlfriends are nicer to me anyway. I will try it at a bar soon and see what happens!</li>
            <li> he is something very good, I cannot believe it! but in truth it works.  I am married and my husband was without giving attention me.  but it places these drops and wow wonderful....my husband to look for to me much now and arrives from the strange work. very different lol</li>
            <li> I purchased Arouse Rx through the authorized dealer on eBay a little over a month ago after reading the fabulous reviews on Amazon. Needless to say, I should have done a little more digging before I shelled out $30 I could have spent on something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the product itself is an odorless oily liquid that one is instructed to apply three times daily on the wrists and neck. Being ever so mindful, I applied it three times daily to my wrists and neck. In the beginning, I applied it after I applied a light spritz of perfume. Once I noticed I was not getting any results, I switched to wearing it alone which really made no difference as I got no results at all. I wore it to various social situations including at school, at the store, at work, at parties, at clubs, and even around guys that I have known for years. Nada, nothing, zilch. In short, no results whatsoever. No \\&quot;extra\\&quot; attention, no whirling of heads, no secret crush asking me out - nothing. The only plus to using this product is that my wrists and neck are probably a bit more moisturized than usual because of applying oil to them three times daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the reviews on this site. As already noted by another reviewer (who was immediately taken to task for expressing their opinion in their review..shocking), it is highly probable that most, if not all, of the reviews here are submitted by people who work for this company hence the high star rating. Note the generic names each reviewer has and the fact that each one has only reviewed one (perhaps two) other product approximately two to three days before leaving a fantastic review for this product. Coincidence? Maybe. Suspicious? Oh yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I would not repurchase Arouse Rx because of the lackluster (ie none) results. I would also think twice about giving my money to a company that possibly uses underhanded tactics to raise their star rating on sites like Amazon. I do believe pheromones work as I have used pheromone products in the past before with decent results (sadly, the one I used is no longer on the market), but I do not believe this product lives up to the reviews.t before with decent results (sadly, the one I used is no longer on the market), but I do not believe this product lives up to the reviews.</li>
            <li> save your money, i did not notice a darn bit of differnce.  no smell and no results  too bad. thanks</li>
            <li> This product is junk... Waste of money .  If I could return it I would.  I also broke out in welts wherever I put it.  I am not generally sensitive to products</li>
            <li> I purchased Arouse out of curiosity and tested the product on my partner. The first time I wore it he complained about getting a headache.  I thought oh no, this product is not mixing well with my body chemistry, what a waste of money!  I gave it another chance.  The second time around he had a different reaction.  He was more touchy feelings all day and night.  There is definitely more bonding and sweetness from both side.  I&#x27;ve made sure to dab some on every time he is around.  Before I would complain he never gave me enough time and attention and now he is more available and playful to be around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if its the placebo effect, but this product has definitely given me more confidence when it comes to conversations.  I&#x27;m very shy and I&#x27;ve noticed men and women want to chat and are friendlier.  For sure a good attitude and a smile goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t follow the recommended use on the bottle, 3 drops.  I used 7-10 drops before I went out during the day and 7-10  at night.  So the bottle only lasted two and a half weeks.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with Arouse that I purchased an additional six bottles just to save on cost since it has become a daily ritual much like putting on shoes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 months now, sometimes it works and sometimes not. I&#x27;ve worn it to all kinds of different places with different people. I don&#x27;t waer it all the time just sometimes. I do get more attention from sales men when I wear it in stores, my boyfriend gets more amorous when I have it on, and I notice getting checked out more when I wear it. One time my best friend and I both put it on and went out, we had a reaction to it. We may have put on too much, we were both in the car with the windows up and I got really zoned out and she got really talkative. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a placebo and I just feel sexier and therfore attract more attention or if the pheramones are doing the work, but I have seen a response to it over the last couple of months.</li>
            <li> Well I say I love it,real test hasn&#x60;t been done yet,but let me tell you if you&#x60;re in love with your best friend put some of this on!Of all people to turn on was my best buddy of 17 yrs.!Works a little too good!It was crazy didn&#x60;t expect it to work that good and fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other pheromone oil brands now (Both male &amp; female oils) &amp; I feel I have more success with the other brands...I;m not hating this oil, I just think the other oils are a little better quality...I noticed little to nothing out of the ordinary when I wear this oil versus the other brands...Usually people want to strike up conversation with me it seems when I wear pheromone oils...However I have not gotten results like that with this oil...I will continue to wear it regularly &amp; hope for positive results like the other brand oils.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I use, this stuff does not work.  Very disappointed.  Also it says it&#x27;s unscented, but there is oily smell to it that I cannot stand...</li>
            <li> Well this is the biggest gimmick I have found thus far. I have used this a there has been no change in the love life. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Every time I went out, and wore this, lets just say good things happened. Its so sneaky! I love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried other products by this vendor and really like this one.  It&#x27;s light, does not feel greasy or conflict with perfume, and makes me feel good when i go out - like I&#x27;m wearing invisible armor or something!</li>
            <li> Noticed a positive difference.</li>
            <li> This do not work, you have been warned, so do not waste your money, I really wish that it did, but lets be honest, theirs no such thing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It didn&#x27;t work for me at all. Its not what it promise. I should had returned it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this but got nothing.  I even tried to be sexier when wearing this, but NADA.  I gave it 2 stars instead of one cause I noticed its to be worn 3 times a day.  I wore it dressed sexy and lounge around my mate hoping to excite him - it didn&#x27;t work but that was the only time I had put it on that day.  I did it a few more times and nothing. I&#x27;ll try it 3 times daily over the weekend and update my review.    I tried it weekend, dynamite!! Sorry I can&#x27;t change the stars.  Please use as directed, this is out of this world.  I&#x27;m still tired from my weekend ***** 5 stars!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS IT IS A SCAM. IT DOES NOTHING LADIES. NOTHING !!!! I WISH I WOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS A LITTLE FURTHER DOWN TO SEE WHAT IT&#x27;S REALLY ABOUT. SAVE YOUR MONEY.  IT&#x27;S A JOKE.</li>
            <li> Wife has more women hotting on her than guys and LOVES it</li>
            <li> great product, and very happy with purchase. Item is perfect and as expected. thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hesitant to write a review because I don&#x27;t want people to know about this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using this as my little secret for over a month now.  I use it whenever I go out, go to work, and even when running errands because, you never know where Mr. Right is hiding.  I&#x27;ve been getting TONS of attention, experienced lots of flirting, and even had a guy ask for my number.  I haven&#x27;t met anyone serious yet, so I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars, but I definitely feel like I&#x27;m on the right track.</li>
            <li> This product did not have the effect that was portrayed in the ad. As a matter of fact, it had the total opposite effect. I received more affection with my male counter part, prior to using this product, than I did after using it. I am very disappointed and would not promote this product at all. I feel that I was cheated. Please do not trick others with a product that does not work.   Sincerely,  Disappointed</li>
            <li> not special compared to something else I tried much more expensive though but worth it.  I would not bought it again sorry that is becasue I have tried another phermone product that makes a wow these men are really loving my perfume  lol!!! and even females compliment but not with this..</li>
            <li> Smells great for that special someone. I notice lots of guys are attracted to me but them that&#x27;s the norm for me. ( blush) I believe this has enhanced my power over most men though..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not extremely thrilled. I applied it to my wrist, neck, cleavage &amp; even varied the amounts. My last-bf friend sniffed this- no response! I tested it with guy friends. They seemed more alert &amp; flirtatious..with other women! (Factor in I have naturally lower amounts of estrogen).. Maybe I just haven&#x27;t worn it to the right places? I feel sexier wearing it- but no free drinks.. yet. Hopefully it&#x27;ll work for you!</li>
            <li> This is 100% FAKE. I feel like an idiot for falling for it but it is not real in any way. Don&#x27;t waste your money. The other \\&quot;good reviews\\&quot; on here are obviously fake also.</li>
            <li> I bought this item thinking to spice up a slight slow time in a 12 year marriage. There was NO response! Not only that, but becuase I put it on to see how my husband responded, I had it on and got nothing different from any other males at work etc! Not that I was looking to attract someone other then my spouse, but I was curious to see if ANYONE had a response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing. DO NOT waste your money!</li>
            <li> Really, for almost $40 for this not only is it expensive, but I have noticed absolutely NO DIFFERENCE in others behaviors towards me when I&#x27;m wearing this. I&#x27;ve put like 10 drops on, NOTHING, plus it advises to apply it 3 times a day. Nothing like using this little bottle up in about 2 weeks at best if you plan on following those instructions. I seriously feel the reviewers who praise and refer to this as the magic of attraction are full of it. I will be sending mine back.</li>
            <li> Clearly, MOST of the reviews for this product were written by the same person. Okay, Representative-of-the-company, you could have at least changed up your writing style a bit. Nobody talks like that. How silly.</li>
            <li> This does not work. I am attractive but older and wanted to see if this makes a difference to men around me. IT SO DOES NOT. Amazon should not sell products that are fraudulent. so happy to send this back but do not except returns. I was defrauded of my money</li>
            <li> I tried this product on several times as indicated ahead of team meetings lasting more than one hour and also at cocktail parties and bars. I did not see any change in attention from male colleagues or strangers. The friendly people remained friendly and the cold ones remained so. I was disappointed somewhat.</li>
            <li> This stuff is my secret weapon!!  I put it on before going out for the night and the guys SWOON over me at the bars.  My girlfirends are always so jealous but they don&#x27;t seem to mind the free drinks we rack up, haha!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not getting any younger and really want to get married.  I just bought this a few weeks ago and think it really works.  I&#x27;ve been noticing more attention from guys - albeit the delivery guys and waiters at my favorite restaurant - but I haven&#x27;t work it for a big night out yet.  Hoping this stuff will get me hitched!</li>
            <li> A guy friend told me about how he uses pheromones and how they make them for women, so I ordered some and it was the best purchase I have ever made.  At the bar men send drinks my way non stop, but what is interesting is that during business meetings all the men hang on my every word. I use it 3 times a day for full effectiveness. Its odorless so it mixes perfectly with all of my perfumes.</li>
            <li> Honestly if this stuff worked they wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep it in stock.  So what they do is make bogus reviews themselves and try to get people hyped up on something that doesn&#x27;t work and will never work!  People are not like dogs and cats, smell is not as stong in humans.    I will say a good makeover will go a lot further in attracting men that this stuff ever will.  You would be better off using water, saving the $30, and at the very least water will quench your thirst unlike this snake oil!</li>
            <li> Its like water, dont do nothing! nothing! its... Dont buy this product!!! its not real!! Im disappointing. !! !!! !!! !!!</li>
            <li> High hopes but I have seen no difference.  I guess you win some and lose some.  Didnt see any difference at all.  Order at your own risk.  I will still keep the bottle and continue to use it but so far.....nothing...  :(</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in attracting men. Seems to be the same as always. Landed two jobs from male employers since wearing it, so may have had some effect in that respect.</li>
            <li> Fast shiping , N O  D I F R E N T  I t  I s w a I s t  o f  m a n y . T h a n k  y o u .</li>
            <li> i think that whatever u put ur mine that u will attract so if u want to use the oil and put it on and believe that it makes mens like u then use it. BUT u may want to try to to love ur self more and then mens will be attract it to u. is just a choice.</li>
            <li> Ok so I bought this to try it out on my husband... he was deployed for 9 months and I knew he was going to be \\&quot;ready for me\\&quot; even without the pheromones so I waited a few days. One morning I put it on my neck and wrist but I put way more than 2-3 drops and I didn&#x27;t get anything from my husband all day :-( that night he tackled me and started wrestling me then he stopped and started sniffing me like a damn dog lol.. he said you smell good what are you wearing... and I said nothing everything I use is unscented :D the next night I caught him sniffing my neck while after we got into bed to go to sleep and he said yum you smell good and I said what do i smell like and he said I cant explain it... its just YOUR smell ..... so it works ladies just give it time to soak in properly</li>
            <li> i did not like the product at all and is an utter waste of money !it didnt do anything just an additional scent ! and is very oily ! nope !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Pretty embarrased to say that I bought this because I feel tricked. I bought it to bring a little \\&quot;spice\\&quot; back into my marriage and I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. There has been no dramatic change in guys around me either lol A complete waste of money. I have had other pheromone products but the reviews on this were so great so I thought I would try it. I&#x27;m going to go back to my other stuff lol. This product turned out to be fake unfortunately. It didn&#x27;t work for me... :(</li>
            <li> This is one product containing pheromones that I actually think works. I have tried a few others, with little to no results (see my previous reviews for more info) but this one does seem to have an effect. I use it before bedtime with my boyfriend and he seems to be more &amp;#34;in the mood&amp;#34; than normal when I wear it. Also, men seem to be less shy when you are wearing it, but you have to be in close quarters -- it&#x27;s not going to attract people who can&#x27;t smell you. Good product!</li>
            <li> This crap is total SNAKE OIL! I&#x27;ve gone out on a lot of dates w different men since buyin this stuff. Sometimes I used it and sometimes I didn&#x27;t. It didn&#x27;t seem to make ANY difference at all. In addition, I tried just wearing it around town as a test to see if I got any special attention from men I wasn&#x27;t on a date with. NOTHING. NADA. ZIP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money. Buy a nice perfume and be yourself!</li>
            <li> I have no idea why all this ppl say it works. it never worked. i used more that 6 times as directed but no different.</li>
            <li> Received my package broken. Never even got the chance to try it out and amazon is asking for me to return it!? What kind of foolery!!! How can one possibly return bits of broken glass and a soaked envelope. Waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure this product works. Have tried another brand that I noticed better results with . Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this product again, not worth time or money.</li>
            <li> This really seems to work.</li>
            <li> 90 day money back guaranteed?? 90 days? I guess the 90 days is so you can forget about this stuff and not return it. A scientist I am not but this stuff should mix with your chemistry quicker than  90 days.  I have tried it alone, mixed with lotion and with my perfume...still nothing. My new hair cut worked better. Basically $30 plus dollars for some oil. Note to self: pay attention to the reviews.</li>
            <li> No one will fall down at your feet, but I think people were friendly. (and no, I&#x27;m not a troll). Maybe it&#x27;s good for a mental boost, more than anything...</li>
            <li> Hi! Well, I read almost all the reviews on here and, after despite the negative ones, I decided to give this product a try. I am waiting for it to come in the mail this week. When it does, I will start using it (as directed) and let you know how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this is my FIRST review, however, it doesn&#x27;t mean I am FAKE! I am real, and REALLY hoping this stuff works. I want to use it to give me an extra boost, so I can attract a man that I am interested in. Granted, the man may already be attracted to me (I know he likes me as a friend at least). This stuff will hopefully work to &#x27;&#x27;push him over the edge&#x27;&#x27; so to speak lol! AND I haven&#x27;t been out on one single date in three years since my divorce (pathetic I know).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I will for sure let you know, and here&#x27;s hoping for the best (God! Please let it work!!).</li>
            <li> Received this very quickly and opened it up even quicker! No scent to it, so I put it on and then my own perfume I wear everyday. Went out to do some errands, and as I was walking by a man who was pumping gas, he smiled and said &#x27;Man! You smell AWESOME! I better stay far away from you!&amp;#34; I smiled back and went into the store. When I walked back out, he was on his way in, and stopped me and said &amp;#34;what are you wearing?&amp;#34; I smiled and said &amp;#34;I will never tell&amp;#34;... So it MUST work!</li>
            <li> I thought this would put a spark back in my relationship. But hummmm it doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;ve put it on everyday an no action from my lover. An I work with a bunch of men im the only lady an they are still mean to me like always. Please dont waste ur money! !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> After spending an evening with the boyfriend and testing it out without him knowing. He just couldn&#x27;t keep his hands off me! :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was curious. Yes when I put it on men became more sociable, I don&#x27;t think they desired to jump my bones but it seems effective on some individuals. So 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I don&#x60;t joke around and Im going to tell you my honest answer: It doesn&#x60;t work. Sorry, but it really doesn&#x60;t. Not even a tiny little bit. I returned it.</li>
            <li> was expecting it to work... had a bet with my friends to see if this really works so got it and put some on her for two nights in a row she got no game play from the men...p.s she was miss Atlanta twice so its not the looks here... it did not work... bummer...</li>
            <li> Does not work, don&#x27;t waste your money. I used it for a few weeks and nothing happened, not even my boyfriend noticed it.</li>
            <li> Let me first start by saying that I&#x27;m a pretty attractive gal to begin with. But I&#x27;m 35 and the guys my age don&#x27;t seem to be swarming like I want them to. So I recently gave myself a makeover (dyed my hair, started wearing lipstick and updated my wardrobe) so it was tough to say if this product worked at first because an increase of  guys were looking at me anyways.  The 1st day I wore it, I put some only on the front part of my neck. When my guy friend came over, he started kissing the front part of my neck and I busted out laughing because who kisses the front of someone&#x27;s neck? Lol. He had no idea! That same day I got hit on by about 2 other guys at the store. The next few times I wore it, it didn&#x27;t seem to work. I used only 7 to 10 drops like the bottle said too. Perhaps it did work and I didn&#x27;t realize it because there were times that I went to the coffee shop and got hit on/chatted up by a couple of guys and I couldn&#x27;t remember if I had it on or not. But I always put in on before I go to places like coffee shops. So a couple of weeks ago, I piled it on (on my neck AND wrists) and made a mental note to see if any guys would pay attention. Funniest s*** ever! 2 guys (friends) were looking at me at one table and another guy walked over (just as they were about to come over) and just started chatting me up for like 45 mins and WOULD NOT LEAVE! Pissed the other too guys off, I imagine. I didn&#x27;t mind though. The guy was kind of cute and was a lawyer. So yes. It works. I can&#x27;t say it works every single time which is why I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars, but it definitely works. I will definitely be buying another bottle when this one runs out. I also love that it is unscented because it doesn&#x27;t disturb my other fragrances.</li>
            <li> This is the worst I am so sorry dont do anything</li>
            <li> I never revived this item some lady across the street said the next door neighbor signed for it! This is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> im highly unhappy, this did not work and because of it, i can not put anything higher than 1, id like to put 0 but 1 is the lowest it can go. ladies or men, please dont waste your time and money on this. theres 30+$ ill never get back, complete waste</li>
            <li> Yesss!!! This product really works! I&#x27;ve only used it two days and I notice the difference, the guys look at me more, smiling me and even give me presents. You must to follow the instructions ( I applied it twice a day). This is a good investment, I already order my second bottle !</li>
            <li> This stuff really works,My son father was coming to pick him up for a doctor appointment so I had put some on the pressure points on my neck and wrist to see if this stuff really works all of a sudden I had this boost of confidence and he couldn&#x27;t stop touching me he was being so nice to me which he hasn&#x27;t been lately due to our break up.Everything seemed like the first day we met and he even told me he loved me and kissed me.Now that I know this stuff works I am going out to meet new people, hopefully I run into Mr. Right</li>
            <li> does not work do not spend money on it</li>
            <li> I received my bottle of Arouse-Rx this past Tuesday, so far I&#x27;ve worn the product all the times I&#x27;ve gone out, with no results. I have pretty realistic expectations when it come to pheromones, however all the times I&#x27;ve worn the product on my neck and wrist and interacted with men and women, I&#x27;ve seen no meaningful result. I dont get any smiles, or looks in fact I notice men and women both very indifferent with me. This is a waste of money.I dunno if there is a money back policy. But I sure will try to find out.</li>
            <li> I put this on when i was at the gym kickboxing and when i went to the store. Nothing happen. Its a waste of money. Update, it attracts cats, as weird as it sounds whatever is in it attracts cats not humans but cats.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using pheromone colognes time and my experiences with this product was very poor. Of the various perfumes I have used recommend Egyptian Goddess, Love or Rose - Auric Blends Fine Perfume Oil .... men are transformed from a kitten to a lion. It is much more economical and effective.</li>
            <li> I got the pheromones for men on Wednesday of this week and at once I started using it. I must say that I can&#x27;t tell the difference.  Maybe I should give it a little while long. The good thing about this product is that you can&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> When i first used Arouse-Rx Sex Pheromones, right when i had put it on, i started feeling weird, a kind of feeling i haven&#x27;t experience before. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it!! It gave me a dose of confidence also more men were looking at me, my guy is nicer to me when am wearing it. I feel less shy and just feel more outgoing, love it!</li>
            <li> see no change what so ever</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really have any kind of smell at all, and did absolutely nothing for me. I think I ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> I tried this Arouse rx stuff last week and didn&#x27;t dotas iney thing till I left the office to go make keys for my job I work at a Reilly estat place and win I went to have keys made the man that I always see that is Normaly not rily friendly&lt;br /&gt;But win I walked in this time he acted rily strang he was much more come and he looked at me rily wired like he was I love with me he cold not stop looking at me and win I left the ather guy that was in thare tearned and looked me up and down win I was leaving!!!!</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money or time on this item. I purchased this and tried it on my husband and there was no difference. I can&#x27;t figure out why there are some good reviews on this item. I tried it with and without perfume. Husband liked the perfume, but I wear it all the time. I never told him I purchased this item so he never knew I had it on.</li>
            <li> Well! So far, so good. I&#x27;ve noticed men have been more sociable around me, and much more polite -- totally bizarre for people around my age group. I love it!</li>
            <li> After all the positive reviews I hate to be a naysayer but this is  a totally bogus product. At best, it has the smell of a cheap scented oil- the kind you can get for $10 from someone at a sidewalk kiosk. I guess the placebo effect is alive and well - perhaps the people wearing this allowed their beast out to play a bit more and that&#x27;s what resulted in all the positive results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like the kid who yelled &amp;#34;The Emperoro is Naked&amp;#34; when everyone else was admiring his fine new clothing. My European husband had to laugh at how gullible Americans remain to the same huckster quackery that has been in vogue for hundreds of years. We had a good laugh over this one and have resumed using the inexpensive Italian cologne he most enjoys: Cerruti 1881 - a light floral fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be a lot of money to be made in the placebo effect</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 weeks, this product didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I really believe that most of the positive reviews about this pheromone bootle are fake,what a shame!</li>
            <li> when the guy I was seeing started seeing someone else, I got so mad!!  So I borrowed some of this stuff from my friend and went out on a Friday night to the bar I knew he would be at.  Not only was he there, but he was with HER.  Ick.  I was cool, collected, and had on my best red lipstick.  And you know what?  He couldn&#x27;t take his eyes off me and couldn&#x27;t stop talking to me.  In fact he didn&#x27;t really pay much attention to her at all and she left in a huff.  I SWEAR TO GOD.  And when he asked to take me home, I very clearly ripped him a new one.  No lie, this stuff is perfect revenge making in a tiny little bottle!</li>
            <li> I do not like me because it gave me allergy</li>
            <li> First time trying these products and I found this one did give me that extra something ...I did get attention more than usual...I tried other products after this but was disappointed with them...will go back to this for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this just to see if there is anything to it and there really isn&#x27;t. It is another product promising change in your life, but another product that doesn&#x27;t deliver. Try smiling at the person you are interested, crack a joke and ask questions... that seems to work much better.</li>
            <li> This product reminds me of the store of the Emperor with no clothes on.  This item has absolutely no scent at all, so as far as I know, it might just be a bottle with nothing more than kitchen oil inside.  For the record, men are NOT that sensitive that they can be turned on by a product that has no scent at all.  Hey, I fell for this product and purchased it based on the hype in the ad, so I guess that I have no one but myself to blame for wasting my money!!!</li>
            <li> no reaction at all.  i used it many times in many different situations and i didn&#x27;t knotice any difference any anyone&#x27;s behaviors.</li>
            <li> Loool when I first got it, my boyfriend would sniff the spots where I secretly put it and get more sexually assertive. After we had sex he told me that he didn&#x27;t know why he got like that and I smiled to myself because it was this beautiful thing... I used it sparingly because I&#x27;m a poor college student and i don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ll be able to buy another one.. I tried using it again a year later and i already have a lot of sex with my boyfriend so it&#x27;s too hard to tell if it&#x27;s working anymore lool but I liked the quick response in the very beginning when I first used it.</li>
            <li> Item arrived promptly and as described.</li>
            <li> What a joke! Olive oil would work better! I can&#x27;t believe I was so gullable.</li>
            <li> Drinks sent to my table when I am in my work clothes. Men giving me attention even when I am dressed in crappy work clothes. I was a skeptic but now I am a believer</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if I could perk up my husband. In the first 3 days I wore it I ended up getting hit on by the UPS guy, a fat man who took second prize at a local moustache competition, an old guy that lives out of his pickup near the park I work at and this sneaky little Mexican guy who works at the Shell. But not my husband. I think maybe he dosn&#x27;t like me? So moral of my story is, yeah, I think it works but don&#x27;t expect it to work on who you want it to work on.</li>
            <li> the reviews I read were 50/50, so I figured it was all about an individual&#x27;s chemistry.  Not.  It is really a waste of money. It is hard to put on, which they didn&#x27;t explain about the dropper, and once you get it out of this dropper and onto your skin, it seems that you are the only one that knows you have it on.  Peace.</li>
            <li> I like it guys seem to be a little nicer.... And a little more touchy feely. That can be a good or bad thing but I am satisfied!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money on this one. It has no effect on anyone or anything. I only wish there was a rating less than one star!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works or not...but makes my adrenaline level go up like having too much caffeine. So, I dont use it enough to know if it works or not.</li>
    </ol>
