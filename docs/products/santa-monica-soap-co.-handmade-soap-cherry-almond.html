            <li>lathers beautifully and leaves my skin soft.....</li>
            <li>It is a nice hard bar of soap with the most delicious smell ever.</li>
            <li>But the cherry smell is way too strong.  </li>
            <li>first, it smells amazing---has an amazing cherry juice type of scent....</li>
            <li>Has a very light cherry almond scent that can make you think of fresh baked cookies.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s delicious and mouthwatering but it&#x27;s not too sweet like other brands of soaps can be.</li>
            <li>Good lather and leaves the skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>The only thing the bar has going for it is that it is attractive.  </li>
            <li>Smells fantastic...</li>
            <li>I just started using handmade soaps so still looking for a favorite, but this was worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Buying more very soon.</li>
            <li>Bought only for scent smell, smells good</li>
            <li>just the right amount of sweet cherry smell and blend of almond.  </li>
            <li>The soap smells exactly how I hoped!</li>
            <li>This soap smells fantastic, and is gentle on my sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t tend to like many soaps.</li>
            <li>stars well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love everything about it from the generous bar size to the natural texture it has.</li>
            <li>Nice soap..leaves my skin clean and fresh...helps with my dry skin</li>
            <li>My favorite so far.</li>
            <li>My favorite so far.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>High quality, and several guests have asked &amp;#34;what smells so good?&amp;#34; love it!</li>
            <li>and I really like Santa Monica Soap C.!</li>
            <li>I had to buy another cherry almond bar of soap because our youngest daughter took the first one for herself.</li>
            <li>Another P.S. - Just bought one for ME&amp;#62; In case anybody is interested, I am on my fifth bar now.</li>
            <li>I will definitely come back and get more of this!</li>
            <li>It was irresistible to her and she loves the smell as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I hope she loves it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>leave you with a squeaky clean experience.&lt;br /&gt;Fellas, (if there are any out there that would actually buy this like me), DO NOT SHAVE YOUR FACE &amp; then use this soap on your face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>She especially loves Jergens cherry almond lotion, which this soap smells exactly like!  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once, so the 5 stars mainly goes for the scent.</li>
            <li>I just purchased the fourth bar of this soap for my daughter who is recuperating from major surgery.</li>
            <li>This is unlike other high-end bars such as Pre de Provence which are much mure durable.  </li>
            <li>A nice scent not overwhelming but not too subtle either.</li>

            <li> Also, have I mentioned how hard it is to find a cherry scented body product?</li>
            <li> AWFUL, SMELL LIKE A SEWAGE PLANT DISGUSTING</li>

            <li> Love this soap!  Incredible scent- not overpowering, just the right amount of sweet cherry smell and blend of almond.  Good lather and leaves the skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This smells awesome and I really like Santa Monica Soap C.!</li>
            <li> This soap smells fantastic, and is gentle on my sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t tend to like many soaps. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> The soap smells exactly how I hoped! A perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
            <li> The bar is attractive and that is why I bought it (as a decorative soap bar for the vanity).  But the cherry smell is way too strong.  I thought that if I left it out a few days the smell would dissipate and it did but not to the degree I hoped.  Every time you entered my small master bathroom you&#x27;d smell this cherry smell.      So I decided to give up on the decorative aspect and use it as a regular shower bar and after I&#x27;d used about half the bar it became very soft and gooey and big pieces would flake off.  This is unlike other high-end bars such as Pre de Provence which are much mure durable.  The only thing the bar has going for it is that it is attractive.  I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and cleans well too. Has a very light cherry almond scent that can make you think of fresh baked cookies.</li>
            <li> Best smelling cherry almond soap ever!!!</li>
            <li> Best smelling soap ever. It even lingers in your bathroom for a bit after usage, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;Does leave you with a squeaky clean experience.&lt;br /&gt;Fellas, (if there are any out there that would actually buy this like me), DO NOT SHAVE YOUR FACE &amp; then use this soap on your face. It will sting.&lt;br /&gt;This is a body bar only, as it has been stated by the company themselves. You could also use it as a fancy alternative to your liquid soap at the sink. Looks nice.&lt;br /&gt;4 stars well worth the price.</li>
            <li> AWFUL, SMELL LIKE A SEWAGE PLANT DISGUSTING DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. BEST THING ABOUT THIS TRASH WAS THAT AMAZON REIMBURSED ME ASAP.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and is a nice experience washing hands or body.</li>
            <li> I received this soap as part of a gift set. I love everything about it from the generous bar size to the natural texture it has. In the shower it releases a wonderful Cherry Almond fragrance that&#x27;s sexy and natural. It&#x27;s delicious and mouthwatering but it&#x27;s not too sweet like other brands of soaps can be. Also, have I mentioned how hard it is to find a cherry scented body product? It&#x27;s definitely not easy - and when you finally do find it, you have to be careful with the chemicals if synthetic concoctions aren&#x27;t your thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of lather, I find the lather just right. I&#x27;ve only used this once, so the 5 stars mainly goes for the scent. My skin seemed softer and smoother, but I&#x27;ll see how good it is with continued use, and I&#x27;ll update my findings then.</li>
            <li> I will definitely come back and get more of this! Smells great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like most soap does.</li>
            <li> Love these soaps. Leaves skin feeling soft,smooth no soap residue. Buying more very soon.</li>
            <li> Boy does this smell good</li>
            <li> Nice soap..leaves my skin clean and fresh...helps with my dry skin</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic... I almost want to take a bite!</li>
            <li> Wow...I just love it.....first, it smells amazing---has an amazing cherry juice type of scent....lathers beautifully and leaves my skin soft.....great soap!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Delicious! Ok, don&#x27;t eat it, but it smells downright yummy and has a great lather. High quality, and several guests have asked &amp;#34;what smells so good?&amp;#34; love it!</li>
            <li> The sent is chemicals.  Burned my face and skin.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best soap in the world!!!! Aroma is spectacular, and skin feels squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap as a present for my mom who loves almond-scented soaps.  She especially loves Jergens cherry almond lotion, which this soap smells exactly like!  She loved it!</li>
            <li> My special treat for myself arrived today and it smells wonderful. It smells so good that I almost want to take a chomp out of it. Yum. I love the fragrance of cherry and almond. I am already enjoying this treat. It is a nice hard bar of soap with the most delicious smell ever. I am so pleased with this purchase. P. S. I had to buy another cherry almond bar of soap because our youngest daughter took the first one for herself. It was irresistible to her and she loves the smell as much as I do. She has actually given up body wash in favor of cherry almond soap. It is so delicious smelling. PS. This is the third bar of cherry almond soap that I have ordered. That should definitely tell you something. I am smelling delicious. Another PS. I just purchased the fourth bar of this soap for my daughter who is recuperating from major surgery. This is my most favorite smell/flavor so I thought I would share. I hope she loves it as much as I do. Another P.S. - Just bought one for ME&amp;#62; In case anybody is interested, I am on my fifth bar now. I wish my girls didn&#x27;t like this soap so much!!!!!</li>
            <li> I just started using handmade soaps so still looking for a favorite, but this was worth the price in my opinion. My favorite so far. A nice scent not overwhelming but not too subtle either.</li>
            <li> My favorite so far. Wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> This soap is so scrumptious. I absolutely LOVE it!!!  I will be buying much more of this.</li>
            <li> Bought only for scent smell, smells good but I need to bring up to nose and sniff.</li>
