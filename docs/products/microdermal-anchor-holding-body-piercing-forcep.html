            <li>When the clamps are tightened all the way on just the holed out area, you can spin the top and anchor together because...</li>
            <li>If you tried to use this to hold onto your dermal piercing, you would rip it out for sure.</li>
            <li>People, do not listen to Michael, who has posted that these have been redesigned and should now fit under the gem of a microdermal.  </li>

            <li>As someone who is taking the tops off their own chest dermals from home, it can get a little tough.</li>

            <li> The picture shown on Amazon is a nearly flat pair or forceps, these are not flat.  </li>
            <li> The flat metal piece on the end is way to think to hold the dermal post.</li>
            <li> Let me assure you from my experience this evening, having just wasted money on a pair, that these forceps are too thick to fit under a microdermal gem.  </li>
            <li> I am a medical provider and I use these to remove the implant from patients who no longer want them or due to complications.</li>
            <li> well, it&#x27;s not really clamping it.</li>
            <li> You do need to buy the other ones that hold the diamond or if you would like to twist it off with pliers you can.</li>
            <li> The product is nowhere near as thin as they advertise.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact the tip would not fit under my dermal without pulling the anchor up and pinching my skin.  </li>
            <li> These hold on great, the problem is , is that they are too thick, they need to be a tad bit skinnier, to clamp them shut it would force my dermal out of my skin, so I ended up having to tear it halfway out (very painful) to get these to shut, &amp; then since there was hardly any space they pinched my skin (also very painful ontop of the already very painful pain I was feeling), this could all easily be avoided if they were just a tad skinnier, I won&#x27;t be changing my tops hardly ever after that.</li>
            <li> I know you have to see these comments &amp; you still send out thick forcepts üòëüëè</li>
            <li> but I was a little disappointed that it was so thick.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m looking for a less painful way to change my dermal toppers.</li>
            <li> They are blatantly ripping people off</li>
            <li> Had a difficult time getting it under my dermal</li>
            <li> And you don&#x27;t even deserve one star for these piece of crap forcepts.</li>

            <li> The picture shown on Amazon is a nearly flat pair or forceps, these are not flat.  As a matter of fact the tip would not fit under my dermal without pulling the anchor up and pinching my skin.  I&#x27;m certain they would work but I&#x27;m looking for a less painful way to change my dermal toppers.</li>
            <li> These are EXCELLENT at gripping the dermal for removal! I am a medical provider and I use these to remove the implant from patients who no longer want them or due to complications. Best product out there for this purpose. The autoclave wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as shown in the picture. I changed my neck piercing without a problem with this. You do need to buy the other ones that hold the diamond or if you would like to twist it off with pliers you can.</li>
            <li> When putting in dermals this kit makes life that much simpler.üòÑ</li>
            <li> Great tool! It works great when I am changing out my dermals!</li>
            <li> made easier to find hole of anchor</li>
            <li> Forceps write what they appear to be in the picture.  No problems with them.</li>
            <li> People, do not listen to Michael, who has posted that these have been redesigned and should now fit under the gem of a microdermal.  Let me assure you from my experience this evening, having just wasted money on a pair, that these forceps are too thick to fit under a microdermal gem.  The picture above showing the forcep around a microdermal is inaccurate.  Do not buy.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.. Easy to open and very accurate product description.</li>
            <li> these are much thicker then i thought they would be, basically normal straight clamps with a bend a small hole, they should still work though</li>
            <li> So sometimes this tool works. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. As someone who is taking the tops off their own chest dermals from home, it can get a little tough. I wouldn&#x27;t actually use the hole that is left there for the anchor itself, but rather use the teeth to actually grip onto it. When the clamps are tightened all the way on just the holed out area, you can spin the top and anchor together because...well, it&#x27;s not really clamping it.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I could get the stone to come off. I needed help to have my husband twist while I held the forcep in place. I screamed and that was the end of it. I ended up going to a piercing shop and had them remove my stone.</li>
            <li> The product is nowhere near as thin as they advertise. It is not the forcep they have in the picture at all. It is actually the forcep they use to hold the dermal before they put it in. If you tried to use this to hold onto your dermal piercing, you would rip it out for sure. Do not buy this.</li>
            <li> I only gave this one star because it doesn&#x27;t work with a dermal at all! The flat metal piece on the end is way to think to hold the dermal post. DO NOT waste your money on this item!</li>
            <li> These hold on great, the problem is , is that they are too thick, they need to be a tad bit skinnier, to clamp them shut it would force my dermal out of my skin, so I ended up having to tear it halfway out (very painful) to get these to shut, &amp; then since there was hardly any space they pinched my skin (also very painful ontop of the already very painful pain I was feeling), this could all easily be avoided if they were just a tad skinnier, I won&#x27;t be changing my tops hardly ever after that.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality tools!</li>
            <li> I have to give you one star to even leave a comment. And you don&#x27;t even deserve one star for these piece of crap forcepts. I should have read the comments first. They are blatantly ripping people off cause I know you have to see these comments &amp; you still send out thick forcepts üòëüëè</li>
            <li> it pinches your skin plus they wont let you sent it back.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly but I was a little disappointed that it was so thick.  Had a difficult time getting it under my dermal</li>
            <li> Perfect. All of the heads are off. I had to drill another hole in them to hold a 16g anchor. The hole in them is for a 12 g or 14 g.  Remember to put something on your skin so they slide easier or they WILL bite you. I use A&amp;D ointment on my customers.</li>
