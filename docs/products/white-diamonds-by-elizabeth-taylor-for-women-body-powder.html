            <li>and I love the powder.</li>
            <li>I do too :-)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find it in any stores.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is too strong for me, one more thing</li>
            <li>I love this powder as an accent to White Diamonds Brilliant spray.</li>
            <li>AMAZON makes shopping at home more fun!  </li>
            <li>VERY STRONG AT FIRST..........</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use perfume and this is a great alternate and works well.</li>
            <li>The smell is soo fresh, I am in love with it.</li>
            <li>Another great home run for the Elizabeth Taylor White Diamonds&#x27; collection!</li>
            <li>the spray is good ,but not to soft for me,I use it anyway</li>
            <li>It smells clean and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>She considers the powder to be a luxury and a special treat to have and use.</li>
            <li>Makes you feel good when you open the container.  </li>
            <li>White Diamonds has a light sweet smell and I am sure everyone will love the smell..</li>
            <li>This powder has a light scent and is very smooth leaving your body soft.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li>After many years of struggling trying to find \\&quot;my fragrance\\&quot; and a scent that would not trigger my husband&#x27;s allergies into high gear, this is it.</li>
            <li>It smells good and the scent lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s such a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is such a sweet but not strong fragrance - smell wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Also, since none of  the stores around me carry dusting powder any more, I didn&#x27;t  know how many ounces were in a typical dusting powder container.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of talc, &amp; just used regular powder before, but love to use this now after a shower</li>
            <li>I was so pleased in came in a timely manner and hopefully in the future I can order again.  </li>
            <li>My mother has been in love with White Diamonds ever since I can remember.</li>
            <li>exactly what Mama wanted ty will buy again</li>
            <li>I love this bath powder and use it daily!  </li>
            <li>The price was great as i saved $4.00 buy getting two of the smaller boxes ounce wise instead of the one big one and had almost the same amount of powder as the big one.</li>
            <li>She loves White Diamonds, it&#x27;s her favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell of White Diamonds perfumes and lotions and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li>The body powder comes in a pretty white container that fits nicely in your bathroom and the powder puff is soft and allows for just the right amount of talc.  </li>
            <li>The large sized &amp;#34;Powder Puff&amp;#34; that is included is just right for applying this product over the whole body.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mother to use for dusting powder after a shower and with the holes on the top of the container so you can&#x27;t just dump out the powder, she can&#x27;t shake enough powder out to be happy with what she is getting, so she is not really happy with this so-called improvement in the product.</li>
            <li>Thanks AMAZON.</li>
            <li>I really like it and will order it again.</li>
            <li>Really like this body powder.  </li>
            <li>The stores around here are not selling much powder anymore.</li>
            <li>It was a gift, the pers really likes it.</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>This smell is wonderful, it fills her entire room without making you ill.</li>
            <li>I ordered the 2.6 oz size and was thrilled to discover the size of the container and the puff are larger than expected.</li>
            <li>the white box is pretty on the dresser......</li>
            <li>As far as the quality, well, it&#x27;s a known perfume to my mother</li>
            <li>My White Diamonds Dusting Powder just arrived and I was pleasantly surprised at the size.</li>

            <li> Beautiful.!It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Cannot move due to a stroke.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy any other now.</li>

            <li> Amazon comes through with hard to find items, as well as affordable ones.  </li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t be too hard on anyone for that.  </li>
            <li> Elizabeth Taylor and I don&#x27;t have in common.</li>
            <li> So delicate and the smell.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it was just a refill at this price</li>
            <li> Damaged box and dirty container inside.</li>
            <li> I ordered this not knowing what it would smell like --- but it&#x27;s got Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s name, so how bad could it be?  </li>

            <li> I love the product it arrived on time,and I was very pleased with the product! I was afraid it was just a refill at this price but is was all I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> This is great as a body powder and as a powder to make hair smell great. Just put it in your hair and wipe off with a towel.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is too strong for me, one more thing Elizabeth Taylor and I don&#x27;t have in common. But the box is nice.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this not knowing what it would smell like --- but it&#x27;s got Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s name, so how bad could it be?  I really like it and will order it again.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful body powder, the scent is light but nice.  perfect touch after a shower.  I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> Always looking for nice scented body powder.  My mom loves this tool.</li>
            <li> very happy no complaints at all exactly what Mama wanted ty will buy again</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this dusting powder for years.</li>
            <li> Really like this body powder.  It smells good and the scent lasts for a long time.  I will order this again.</li>
            <li> Damaged box and dirty container inside. The product still good quality</li>
            <li> very happy with seller and product</li>
            <li> I love this bath powder and use it daily!  The scent is wonderful. Buy for yourself or as a gift.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li> After many years of struggling trying to find \\&quot;my fragrance\\&quot; and a scent that would not trigger my husband&#x27;s allergies into high gear, this is it. I love the powder, body lotion, body cream and shower gel. If they made a shampoo, I would hoard that also! Can&#x27;t get enough of this product line!</li>
            <li> This powder is sooooo goooood.  I love the fragrance after it is splashed on.  It leaves you with a lingering scent, even when you have had it on awhile and retire to bed.  I am a powder queen and my  PARIS decor in the bathroom shows it. Just blow it off!  I am hoping that all women who are powder queens will give this a try.  The price was great as i saved $4.00 buy getting two of the smaller boxes ounce wise instead of the one big one and had almost the same amount of powder as the big one. Get some!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a bunch  Linda L Holder</li>
            <li> If you use it you know what it is, love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the fragrance of this powder. It has become my favorite. It lasts all day and into the night. It&#x27;s not overpowering as some can be. I won&#x27;t buy any other now. I&#x27;m spoiled.</li>
            <li> This arrived well packaged, but didn&#x27;t arrive until a day later than was promised with Prime.  I understand it&#x27;s Christmas so I won&#x27;t be too hard on anyone for that.  As far as the quality, well, it&#x27;s a known perfume to my mother so she&#x27;ll be thrilled.  And like I said, the powder arrived well packaged and the powder box in wonderful shape to put under the tree!</li>
            <li> This was bought as part of a gift for my sister.  She loves White Diamonds, it&#x27;s her favorite fragrance.  She considers the powder to be a luxury and a special treat to have and use.</li>
            <li> My mother loves White Diamond products so this was a gift sent to her for Christmas.  She really loved it.</li>
            <li> My elderly mother was looking for body powder. The stores around here are not selling much powder anymore. When I saw this item on Amazon I immediately bought this. My mother loves it. It has a lovely scent.Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this. So delicate and the smell. Beautiful.!It lasts a long time.Makes your skin feel like velvet.This is the only one I will buy</li>
            <li> It was a gift, the pers really likes it. the spray is good ,but not to soft for me,I use it anyway</li>
            <li> My mother uses this and so I decided to give it a try. The smell is soo fresh, I am in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Smell great!</li>
            <li> My White Diamonds Dusting Powder just arrived and I was pleasantly surprised at the size. When I ordered I wasn&#x27;t sure which size to order. Also, since none of  the stores around me carry dusting powder any more, I didn&#x27;t  know how many ounces were in a typical dusting powder container. I ordered the 2.6 oz size and was thrilled to discover the size of the container and the puff are larger than expected. The diameter of the container is 4.5 inches and 2 inches tall. This is the size I remember from  days gone by.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.  The scent is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I purchased one for me and one for a friend.  It smells clean and is not overpowering. I&#x27;ve been using this for years.</li>
            <li> Lovely smelling body powder in an easy to use and attractive container. The large sized &amp;#34;Powder Puff&amp;#34; that is included is just right for applying this product over the whole body.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift.  The fragrance is lovely, the recipient loves it and the price was great.</li>
            <li> This is lovely and arrived in perfect condition...</li>
            <li> This is one of the best dusting powder scents.  I dusted my body all over with this powder.  Thank u, Elizabeth:}</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, was a gift, they said they  liked it.</li>
            <li> This is a refreshing way to start your day. This powder has a light scent and is very smooth leaving your body soft. I use it before work and after every shower it makes my days start a little fresher.</li>
            <li> White Diamonds has a light sweet smell and I am sure everyone will love the smell..I gave this one a 5 star rating...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of White Diamonds perfumes and lotions and this is no exception.  The body powder comes in a pretty white container that fits nicely in your bathroom and the powder puff is soft and allows for just the right amount of talc.  Another great home run for the Elizabeth Taylor White Diamonds&#x27; collection!</li>
            <li> Great item and fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> Good price. Fast service. Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I love this powder as an accent to White Diamonds Brilliant spray.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother to use for dusting powder after a shower and with the holes on the top of the container so you can&#x27;t just dump out the powder, she can&#x27;t shake enough powder out to be happy with what she is getting, so she is not really happy with this so-called improvement in the product. Still looking for one that does not have the limiting top on it.</li>
            <li> Good Service.  Good price</li>
            <li> Order was delivered on schedule and I love the powder.</li>
            <li> Great price save time and gas didn&#x27;t fight the crowds.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the fragrance. I do too :-)</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Was very happy to have found this product on line.  I wasn&#x27;t able to find it in any stores.</li>
