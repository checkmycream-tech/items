            <li> the fan would make strange noises before it would start to work.</li>
            <li> This worked just like the cartridge that came with the Me and lasted just as long.</li>
            <li> The Replacement Cartridge seems to have lasted as long as it was expected to.  </li>
            <li> The only area I have a little difficulty with is my underarm but the rest of my body</li>
            <li> This replacement is just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know about this product yet ,  some improvement, but cartridge does not last anytime for the cost, very expensive if you use it much</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this system to anyone who is tired of shaving.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive purchase and I would have thought the manufacturer would stand by their product no matter what.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works perfectly with 4 year old Me Elos.</li>
            <li> Three months after purchasing this device, the device stopped working.  I contacted the manufacturer, Illuminage Beauty, to see if we could send it in under warranty and they declined coverage because the receipt reflected we had purchased the device from a non-authorized dealer, RMK Distributors.  After multiple e-mails with Illuminage Beauty customer service, we still have an unusable machine with no warranty coverage.  It is incredibly dissappointing.  This is an expensive purchase and I would have thought the manufacturer would stand by their product no matter what.  If RMK is selling it on amazon, then that is an issue between RMK, Illuminage, and amazon, but not something the ultimate customer should have paid the price for.</li>
            <li> the fan would make strange noises before it would start to work. The cartridge will get too warm and couldn&#x27;t use it because it&#x27;s too hot to put to the skin. Hair reduction did not actually happen. Overall the product was not what it claims to be</li>
            <li> I used this item for 8 months non stop, at first the hairs tool longer (two or three days more than usual) to grow  but at the end of the day the hair continued to grow.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know about this product yet ,  some improvement, but cartridge does not last anytime for the cost, very expensive if you use it much</li>
            <li> This replacement is just what I expected. I love the Me Elos. So nice not having to shave. I have been using it once a month for over a year. The only area I have a little difficulty with is my underarm but the rest of my body it is easy and painless.</li>
            <li> Still don&#x27;t know how effective it,is. Doesn&#x27;t seem to reduce hair growth completely</li>
            <li> They raised the price now that I came back for another one, it was $42. and change now it&#x27;s $50.  It worked fine but not as smooth as the me smooth cartridge and it&#x27;s $50, so I&#x27;ll just go back to Sephoria and get it quick with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> The cartridge works great with my ME smooth machine and cheaper then the store, I will re order again I love it.</li>
            <li> I am still using the cartridge that came withe the Tanda Me Smooth machine.  When I use up the first cartridge, I will use this one.</li>
            <li> Perfect delivery, and match as per my requierement, and perfect packaging. And Good quality and looks very nice plastic color, my wife love it. I am the home king now</li>
            <li> I was glad to find the Elos replacement cartridge at Amazon. I looked for these replacement cartridges at several dept stores to no avail. The Elos system was a gift from my daughter. I would recommend this system to anyone who is tired of shaving. I give this product a 5 star award.  And the price was right.  Wanda Talbert</li>

            <li> Wish it would last longer!</li>
            <li> My wife use without result, we spend money on additional parts for nothing</li>
            <li> This was just want I was looking for. The cost was a bit too much..</li>
            <li> The Replacement Cartridge seems to have lasted as long as it was expected to.  I like the freedom of having treatments when most convenient for me, even if it is 10 pm at night.</li>
            <li> This worked just like the cartridge that came with the Me and lasted just as long. I can&#x27;t say enough about how great the Tanda Me Elos works!</li>
