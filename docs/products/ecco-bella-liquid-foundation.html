            <li>Best product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Perfect color, consistency, and price.</li>
            <li>but this foundation is the best!</li>

            <li>Price was excellent.</li>
            <li>b - very good coverage.  </li>
            <li>Ecco Bella is a very good foundation, I&#x27;ve used it before.</li>
            <li>The aloe formula feels great on the skin.  </li>
            <li>a - it feels great on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and stays put even in Mexico&#x27;s humidity)  </li>
            <li>It has great ingredients, not so of what you buy in department stores, Walmart, etc.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping after reading the many rave reviews that this foundation would be awesome.</li>
            <li>It has good ingredients and goes on very nicely.</li>
            <li>It is especially good for sensitive/allergic skin types, has excellent coverage and yet a very natural look.</li>
            <li>It matched my skin tone good though.  </li>
            <li>c - I feel good about using this product.  </li>
            <li>I really loved this makeup.</li>
            <li>I found Ecco Bella&#x27;s Foundation and was delighted; [ASIN:</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m fair with freckles).</li>
            <li>Blends nicely, goes on smoothly, has good coverage, and its a nice light foundation that lasts all day and best of all the ingredients will not worry you!(They have changed their formulation and it does not contain any parabens anymore.)</li>
            <li>It would be nice if EB updated their page here, but until that happens, please note: THERE ARE NO PARABENS IN THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice dewy finish; not too matte, not too shiny.</li>
            <li>The best coverage I can find on the market, natural or chemical-laden has been Revlon Colorstay.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, just rub it in like moisturizer and make sure it is even.</li>
            <li>This foundation is ok.  </li>
            <li>I need to use powder most days to set it since it is moisturizing</li>
            <li>Since I am breastfeeding my son, and that junk gets into the milk, I am glad I found this.  </li>
            <li>I would say the texture is creamy and the coverage is at most medium.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even tried mixing it with lotion etc and it still streaks and sits on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li>* contain parabens any more, despite what Amazon&#x27;s page says.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If the skin doesn&#x27;t breathe, your pores can become clogged, and healthy skin cells can die.</li>
            <li>more</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>and I have yet to find a foundation that is better.</li>
            <li>Not so much; it does not \\&quot;feel good on your skin\\&quot; as it claims to and does not glide on nicely.</li>
            <li>I always put a translucent powder on top of my liquid foundation for a matte finish and for some oil control, but it did nothing.</li>
            <li>BUT if I layer it, as you would mascara, it does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>Loved the idea of gluten free makeup, but this wasn&#x27;t the right choice for me.  </li>
            <li>This is not only a great product but also safe for me to use.</li>
            <li>It is perfect with the cool pink undertones.  </li>
            <li>It is a light and easy to use foundation.  </li>
            <li>(I was able to compare it to past purchases and there is a very remarkable difference in the color.)</li>
            <li>The ecco bella website states that this foundation is paraben free.  </li>
            <li>then I use a brush and lightly brush over with linen color of the ecco bella pressed powder.</li>
            <li>On a positive note, they have a lot of other products that are awesome.  </li>
            <li>, I tried to give this foundation another shot (the original one I bought), just to make sure if I really wanted to try another color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised how light and very easy</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it in the mail.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, this make-up has such a nice finish to it with great coverage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the natural shade, yet if you&#x27;re looking for a little more skin coloring, you may want a different foundation shade, or use the Ecco Bella Bronzing Powder for a very nice color addition.  </li>
            <li>LUCKILY, it is a decent price, so I think it might be worth one more shot.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and this makeup feels good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many uses you can get out of it and for the price I expected more.  </li>
            <li>Isopropyl palmitate is directly derived from palm, which is the staple food of a prominent species of primates, the orangutan.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>To be fair, I don&#x27;t think this foundation says it&#x27;s for oily skin, but other people with supposedly oily skin said it worked for them.</li>
            <li>I would like to point out that Amazon has a disclaimer right up there under the product, which reads, \\&quot;Disclaimer:</li>
            <li>The combo of the natural with the linen gives my skin a nice natural sun kissed glow!</li>
            <li>She does not have very dry skin or very oily skin, but more combination skin and this smoothed out the combination skin areas just fine.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon (and Ecco Bella!)</li>
            <li>This foundation has recently become my all-time favorite.  </li>
            <li>It actually seemed to make my pore even more visible.</li>
            <li>But, I know now for SURE that I will definitely NOT be trying it again.</li>
            <li>Ecco Bella&#x27;s Liquid Foundation just looks natural &amp; fresh!</li>
            <li>First found it at whole foods but they no longer carry it.</li>
            <li>I would love it (5 stars), except that it never seems to dry, staying a bit \\&quot;sticky,\\&quot; and so by the end of the day my skin oils - I have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin - have lifted the foundation.</li>
            <li>Most important, cancer prone skin needed minimalist cover with no or very few chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and really like it.</li>
            <li>It was very runny.</li>
            <li>Always check the actual product label in your possession for the most accurate ingredient information due to product changes or upgrades that may not yet be reflected on our web site.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought Lanc√¥me, Clinique and other more pricey brand</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it tends to be a little shiny, so I put some powder on top which fixes that easily.</li>
            <li>in the case of this foundation, it&#x27;s particularly apropos.</li>
            <li>Deprived of their main source of subsistence, they are dying from hunger.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this foundation.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use it a little longer before I decide if I&#x27;ll buy more.  </li>
            <li>I have not found any other natural liquid foundation that is vegan, has medium coverage, matches my skin tone, stays on all day, and is more natural than not.</li>
            <li>I mentioned, it is a medium coverage, giving adequate coverage of minor blemishes and evening-out redness.</li>
            <li>I had oily skin, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d love the product so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, the color is not pink or yellow &amp; really blends with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I am in my early 40s and have normal skin that gets quite dry in winter if I&#x27;m not careful, so this moisturizing foundation is juuuuuuust right!</li>
            <li>at first I was shocked by the amount for the money but the quality is great non greasy, cover well</li>
            <li>First off, it&#x27;s super small.  </li>
            <li>It works hard to keep skin healthy with both a UVA/UVB sunscreen, organic herbs, and antioxidants.</li>
            <li>The Natural was much darker and had a very red tint to it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have parabens and they use natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Amazon needs to delete these old statements.</li>
            <li>Looks natural and keeps skin naturally moist.</li>
            <li>FlowerColor Liquid Foundation SPF 15, Natural]</li>
            <li>The natural shade is truly that, natural.  </li>
            <li>It gives me glowing, natural skin.  </li>
            <li>This is completely natural.</li>
            <li>So, I came across Ecco Bella Foundation in my quest for a natural make</li>
            <li>I use the natural color of liquid</li>
            <li>Unfortunately this is the only thing I do not like about the product - the rest of my face needs a warm golden or neutral undertone, which the color does not match.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoother when I put on my sunscreen first as I have dry skin.</li>
            <li>The English lists a whole lot of ingredients; no titanium dioxide, but the French has \\&quot;Actif:</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>all natural is such a misleading name to give products.  </li>
            <li>Organic aloe vera quenches thirsty skin, saccharide isomerate, a natural sugar that binds water to the skin acting as a reservoir for continuous moisture.</li>
            <li>Thought I would try out some liquid for a little better coverage, having a slight case of redness from rosacea.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very clay-like and almost feels like watered down play doh.  </li>
            <li>Also, small tubes are replaced more often and possibly ensure less bacteria.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> the feel of it on my face is like a thick mask that doesnt even cover my acne spots ...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This foundation is ok.  It doesn&#x27;t make me break out but for me feels a little heavy on.  It matched my skin tone good though.  I&#x27;m going to use it a little longer before I decide if I&#x27;ll buy more.  I have a problem with breakouts and need to use whatever will not break me out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this foundation.  The aloe formula feels great on the skin.  I like to use it especially as undereye concealer.  It is perfect with the cool pink undertones.  Unfortunately this is the only thing I do not like about the product - the rest of my face needs a warm golden or neutral undertone, which the color does not match.  But I don&#x27;t care, I still use it...  a - it feels great on my skin.  I need to use powder most days to set it since it is moisturizing and I have combination skin.  (I actually like Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s baby powder for that! Smells great and stays put even in Mexico&#x27;s humidity)  b - very good coverage.  The best coverage I can find on the market, natural or chemical-laden has been Revlon Colorstay.  Stuff is like paint, I tell you.  This doesn&#x27;t match it BUT if I layer it, as you would mascara, it does a pretty good job.  90% of skin discolorations even out.  c - I feel good about using this product.  It doesn&#x27;t have parabens and they use natural ingredients.  Since I am breastfeeding my son, and that junk gets into the milk, I am glad I found this.  I have reordered it a few times already. Yay!</li>
            <li> Other reviews stated the Ecco Bella foundation was not natural. It is no longer correct. Yes, it did have parabens but removed them years ago. Amazon needs to delete these old statements. It is not fair to the company as people will believe them and not buy it. I&#x27;ve used it for years and really like it. It goes on smoother when I put on my sunscreen first as I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product. It is especially good for sensitive/allergic skin types, has excellent coverage and yet a very natural look. It&#x27;s the best foundation I&#x27;ve found in over 20 yrs..I use it with their cover stick applied under the foundation, around eye area on dark circles and on blemishes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this foundation in Bisque for 4 years at least. I found it in a health store in Hong Kong and it was very expensive ($50 US) there. At that time, I did not need another foundation, but the owner of the store said it was made of flowers. I have dry skin and this makeup feels good. It feels like I have nothing on my face and makes my face look like a porcelin doll. I would say the texture is creamy and the coverage is at most medium.</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever used.  Perfect color, consistency, and price. Most important, cancer prone skin needed minimalist cover with no or very few chemicals. Also, small tubes are replaced more often and possibly ensure less bacteria.  Purchased in California 9 months ago, found later on Amazon for less. Price aside, I am trusting that my Ecco Bella \\&quot;discovery\\&quot; will live up to my expectations and be around to highlight, camouflage dark circles, and cover minor imperfections for years to come. Thanks Amazon (and Ecco Bella!)</li>
            <li> I was not real impressed with the coverage of this make-up as I have fairly dark olive skin and I also have oily skin so it did not want to stay on my skin.</li>
            <li> The ingredients list on amazon is incorrect.  The ecco bella website states that this foundation is paraben free.  It is medium coverage without being heavy or noticeable and has moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li> at first I was shocked by the amount for the money but the quality is great non greasy, cover well</li>
            <li> I really loved this makeup. I found it after searching endlessly online and in grocery stores trying to find a product that didn&#x27;t have a TON of gross chemicals in it. It has good ingredients and goes on very nicely. The only downside is that it tends to be a little shiny, so I put some powder on top which fixes that easily.</li>
            <li> This is the greasiest nastiest makeup I have ever used, would NOT recommend. Sticky and gross.</li>
            <li> Looks natural and keeps skin naturally moist.</li>
            <li> I hate this foundation its terrible the color is so not natural and the feel of it on my face is like a thick mask that doesnt even cover my acne spots ...</li>
            <li> I bought this and then read the ingredients.  Oops.  Methylparaben and propylparaben.  Very bad ingredients indeed.  Also, when I used it, it pilled on my skin.  Yuck</li>
            <li> It was very runny. I&#x27;ve used this brand before and will continue. I had to mix it with thicker product to use it</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it in the mail.  Unfortuntely, this did not live up to my expectations.  First off, it&#x27;s super small.  I don&#x27;t know how many uses you can get out of it and for the price I expected more.  Second of all, it&#x27;s impossible to blend.  Impossible.  It&#x27;s very clay-like and almost feels like watered down play doh.  It won&#x27;t blend on the skin at all.  I&#x27;ve even tried mixing it with lotion etc and it still streaks and sits on top of my skin.  I&#x27;m very pale, so I bought the lightest shade because normally the lightest is too dark.  Boy, not with this stuff.  It was almost white in color.  You&#x27;d have to be a vampire or zombie to have that color match.  I won&#x27;t be re-purchasing.  On a positive note, they have a lot of other products that are awesome.  Just not the foundation.</li>
            <li> Ecco Bella is a very good foundation, I&#x27;ve used it before. Just could not tell what color via the presentation online. It has great ingredients, not so of what you buy in department stores, Walmart, etc.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to all dyes and perfumes. This is not only a great product but also safe for me to use.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing and using Ecco Bella for years but the last tube was not true to the color of past purchases. The Natural was much darker and had a very red tint to it. (I was able to compare it to past purchases and there is a very remarkable difference in the color.) Even with a little summer tanning, the foundation was way too dark to use. Unfortunately for me, I did not open the package until after the time for returning. Because of this experience, I have canceled my subscription and moved on to another product. Please check your order for accuracy of color as soon as it arrives.</li>
            <li> Loved the idea of gluten free makeup, but this wasn&#x27;t the right choice for me.  Went on horrible.  Needless to say mine ended up in the trash.</li>
            <li> all natural is such a misleading name to give products.  there are still dangerous chemicals in this product. also, it suggests to apply it before sun exposure, but studies show vitamin a can encourage tumor and lesion growth when worn in sunlight.</li>
            <li> I would like to point out that Amazon has a disclaimer right up there under the product, which reads, \\&quot;Disclaimer: This website is for informational purposes only. Always check the actual product label in your possession for the most accurate ingredient information due to product changes or upgrades that may not yet be reflected on our web site.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in the case of this foundation, it&#x27;s particularly apropos. Because Ecco Bella *has* reformulated/upgraded, and the product does *NOT* contain parabens any more, despite what Amazon&#x27;s page says.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I can&#x27;t believe people are still writing 1-star reviews about this product that they&#x27;ve never tried, just to complain about non-existent parabens. It would be nice if EB updated their page here, but until that happens, please note: THERE ARE NO PARABENS IN THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the product review:&lt;br /&gt;I like it! 4 stars. I would love it (5 stars), except that it never seems to dry, staying a bit \\&quot;sticky,\\&quot; and so by the end of the day my skin oils - I have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin - have lifted the foundation. I use a primer under it now, which solves that problem, but I don&#x27;t like having to use (and pay for) 2 products for one purpose. I have not found any other natural liquid foundation that is vegan, has medium coverage, matches my skin tone, stays on all day, and is more natural than not. I am in my early 40s and have normal skin that gets quite dry in winter if I&#x27;m not careful, so this moisturizing foundation is juuuuuuust right! It has a nice dewy finish; not too matte, not too shiny. I could probably add powder half-way through the day to help with the stickiness, but I&#x27;m lazy and not the type to do anything to my makeup once I leave the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had oily skin, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d love the product so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, it is a medium coverage, giving adequate coverage of minor blemishes and evening-out redness. Bonus: it doesn&#x27;t contain beeswax (a lot of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; foundations have beeswax, which makes me break out like whoa).</li>
            <li> I have used this foundation for 6 years and can&#x27;t find anything else that compares. I&#x27;ve bought Lanc√¥me, Clinique and other more pricey brand but this foundation is the best! First found it at whole foods but they no longer carry it.</li>
            <li> I have been switching my make-up to products without Titanium Dioxide, which is now classified as a carcinogen.  I found Ecco Bella&#x27;s Foundation and was delighted; [ASIN:B000URVDIQ Ecco Bella FlowerColor Liquid Foundation SPF 15, Natural] but there is a big problem.  When my package arrived, the outside package was written in English and French.  The English lists a whole lot of ingredients; no titanium dioxide, but the French has \\&quot;Actif: dioxyde de titane.\\&quot;  That is titanium dioxide!!!  No ingredients on the actual product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now am in touch with the company to deal with this and see what else is misrepresented. The description on Amazon is \\&quot;A treatment, sunscreen and foundation all in one! Water-based,  lightweight and natural-looking, but with excellent coverage. It works hard to keep skin healthy with both a UVA/UVB sunscreen, organic herbs, and antioxidants. Organic aloe vera quenches thirsty skin, saccharide isomerate, a natural sugar that binds water to the skin acting as a reservoir for continuous moisture. Organic herbs and vitamin E rejuvenate, protect and soothe skin.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am 56 and this is the worst foundation I ever had the displeasure of trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It spreads [?] like horribly thick glue and doesn&#x27;t move!&lt;br /&gt;Even after using cleanser some was still left on my nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible stuff and I had to send back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how light and very easy this foundation goes on but also stays on.  The natural shade is truly that, natural.  I&#x27;m happy with the natural shade, yet if you&#x27;re looking for a little more skin coloring, you may want a different foundation shade, or use the Ecco Bella Bronzing Powder for a very nice color addition.  That combination worked for me!</li>
            <li> This foundation has recently become my all-time favorite.  First of all, the color is not pink or yellow &amp; really blends with my skin tone.  It&#x27;s lovely not to have that nasty line on your chin/neck that screams \\&quot;Hello, I&#x27;m wearing make-up!\\&quot;  Secondly, this make-up has such a nice finish to it with great coverage.  It gives me glowing, natural skin.  I previously tried some of the mineral powders for coverage and thought they looked cakey and accentuated my lines and wrinkles and made my face look too dry and phoney.  Ecco Bella&#x27;s Liquid Foundation just looks natural &amp; fresh!</li>
            <li> Suggest you review below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin Irritation&lt;br /&gt;Isopropyl palmitate can cause skin irritations. IPP use, especially in products that also contain synthetic alcohol and isopropyl alcohol, can cause a number of potential skin problems, including acne and dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clogged Pores&lt;br /&gt;Isopropyl palmitate can clog the pores, resulting in the appearance of dermatological conditions such as whiteheads and blackheads. The thickness of the chemicals in IPP can deprive the skin of nutrients such as as oxygen. If the skin doesn&#x27;t breathe, your pores can become clogged, and healthy skin cells can die. This can also lead to dry, flaky skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Environmental Dangers&lt;br /&gt;While its effects on the human body are obvious, IPP also creates some environemntal dangers. Isopropyl palmitate is directly derived from palm, which is the staple food of a prominent species of primates, the orangutan. The rush to procure palm, triggered by the global cosmetics industry&#x27;s clamor for its use as an ingredient, has devastated vast areas of palm growth around the world, including rainforsests. These rainforests are the traditional dwelling place of the orangutans. Deprived of their main source of subsistence, they are dying from hunger. The over-harvesting of palm could lead to the endangerment and even possible extinction of orangutans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read more: What Are the Dangers of Isopropyl Palmitate? | eHow.com [...]</li>
            <li> It is a light and easy to use foundation.  It is easy to use and a little goes a long way.  The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is that sometimes it is hard to regulate how much comes out of the tube, which causes some wasted foundation.  Other than that, it is awesome.</li>
            <li> This is completely natural. No additives and it takes just a dot to.cover. Price was excellent. Love. Will always stay with this product</li>
            <li> Blends nicely, goes on smoothly, has good coverage, and its a nice light foundation that lasts all day and best of all the ingredients will not worry you!(They have changed their formulation and it does not contain any parabens anymore.) Incidentally, I bought this for my mom, who has a slight olive complexion, and darkish circles under the eyes - this foundation in Natural color worked for both her type complexion and the dark circles. She does not have very dry skin or very oily skin, but more combination skin and this smoothed out the combination skin areas just fine.  It&#x27;s also a sunscreen, moisturizer and foundation all in 1. Definitely worth a try!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have to apply a lighter foundation before applying this one.  Otherwise I sometimes feel an itchysensation. I do like the color though. I can&#x27;t figure out which ingredient might be the irritant.</li>
            <li> I like it but I find it a bit expensive</li>
            <li> I had been using Revlon ColorStay Foundation for combination/oily skin and I have yet to find a foundation that is better. UNFORTUNATELY, I&#x27;ve learned that the ingredients are harmful. So, I came across Ecco Bella Foundation in my quest for a natural make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping after reading the many rave reviews that this foundation would be awesome. Not so much; it does not \\&quot;feel good on your skin\\&quot; as it claims to and does not glide on nicely. After I applied it, I was like, \\&quot;Yuck...\\&quot;. I always put a translucent powder on top of my liquid foundation for a matte finish and for some oil control, but it did nothing. My face was shiny after about 1/2 an hour. To be fair, I don&#x27;t think this foundation says it&#x27;s for oily skin, but other people with supposedly oily skin said it worked for them. uh, huh...uh, uh. Not for me. :( It actually seemed to make my pore even more visible. Bleck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color definitely has a pink undertone, which I wanted, but it was too dark for me. (I&#x27;m fair with freckles). I think I will give it another try in a lighter shade, but next time I will use a primer (Reviva), and see if that helps with the application, pores, and oil control. *fingers crossed* LUCKILY, it is a decent price, so I think it might be worth one more shot. I&#x27;ll update when I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I tried to give this foundation another shot (the original one I bought), just to make sure if I really wanted to try another color. But, I know now for SURE that I will definitely NOT be trying it again. Even if I did match my shade, it still will be a poor foundation. It feels so GROSS. . I am so bummed I wasted money on this. I&#x27;m going to try glominerals liquid foundation next....</li>
            <li> The girlfriend here! I have never used liquid foundation, have always used mineral or powder. Thought I would try out some liquid for a little better coverage, having a slight case of redness from rosacea. Anyway, this stuff is amazing! I wish I had tried it a long time ago. Very easy to apply, just rub it in like moisturizer and make sure it is even. I use the natural color of liquid then I use a brush and lightly brush over with linen color of the ecco bella pressed powder. The combo of the natural with the linen gives my skin a nice natural sun kissed glow! It lasts all day too! My face will get oily in the afternoon but not with this stuff! Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin, doesnt clog pores and keeps the oil away (when used with the powder).</li>
