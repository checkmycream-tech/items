            <li>Am glad to know of a source I can get it at and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>but when I received it I was relieved to see that much attention had been attributed to the packaging to make sure I received a product intact and undamaged.  </li>
            <li>The price is good and the effects are terrific.  </li>
            <li>I like Chanel, and Lancôme and this is the only &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; perfume that comes close to all the good brands/fragrances.</li>

            <li>They also find other amazing deals!</li>
            <li>I decided to try this cologne several years back and evidently, my body chemistry is a perfect match for this cologne.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It still smells exactly like I remember!  </li>
            <li>I wore it on my first date with my now husband of 10 years!</li>
            <li>I was so surprised and pleased.  </li>
            <li>Success in two areas I say....</li>
            <li>Not over powering and fresh</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping sweet</li>

            <li>I will most definitely be a returning customer!</li>
            <li>This has been my Mom&#x27;s favorite perfume for my entire life.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of perfumes, but I wanted something light and this is far from it.</li>
            <li>Try it in the store first.</li>
            <li>When she runs low, I search for it and get her some more.</li>
            <li>I have to be careful, since cologne seems to get very strong when it&#x27;s on my skin</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that after all this time, it still exists and I can have it delivered right to my door!</li>
            <li>I wore this in Jr high and was not sure if I would still love it, and guess what I sure did</li>
            <li>With all the positive reviews, I thought we&#x27;d have a winner.</li>
            <li>It is such a light pretty fragrance and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Smart</li>

            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A REAL WINNER IN MY BOOK.  </li>
            <li>smells very good&lt;br /&gt;gets</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about scents.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve always remembered how much Ioved</li>
            <li>Very seductive musk with a sweetness to it.  </li>

            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>I get more compliments wearing this then any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This is one of the first perfumes I was given as a tween-now I&#x27;m nearly thirty</li>
            <li>My friend has asked or should I say hinted to members of her family for her favorite perfume with no success.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product well in advance for a valentine gift for my wife and it arrived several days later than the valentine, the culprit most probably is USPS..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this site.</li>
            <li>The scent is long wearing and clean.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance and have been wearing it for a few years.</li>
            <li>I normally buy this in the stores, but decided to try Amazon this time.</li>
            <li>The bottle of Fire &amp; Ice that I received does not spray, I ordered &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; but the box the cologne was in doesn&#x27;t look new.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne and it is very hard to find in my area and grateful to learn I can just buy it on-line at a very reasonable price....</li>
            <li>I bought this, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s authentic.</li>
            <li>First, a warning--&gt; The product picture is of a different, and unknown to me, product, Fire and Ice Cool.</li>
            <li>If anyone wants it, I&#x27;ve barely used but a spray or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this perfume for the past 19 years and it is still my favorite.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think Fire and Ice is that light of a scent, but at least it&#x27;s not a super strong one.  </li>
            <li>Also the cap is frosted instead of clear, and bottle is clear instead of frosted like the others.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just old.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t smelled this since I was a young teenager</li>
            <li>I look forward to ordering from Amazon in the future, I found it to be a very trusted site.</li>
            <li>my girlfriend loves it was a mothers day gift she couldn&#x27;t find in store and was totally surprised when she opend box</li>
            <li>I first found this back in the mid 90&#x27;s .</li>
            <li>I use NO OTHER COLOGNES ANYMORE!  </li>
            <li>Very hard find love this</li>
            <li>Was exactly the same as the store, not old or different smell.</li>
            <li>My favorite secret perfume that doesn&#x27;t cost hundreds</li>
            <li>Thanks again Amazon for not promising the moon but then delivering it!</li>
            <li>The price is very competitive with other perfume websites and there is the no tax/free shipping bonus.</li>
            <li>I simply love this fragrance and hate that it is not as readily available in stores as it use to be.</li>
            <li>The smell is alright in the first few seconds, then it begins to fume like oven cleaner.</li>
            <li>She has been using for a very long time and it does not get old.</li>

            <li> i have always love this product but its hard to find in stores and to find it and to be at a great price was great.</li>
            <li> My steadfast companion throughout many years now and have never had anyone say they did not like the scent.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a really nice cologne that makes me happy to wear every single day!</li>
            <li> I originally brought it for the name and theme but found it to be wonderfully light and sexy and sensual</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it smells great and lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t break the bank.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Delivery was so quick I enjoyed my perfume a lot faster than I thought I was.</li>
            <li> I receive my cologne much more quickly than anticipated and it was well wrapped.  </li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite perfume ever!</li>
            <li> and I still enjoy spraying it on every time.</li>
            <li> To be honest a lot of men real like its smell.</li>
            <li> and now we both enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I use it lightly during the day, so I can use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I am by no means and expert, but I am male and I thought it smelled great on her.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic scent....</li>
            <li> It was great to have it back on my dresser.</li>
            <li> Great price, bought 3 for the price I would pay at Walgreens for only 1.</li>
            <li> I loved it back then and still love it now.  </li>
            <li> it has a very fresh light smell not over-bearing</li>
            <li> I just love it and was so excited to find it here for such a good price.</li>
            <li> Great gift idea for that someone special at a fantastic low price!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my Fire and Ice and often get asked what perfume I am wearing.  </li>
            <li> -it&#x27;s a unique and lovely scent that makes me feel pretty when I put it on.</li>
            <li> I have worn it for years, and I get many positive comments.</li>
            <li> and it is delivered right to my door!</li>
            <li> And the price is right as well!</li>
            <li> Am glad to know of a source I can get it at and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> but when I received it I was relieved to see that much attention had been attributed to the packaging to make sure I received a product intact and undamaged.  </li>
            <li> The price is good and the effects are terrific.  </li>
            <li> I like Chanel, and Lancôme and this is the only &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; perfume that comes close to all the good brands/fragrances.</li>
            <li> So many people ask me what I am wearing, and are very surpised to find it costs</li>
            <li> will order again sweet</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> He loved it then and I wore it for a long time before they stopped carrying it in drugstores some time ago</li>
            <li> to be able to purchase at a chain drug store, but our new community&lt;br /&gt;does</li>
            <li> They also find other amazing deals!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this cologne several years back and evidently, my body chemistry is a perfect match for this cologne.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It still smells exactly like I remember!  </li>
            <li> I wore it on my first date with my now husband of 10 years!</li>
            <li> I was so surprised and pleased.  </li>
            <li> Success in two areas I say....</li>
            <li> Not over powering and fresh</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping sweet</li>
            <li> /&gt;the price was right for the size i got.</li>
            <li> Best price around for wifes favorite perfume that is getting very hard to find a big box stores.</li>
            <li> By far my favoreite perfume, ive been wearing this stuff for 20 years, and have always had compliments on how sweet it smells!</li>
            <li> I love Fire &amp; Ice and is the only cologne I wear.</li>
            <li> Just be aware of the difference.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I wanted.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely be a returning customer!</li>
            <li> This has been my Mom&#x27;s favorite perfume for my entire life.  </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of perfumes, but I wanted something light and this is far from it.</li>
            <li> Try it in the store first.</li>
            <li> When she runs low, I search for it and get her some more.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful, since cologne seems to get very strong when it&#x27;s on my skin</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that after all this time, it still exists and I can have it delivered right to my door!</li>
            <li> I wore this in Jr high and was not sure if I would still love it, and guess what I sure did</li>
            <li> With all the positive reviews, I thought we&#x27;d have a winner.</li>
            <li> It is such a light pretty fragrance and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Smart</li>
            <li> Never had that happen with the high price perfumes !</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A REAL WINNER IN MY BOOK.  </li>
            <li> smells very good&lt;br /&gt;gets</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about scents.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve always remembered how much Ioved</li>
            <li> Very seductive musk with a sweetness to it.  </li>
            <li> I have never really been able to find another perfume that has lived up to it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments wearing this then any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is one of the first perfumes I was given as a tween-now I&#x27;m nearly thirty</li>
            <li> My friend has asked or should I say hinted to members of her family for her favorite perfume with no success.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product well in advance for a valentine gift for my wife and it arrived several days later than the valentine, the culprit most probably is USPS..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this site.</li>
            <li> The scent is long wearing and clean.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and have been wearing it for a few years.</li>
            <li> I normally buy this in the stores, but decided to try Amazon this time.</li>
            <li> The bottle of Fire &amp; Ice that I received does not spray, I ordered &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; but the box the cologne was in doesn&#x27;t look new.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and it is very hard to find in my area and grateful to learn I can just buy it on-line at a very reasonable price....</li>
            <li> I bought this, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s authentic.</li>
            <li> First, a warning--&gt; The product picture is of a different, and unknown to me, product, Fire and Ice Cool.</li>
            <li> If anyone wants it, I&#x27;ve barely used but a spray or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for the past 19 years and it is still my favorite.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think Fire and Ice is that light of a scent, but at least it&#x27;s not a super strong one.  </li>
            <li> Also the cap is frosted instead of clear, and bottle is clear instead of frosted like the others.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just old.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t smelled this since I was a young teenager</li>
            <li> I look forward to ordering from Amazon in the future, I found it to be a very trusted site.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend loves it was a mothers day gift she couldn&#x27;t find in store and was totally surprised when she opend box</li>
            <li> I first found this back in the mid 90&#x27;s .</li>
            <li> I use NO OTHER COLOGNES ANYMORE!  </li>
            <li> Very hard find love this</li>
            <li> Was exactly the same as the store, not old or different smell.</li>
            <li> My favorite secret perfume that doesn&#x27;t cost hundreds</li>
            <li> Thanks again Amazon for not promising the moon but then delivering it!</li>
            <li> The price is very competitive with other perfume websites and there is the no tax/free shipping bonus.</li>
            <li> I simply love this fragrance and hate that it is not as readily available in stores as it use to be.</li>
            <li> The smell is alright in the first few seconds, then it begins to fume like oven cleaner.</li>
            <li> She has been using for a very long time and it does not get old.</li>
            <li> it was the same smell I remembered from a long time ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has some of the same qualities and it lasts a long time on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have actually had some guys wanting to give me some money to buy more because it drives them crazy.</li>
            <li> Amazon usually has decent prices on it.</li>
            <li> It lasts a really long time too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become our long time</li>
            <li> I expected to get this product 6 days later than I did.  </li>
            <li> So, I just ordered 2 of the larger bottles today as my bottle is almost empty.  </li>
            <li> Will continue buying for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am buying this as a gift for my grandma and she has been using it for as long as I can remember and</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorites for a long time</li>
            <li> I will always buy this as long as I can find it.</li>
            <li> I had been placing it in my cart for the last year or two, but I could never get it shipped when I ordered other items.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other perfumes but always go back.</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to find anywhere in stores, so I am incredibly glad that I can order it from amazon.com.</li>
            <li> on here i bought the bigger size for less.</li>
            <li> so was less than $3.00 for the larger bottle.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m not super crazy about the smell, but I believed all the other reviewers and tried it...</li>
            <li> I have never had anyone say anything bad about it, in fact they love it as well.</li>
            <li> and now it is harder to find.</li>
            <li> The only trouble I&#x27;m having is that the stores don&#x27;t seem to carry it anymore.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the product was what I expected and had sought the product I found in you enchanted with!</li>
            <li> I was reading some of the other reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that I can&#x27;t get it in the stores anymore, but I&#x27;m glad I can depend on people like you to find it for me&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Sorry if that offended any women, but really...)    </li>
            <li> I am not very good a describing smells.</li>
            <li> It was hard for me to find it</li>
            <li> wonderful.it is hard to explain the scent .</li>
            <li> She has had a really hard time finding any in the stores for years.</li>
            <li> I started using Fire &amp; Ice years ago, started having a hard time finding it in stores.</li>
            <li> Sometimes hard to find.</li>
            <li> Hard to find</li>
            <li> I know that sounds crazy, since this is inexpensive,  but the fluid is darker than others I&#x27;ve seen online.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing it since at least the 1990s.</li>
            <li> until lately i could find it just about anywere</li>
            <li> I put some on in the morning and still smell it late into the night.</li>
            <li> My wife understands subtle.</li>
            <li> I HAD A VERY HARD TIME FINDING THIS PERFUME.</li>
            <li> I have never smelled it on another soul, but it is tough to buy in the stores.</li>
            <li> and I never get tired of it.</li>
            <li> Unable to find it in any stores anymore, so hope Amazon continues to carry it.</li>
            <li> I would choose this over some of the expensive perfumes any day.  </li>
            <li> how could I go wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this now for 19 years...sort of crazy to say...</li>
            <li> but it is almost impossible to find in the stores anymore.  </li>

            <li> i have used this for years, and receive compliments all the time on how nice I smell! Never had that happen with the high price perfumes !Unable to find it in any stores anymore, so hope Amazon continues to carry it.</li>
            <li> I bought this, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s authentic. I know that sounds crazy, since this is inexpensive,  but the fluid is darker than others I&#x27;ve seen online. Also the cap is frosted instead of clear, and bottle is clear instead of frosted like the others. There is no name printed on the actual bottle, Just on the cap which is also different.  I don&#x27;t know, it just doesn&#x27;t smell great either. Maybe it&#x27;s just old. I think I will order a different one listed and return this.</li>
            <li> smells great, price is right and will continue to buy through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Totally a Happy Camper.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent! It lasts a really long time too. I often catch my kids sniffing it when they pass by a bottle. I love it and get so many compliments on it. Every time I try to use another scent, I always gravitate back to this one. I have never smelled it on another soul, but it is tough to buy in the stores. But periodically, it is there. So someone else must be wearing it. I have been wearing it since at least the 1990s.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the product was what I expected and had sought the product I found in you enchanted with!</li>
            <li> SO Good!  Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my Fire and Ice and often get asked what perfume I am wearing.  I also tell people to get best price on Amazon.com.  Thank you so much and I will be ordering more soon, don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
            <li> My wife has indicated that she love this fragrance and its one of her favorite to wear when going out</li>
            <li> I love Fire &amp; Ice and is the only cologne I wear. The product was shipped very timely and in excellent shape. I appreciate the promptness as promised.</li>
            <li> still my favorite every day fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for 20plus years love it</li>
            <li> My annual gift to my daughter on her birthday and of course I get it from Amazon. She loves it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product.  It was hard for me to find it but wonderful Amazon had it :)</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this, I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore</li>
            <li> I ordered this product well in advance for a valentine gift for my wife and it arrived several days later than the valentine, the culprit most probably is USPS.. However the product was nice and well packaged.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume! I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores. I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find it here and for a great price! Fast shipping. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Someone needed this as a Christmas present.  Nothing could be found in stores, they were sold out, found on Amazon and at a great price.</li>
            <li> First, a warning--&gt; The product picture is of a different, and unknown to me, product, Fire and Ice Cool. Just be aware of the difference. The description is of the regular version, which is what I ordered and received.    My wife understands subtle. As in- when she puts on make-up, it doesn&#x27;t look like she&#x27;s put on make-up. You don&#x27;t smell her 50 feet away when she&#x27;s wearing perfume. (Sorry if that offended any women, but really...)    She loves this and has worn it for years. I like it on her. It&#x27;s become our long time Christmas tradition for her to get this as a stocking stuffer (Sur-PRISE).</li>
            <li> It was a Christmas gift for my mother and she loves it!</li>
            <li> Great price....happy wife...happy life</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!! I have been wearing this for over 20 yrs.. and I still enjoy spraying it on every time. I cant count how many times I have been asked by others (but esp men) over the years it&#x27;s name. The name speaks for itself.  It is def my signature scent. I was reading some of the other reviews and I agree with everyone who says for some reason it just blends well with their own scent and and does something so special. It smells as beautiful at the end of the night as it does in the beginning. This sexy smell compliments me!! I need to buy stock into it or something because I don&#x27;t know what I would do if I couldn&#x27;t get it anymore.</li>
            <li> I thought this perfume was discont but i am so glad I found it for my sister!!</li>
            <li> I expected to get this product 6 days later than I did.  I was so surprised and pleased.  Thanks again Amazon for not promising the moon but then delivering it!</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on this cologne. It&#x27;s reasonably priced and makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> I love Fire and Ice but it is almost impossible to find in the stores anymore.  I am glad that I can still purchase it on Amazon.  The price is very competitive with other perfume websites and there is the no tax/free shipping bonus.</li>
            <li> I first found this back in the mid 90&#x27;s . I was given a tester of this from a friend to give to my wife. And she fell in love with the scent. so each year i would go out and buy her a bottle . until lately i could find it just about anywere and now it is harder to find. so i decided to try amazon. bang there it was. locally they only had the .5 oz for $18.00 .and on here i bought the bigger size for less. awesome deal.smells wonderful.it is hard to explain the scent .</li>
            <li> The wife&#x27;s favorite fragrance.  Amazon usually has decent prices on it.</li>
            <li> My hubby loved the scent</li>
            <li> Exactly as I wanted. Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Been using this since it came out years ago. Smells awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I love Fire and Ice.  Am glad to know of a source I can get it at and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My wife love&#x27;s this stuff so every year I get her some and this is the best price anywhere trust me great buy!!</li>
            <li> The bottle of Fire &amp; Ice that I received does not spray, I ordered &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; but the box the cologne was in doesn&#x27;t look new. I tried to return the faulty item but found out that cologne cannot be returned to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I purchased the \\&quot;Fire &amp; Ice by Revlon for Women- 1.7 Ounce Cologne Spray\\&quot; and I consider this an excellent buy of a very quality product.  When I ordered this item I was also concerned about the packaging but when I received it I was relieved to see that much attention had been attributed to the packaging to make sure I received a product intact and undamaged.  An excellent product at an excellent price.  I would definitely recommend this product to others and will purchase again myself in the future.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this cologne several years back and evidently, my body chemistry is a perfect match for this cologne.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many people have told me how nice I smelled and ask what fragrance am I wearing.  I use NO OTHER COLOGNES ANYMORE!  THIS IS A REAL WINNER IN MY BOOK.  The only trouble I&#x27;m having is that the stores don&#x27;t seem to carry it anymore.  So, I just ordered 2 of the larger bottles today as my bottle is almost empty.  I hope you continue to offer this truly wonderful cologne.  The price is good and the effects are terrific.  Thank you for a really nice cologne that makes me happy to wear every single day!</li>
            <li> The best perfume I have used. I have received a lot of compliments from people after using this perfume. Totally recommend it</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me back when we were dating, 5 years ago, and I still LOVE IT!!! I&#x27;ve found it cheaper, but not including shipping. This price is great!!</li>
            <li> I love Fire and Ice it has a very fresh light smell not over-bearing and I have used it probably for ten years.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best scents I have ever used, very good product&lt;br /&gt;Fire and Ice, been using for 15 yrs.</li>
            <li> Shipped in great time and my most favorite fragrance ever...great price!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for years...I just love it and was so excited to find it here for such a good price. Now I send my friends and relatives to Amazon to buy perfume for me for special occasions!!! Smart huh! They also find other amazing deals!</li>
            <li> My 1st time using AMAZON didn&#x27;t know what to expect....... well I was so impressed IM HOOKED NOW. Delivery was so quick I enjoyed my perfume a lot faster than I thought I was. I will most definitely be a returning customer!</li>
            <li> My favorite secret perfume that doesn&#x27;t cost hundreds and I always get asked what it is.  I&#x27;ll never tell!  Everyone loves the perfect scent.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a birthday present for the wife.&lt;br /&gt;Used to be able to purchase at a chain drug store, but our new community&lt;br /&gt;does not have that chain.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is there and fills the bill.</li>
            <li> She loves this cologne, so she gets it as needed. I recommend it, smells good. Try it on your woman next time and thank me.</li>
            <li> smells very good&lt;br /&gt;gets rid of the stinky funk</li>
            <li> dunno what else to say, when my women wears this, thought process ceases and as the scent enters my sniffer, I feel almost euphoric around her.</li>
            <li> P.U.  Gave to Goodwill</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for so many years; I just love how it smells.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I found it on Amazon and a very good price, too.  Will continue buying for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great price and lasts quite awhile. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just what the wife wanted</li>
            <li> I use this cologne every day.  Love it.  Unobtrusive and doesn&#x27;t make my family sneeze like some fragrances do !</li>
            <li> Fire and Ice smells so good. To be honest a lot of men real like its smell. I have actually had some guys wanting to give me some money to buy more because it drives them crazy. Each women&#x27;s body has their own unique smell so it depends on how it smells on her.</li>
            <li> This is the best fragrance in the whole world.  I love it and Wal-mart stopped selling it and I was upset.  But was really happy when I found it here.</li>
            <li> Love Fire and Ice!  I have worn it for years and I get many compliments.  I also love the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a favorite for 15 years. I&#x27;m happy I can still purchase it through Amazon for an great price.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m not super crazy about the smell, but I believed all the other reviewers and tried it...everyone else loves it on me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear it because I don&#x27;t like the smell of it. It smells powdery and spicy. Not at all a good combination. Now what do I do with it? If anyone wants it, I&#x27;ve barely used but a spray or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should know better than to buy a perfume solely on good reviews. Shame on me.</li>
            <li> I receive my cologne much more quickly than anticipated and it was well wrapped.  I love this cologne and it is very hard to find in my area and grateful to learn I can just buy it on-line at a very reasonable price....and it is delivered right to my door!</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite fragrance for years. My teen girls even like the scent,this is for all ages. The price is right and the fragrance is awesome.....definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite and that says a lot.  I only use 2 colognes I&#x27;m very picky about scents.  I keep two bottles on my dresser.</li>
            <li> I paid 1/3 the price I pay for it retail in my town!!! I will definitely do it again next time!!!</li>
            <li> Got a great deal!  Great price, then got another $10.00 off for signing up for a card - so was less than $3.00 for the larger bottle.  Extremely great value for this perfume!</li>
            <li> Although I was hesitant to buy this for my wife, she was so wanting to have some \\&quot;Fire and Ice\\&quot; I got it for her.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I have to like the fragrance on her and now we both enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it smells great and lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t break the bank.  It smells like it costs a lot more than 15 bucks.  I like Chanel, and Lancôme and this is the only &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; perfume that comes close to all the good brands/fragrances.</li>
            <li> The scent is beautiful on her and she always get asked what it  is it and how nice it You cannot beat the price! Thankyou wi</li>
            <li> I love the smell and get a lot of compliments while wearing it.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance!!  I get a lot of compliments from men!!</li>
            <li> I use this cologne every day Its my favorite. it got here in time, the packaging was perfect .&lt;br /&gt;great job to the seller. I&#x27;ve used this cologne for 15 years and I&#x27;ve had lots of people ask what it was called and where I got it.&lt;br /&gt;well I&#x27;m disappointed that I can&#x27;t get it in the stores anymore, but I&#x27;m glad I can depend on people like you to find it for me&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you from the bottom of my heart</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this perfume before but I liked it and would order it again. I received many compliments when I wore it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my nurses &amp; they love it.&lt;br /&gt;More great Christmas ideas&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase more for stocking stuffers&lt;br /&gt;Great for the money</li>
            <li> I am buying this as a gift for my grandma and she has been using it for as long as I can remember and this is the 2nd time getting it from Amazon so I will keep getting it from here. Thank you</li>
            <li> I wore this in Jr high and was not sure if I would still love it, and guess what I sure did</li>
            <li> If you like vanilla, ambery scents, you will like this.  Don&#x27;t like this on me but it may be to your taste.  Projection and longevity ok.</li>
            <li> I simply love this fragrance and hate that it is not as readily available in stores as it use to be. It the perfect blend of floral and musk without being overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite perfume ever! It is almost impossible to find anywhere in stores, so I am incredibly glad that I can order it from amazon.com. I have been complimented on my perfume many times before it&#x27;s a fantastic scent!</li>
            <li> This perfume is a staple for me...I order it before I run out.</li>
            <li> Good price for this great cologne!</li>
            <li> This has been my Mom&#x27;s favorite perfume for my entire life.  In recent years, we have had some difficulty finding it in stores.  I was very happy to find it here and for a great price too!  I plan to purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after my favorite beauty guru said that it was her staple fragrance. The scent is long wearing and clean. It reminds me of the fall time. I can see why it has received so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> bought as a Christmas gift for my wife she loves it and I love the smell great price also, will buy her more when this runs out</li>
            <li> it was the same smell I remembered from a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;the price was right for the size i got.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore, but it&#x27;s still my favorite perfume. I always get a lot of compliments on it too!</li>
            <li> my favorite, good value</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my moms since I was 12yo and I&#x27;m still in love as a 30yo woman. Timeless musk scent. Nice and dewy</li>
            <li> One of my most favorite scents</li>
            <li> My mother in law really is happy about us getting this for her.  She has had a really hard time finding any in the stores for years.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t smelled this since I was a young teenager but I&#x27;ve always remembered how much Ioved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still smells exactly like I remember!  I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I use this as a substitute for Chanel no. 5. It has some of the same qualities and it lasts a long time on my skin.I use it lightly during the day, so I can use it all the time. I had been placing it in my cart for the last year or two, but I could never get it shipped when I ordered other items. I finally realized that if I only ordered liquids, it would be shipped without a problem. When I order it again, I&#x27;ll buy several at one time</li>
            <li> I like this scent on me.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased also excited to receive Fire &amp; Ice by Revlon at an excellent price, and not an imposter.  I had looked everywhere for it and was told to go online for the product, after checking out several web sites I found Amazon to be the best. I had fast delivery, product in excellent shape and just what I wanted.  I look forward to ordering from Amazon in the future, I found it to be a very trusted site.</li>
            <li> I love it. Truely the best smell ever.</li>
            <li> This scent is awesome. So many people ask me what I am wearing, and are very surpised to find it costs so little.&lt;br /&gt;I have been wearing it for about 8 years now and I never get tired of it.</li>
            <li> Best price around for wifes favorite perfume that is getting very hard to find a big box stores. Will be back to purchase again.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my wife. She liked the smell. I am not very good a describing smells. I am by no means and expert, but I am male and I thought it smelled great on her.</li>
            <li> love it and bought it fire and ice smells like nothing else and stays with u all day or nite loe it</li>
            <li> Mom loved her Christmas Birthday gift that she received in another state.</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorites for a long time and I can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter as a because gift, she loved it</li>
            <li> My mother in law loved it and the price</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and the price was great I got three bottles for the price of one. ;-) I love it</li>
            <li> Este perfume lo recomiendo porque tiene un olor como dulce y es muy sabroso. Lo es tanto que provoca comerse a la mujer que lo usa</li>
            <li> Would recommend this perfume to anyone wanting a warm and exotic fragrance, but not overpowering.  Been my favorite for many years.  I would choose this over some of the expensive perfumes any day.  Have received many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I started using Fire &amp; Ice years ago, started having a hard time finding it in stores. Only thing I could find is the smaller bottle and it&#x27;s more expensive than ordering in online. I&#x27;m paying about the same price online for the bigger bottle that I would pay for the smaller bottle at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the order. Received in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> love the scent. I received it when they said I would.</li>
            <li> Bought for my friend for Christmas.  She loves it.  I actually liked it too and ordered myself somr</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping sweet</li>
            <li> This was a gift, I heard today from the person I sent it to that she loves it!</li>
            <li> I HAD A VERY HARD TIME FINDING THIS PERFUME. IT WAS SOLD OUT EVERYWHERE. I&#x27;VE USED IT FOR YEARS. I BOUGHT THIS BOTTLE TO REPLACE THE BOTTLE I HAD USED UP.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> This is one of the first perfumes I was given as a tween-now I&#x27;m nearly thirty and it&#x27;s wonderful to be able to buy it here on amazon.  Very seductive musk with a sweetness to it.  I loved it back then and still love it now.  Give it a try ladies-it&#x27;s a unique and lovely scent that makes me feel pretty when I put it on.</li>
            <li> By far my favoreite perfume, ive been wearing this stuff for 20 years, and have always had compliments on how sweet it smells!</li>
            <li> I came across this perfume as a teenager when I took a sample out of a box of my mother&#x27;s hair dye, and have loved it ever since. I wore it on my first date with my now husband of 10 years! He loved it then and I wore it for a long time before they stopped carrying it in drugstores some time ago and I couldn&#x27;t find it. I have never really been able to find another perfume that has lived up to it. For some reason today, I thought, why not search for it on Amazon. I was pleasantly surprised to find that after all this time, it still exists and I can have it delivered right to my door! Can&#x27;t wait till I get it, and I&#x27;m sure my husband won&#x27;t be able to either!</li>
            <li> Sometimes hard to find. Great fragrance.</li>
            <li> The only reason I bought this is because of the reviews. I had never heard of it before and buying a Revlon cologne spray never occurred to me. I LOVE this stuff. It smells sooo good. I put some on in the morning and still smell it late into the night. I will always buy this as long as I can find it.</li>
            <li> she likes it. its her favorite perfume. she happy me happy. now they want nine more words, who&#x27;s review is this?</li>
            <li> Smells really nice. Great gift idea for that someone special at a fantastic low price! I recommend it! &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I give this perfume 5 stars because it has an awesome smell and it is not expensive at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone wanting a perfume that isn&#x27;t flowery and doesn&#x27;t cost alot.</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume at a lower price than walmart. Got several bottles for my mother. Was exactly the same as the store, not old or different smell. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I figured for 12 bucks how could I go wrong. With all the positive reviews, I thought we&#x27;d have a winner. I&#x27;m not a fan of perfumes, but I wanted something light and this is far from it. It&#x27;s the chance you take when ordering online, but good lord. I felt like I was choking. You get what you pay for. The smell is alright in the first few seconds, then it begins to fume like oven cleaner. You&#x27;re better off wearing windex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll gift to my teenage sister, she doesn&#x27;t know any better. Try it in the store first.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic scent....I am thrilled to have found it again!...1st day and nothing but compliments ...luscious,creamy floral...lasts a good 8 hrs....I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Hard to find but it&#x27;s what the wife likes. Great price and immediate shipment. Same quality that you expect from any merchant.</li>
            <li> I buy Fire and Ice for my daughter who has used it since her teens,  I love the smell so I buy it for her online.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, I use to wear it many years ago and had forgotten how much I liked it.</li>
            <li> This is my fave! My boyfriend loves the smell of it as well. very good deal for the price I paid, normally in store anywhere else I&#x27;m looking to pay way more.</li>
            <li> This is a great price. I get complinets on this perfume all the time! Its a great buy. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume and i like it more than many other famous brand names.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recomended for any lady need some perfection.</li>
            <li> My friend has asked or should I say hinted to members of her family for her favorite perfume with no success. The cost fit the pocket change and it made the person very happy. Success in two areas I say....</li>
            <li> my girlfriend loves it was a mothers day gift she couldn&#x27;t find in store and was totally surprised when she opend box</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for the past 19 years and it is still my favorite. It is such a light pretty fragrance and not overpowering. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! Great price for the size. Takes awhile to get, but otherwise satisfied!</li>
            <li> This got here in good time and I love the scent. My husband says &amp;#34; I stink good&amp;#34;. Such a comedian.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this perfume for 10+ years... very unique fragrance and never over-powering.  I got compliments ten years ago, and I still get them now.</li>
            <li> Its the only perfume I wear. I get asked all the time what I wear. Everybody loves the smell. The best ever.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this perfume for many years! This is my favorite&lt;br /&gt;perfume! I love the scent! And the price is right as well!</li>
            <li> Very hard find love this</li>
            <li> I was very impressed at how quickly I was able to order Android receive a product that I have not seen at any store in ages. It was great to have it back on my dresser. If anyone is looking fot a nice inexpensive fragrance try Fire &amp; Ice by revlon</li>
            <li> Love the price and the cologne</li>
            <li> This is my signature perfume and I am always getting compliments on it. Love the smell. Not over powering and fresh</li>
            <li> will order again sweet</li>
            <li> I originally brought it for the name and theme but found it to be wonderfully light and sexy and sensual</li>
            <li> My wife loves Fire and Ice. When she runs low, I search for it and get her some more. I like it too...on her. I bought two which was about the same price as one at a local drug store. Good deal!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and have been wearing it for a few years. I normally buy this in the stores, but decided to try Amazon this time. For the same price I got a bottle twice the size. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> My steadfast companion throughout many years now and have never had anyone say they did not like the scent.</li>
            <li> This was for my wife. She has been using for a very long time and it does not get old.</li>
            <li> My friend loves this cologne and thought it was discontinued. Happy to find it and make it her birthday gift.  She was delighted. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this cologne for years and have gotten many compliments on it. I have to be careful, since cologne seems to get very strong when it&#x27;s on my skin so I try to buy lighter scents. I really don&#x27;t think Fire and Ice is that light of a scent, but at least it&#x27;s not a super strong one.  I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> When total strangers approach and  make complements, ask  about the product and company,  that in itself says it all. I have tried several well known colognes over the years, none have the same effect.</li>
            <li> The only scent I wear.I have worn it for years, and I get many positive comments. This was a great price. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been able to buy 2 bottles for less then 1 bottle in the store, very happy.</li>
            <li> I have literally warn this perfume off and on for over a decade. It broke my heart when I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores any more, but after I found it on line I purchased it, and I have to say, men love this sent. It is warm and feminine with a touch of vanilla.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this now for 19 years...sort of crazy to say...I&#x27;ve tried other perfumes but always go back. I get more compliments wearing this then any other I&#x27;ve tried. People always ask &amp;#34;what are you wearing!?&amp;#34; I&#x27;m a bartender and around people 24/7 -</li>
            <li> Love this cologne. Very light and I always get compliments when I wear it!! For the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I cannot wear a lot of perfume because gives me a headache. I can wear this and get a lot of compliments  on it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, I have been using it for over 20 years and I am always getting compliments. I have never had anyone say anything bad about it, in fact they love it as well. I&#x27;m always being told how I smell good. The price is great, I will never stop using Fire &amp; Ice :-)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and have people ask what I am wearing. My 3 daughters swipe my bottle so often that I finally bought them each one.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!!!! the price is great and got it very fast</li>
            <li> i have always love this product but its hard to find in stores and to find it and to be at a great price was great.</li>
            <li> I use this perfume almost every day. Great price, bought 3 for the price I would pay at Walgreens for only 1. I highly recommend this site. Will definitely shop here for all my perfume.</li>
