            <li>You can use it wet as the best scrub brush I have ever used!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and use, durable too.  </li>

            <li>Nice brush with soft but effective bristles.  </li>
            <li>well constructed and stiff bristles that work very good for a nice scrub a dub dub</li>
            <li>This brush also features a beautiful layered wooden handle and &amp;#34;Made in Germany&amp;#34; quality.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>Is such a great exfoliator.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>And this is great as a back scratcher!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing body brush, It does the job very well.</li>
            <li>It also feels really good on my back :)</li>
            <li>It gets rid of the rough patches (elbows &amp; knees), and it feels soooo good!  </li>
            <li>It may have been a special, but a lucky one for me!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a very firm body brush with a shorter handle and works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and revitalized after I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li>Great product, was absolutely what I wanted and then some as far as a grooming tool for shower.  </li>
            <li>The bristles seem to be just about the right texture for me -- not too scratchy but not too floppy either!  </li>
            <li>of reach do it also cool parts of the body.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Every other aspect is great.</li>
            <li>The size is also perfect for reaching the back easily enough.</li>
            <li>It is a large brush, so it works great for all over body use (without taking too long).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not for people with very sensitive skin, but most will find it invigorating.  </li>
            <li>Item came in great condition just a few bristles squished.</li>
            <li>Be warned though, some with more sensitive skin might find that this brush has TOO invigorating of a scrub.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money and time you will spend renewong and polishing your skin.  </li>
            <li>My husband always comments on my lovely soft skin.</li>
            <li>Finally getting a great scrub, if you want a soft brush this one is not for you.</li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I use dial antibacterial soap to clean the brush and make sure I shake it and hang it to dry.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>At first it almost hurt</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>I lost my first one of these</li>
            <li>I first heard of cactus bristle brushes at a spa</li>
            <li>but am glad that this brush has been keeping up with daily usage in the shower.</li>
            <li>Hot shower and brush scrub is almost like going to the spa</li>
            <li>I felt like it was scratching my skin at first</li>
            <li>he said it sure can scrub his back good.so he told me buy two.</li>
            <li>If you like a good stiff bristled brush, this product is for you.</li>
            <li>Having severe knee and upper arm/shoulder joint problems, this cactus brush fit the bill perfectly, because the bristles are stiff enough to refrain me from using undue scrubbing pressure.</li>
            <li>Only had this one 2 weeks so far; wondering if the bristles may soften up some, but I&#x27;d rather have it a little more rough than too soft and delivery to my door in 2 days is very nice! :)</li>
            <li>Add some body oil for super soft skin!</li>
            <li>really like that this brush on the picture is exactly what you get.</li>
            <li>The brush stays firm and crisp even under very hot water, and seems to have no sign of molding, as many before it have.</li>
            <li>The brush seems to dry better this way.</li>
            <li>I use it on dry skin most the time as this is what i prefer.</li>
            <li>, i have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>the cactus is good and stiff (i could use it a little stiffer but that would be because i enjoy a very stiff brush) it has not lost shape or form and is great.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but I got used to it fast.</li>
            <li>I really like the look and feel of this brush.  </li>
            <li>When I have a bath I put liquid soap and really scrub my skin.</li>
            <li>Takes a while for it to &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; and soften... but scrubs me so very well.  </li>
            <li>A very sturdy brush, seems to do the job.  </li>
            <li>and they said to brush toward your heart and it improves circulation as much as a 30 minute workout would.</li>
            <li>It really gets the job done.</li>
            <li>If you use this before a shower a couple of times a week and follow with moisturizer you will see a real difference in your skin.</li>
            <li>If you want a really gentle brush, this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li>my husband really loves this brush.</li>
            <li>I ordered this brush because I had purchased one at an actual Body Shop store several years ago and liked it a lot.  </li>
            <li>Nice stiff bristles.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a dry brush when my back itches (PERFECT back scratcher) as well as for washing my back in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The handle is nice and long for reaching your legs and back.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and has been extremely irritated this past winter and after one use, I was itch free and my skin absorbed moisturizer 100x better!</li>
            <li>Delivery was prompt and I would highly recommend this brush to everyone</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love everything about it,  except that the handle is not quite long enough.  </li>
            <li>The handle is long so you can get most of your back!</li>
            <li>Firm bristles, which I love.</li>
            <li>Product bristles are nice, thick, and seem to be well constructed.  </li>
            <li>The length is perfect for hard to reach spots on your back and the bristles are pretty stiff.</li>
            <li>Ater the shower you feel like a new person.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>It feels soft when it&#x27;s dry, but when it&#x27;s wet, it has a nice scratch to it.  </li>
            <li>This is a must-have for smooth, exfoliated skin, especially since I need it to get to my back.</li>
            <li>this broad headed one piece really stands up.</li>
            <li>The photo shows the one that I purchased previously, which is a longer brush that is suitable as a back brush.  </li>
            <li>I like this brush as it is soft bristled but still firm enough to be effective.  </li>
            <li>After my first experience with customer service, I did not call back.  </li>
            <li>So initially they are pretty scratchy.</li>
            <li>It should last a little better.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft after I use it.</li>
            <li>Although, if you are looking for a soft brush, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>picture is very decieving,handle is way to short to reach all of your body.</li>
            <li>I purchased a half-dozen of these directly from the Body Shop for $7.50 each.</li>
            <li>by far.</li>
            <li>There is but one true &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; - and that is that the handle should have been a couple of inches longer - other than that, perfection with bristles!</li>
            <li>The handle is only 3 time as long as the head - too short for comfortable use.  </li>
            <li>The nice thing about the brush was that it was one piece so the head didn&#x27;t come off after a week of use like the cheaper ones and the cactus brush only took a few days to break in and lasted and did its job for a long time.  </li>
            <li>The wooden handle keeps it steady in soapy hands.  </li>
            <li>I use it dry before a shower, it really exfoliates the skin.</li>
            <li>I found it a solid brush but not to heavy which was important as well.  </li>
            <li>It was much more firm than I expected.</li>
            <li>Might be harsh for some people, but I absolutely love it and cannot use any other type.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I&#x27;d highly recommend this product especially for anyone with such disabilities.</li>
            <li>but the head is about 1/3 the total length, which is really too short to be a back brush.  </li>
            <li>Just right for getting rid of all the dead skin.</li>
            <li>Brush is just right, not too harsh.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, this brush offers an invigorating scrub that will thoroughly remove dead skin cells, thanks to its cactus fiber bristles.</li>
            <li>The handle could be just a bit longer -- I feel like I really have to stretch to get the center of my back.</li>
            <li>I, personally, would want it no other way.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have some one to scrub your back, say due to a divorce, this tool really helps cleanse the body.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stiff enough to be effective for dry brushing and exfoliating without being too harsh.</li>
            <li>the shorter broad handle still has enough reach for me to get every bit of my back.</li>
            <li>this brush is super hard and it hurt my skin</li>
            <li>The bristles are also longer than typically find, but for legs, back, back of arms, and rump, this brush does the job very well.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I use it on dry skin most the time as this is what i prefer.</li>
            <li> , i have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> the cactus is good and stiff (i could use it a little stiffer but that would be because i enjoy a very stiff brush) it has not lost shape or form and is great.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but I got used to it fast.</li>
            <li> I really like the look and feel of this brush.  </li>
            <li> When I have a bath I put liquid soap and really scrub my skin.</li>
            <li> Takes a while for it to &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; and soften... but scrubs me so very well.  </li>
            <li> A very sturdy brush, seems to do the job.  </li>
            <li> and they said to brush toward your heart and it improves circulation as much as a 30 minute workout would.</li>
            <li> It really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> If you use this before a shower a couple of times a week and follow with moisturizer you will see a real difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> If you want a really gentle brush, this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li> my husband really loves this brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush because I had purchased one at an actual Body Shop store several years ago and liked it a lot.  </li>
            <li> Nice stiff bristles.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a dry brush when my back itches (PERFECT back scratcher) as well as for washing my back in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The handle is nice and long for reaching your legs and back.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and has been extremely irritated this past winter and after one use, I was itch free and my skin absorbed moisturizer 100x better!</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt and I would highly recommend this brush to everyone</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love everything about it,  except that the handle is not quite long enough.  </li>
            <li> The handle is long so you can get most of your back!</li>
            <li> Firm bristles, which I love.</li>
            <li> Product bristles are nice, thick, and seem to be well constructed.  </li>
            <li> The length is perfect for hard to reach spots on your back and the bristles are pretty stiff.</li>
            <li> Ater the shower you feel like a new person.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> It feels soft when it&#x27;s dry, but when it&#x27;s wet, it has a nice scratch to it.  </li>
            <li> This is a must-have for smooth, exfoliated skin, especially since I need it to get to my back.</li>
            <li> this broad headed one piece really stands up.</li>
            <li> The photo shows the one that I purchased previously, which is a longer brush that is suitable as a back brush.  </li>
            <li> I like this brush as it is soft bristled but still firm enough to be effective.  </li>
            <li> After my first experience with customer service, I did not call back.  </li>
            <li> So initially they are pretty scratchy.</li>
            <li> It should last a little better.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft after I use it.</li>
            <li> Although, if you are looking for a soft brush, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> picture is very decieving,handle is way to short to reach all of your body.</li>
            <li> I purchased a half-dozen of these directly from the Body Shop for $7.50 each.</li>
            <li> by far.</li>
            <li> There is but one true &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; - and that is that the handle should have been a couple of inches longer - other than that, perfection with bristles!</li>
            <li> The handle is only 3 time as long as the head - too short for comfortable use.  </li>
            <li> The nice thing about the brush was that it was one piece so the head didn&#x27;t come off after a week of use like the cheaper ones and the cactus brush only took a few days to break in and lasted and did its job for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The wooden handle keeps it steady in soapy hands.  </li>
            <li> I use it dry before a shower, it really exfoliates the skin.</li>
            <li> I found it a solid brush but not to heavy which was important as well.  </li>
            <li> It was much more firm than I expected.</li>
            <li> Might be harsh for some people, but I absolutely love it and cannot use any other type.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I&#x27;d highly recommend this product especially for anyone with such disabilities.</li>
            <li> but the head is about 1/3 the total length, which is really too short to be a back brush.  </li>
            <li> Just right for getting rid of all the dead skin.</li>
            <li> Brush is just right, not too harsh.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, this brush offers an invigorating scrub that will thoroughly remove dead skin cells, thanks to its cactus fiber bristles.</li>
            <li> The handle could be just a bit longer -- I feel like I really have to stretch to get the center of my back.</li>
            <li> I, personally, would want it no other way.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have some one to scrub your back, say due to a divorce, this tool really helps cleanse the body.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stiff enough to be effective for dry brushing and exfoliating without being too harsh.</li>
            <li> the shorter broad handle still has enough reach for me to get every bit of my back.</li>
            <li> this brush is super hard and it hurt my skin</li>
            <li> The bristles are also longer than typically find, but for legs, back, back of arms, and rump, this brush does the job very well.</li>
            <li> What I expected, no less.</li>
            <li> some reviewers have said, the handle is on the short side, but I have found it to be just long enough.  </li>
            <li> Brush is very sturdy and bristles are very firm.</li>
            <li> bristles were stiff when new, but they have either become softer with use or I have grown to like them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not a soft brush.</li>
            <li> Even though the handle was noted as being too short by other reviews, I decided to pull the trigger in hopes that the seller corrected the problem with the product.  </li>
            <li> Anyone with shoulder issues would do well to avoid this brush, but only due to the handle.</li>
            <li> You can dry brush your legs in an upward fashion from your foot to your thigh to help reduce cellulite.</li>
            <li> Started dry brushing my legs to help with circulation.  </li>
            <li> I had been hanging the brush on a hook to dry.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to do dry skin brushing.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, winter and summer</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, the handle on this brush is on the short side (minus one star).</li>
            <li> The bristles seem a little bit stiff at first taking it out of the package, but they soften with soap and water, giving a stimulating massage and removing dead skin flakes and other unwanted particle from your back.</li>
            <li> I now dry it flat on a towel with the bristles down.  </li>
            <li> Was amazed at the dry skin that came off!  </li>
            <li> Brush is lasting a long time but bristles are stiff and abrasive.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned in previous posts, the handle is not as long as shown in the photo (stretched photo).  </li>
            <li> I cannot imagine not using it every single day!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitating re the feedbacks left.</li>
            <li> I have never had any use for a removable, hand-held brush-head - other than to annoy me half to death.</li>
            <li> The handle is a bit short and that makes it hard to fully scrub my back, but I like the brisk feel of the bristles, even when wet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made in Germany out of solid wood and firm bristles.</li>
            <li> i use a brush head to toe in wet and this guy is a winner.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit rough feeling...</li>
            <li> However, the 2-star review is due to the misleading photo.  </li>
            <li> Little rough for chest and underarms though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a month of use, there is some black staining on the wood where the bristles attach.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was odd that she told me to not put any markings on the box, not even a \\&quot;To:\\&quot; address, but I figured that UPS would have a posted paid sticker with an address to put on it.  </li>
            <li> Typically brushes like this will need to be bleached every month or so, since they stay in the shower and will be prone to mildew.</li>
            <li> Why doesn&#x27;t someone make a brush like this with a slightly longer handle?</li>
            <li> I was looking for a stiffer brush than usual but this item was too stiff to be used on the body anywhere other than soles of feet.</li>
            <li> The return process was difficult enough that I just kept the 2 brushes that I ordered and am not really using them.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting the dead skin cells exfoliated.  </li>
            <li> I read reviews and was looking for a firm body brush and made this purchase.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s firm and the correct size</li>
            <li> ; it seems to get the dead skin off as I wanted.</li>
            <li> Being disabled to stand, the brush length adds to the ease of it&#x27;s use while seated in the shower.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday in the shower and one time when I didn&#x27;t use it after a week or so, I started to feel the dirt pill up on my skin as I cleaned my body.</li>
            <li> For the wimpy, this brush will be too stiff - and there is little to no chance of it softening with age.</li>
            <li> It is a sturdy, stiff bristled, bath brush.  </li>
            <li> Cactus fibers are quite stiff, stay in place, and provide an invigorating scrub.</li>
            <li> It is also a one-piece brush - a &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; to me, but, possibly, you like the head of your brush falling off randomly while showering.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a firm brush get this one!</li>
            <li> This is a STIFF brush!</li>
            <li> have alway been the 2 piece variety, which for me have never served any purpose and the few one pieces i have tried have been flimsy in the handle making the application of pressure on the back impossible.</li>
            <li> The people at the Body Shop were not willing to pay the return shipping until I told them that showing the wrong photo was equivalent to fraud.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the bristles are so scratchy that he couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> the cactus stands up, i was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Perhaps overtime the bristles would become softer, but using it during that breaking in period would be very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I tried it myself and it was painful.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this order, however.</li>
            <li> so it was awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. The handle is perfect length and the bristles give an exhilarating scrub.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitating re the feedbacks left. BUT,&lt;br /&gt;I really like that this brush on the picture is exactly what you get.Even in size and length, just perfect. It&#x27;s made in Germany out of solid wood and firm bristles.</li>
            <li> This is an great brush. It is not a soft brush. I like a good scrub so it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, the handle on this brush is on the short side (minus one star). On the plus side, this brush offers an invigorating scrub that will thoroughly remove dead skin cells, thanks to its cactus fiber bristles. Be warned though, some with more sensitive skin might find that this brush has TOO invigorating of a scrub. This brush also features a beautiful layered wooden handle and &amp;#34;Made in Germany&amp;#34; quality.</li>
            <li> I try a lot of bath products, and this is the best scrub tool I&#x27;ve found.  It gets rid of the rough patches (elbows &amp; knees), and it feels soooo good!  It feels soft when it&#x27;s dry, but when it&#x27;s wet, it has a nice scratch to it.  My skin feels clean and revitalized after I&#x27;ve used it.  I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I like this brush as it is soft bristled but still firm enough to be effective.  I found it a solid brush but not to heavy which was important as well.  Delivery was prompt and I would highly recommend this brush to everyone</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  This is my second in 5 years. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Well made and a perfect size!</li>
            <li> It is a sturdy, stiff bristled, bath brush.  It is nicer than the nylon bristle brushes.  It should last a little better.</li>
            <li> What I expected, no less.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It is a large brush, so it works great for all over body use (without taking too long). The bristles are strong but not &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34;. I add a moisturizing body wash to the brush while in the shower and it feels wonderful to have freshly scrubbed, clean feeling skin. I cannot imagine not using it every single day!</li>
            <li> These are by far the best shower brushes in the market and I have tried many! I highly recommend these brushes to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works well but after a month the bristles started falling out</li>
            <li> a gift and she love sit.. although it took a while to arrive</li>
            <li> I bought this after having one used on me at a spa in the Bahamas. You can dry brush your legs in an upward fashion from your foot to your thigh to help reduce cellulite. You can use it wet as the best scrub brush I have ever used!!! My skin is sensitive and has been extremely irritated this past winter and after one use, I was itch free and my skin absorbed moisturizer 100x better! I bought one for a friend and will buy another for myself when necessary!!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have some one to scrub your back, say due to a divorce, this tool really helps cleanse the body.  The bristles seem a little bit stiff at first taking it out of the package, but they soften with soap and water, giving a stimulating massage and removing dead skin flakes and other unwanted particle from your back.</li>
            <li> Just right for getting rid of all the dead skin. Cactus fibers are quite stiff, stay in place, and provide an invigorating scrub. Handle is somehow shorter that the picture shows.</li>
            <li> Started dry brushing my legs to help with circulation.  Was amazed at the dry skin that came off!  Brush is just right, not too harsh.</li>
            <li> Love love love it. The length is perfect for hard to reach spots on your back and the bristles are pretty stiff. At first it almost hurt but I got used to it fast. Is such a great exfoliator. My skin is so soft after I use it. Recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I really like the look and feel of this brush.  The bristles seem to be just about the right texture for me -- not too scratchy but not too floppy either!  The handle could be just a bit longer -- I feel like I really have to stretch to get the center of my back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great body brush from the BS. Item came in great condition just a few bristles squished. Add some body oil for super soft skin!</li>
            <li> Great every day exfoliater.</li>
            <li> Great product, was absolutely what I wanted and then some as far as a grooming tool for shower.  Highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> If you like a good stiff bristled brush, this product is for you. It is exactly what I have been looking for. Although, if you are looking for a soft brush, look elsewhere. I have been using it for a month and it seems to be good quality. I do not believe that I have lost one bristle yet.</li>
            <li> picture is very decieving,handle is way to short to reach all of your body. returned but had to call three times before my account was credited properly</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money and time you will spend renewong and polishing your skin.  Ater the shower you feel like a new person.</li>
            <li> This is the best scrub brush ever. I use it dry before a shower, it really exfoliates the skin. When I have a bath I put liquid soap and really scrub my skin. My husband always comments on my lovely soft skin. I keep one at both my residences. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Made in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some reviewers have said, the handle is on the short side, but I have found it to be just long enough.  Since it is a one piece brush, there is no chance that the head will go flying off in the shower as the made in China ones tend to do.  The handle is also thicker than the China ones.  This makes the handle feel better in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles were stiff when new, but they have either become softer with use or I have grown to like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of use, there is some black staining on the wood where the bristles attach.  I had been hanging the brush on a hook to dry.  I now dry it flat on a towel with the bristles down.  The brush seems to dry better this way.</li>
            <li> i have used this brush and i&#x27;m in love with it i feel like my skin is softer and i feel cleaner after using it</li>
            <li> I ordered this to be used as a back brush in the shower. I was looking for a stiffer brush than usual but this item was too stiff to be used on the body anywhere other than soles of feet. And while item is &amp;#34;one piece&amp;#34;, it is layers of wood put together, which started to separate within a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Takes a while for it to &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; and soften... but scrubs me so very well.  My favorite scrub brush.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best body brush I&#x27;ve found to date. The brush stays firm and crisp even under very hot water, and seems to have no sign of molding, as many before it have. For the wimpy, this brush will be too stiff - and there is little to no chance of it softening with age. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! This is a STIFF brush! I, personally, would want it no other way. You may. And, if so, this is NOT your brush! As a back-scratcher/dry brush, it hits the spot! It is also a one-piece brush - a &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; to me, but, possibly, you like the head of your brush falling off randomly while showering. I have never had any use for a removable, hand-held brush-head - other than to annoy me half to death. There is but one true &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; - and that is that the handle should have been a couple of inches longer - other than that, perfection with bristles! I purchased a half-dozen of these directly from the Body Shop for $7.50 each. It may have been a special, but a lucky one for me!</li>
            <li> Finally getting a great scrub, if you want a soft brush this one is not for you.</li>
            <li> I started with a &amp;#34;Buff -puff&amp;#34; when I was a teenager , then  the loofa , then kept moving on to firmer abrasives which seemed to prevent regrowth of skin tags and bumps and acne .I use this brush all over my body . It  has the firmest bristles Iv&#x27;e ever used .</li>
            <li> A very sturdy brush, seems to do the job.  The size is also perfect for reaching the back easily enough.</li>
            <li> I lost my first one of these (I think airport personnel stole it!)  I use it as a dry brush when my back itches (PERFECT back scratcher) as well as for washing my back in the shower.  It&#x27;s PERFECT.  Not too rough, but not so soft I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting the dead skin cells exfoliated.  I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li> Too cool.&lt;br /&gt;If you do not immerse in warm water for 5 minutes,&lt;br /&gt;With the skin it seems to peel off.&lt;br /&gt;Out of reach do it also cool parts of the body.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a very firm body brush with a shorter handle and works perfectly.  Don&#x27;t like banging into things like I do when showering with those longer handle brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to do dry skin brushing. Unfortunately, the bristles are so scratchy that he couldn&#x27;t use it. I tried it myself and it was painful. Perhaps overtime the bristles would become softer, but using it during that breaking in period would be very uncomfortable. We have not been using it. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It feels wonderful. I first heard of cactus bristle brushes at a spa and they said to brush toward your heart and it improves circulation as much as a 30 minute workout would. I don&#x27;t know if that is true, but it makes my skin feel really nice.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush because I had purchased one at an actual Body Shop store several years ago and liked it a lot.  The nice thing about the brush was that it was one piece so the head didn&#x27;t come off after a week of use like the cheaper ones and the cactus brush only took a few days to break in and lasted and did its job for a long time.  I was very disappointed with this order, however. The photo shows the one that I purchased previously, which is a longer brush that is suitable as a back brush.  In the photo the head is about 1/5 the total length.  What you get when you order is the same size brush head as in the photo but the head is about 1/3 the total length, which is really too short to be a back brush.  The return process was difficult enough that I just kept the 2 brushes that I ordered and am not really using them.  The people at the Body Shop were not willing to pay the return shipping until I told them that showing the wrong photo was equivalent to fraud.  The woman on the phone told me to place my box on the front porch and she would assign a UPS pickup.  I thought it was odd that she told me to not put any markings on the box, not even a \\&quot;To:\\&quot; address, but I figured that UPS would have a posted paid sticker with an address to put on it.  I also figured that the customer service person knew what she was talking about.  Of course, UPS said that they needed a sticker with an address.  After my first experience with customer service, I did not call back.  Do yourself a favor - do not order this product online.</li>
            <li> Brush is very sturdy and bristles are very firm. So initially they are pretty scratchy. With time you do get used to it some, but if you prefer a softer brush this is not for you. The bristles are also longer than typically find, but for legs, back, back of arms, and rump, this brush does the job very well. Little rough for chest and underarms though. Typically brushes like this will need to be bleached every month or so, since they stay in the shower and will be prone to mildew. Only had this one 2 weeks so far; wondering if the bristles may soften up some, but I&#x27;d rather have it a little more rough than too soft and delivery to my door in 2 days is very nice! :)</li>
            <li> Great brush.  Good for skin.  Thank you for the smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> I wish i would have bought this sooner!</li>
            <li> well worth the price. well constructed and stiff bristles that work very good for a nice scrub a dub dub</li>
            <li> Love everything about it,  except that the handle is not quite long enough.  Nice stiff bristles.  Why doesn&#x27;t someone make a brush like this with a slightly longer handle?</li>
            <li> Might be harsh for some people, but I absolutely love it and cannot use any other type. Grab it if you like a good scrub.</li>
            <li> I love the cactus brush.  I&#x27;ve been using them for years.  I like it so much that I bought a few of them, just in case they go out of production.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not for people with very sensitive skin, but most will find it invigorating.  It really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> best brush ever. by far. the cactus stands up, i was skeptical. but am glad that this brush has been keeping up with daily usage in the shower. i use a brush head to toe in wet and this guy is a winner. 20+ year i have used brushes and the have alway been the 2 piece variety, which for me have never served any purpose and the few one pieces i have tried have been flimsy in the handle making the application of pressure on the back impossible. this broad headed one piece really stands up. the shorter broad handle still has enough reach for me to get every bit of my back. the cactus is good and stiff (i could use it a little stiffer but that would be because i enjoy a very stiff brush) it has not lost shape or form and is great. i will buy this again and again, i am very glad to have found it.</li>
            <li> this brush works wonders on your body in the shower in replacement of your bath towel, I am on my second one they last about a year. Hot shower and brush scrub is almost like going to the spa</li>
            <li> This brush is a must for everyone on Earth :)&lt;br /&gt;The bristle are really firm and really get the blood going. I use it on my abs to get them going.&lt;br /&gt; Exfoliates like a dream.</li>
            <li> I read reviews and was looking for a firm body brush and made this purchase. I have dry skin, winter and summer and I use this as an exfoliator and to over all body brush. And this is great as a back scratcher! Some may find the handle a bit short, but I am a bit short (5ft) so I have no problems. If you are looking for a firm brush get this one! I use it on dry skin most the time as this is what i prefer.</li>
            <li> Adore this brush! It&#x27;s stiff enough to be effective for dry brushing and exfoliating without being too harsh. The handle is nice and long for reaching your legs and back. If you use this before a shower a couple of times a week and follow with moisturizer you will see a real difference in your skin. I use dial antibacterial soap to clean the brush and make sure I shake it and hang it to dry.</li>
            <li> Brush is lasting a long time but bristles are stiff and abrasive.  Good brush compared to others I have bought</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit rough feeling...but i think that&#x27;s the way they are suppose to feel??  i know my skin feels awesome after i dry brush with this and then hit the shower.  it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  It&#x27;s easy to hold and use, durable too.  The wooden handle keeps it steady in soapy hands.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Product bristles are nice, thick, and seem to be well constructed.  However, the 2-star review is due to the misleading photo.  As mentioned in previous posts, the handle is not as long as shown in the photo (stretched photo).  The handle is only 3 time as long as the head - too short for comfortable use.  Even though the handle was noted as being too short by other reviews, I decided to pull the trigger in hopes that the seller corrected the problem with the product.  As of November 2012, no change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller needs to correct the photo!!!</li>
            <li> this brush is super hard and it hurt my skin, i have super sensitive skin so it was awful. it does not feel like a body scrubber at allll</li>
            <li> the only brush i like, it&#x27;s firm and the correct size</li>
            <li> Nice brush with soft but effective bristles.  The handle is long so you can get most of your back!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing body brush, It does the job very well. I think I&#x27;ll order another for future use.</li>
            <li> Firm bristles, which I love.</li>
            <li> It Works like it&#x27;s supposed to...</li>
            <li> I was looking for a &#x27;rougher&#x27; body brush than most on the market. I really enjoy a good scrub but if you have sensitive skin this brush might be a bit rough for you.</li>
            <li> Since I am a smaller person, I can reach my back areas well with this brush.  I like the &#x27;feel&#x27; of it; it seems to get the dead skin off as I wanted.</li>
            <li> Personally, I found no problems with this (bath),Cactus Body Brush AT ALL! Having severe knee and upper arm/shoulder joint problems, this cactus brush fit the bill perfectly, because the bristles are stiff enough to refrain me from using undue scrubbing pressure. Being disabled to stand, the brush length adds to the ease of it&#x27;s use while seated in the shower. The brush itself is a nice size to pour your favorite/fragranced liquid soap on for a nice sudsy scrub. Therefore, I&#x27;d highly recommend this product especially for anyone with such disabilities.</li>
            <li> The handle is a bit short and that makes it hard to fully scrub my back, but I like the brisk feel of the bristles, even when wet. If you want a really gentle brush, this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li> I love this body brush! It was much more firm than I expected. I felt like it was scratching my skin at first but now that I&#x27;ve adjusted to it, I can&#x27;t be without it. I like to use this to help wake up my skin and to help with exfoliating. It also feels really good on my back :) I use this everyday in the shower and one time when I didn&#x27;t use it after a week or so, I started to feel the dirt pill up on my skin as I cleaned my body. This is a must-have for smooth, exfoliated skin, especially since I need it to get to my back.</li>
            <li> If the handle were another 3 inches longer, the brush would be perfect. Anyone with shoulder issues would do well to avoid this brush, but only due to the handle. Every other aspect is great.</li>
            <li> my husband really loves this brush. he said it sure can scrub his back good.so he told me buy two.</li>
            <li> great, very good, I love it</li>
