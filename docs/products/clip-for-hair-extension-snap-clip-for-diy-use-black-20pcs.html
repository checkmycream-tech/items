            <li>Otherwise they are just great, strong and very sturdy and undetectable.</li>
            <li>It allows you to create your own extensions and are super durable and comfortable!</li>
            <li>BIG SMILE!!!!!</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t come off easily.</li>
            <li>The clips are strong and have a silicone strip on the clasp to help the clip stay in place and also protecting your hair.  </li>
            <li>But the clips work just fine,</li>
            <li>However they work fine for my use.  </li>
            <li>they are fine.</li>
            <li>These work perfect, they take a little while to come though</li>
            <li>but if you tease your hair a little bit they work perfect</li>
            <li>But overall the clips are great.</li>
            <li>I am taking apart some cheap hairpieces I got, and plan to sew the hair strips on to these clips.  </li>
            <li>Light weight clips which do not damage hair.</li>
            <li>If you sew the clips on correctly and securely the number of holes will not hinder you.</li>
            <li>She was overly excited and just loves it.</li>
            <li>they hold good and are light enough to be comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love them they was much cheaper than the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>Despite that the clips were good quality and there was enough for the pack of hair that I used.</li>
            <li>I RECEIVED THEM RATHER QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>Love the functionality of these :) Strong, durability well expected.</li>
            <li>The clips are very sturdy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The clips work well and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It worth it.</li>
            <li>The clips were smaller than I would have liked them to be</li>
            <li>You can&#x60;t get this price in America ,The clips are worth it!They do their job.</li>
            <li>And they quickly loss shape fast!</li>
            <li>They are just the right size to sew on some tracks an clip them in and off.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t slip out or show and they also remain in your hair for days without tangling or breaking your natural hair and they clip right out with easy......  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>they would be better if the holes were in the proper area.</li>
            <li>Pretty neat.</li>
            <li>exactly what i was expecting.</li>
            <li>My mom made me a few hair extensions with this clips they came out good.</li>
            <li>The clip teeth tips are coated so they are comfortable and the clips lay super flat on the head.</li>
            <li>Great item and half the price of my local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>I just used a regular sized sewing needle, and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy clips.</li>
            <li>ALLOWS FOR A MUCH EVEN AND TIGHTER GRIP  </li>
            <li>The only problem I had with the clip ins is the fact that I couldn&#x27;t find a needle to fit the holes.</li>
            <li>I sew them to the inside of my wig and clip them to my real hair.</li>
            <li>They snap to my hair very well.</li>
            <li>Very affordable</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE VERY INEXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li>I like the clips they really gripped on to my hair</li>
            <li>so i had to find a smaller needle to fit it .</li>
            <li>They also hold really well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>other than that they are very sturdy and durable and I love them.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to create clip in extensions.</li>
            <li>if your making your own clipin extensions dont waste your time on these!</li>
            <li>Then I realized that the clips only had two holes at the top for the thread to go through instead of four like regular clip Ins.</li>
            <li>I thought these clips would be big enough to hold more hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking to add length and body to their hair by using extensions.</li>
            <li>so I just mix these in with the expensive ones and it works out great.</li>
            <li>When I buy this was a little afraid I won&#x27;t get what I saw, but they are amazing, they work just fine and easy to click on...</li>
            <li>exactly what i wanted just took alot linger than i epected overall</li>
            <li>Took a VERY long time to get to the states, but they are useful for what they are....</li>
            <li>Even though I knew they were coming from overseas, I was still surprised at the 36 days it took to receive them.  </li>
            <li>At sallies the cost a lot more for only a few in a pack.</li>
            <li>Therefore the wig is not tight to my head and will not blow off in the wind.</li>
            <li>The only problem is sewing the hair to the clips as the holes at the top are too small for the needle.</li>
            <li>they are exactly what i expected and recieved.</li>
            <li>My clips tend to come loose a little easily, they fall but are still clipped to my head.</li>
            <li>I chose to order these because the clips shown within the picture are the kinds of clips I like and when I opened my package, I received a totally different type of clip and it was in brown, not black.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had with this product was that the holes are a too small for a regular weaving needle to fit through, however I just sewed around the perimeter of the clip and that worked well.</li>
            <li>These clips works wondrous with my weaves, the only problem is the holes at the top are a little small for the sewing needles</li>

            <li> I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking to add length and body to their hair by using extensions.</li>
            <li> so I just mix these in with the expensive ones and it works out great.</li>
            <li> When I buy this was a little afraid I won&#x27;t get what I saw, but they are amazing, they work just fine and easy to click on...</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted just took alot linger than i epected overall</li>
            <li> Took a VERY long time to get to the states, but they are useful for what they are....</li>
            <li> Even though I knew they were coming from overseas, I was still surprised at the 36 days it took to receive them.  </li>
            <li> At sallies the cost a lot more for only a few in a pack.</li>
            <li> Therefore the wig is not tight to my head and will not blow off in the wind.</li>
            <li> The only problem is sewing the hair to the clips as the holes at the top are too small for the needle.</li>
            <li> they are exactly what i expected and recieved.</li>
            <li> My clips tend to come loose a little easily, they fall but are still clipped to my head.</li>
            <li> I chose to order these because the clips shown within the picture are the kinds of clips I like and when I opened my package, I received a totally different type of clip and it was in brown, not black.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with this product was that the holes are a too small for a regular weaving needle to fit through, however I just sewed around the perimeter of the clip and that worked well.</li>
            <li> These clips works wondrous with my weaves, the only problem is the holes at the top are a little small for the sewing needles</li>
            <li> The shipping is a bit slow, but it is worth the wait.</li>
            <li> People never know I am wearing clips ins because these lay so flat.</li>
            <li> It is quite small which makes it kinda hard to clip to fine hair.</li>
            <li> and it took to long to come from when I order it</li>
            <li> Since they don&#x27;t show, I don&#x27;t mind they they are a shiny black, but that could be a problem for hair extensions for someone with light thin hair.  </li>
            <li> smaller than I expected, not much I can do with these.</li>
            <li> My lady has been into her hair alot lately and trying new things.</li>
            <li> It was a little smaller than I thought</li>
            <li> so so.. takes forever to soe into some fake hair, and hard to put in... rips out more heir taking it out</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about it slipping or coming off</li>
            <li> Work extremely well for clip-in extensions.</li>
            <li> One side has one hole and the other side has 2.</li>
            <li> Other than that they were workable.</li>
            <li> so when I get tired of one hair style I clip them out and clip new hair in</li>
            <li> so I bought these little clips to sew them on the bottom center of the wig.  </li>
            <li> not worth the price.</li>
            <li> They were what I expected!!  </li>
            <li> , they slip out a little bit in my hair,</li>
            <li> and they slip a little bit</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just ridiculously too long.</li>
            <li> A couple of the clips (out of the 40 that I bought) were imperfect: some paint missing or bent teeth.  </li>
            <li> Also one broke after a few weeks of uses.</li>
            <li> I use them when I want to add a few tracks in my head to make my hair fuller.</li>
            <li> a messy bun look</li>
            <li> although the holes were a little small</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had some others in the past that were just too heavy.</li>
            <li> I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THERE ARE NO HOLES ON THE TOP OF THE CLIPS.</li>
            <li> It always does at least a little bit</li>
            <li> but in my opinion that is small stuff</li>
            <li> i do not like the size of the clips they are to small .</li>
            <li> when i view them over the internet it looked alright size, but after receiving them is to small no.</li>
            <li> They are exclusively for small amounts of hair like for a weave.</li>
            <li> gave it 4 stars because the holes are too small for the curved sewing needle</li>
            <li> small though</li>
            <li> The non slip grip allows for a very firm hold.</li>
            <li> They are very stiff</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a needle to go through the hole</li>
            <li> but it is very slick</li>
            <li> Some of my clips came broken which was fustrating</li>
            <li> since I have heard it none has been broken even when sewing in the hair in it.</li>
            <li> And when I did receive it some of the clips were broken...</li>
            <li> I receive was the wrong color  </li>
            <li> I bought these because the extension clips at Sallys are really expensive</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use, clips are so hard to close!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the extension clips I received.</li>

            <li> When I buy this was a little afraid I won&#x27;t get what I saw, but they are amazing, they work just fine and easy to click on...</li>
            <li> A couple of the clips (out of the 40 that I bought) were imperfect: some paint missing or bent teeth.  They still work.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Works well and does not snag on your hair. Recommended it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I got this to sow in the Extensions</li>
            <li> I like these clips. I purchased them to make my own hair extensions.The clip is great.The only problem I had with this product was that the holes are a too small for a regular weaving needle to fit through, however I just sewed around the perimeter of the clip and that worked well.But overall the clips are great.</li>
            <li> Some of my clips came broken which was fustrating</li>
            <li> Very sturdy clips. Work extremely well for clip-in extensions. A lot more affordable than the ones from the Beauty supply store in my country!</li>
            <li> It was a little smaller than I thought and it took to long to come from when I order it that&#x27;s is why I rated it that way the product itself is  ok</li>
            <li> My clips tend to come loose a little easily, they fall but are still clipped to my head. Also one broke after a few weeks of uses.</li>
            <li> Great. Serves its purpose</li>
            <li> Oh yeah! These work awesome!</li>
            <li> Loved the hair clips, they are very good for making at home clips and they hold in place very well.</li>
            <li> I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THERE ARE NO HOLES ON THE TOP OF THE CLIPS. HOLES ON THE TOP ALLOWS FOR A MUCH EVEN AND TIGHTER GRIP  WHEN ATTACHED TO THE HEAD.</li>
            <li> They took FOREVER to come but when they finally did I used them immediately. Perfect size for my clip ins</li>
            <li> I bought these clips to make my own clip ins and for the most part they clip. The only problem I had with the clip ins is the fact that I couldn&#x27;t find a needle to fit the holes. I eventually went to Sally&#x27;s beauty supply store and bought the sewing needle they had in stock next to their thread. Then I realized that the clips only had two holes at the top for the thread to go through instead of four like regular clip Ins. I also ran out of clips but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve made more clip ins then needed . other than that they are very sturdy and durable and I love them.</li>
            <li> I bought these clips for my extentions! The clips sow in nice and easy... but when I decided to wear them they moved around, I had to clip my hair up so no one would realize I was wearing extentions. I will be buying thinner clips next time.</li>
            <li> smaller than I expected, not much I can do with these. if your making your own clipin extensions dont waste your time on these!</li>
            <li> just keep in mind they take a whileee to be delivered since it&#x27;s international, and they are on the smaller side, which i personally prefer but some people may like bigger clips.</li>
            <li> These clips are exactly what I needed: right size and excellent quality! I sew them to the inside of my wig and clip them to my real hair. Therefore the wig is not tight to my head and will not blow off in the wind.</li>
            <li> Although it took forever for it to arrive...that&#x27;s why I gave it a four star... But the clips work just fine, since I have heard it none has been broken even when sewing in the hair in it.</li>
            <li> I used them on my extensions they are the perfect size, easy to snap  and unsnap will order again soon</li>
            <li> The clips work well and worth every penny. I will definitely buy again. The shipping is a bit slow, but it is worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and right price. It worth it. It clips well. Good for my 18 inch weave on. Still holding great</li>
            <li> I love these clips. I use them when I want to add a few tracks in my head to make my hair fuller. They are just the right size to sew on some tracks an clip them in and off. You know when they are clipped in because you would her a snap.</li>
            <li> I use to get sewing but now I get clipons they are perfect I ordered a lot of them so when I get tired of one hair style I clip them out and clip new hair in</li>
            <li> These clips are really good. The best ones I&#x27;ve ever bought. They snap to my hair very well. The only problem is sewing the hair to the clips as the holes at the top are too small for the needle. but in my opinion that is small stuff and you are able to get around it. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Took a VERY long time to get to the states, but they are useful for what they are....</li>
            <li> What can I say?  The clips are strong and have a silicone strip on the clasp to help the clip stay in place and also protecting your hair.  They do the job, and well.</li>
            <li> Clips came in a zip locker bag and some of them were damages.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a needle to go through the hole but I will be purchasing this again a couple dollars for 20 wigs clips! yup cant beat it.</li>
            <li> Good price for a bunch.  I am taking apart some cheap hairpieces I got, and plan to sew the hair strips on to these clips.  Will work great.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I&#x27;m able to change my hairstyle and DO IT MYSELF! This has enabled me to give my hair a rest for all of the chemical and heat abuse!  Very affordable and I received it quicker than estimated.</li>
            <li> they are exactly what i expected and recieved. Wish they had better packages for a good rate i would order more.</li>
            <li> You get a good deal because the ones in the beauty store are a ripp off</li>
            <li> can  get cheaper off aliexpress</li>
            <li> Light weight clips which do not damage hair. They arrived as promised and they are very easy to use too. Loved the price and would buy again from them.</li>
            <li> this item is good, but my question is, can you make it from the material plastic.  because i use 80 or 100 in my hair. and when i travel with the plain,&lt;br /&gt;the immigration machine beep alarm. its gives me the feeling like they catch me with kilos iron (gun). and the security&lt;br /&gt;stay on me looking for the amount of iron (they think gun terrorist) . they let me take off all my jewelry. its embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;please feedback at me: Ruthmila M Short. ruthmila.thspsxm@gmail.com</li>
            <li> Not a fan...they don&#x27;t help hold anything</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Description was accurate, best price any where. I can&#x27;t wait to get started, making my own clip in hair piece&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I love these clips it seems like these are better then the one i got at sallys they don&#x27;t slide out</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> Took a while to arrive but, were on time. You need time and patience in sewing the clips in.  Buy more than one pack according to the amount of hair. I&#x27;m going to order more.</li>
            <li> This product took more than a month to get to me.  And when I did receive it some of the clips were broken...not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I got what I was expecting,  but have not used them yet.</li>
            <li> I receive was the wrong color  i was dissatisfied</li>
            <li> They were a bit smaller than the ones I have seen in retail shops, but they work the way they are supposed to and they are not flimsy.</li>
            <li> they would be better if the holes were in the proper area. One side has one hole and the other side has 2. Other than that they were workable. I may not buy again from the company though.</li>
            <li> Great product bought so I could make my own hair extensions. Didn&#x27;t have any problem receiving my shipment. Clips were the perfect size I needed to make a strip with three clips on each extension. Made the extensions and my friends asked me to make them some also.</li>
            <li> Prácticos, ligeros, buen tamaño y suficiente cantidad para usar en el futuro, estoy feliz con el producto. Envió rápido, lo recomiendo</li>
            <li> These clips were just what I needed. I attached the  extensions to the clips and created great clip in extensions for my hair. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to create clip in extensions.</li>
            <li> I have medium thickness hair but it is very slick, they slip out a little bit in my hair, sometime it seems like I&#x27;m readjusting all day but then I bout some from Sally&#x27;s that were more expensive and they don&#x27;t slip from my hair so I just mix these in with the expensive ones and it works out great.</li>
            <li> Pretty neat. It is quite small which makes it kinda hard to clip to fine hair. But it works. I received it whitin days</li>
            <li> Took about three weeks to receive but very good product.</li>
            <li> The clips came way before the delivery date and they were packaged properly. These clips works wondrous with my weaves, the only problem is the holes at the top are a little small for the sewing needles but I improvised with a thicker sewing needle. Otherwise they are just great, strong and very sturdy and undetectable. Great service and great product!!</li>
            <li> When I travel, I like to bring a wig with me just in case they don&#x27;t have a plug in the bathroom at the hotel for my curling iron (happened on my recent trip to Switzerland).  But I find that I worry about the wig riding up in the back.  It always does at least a little bit and I don&#x27;t want to tug on it in public, so I bought these little clips to sew them on the bottom center of the wig.  I can clip the bottom of the wig onto my own hair and the wig doesn&#x27;t ride up.  Since they don&#x27;t show, I don&#x27;t mind they they are a shiny black, but that could be a problem for hair extensions for someone with light thin hair.  However they work fine for my use.  Even though I knew they were coming from overseas, I was still surprised at the 36 days it took to receive them.  That&#x27;s just ridiculously too long.</li>
            <li> just what i needed to make clip on extensions and also at a great price, will buy again!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying use these clips for my wigs I make.  Thanks. Looking forward to buying from you soon.</li>
            <li> Love them they was much cheaper than the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> I USE THESE CLIPS A LOT WHEN I PUT ON MY DIFFERENT HAIR PIECES. I WISHED I WOULD HAVE ORDERED 3 ORDERS INSTEAD OF ONE. THEY ARE VERY INEXPENSIVE. AND ALTHOUGH THEY CAME FROM CHINA I RECEIVED THEM RATHER QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> These work perfect, they take a little while to come though and they slip a little bit but if you tease your hair a little bit they work perfect</li>
            <li> The clips were smaller than I would have liked them to be and there were only 2 side holes not one in the middle. Despite that the clips were good quality and there was enough for the pack of hair that I used. If you sew the clips on correctly and securely the number of holes will not hinder you.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who is making hairextensions! it worker for me and the clips are sturdy.. Good product..</li>
            <li> I like the clips they really gripped on to my hair but when they where sewed on to the hair weft they kept flipping around but could be the hair weft it self. They are very stiff so it takes longer to clip in to my hair and I clip</li>
            <li> exactly what i was expecting. although the holes were a little small so i had to find a smaller needle to fit it .</li>
            <li> i do not like the size of the clips they are to small . when i view them over the internet it looked alright size, but after receiving them is to small no.</li>
            <li> They were what I expected!!  Just the wait to get them I was better off just going to the store and buying them!!</li>
            <li> These are a great way to save money. It allows you to create your own extensions and are super durable and comfortable!</li>
            <li> These clip for extensions are great they stay put on the hair doesn&#x27;t come off easily. My mom made me a few hair extensions with this clips they came out good. I don&#x27;t have to worry about it slipping or coming off and I feel comforter with them on.</li>
            <li> These stay in your hair all day and I never have to worry about them falling out. Love them, they&#x27;re awesome!</li>
            <li> they hold good and are light enough to be comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had some others in the past that were just too heavy.</li>
            <li> These clips are easy, convenient and best of all they don&#x27;t damage your natural hair. I absolutely love them. I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking to add length and body to their hair by using extensions. They don&#x27;t slip out or show and they also remain in your hair for days without tangling or breaking your natural hair and they clip right out with easy......  This is a ten star product. The shipping service was also timely and reliable. All rounded customer satisfaction. BIG SMILE!!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought these clips would be big enough to hold more hair. They are exclusively for small amounts of hair like for a weave.</li>
            <li> Great Value! I bought these because the extension clips at Sallys are really expensive and I needed A LOT of clips. I just used a regular sized sewing needle, and it worked fine. No issues here, works perfect for my clip ins :)</li>
            <li> These clips are perfect for wigs or falls.</li>
            <li> so so.. takes forever to soe into some fake hair, and hard to put in... rips out more heir taking it out</li>
            <li> The best deal. Got it in about 5 days. I would not have gotten that deal at the hair store.</li>
            <li> They were just what I wanted. At sallies the cost a lot more for only a few in a pack. Great buy!</li>
            <li> My lady has been into her hair alot lately and trying new things. She told me about  the product so i got it for her. She was overly excited and just loves it. She&#x27;s been using them as soon as i gave it to her. Woman, lol... Over all I  recommend this product for anyone who is on that Hair Extention status...</li>
            <li> Love the functionality of these :) Strong, durability well expected. Perfect size for sewing onto weft hair. The clip teeth tips are coated so they are comfortable and the clips lay super flat on the head. The non slip grip allows for a very firm hold.</li>
            <li> Great item and half the price of my local beauty supply store. This was a great deal and I am satisfied</li>
            <li> the product is great however took 4 weeks to receive the order exactly what i wanted just took alot linger than i epected overall</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t clip well to my hair</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the extension clips I received. I chose to order these because the clips shown within the picture are the kinds of clips I like and when I opened my package, I received a totally different type of clip and it was in brown, not black. I had waited almost a month for the package to come only to receive something I did not want.</li>
            <li> Came in a week before delivery date. The clips are a perfect size and i definitely would reccomend you to buy this.</li>
            <li> I have gotten some really great use from these. People never know I am wearing clips ins because these lay so flat. They also hold really well.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because the holes are too small for the curved sewing needle so I had to purchase another needle to sew the track to the hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need clips, these are great. I had some left over after doing enough tracks to cover 3/4 of my head.</li>
            <li> they are fine. small though</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use, clips are so hard to close! And they quickly loss shape fast!</li>
            <li> The order came within 10 days of buying the product, delivers to P.O. boxes, I made me own clip in extensions and it worked well for me sense i only wanted extensions to do a messy bun look</li>
            <li> I never want to lose this number! You can&#x60;t get this price in America ,The clips are worth it!They do their job.</li>
            <li> I love the clips for hair extension.  It saved me money by making my own clip on hair extension. I would recommend them to my friends.</li>
            <li> The clips are very sturdy and easy to use. I have just decided to add extensions to my hair and enjoying putting the pieces together.</li>
