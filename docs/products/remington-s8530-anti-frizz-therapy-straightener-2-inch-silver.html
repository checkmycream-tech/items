            <li>size all factored in with helping a novice like me transform my frizzy semi curly hair into beautiful strands!  </li>

            <li>Does a great job straightening hair.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of straightening her hair.</li>
            <li>(I tend to drop stuff) and the cord is a great length.</li>
            <li>The auto shut off is always a welcome feature as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so the automatic shut off is a great safety feature.</li>
            <li>I just sent my daughter off to college with my straitening iron (HerStyler) which I thought was great.</li>
            <li>makes this great for just about all.</li>
            <li>and I am happy that I was.</li>
            <li>The Remington Anti Frizz Therapy Straightener is great.  </li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>In love with it one of the best straighteners I have ever bought</li>
            <li>very easy!</li>
            <li>I felt that it did a good job straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li>the good.</li>
            <li>I did find the Remington straightener to be a good surprise.  </li>
            <li>It was a great iron, and this is BETTER than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has so many great features- lock buttons, increase/decrease temperature buttons, turbo feature, 1 hour auto shut off and 4 year warranty.</li>
            <li>After doing my research and reading reviews I decided to buy this Remington (the latest HerStyler didn&#x27;t get great reviews).</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It is very smooth, my hair looks sleek and gorgeous after one run over.</li>
            <li>I used it immediately to see if I liked it</li>
            <li>There is a nice LCD indicator and a heat guide to what type of hair you have.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on Good Housekeeping recommending it, and I am pleased that I didn&#x27;t buy a Chi.</li>
            <li>Partially my own fault, but</li>
            <li>At this lowest setting, she burned herself on the iron itself, and noticed that she even burned herself on her own hair.  </li>
            <li>and I had to try to do it on my own and</li>
            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel as though I was able to get as good a grip on the straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This heats up fast, evenly, and leaves hair wonderfully sleek.</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve been very happy with it!</li>
            <li>Great price, good built quality, easy to use and fast heat.</li>
            <li>VERY SMOOTH when going over my hair.</li>
            <li>A very important feature is also for a straightener to have ceramic plates, as I feel this protects the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a huge plus!</li>
            <li>Absolutely in love with this straightener.</li>
            <li>but my ends were more frizzy than ever.</li>
            <li>But most telling was my hair.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m able to store it sooner.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter - the latest in years of straighteners.</li>
            <li>And my hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li>That is a lot of time in the mornings!  :-)</li>
            <li>I love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>This product is ok.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>is sometimes while I&#x27;m holding it and styling, the location of the buttons makes it so that I accidentally turn up the heat more than I tend to.</li>
            <li>but otherwise, I just love how this straightener works.</li>
            <li>If you run into this problem be sure to lock the settings to avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Looks great!&amp;#34;  :)</li>
            <li>This did a fantastic job!</li>
            <li>My hair frizzes out at the hint of rain - this straightener keeps it nice and smooth without me having to worry about it growing into 80&#x27;s hair by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Love how you do not have to wait for it to heat up as well.</li>
            <li>I love this device and will be using it even more once my daughter moves out</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>This is the best straightner outside of the high-end line I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I asked her for her opinion and she said that if it was the right style she would have loved it.</li>
            <li>Makes my curly frizzy hair straight!!!!</li>
            <li>very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a cheap hair straightener for many years...</li>
            <li>The Remington S8530 is a very good flat iron.</li>
            <li>easy to use too.</li>
            <li>Plus my hair would tangle easily.</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
            <li>The locking function makes it easy to store.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Heated up very, very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quality hair straightener, with cool features and many benefits.</li>
            <li>It has an automatic shut-off, which is probably true of most straighteners today.</li>
            <li>Quick to heat, efficient and controls frizz!</li>
            <li>I have used this once and was hugely impressed!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was everything I wanted and such a great price.  </li>
            <li>I really liked how this works and heats up fast</li>
            <li>I really wish I liked it because it was affordable.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light weight</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Glides smoothly.</li>
            <li>It heats very quickly &amp; the temperature enables quick and easy starightening as desired (and I still didn&#x27;t set it at the highest temperature).</li>
            <li>It heats very quickly and just as important, it also cools quickly</li>
            <li>The iron heats up super quick as do most of them these days.</li>
            <li>The auto shut-off is a great feature that all flat irons and curling irons should have.</li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron.</li>
            <li>Great product with quick results that last!</li>
            <li>Such an amazing product !</li>
            <li>does the job and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Love it so much!</li>
            <li>So when I saw the price tag on this I truly felt it needed to be spectacular to live up to the $75 sale</li>
            <li>Maybe the most appealing feature about this Frizz Therapy Straightener is the speed with which it smooths and straightens wild kinky hair.</li>
            <li>Her hair feels silky smooth and her straight hair doesn&#x27;t frizz, even during fairly humid days here in NEw England.  </li>
            <li>I did a little research into what product would be the best investment, setting a much higher budget...</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find this particular Remington straightener at the top of the list (and near the bottom of the price points!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product that is now my new favorite flat iron.</li>
            <li>with this tool I FINALLY achieved beautiful straight hair all on my own!&lt;br /&gt;The anti-frizz ceramic plates infused with micro-conditioners along with the 450-degree temperature heat and the 2 in.</li>
            <li>I really believe I could do better than $77.</li>
            <li>My hair stays straight and frizz free all day!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this product has some good features, it really isn&#x27;t enough to replace my HAI.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I used it at the highest setting, but the setting I used kept my hair straight for more than two days with no frizzing and</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener heats up very fast and you has an easily adjustable temperature.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said that, she has been happy with the results, but has not noticed any &amp;#34;anti-frizz&amp;#34; improvements over her other iron (maybe there is a difference if she kicks it up to 450 degrees?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tend to straighten my hair only once every couple weeks - at most, once a week - but the health and feel of my hair indicates I&#x27;d be safe if I wanted to up the frequency.</li>
            <li>I was delighted within a few strokes I love the straightener</li>
            <li>My wife says that the Remington S8530 straightener has a quick heat up time.  </li>
            <li>There are various temperature settings and all agree that this is a solid product that does an excellent job at giving the desired results.</li>
            <li>It heats up extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick Heat:</li>
            <li>Having only had it for a couple of months I can tell I will be using it off and on for many more years without needing to replace it.</li>
            <li>Having only had it for a couple of months I can tell I will be using it off and on for many more years without needing to replace it.</li>
            <li>Heats up QUICK and helps with frizz.</li>
            <li>plus I go too quickly.</li>
            <li>The very first time I used it, I wondered why on earth</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a month of testing this has really turned out to be a great flat iron.</li>
            <li>This is such an awesome flat iron!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and fast results.</li>
            <li>The handle, though close to the paddles, never felt hot!</li>
            <li>This straightener gets HOT!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>It will automatically switch off after a certain period of non-use (I think an hour?), which was a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Love it gets my hair straight fast.</li>
            <li>far 300 degrees is all that has been needed to give me a nice straight look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used plenty of straightners at friends&#x27; houses over the years and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It has a nice digital display, the controls are out of the way and it has a swivel cord.  </li>
            <li>and I am left on my own to style my unruly hair.</li>
            <li>so you can straighten your hair pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick to reset, but it&#x27;s a pain as the buttons are exactly where you hold the iron.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is great, it heats up really fast &amp; does the job better than flat irons twice the price.</li>
            <li>So far we have quick and easy.</li>
            <li>The other reviews looked good and for the price, I decided to buy it.  </li>
            <li>I could not make my hair come out right, so I would go and pay to have my hair done, and I used to think why did I spend 100.00 on an iron that I cannot use?</li>
            <li>And the price is right.  </li>
            <li>It works quickly and easily to smooth my hair and make it look like I had it professionally styled.</li>
            <li>It heats up beyond quick (30 seconds) and how it has 2 inch ceramic plates makes the job go that much</li>
            <li>I used it in more humid areas with the same level of success and would recommed it this to those in humid areas.  </li>
            <li>The floating plates, surprisingly do a great job of straightening my hair without grabbing it real tight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this straightener and will continue to use it in addition to my other one.</li>
            <li>I was able to set a lower temperature that suited my fine, long red hair, so I ended with shiny, healthy, and straight locks.</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast and lets you program the temperature as desired.</li>
            <li>Pretty great for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>As far as she is concerned, she loves the width of the plates, and her hair is smooth and shiny when she is done.</li>
            <li>I love it-and I will be buying the REMINGTON CURLING WAND next.</li>
            <li>It even straightens THE FIRST TIME over.  </li>
            <li>I only need 5 minutes to straighten it with this one. :)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t beat my favorite hair straightener, but I would say that it ranks second on my list.</li>
            <li>and I know that the larger plates are supposed to be better for longer hair, but I just don&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li>My go to iron is made by Hot Tools and cost around $35.</li>
            <li>(if you have thinner hair set it to the lowest temp, higher to the highest, etc).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not fussed about the digital display, but others might be so be sure to take that into consideration when buying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not fussed about the digital display, but others might be so be sure to take that into consideration when buying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it gets the job done fast!</li>
            <li>a wider, higher temperature iron.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it saves time as the larger plate takes more hair.</li>
            <li>Gets hot fast!</li>
            <li>Most definitely.  </li>
            <li>It heats up super fast and has a large readable LCD display for setting the temperature.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use flat irons much, but this was very easy to use and worked well.</li>
            <li>There are several heat settings, making it easy to find the right setting for you.</li>
            <li>I love how my hair felt but it made my hair really flat</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>Careful touching your hair immediately after because this iron gets really hot but other than that I love this flat iron works amazing</li>
            <li>and it’s easy to follow directions when it comes to how hot to heat for various hair types</li>
            <li>the positive side</li>
            <li>Yes, that anti-frizz benefit gives much to a head of hair that makes this a straightener that&#x27;s useful even if your hair isn&#x27;t particular curly, like mine.  </li>
            <li>and it straightens large sections of hair in one pass, leaving it sleek and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have to hold it in a certain angle to avoid this.</li>
            <li>This one ranks pretty high on my list.</li>
            <li>I love this new Remington flat iron.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I found my new favorite flat iron.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another huge selling point of this product is its digital screen in the handle</li>
            <li>Heats up in seconds and straightens my hair much faster then</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>Fast heat up, as well.</li>
            <li>It heats up incredibly fast, is durable</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Things I really like about this straightener</li>
            <li>it heats up really fast.</li>
            <li>It heats up very well and does work as you would expect.</li>
            <li>While this straightener is functional, I don&#x27;t really see the \\&quot;anti frizz\\&quot; portion of it.</li>
            <li>but I was amazed that after I straightened my hair with this product, it stayed straight for two whole days.  </li>
            <li>but it really works on my stubborn wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy hair when the humidity goes up</li>
            <li>Is very lightweight.</li>
            <li>It almost seemed as though as soon as the unit was turned on it was heated up and ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although my hair didn&#x27;t frizz, my hair didn&#x27;t remain straight.</li>
            <li>This really does eliminate frizz in the humid weather and this is without using any product.</li>
            <li>This made my hair look as if I was born with straight hair.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day, all night, and my hair still would still be straight when I woke up.</li>
            <li>I have been using this straight iron for over a month and the frizziness is under control.</li>
            <li>really, really worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a number of flat irons and would say this one is pretty average to good.</li>
            <li>In fact, the first time I used it, a co-worker remarked, &amp;#34;You got a new straightener, didn&#x27;t you?</li>
            <li>Good price...not all that different from other straighteners ive used</li>
            <li>The flat iron heats quickly and gets really hot.  </li>
            <li>My hair is VERY THICK, which is amazing!</li>
            <li>I already have straight hair, so I didn&#x27;t need a high temp or a lot of styling.</li>
            <li>From the lady of the house:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder length hair that is mild-moderately curly when left to dry on its own.</li>
            <li>I normally keep mine much lower than that</li>
            <li>That said, this iron did the job: it sleeked down my hair in humid weather and made it look much better.</li>
            <li>and I love how the heat can be turned up or down depending on the preference of the user.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a good solid flat iron that will, no doubt, last for quite a while.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a good solid flat iron that will, no doubt, last for quite a while.</li>
            <li>There were others that were more expensive, but this is the favorite of all that she has owned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d look into a smaller size, they do have a 1&amp;#34; size made with the same features that may be a better</li>
            <li>I like the digital read-out for accuracy of temperature and it heated up wonderfully quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it around the mid setting -- as with any new product, I wanted to make sure I didn&#x27;t burn my hair into tiny pieces</li>
            <li>This straightener has wide smooth plates that moved through my hair like glass</li>
            <li>Keeps the frizz out and really straightens my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I assume this is probably normal for irons like this, and that she needs to get used to it, but she was amazed that this would happen at 300 degrees, and can&#x27;t even imagine what it would be like if it were turned up to its 400-degree max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You do have to make sure when you push the on button that you do it firmly or it might not turn on.</li>
            <li>This straightened my hair really nicely and has definitely cut down on a lot of the frizz.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stand to spend over another $100 on a new one.</li>
            <li>I typically look for a few things in a great flat iron: how fast it heats, whether or not I can control the temperature, and how high the temperature goes.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, my mom asked if I had used a different product on my hair to make it look so shiny.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my wife and initially she said \\&quot;there&#x27;s no way it&#x27;ll be better than my chi\\&quot; or something or other.  </li>
            <li>Especially because this is pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so used to slower machines that I&#x27;ve sometimes gone away to fill the time while it heats up only to realize it&#x27;s hot within seconds.</li>
            <li>However, with the Remington product, those waves were much more pronounced and much more difficult to straighten the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Given, 450 degrees is really only necessary for really coarse unruly hair so the digital dial is especially useful in regulating the temperature.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair looks more like I had it professionally blown dry as opposed to the usual super straight no body look my last iron gave me.</li>
            <li>I do like that it has a 2 inch plate, rather than a 1 inch because you could get more hair done in less time, but for me it will be used as a back up straightener to bring on vacation</li>
            <li>: they&#x27;re large and longer than the last one I had!</li>
            <li>I am pretty hopeless when it comes to styling my own hair due to a lack of patience and thick shoulder length tresses.</li>
            <li>Definitely one to consider if you&#x27;re looking for a sturdy, quick and reliable flat iron.gital display.</li>
            <li>Definitely one to consider if you&#x27;re looking for a sturdy, quick and reliable flat iron.</li>
            <li>It took several passes over each section of my hair to become straight.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair straight in the southern humidity.  </li>
            <li>It use to take me 30+ minutes to straighten my hair with my old straightener.</li>
            <li>This is by far the fastest iron I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I use straighteners through necessity and have developed a hate-hate relationship with them.</li>
            <li>I really appreciated that the cord rotates totally</li>
            <li>So far this straightener has worked well for me</li>
            <li>My hair can be out of control, but during the summer it&#x27;s completely unmanageable.</li>
            <li>I thought it might be too big as my hair is on the shorter side now, but it worked very well</li>
            <li>Well, I was completely taken aback by how well this works.</li>
            <li>; I thought it was complete bull and gimmicks.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this flat iron, I owned a more expensive one that broke, so I bought this one, and the funny thing is my other iron</li>
            <li>Good price, you don&#x27;t need an expensive straightener.</li>
            <li>I, like many others, have tried so many different hair straighteners to try and tame my thick, curly, frizzy, unruly hair.</li>
            <li>It dissipated quickly and didn&#x27;t linger on the hair itself, but it made the process of using the straightener kind of unpleasant.</li>
            <li>My teen daughter usually styles it for me as she does a much better job with the straight iron and says I miss spots on the back of my head when I do it</li>
            <li>If you want a flat iron without spending as much money I would recommend the Wigo with ceramic plates.  </li>
            <li>I live in the desert southwest so constant humidity isn&#x27;t a big issue, but on humid days the frizz control has really worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have thick black hair and while on most days it&#x27;s usually pretty straight, there are some days when it&#x27;s humid outside and my hair just grows exponentially.</li>
            <li>; straightener just took too long to get my hair straight.  </li>
            <li>Even the little things that I had become used to with my tiny, cheap straightener - the burned fingers, the one temperature (surface of the sun), the pulling and pinching of my hair - were improved.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research before buying a new flat iron to replace the $20 drugstore model I borrowed from my sister, and this product was the clear winner based on reviews.</li>
            <li>This might seem small, but while using the Remington my fingers kept grabbing onto where the plates were (HOT!!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always open to trying new straighteners to see how they measure up, and I&#x27;d never tried the Remington</li>
            <li>The Remington is quick to heat, has a digital dial for regulating the temperature and goes up to 450 degrees like most professional and uber expensive flat irons.</li>
            <li>The heat doesn&#x27;t really penetrate the hair enough to totally get rid of the frizziness.</li>
            <li>The build quality is solid, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap but isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair that tends to frizz easily.</li>
            <li>All of the instructions for use are easy to follow and make things pretty simple to remember without feeling bogged down and have to be a rocket scientist to operate.</li>
            <li>I loved my old SEDU straightener and was so sad when it broke!</li>
            <li>If you live in a humid region then this is the flat iron you need.</li>
            <li>The heat was accurate and did not leave my hair in a dry crackling mess.  </li>
            <li>I feel that the larger plates make the straightener heavier (although this one is fairly light), harder to squeeze shut, and they make it a lot more difficult to get the root of the hair, especially around the ears.</li>
            <li>Usually, when I use my other straightener, I only have to make 2 passes along my hair to get it straight, but with this one I had to do about 4, so that pretty much doubled the amount of time it took to finish my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is by FAR the heaviest flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I cranked it up as high as the heat would go (past 400 degrees), and it still wouldn&#x27;t straight my hair as well as my drugstore straightener on a lower heat setting.</li>
            <li>We live in Las Vegas where the weather is dry</li>
            <li>4 year warranty is a definite plus since I&#x27;ve found most flat irons don&#x27;t last that long - it tells me that Remington really stands behind their product.</li>
            <li>That said, it absolutely cuts down on frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my hair is already frizzy due to the high humidity.</li>
            <li>I have an old ceramic Wigo flat iron and wanted to try this Remington flat iron in the same size.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this has been a good iron so far, but not particularly better than her older less expensive iron.</li>

            <li> it was a very welcome discovery.  </li>
            <li> size all factored in with helping a novice like me transform my frizzy semi curly hair into beautiful strands!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one of the best irons I have had in a while.</li>
            <li> This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve owned!</li>

            <li> Does a great job straightening hair.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job of straightening her hair.</li>
            <li> (I tend to drop stuff) and the cord is a great length.</li>
            <li> The auto shut off is always a welcome feature as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so the automatic shut off is a great safety feature.</li>
            <li> I just sent my daughter off to college with my straitening iron (HerStyler) which I thought was great.</li>
            <li> makes this great for just about all.</li>
            <li> and I am happy that I was.</li>
            <li> The Remington Anti Frizz Therapy Straightener is great.  </li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> In love with it one of the best straighteners I have ever bought</li>
            <li> very easy!</li>
            <li> I felt that it did a good job straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li> the good.</li>
            <li> I did find the Remington straightener to be a good surprise.  </li>
            <li> It was a great iron, and this is BETTER than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has so many great features- lock buttons, increase/decrease temperature buttons, turbo feature, 1 hour auto shut off and 4 year warranty.</li>
            <li> After doing my research and reading reviews I decided to buy this Remington (the latest HerStyler didn&#x27;t get great reviews).</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It is very smooth, my hair looks sleek and gorgeous after one run over.</li>
            <li> I used it immediately to see if I liked it</li>
            <li> There is a nice LCD indicator and a heat guide to what type of hair you have.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on Good Housekeeping recommending it, and I am pleased that I didn&#x27;t buy a Chi.</li>
            <li> Partially my own fault, but</li>
            <li> At this lowest setting, she burned herself on the iron itself, and noticed that she even burned herself on her own hair.  </li>
            <li> and I had to try to do it on my own and</li>
            <li> Nice</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel as though I was able to get as good a grip on the straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This heats up fast, evenly, and leaves hair wonderfully sleek.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve been very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Great price, good built quality, easy to use and fast heat.</li>
            <li> VERY SMOOTH when going over my hair.</li>
            <li> A very important feature is also for a straightener to have ceramic plates, as I feel this protects the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a huge plus!</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this straightener.</li>
            <li> but my ends were more frizzy than ever.</li>
            <li> But most telling was my hair.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m able to store it sooner.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter - the latest in years of straighteners.</li>
            <li> And my hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li> That is a lot of time in the mornings!  :-)</li>
            <li> I love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> This product is ok.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> is sometimes while I&#x27;m holding it and styling, the location of the buttons makes it so that I accidentally turn up the heat more than I tend to.</li>
            <li> but otherwise, I just love how this straightener works.</li>
            <li> If you run into this problem be sure to lock the settings to avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Looks great!&amp;#34;  :)</li>
            <li> This did a fantastic job!</li>
            <li> My hair frizzes out at the hint of rain - this straightener keeps it nice and smooth without me having to worry about it growing into 80&#x27;s hair by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Love how you do not have to wait for it to heat up as well.</li>
            <li> I love this device and will be using it even more once my daughter moves out</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This is the best straightner outside of the high-end line I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I asked her for her opinion and she said that if it was the right style she would have loved it.</li>
            <li> Makes my curly frizzy hair straight!!!!</li>
            <li> very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a cheap hair straightener for many years...</li>
            <li> The Remington S8530 is a very good flat iron.</li>
            <li> easy to use too.</li>
            <li> Plus my hair would tangle easily.</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
            <li> The locking function makes it easy to store.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Heated up very, very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quality hair straightener, with cool features and many benefits.</li>
            <li> It has an automatic shut-off, which is probably true of most straighteners today.</li>
            <li> Quick to heat, efficient and controls frizz!</li>
            <li> I have used this once and was hugely impressed!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was everything I wanted and such a great price.  </li>
            <li> I really liked how this works and heats up fast</li>
            <li> I really wish I liked it because it was affordable.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light weight</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Glides smoothly.</li>
            <li> It heats very quickly &amp; the temperature enables quick and easy starightening as desired (and I still didn&#x27;t set it at the highest temperature).</li>
            <li> It heats very quickly and just as important, it also cools quickly</li>
            <li> The iron heats up super quick as do most of them these days.</li>
            <li> The auto shut-off is a great feature that all flat irons and curling irons should have.</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron.</li>
            <li> Great product with quick results that last!</li>
            <li> Such an amazing product !</li>
            <li> does the job and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Love it so much!</li>
            <li> So when I saw the price tag on this I truly felt it needed to be spectacular to live up to the $75 sale</li>
            <li> Maybe the most appealing feature about this Frizz Therapy Straightener is the speed with which it smooths and straightens wild kinky hair.</li>
            <li> Her hair feels silky smooth and her straight hair doesn&#x27;t frizz, even during fairly humid days here in NEw England.  </li>
            <li> I did a little research into what product would be the best investment, setting a much higher budget...</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find this particular Remington straightener at the top of the list (and near the bottom of the price points!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product that is now my new favorite flat iron.</li>
            <li> with this tool I FINALLY achieved beautiful straight hair all on my own!&lt;br /&gt;The anti-frizz ceramic plates infused with micro-conditioners along with the 450-degree temperature heat and the 2 in.</li>
            <li> I really believe I could do better than $77.</li>
            <li> My hair stays straight and frizz free all day!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this product has some good features, it really isn&#x27;t enough to replace my HAI.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I used it at the highest setting, but the setting I used kept my hair straight for more than two days with no frizzing and</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener heats up very fast and you has an easily adjustable temperature.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said that, she has been happy with the results, but has not noticed any &amp;#34;anti-frizz&amp;#34; improvements over her other iron (maybe there is a difference if she kicks it up to 450 degrees?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tend to straighten my hair only once every couple weeks - at most, once a week - but the health and feel of my hair indicates I&#x27;d be safe if I wanted to up the frequency.</li>
            <li> I was delighted within a few strokes I love the straightener</li>
            <li> My wife says that the Remington S8530 straightener has a quick heat up time.  </li>
            <li> There are various temperature settings and all agree that this is a solid product that does an excellent job at giving the desired results.</li>
            <li> It heats up extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick Heat:</li>
            <li> Having only had it for a couple of months I can tell I will be using it off and on for many more years without needing to replace it.</li>
            <li> Having only had it for a couple of months I can tell I will be using it off and on for many more years without needing to replace it.</li>
            <li> Heats up QUICK and helps with frizz.</li>
            <li> plus I go too quickly.</li>
            <li> The very first time I used it, I wondered why on earth</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a month of testing this has really turned out to be a great flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is such an awesome flat iron!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and fast results.</li>
            <li> The handle, though close to the paddles, never felt hot!</li>
            <li> This straightener gets HOT!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> It will automatically switch off after a certain period of non-use (I think an hour?), which was a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love it gets my hair straight fast.</li>
            <li> far 300 degrees is all that has been needed to give me a nice straight look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of straightners at friends&#x27; houses over the years and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> It has a nice digital display, the controls are out of the way and it has a swivel cord.  </li>
            <li> and I am left on my own to style my unruly hair.</li>
            <li> so you can straighten your hair pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick to reset, but it&#x27;s a pain as the buttons are exactly where you hold the iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is great, it heats up really fast &amp; does the job better than flat irons twice the price.</li>
            <li> So far we have quick and easy.</li>
            <li> The other reviews looked good and for the price, I decided to buy it.  </li>
            <li> I could not make my hair come out right, so I would go and pay to have my hair done, and I used to think why did I spend 100.00 on an iron that I cannot use?</li>
            <li> And the price is right.  </li>
            <li> It works quickly and easily to smooth my hair and make it look like I had it professionally styled.</li>
            <li> It heats up beyond quick (30 seconds) and how it has 2 inch ceramic plates makes the job go that much</li>
            <li> I used it in more humid areas with the same level of success and would recommed it this to those in humid areas.  </li>
            <li> The floating plates, surprisingly do a great job of straightening my hair without grabbing it real tight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this straightener and will continue to use it in addition to my other one.</li>
            <li> I was able to set a lower temperature that suited my fine, long red hair, so I ended with shiny, healthy, and straight locks.</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast and lets you program the temperature as desired.</li>
            <li> Pretty great for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> As far as she is concerned, she loves the width of the plates, and her hair is smooth and shiny when she is done.</li>
            <li> I love it-and I will be buying the REMINGTON CURLING WAND next.</li>
            <li> It even straightens THE FIRST TIME over.  </li>
            <li> I only need 5 minutes to straighten it with this one. :)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t beat my favorite hair straightener, but I would say that it ranks second on my list.</li>
            <li> and I know that the larger plates are supposed to be better for longer hair, but I just don&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li> My go to iron is made by Hot Tools and cost around $35.</li>
            <li> (if you have thinner hair set it to the lowest temp, higher to the highest, etc).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fussed about the digital display, but others might be so be sure to take that into consideration when buying.&lt;br</li>

            <li> , it gets the job done fast!</li>
            <li> a wider, higher temperature iron.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it saves time as the larger plate takes more hair.</li>
            <li> Gets hot fast!</li>
            <li> Most definitely.  </li>
            <li> It heats up super fast and has a large readable LCD display for setting the temperature.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use flat irons much, but this was very easy to use and worked well.</li>
            <li> There are several heat settings, making it easy to find the right setting for you.</li>
            <li> I love how my hair felt but it made my hair really flat</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> Careful touching your hair immediately after because this iron gets really hot but other than that I love this flat iron works amazing</li>
            <li> and it’s easy to follow directions when it comes to how hot to heat for various hair types</li>
            <li> the positive side</li>
            <li> Yes, that anti-frizz benefit gives much to a head of hair that makes this a straightener that&#x27;s useful even if your hair isn&#x27;t particular curly, like mine.  </li>
            <li> and it straightens large sections of hair in one pass, leaving it sleek and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have to hold it in a certain angle to avoid this.</li>
            <li> This one ranks pretty high on my list.</li>
            <li> I love this new Remington flat iron.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I found my new favorite flat iron.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another huge selling point of this product is its digital screen in the handle</li>
            <li> Heats up in seconds and straightens my hair much faster then</li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> Fast heat up, as well.</li>
            <li> It heats up incredibly fast, is durable</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Things I really like about this straightener</li>
            <li> it heats up really fast.</li>
            <li> It heats up very well and does work as you would expect.</li>
            <li> While this straightener is functional, I don&#x27;t really see the \\&quot;anti frizz\\&quot; portion of it.</li>
            <li> but I was amazed that after I straightened my hair with this product, it stayed straight for two whole days.  </li>
            <li> but it really works on my stubborn wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair when the humidity goes up</li>
            <li> Is very lightweight.</li>
            <li> It almost seemed as though as soon as the unit was turned on it was heated up and ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although my hair didn&#x27;t frizz, my hair didn&#x27;t remain straight.</li>
            <li> This really does eliminate frizz in the humid weather and this is without using any product.</li>
            <li> This made my hair look as if I was born with straight hair.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day, all night, and my hair still would still be straight when I woke up.</li>
            <li> I have been using this straight iron for over a month and the frizziness is under control.</li>
            <li> really, really worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of flat irons and would say this one is pretty average to good.</li>
            <li> In fact, the first time I used it, a co-worker remarked, &amp;#34;You got a new straightener, didn&#x27;t you?</li>
            <li> Good price...not all that different from other straighteners ive used</li>
            <li> The flat iron heats quickly and gets really hot.  </li>
            <li> My hair is VERY THICK, which is amazing!</li>
            <li> I already have straight hair, so I didn&#x27;t need a high temp or a lot of styling.</li>
            <li> From the lady of the house:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder length hair that is mild-moderately curly when left to dry on its own.</li>
            <li> I normally keep mine much lower than that</li>
            <li> That said, this iron did the job: it sleeked down my hair in humid weather and made it look much better.</li>
            <li> and I love how the heat can be turned up or down depending on the preference of the user.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a good solid flat iron that will, no doubt, last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a good solid flat iron that will, no doubt, last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> There were others that were more expensive, but this is the favorite of all that she has owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d look into a smaller size, they do have a 1&amp;#34; size made with the same features that may be a better</li>
            <li> I like the digital read-out for accuracy of temperature and it heated up wonderfully quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it around the mid setting -- as with any new product, I wanted to make sure I didn&#x27;t burn my hair into tiny pieces</li>
            <li> This straightener has wide smooth plates that moved through my hair like glass</li>
            <li> Keeps the frizz out and really straightens my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I assume this is probably normal for irons like this, and that she needs to get used to it, but she was amazed that this would happen at 300 degrees, and can&#x27;t even imagine what it would be like if it were turned up to its 400-degree max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You do have to make sure when you push the on button that you do it firmly or it might not turn on.</li>
            <li> This straightened my hair really nicely and has definitely cut down on a lot of the frizz.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand to spend over another $100 on a new one.</li>
            <li> I typically look for a few things in a great flat iron: how fast it heats, whether or not I can control the temperature, and how high the temperature goes.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, my mom asked if I had used a different product on my hair to make it look so shiny.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and initially she said \\&quot;there&#x27;s no way it&#x27;ll be better than my chi\\&quot; or something or other.  </li>
            <li> Especially because this is pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so used to slower machines that I&#x27;ve sometimes gone away to fill the time while it heats up only to realize it&#x27;s hot within seconds.</li>
            <li> However, with the Remington product, those waves were much more pronounced and much more difficult to straighten the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Given, 450 degrees is really only necessary for really coarse unruly hair so the digital dial is especially useful in regulating the temperature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair looks more like I had it professionally blown dry as opposed to the usual super straight no body look my last iron gave me.</li>
            <li> I do like that it has a 2 inch plate, rather than a 1 inch because you could get more hair done in less time, but for me it will be used as a back up straightener to bring on vacation</li>
            <li> : they&#x27;re large and longer than the last one I had!</li>
            <li> I am pretty hopeless when it comes to styling my own hair due to a lack of patience and thick shoulder length tresses.</li>
            <li> Definitely one to consider if you&#x27;re looking for a sturdy, quick and reliable flat iron.gital display.</li>
            <li> Definitely one to consider if you&#x27;re looking for a sturdy, quick and reliable flat iron.</li>
            <li> It took several passes over each section of my hair to become straight.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my hair straight in the southern humidity.  </li>
            <li> It use to take me 30+ minutes to straighten my hair with my old straightener.</li>
            <li> This is by far the fastest iron I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I use straighteners through necessity and have developed a hate-hate relationship with them.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated that the cord rotates totally</li>
            <li> So far this straightener has worked well for me</li>
            <li> My hair can be out of control, but during the summer it&#x27;s completely unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be too big as my hair is on the shorter side now, but it worked very well</li>
            <li> Well, I was completely taken aback by how well this works.</li>
            <li> ; I thought it was complete bull and gimmicks.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this flat iron, I owned a more expensive one that broke, so I bought this one, and the funny thing is my other iron</li>
            <li> Good price, you don&#x27;t need an expensive straightener.</li>
            <li> I, like many others, have tried so many different hair straighteners to try and tame my thick, curly, frizzy, unruly hair.</li>
            <li> It dissipated quickly and didn&#x27;t linger on the hair itself, but it made the process of using the straightener kind of unpleasant.</li>
            <li> My teen daughter usually styles it for me as she does a much better job with the straight iron and says I miss spots on the back of my head when I do it</li>
            <li> If you want a flat iron without spending as much money I would recommend the Wigo with ceramic plates.  </li>
            <li> I live in the desert southwest so constant humidity isn&#x27;t a big issue, but on humid days the frizz control has really worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick black hair and while on most days it&#x27;s usually pretty straight, there are some days when it&#x27;s humid outside and my hair just grows exponentially.</li>
            <li> ; straightener just took too long to get my hair straight.  </li>
            <li> Even the little things that I had become used to with my tiny, cheap straightener - the burned fingers, the one temperature (surface of the sun), the pulling and pinching of my hair - were improved.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before buying a new flat iron to replace the $20 drugstore model I borrowed from my sister, and this product was the clear winner based on reviews.</li>
            <li> This might seem small, but while using the Remington my fingers kept grabbing onto where the plates were (HOT!!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always open to trying new straighteners to see how they measure up, and I&#x27;d never tried the Remington</li>
            <li> The Remington is quick to heat, has a digital dial for regulating the temperature and goes up to 450 degrees like most professional and uber expensive flat irons.</li>
            <li> The heat doesn&#x27;t really penetrate the hair enough to totally get rid of the frizziness.</li>
            <li> The build quality is solid, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap but isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that tends to frizz easily.</li>
            <li> All of the instructions for use are easy to follow and make things pretty simple to remember without feeling bogged down and have to be a rocket scientist to operate.</li>
            <li> I loved my old SEDU straightener and was so sad when it broke!</li>
            <li> If you live in a humid region then this is the flat iron you need.</li>
            <li> The heat was accurate and did not leave my hair in a dry crackling mess.  </li>
            <li> I feel that the larger plates make the straightener heavier (although this one is fairly light), harder to squeeze shut, and they make it a lot more difficult to get the root of the hair, especially around the ears.</li>
            <li> Usually, when I use my other straightener, I only have to make 2 passes along my hair to get it straight, but with this one I had to do about 4, so that pretty much doubled the amount of time it took to finish my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is by FAR the heaviest flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I cranked it up as high as the heat would go (past 400 degrees), and it still wouldn&#x27;t straight my hair as well as my drugstore straightener on a lower heat setting.</li>
            <li> We live in Las Vegas where the weather is dry</li>
            <li> 4 year warranty is a definite plus since I&#x27;ve found most flat irons don&#x27;t last that long - it tells me that Remington really stands behind their product.</li>
            <li> That said, it absolutely cuts down on frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my hair is already frizzy due to the high humidity.</li>
            <li> I have an old ceramic Wigo flat iron and wanted to try this Remington flat iron in the same size.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this has been a good iron so far, but not particularly better than her older less expensive iron.</li>
            <li> When I sleep my hair normally does develop some slight waves that I need to touch up the next morning.</li>
            <li> As my hair doesn&#x27;t have any frizz (naturally straight), I can&#x27;t speak to the &amp;#34;Anti Frizz Therapy.&amp;#34; I just use this to tame flyaways and bed head some mornings.</li>
            <li> and I used less heat than normal.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this flat</li>
            <li> Looks like I&#x27;ve been using too much heat in the past.</li>
            <li> but I definitely would recommend as its only about $43 which is not expensive at all compared to other straighteners I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I received this flat iron on a Monday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the ONE brand flat iron the retails for $200.</li>
            <li> This Remington flat iron sells for about $40 and let me tell you, it works just as well.</li>
            <li> I have used a 2&amp;#34; flat iron before</li>
            <li> When I use the flat iron, my hour 1</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair and my 1&amp;#34</li>
            <li> having only recently paid around $35 for my favorite flat iron, but I should add that the less expensive one I have does NOT have a digital display.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying this product before spending near the amount on a CHI or any other straightener!</li>
            <li> /&gt;She informed me that the only issues were that it seemed to dry her hair faster than the chi</li>
            <li> -- I was NOT burning the hair (it was on the lowest setting) and the hair was completely dry before starting, but every time I pressed the hair this chemical smelling steam came up and caused me to cough.</li>
            <li> Not true of my 10 year old HAI.</li>
            <li> And it knocked off my time to get it straight by at least 5 mins.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a minor thing</li>
            <li> and I was worried that since my hair was so short that the wand was too wide to use.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it cuts down on frizz without question, but almost every solid flat iron I&#x27;ve had does that.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I just hope it lives for a long time!</li>
            <li> Since I have very long hair, a 2 inch straightener is a must.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is very long, curly and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have really long hair (it goes all the way down my back)</li>
            <li> Not sure what the problem is, but I discussed it with my stylist (who also used less than 300 degrees to get my hair wonderfully straight), and we couldn&#x27;t figure out what the problem could be, except that maybe the coating in the plates to make it</li>
            <li> I ordered this straightener for my wife to use and she wasn&#x27;t much into it as it was the wrong style apparently.</li>
            <li> The controls are super simplistic</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair that I wear in a just-above-the-shoulder bob that I choose to keep straight.</li>
            <li> I have more bad hair days then not yet using this straightener has helped.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure how long it will last</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan of</li>
            <li> Also my last iron was narrow</li>
            <li> and I have to say I appreciate this wide iron</li>
            <li> The larger than average heat plates cut her straightening time in half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say since we live in South Louisiana, it&#x27;s hard to say if the anti frizz really works.  </li>
            <li> Usually if I brush my hair after straightening, it turns into a big ball of fluff, with this straightener that didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair frizzing due to humidity.</li>
            <li> She even manages to avoid any hair pulling or tangles that can happen with other brands of straighteners.</li>
            <li> It works about as well as my other straightener, which does not claim to be anti frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d pay the price for what you&#x27;re getting, but it&#x27;s a solid iron.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure that this is technically a &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; feature.</li>
            <li> I have had other straighteners with ceramic plates</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for the past 7 years on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> and I think this is largely due to this straigtner.  </li>
            <li> Was not sure with the price being so low</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and recently got a bob cut just above shoulder length</li>
            <li> Definitely helps narrow down my hair prep time with less frizz in the Summer.</li>
            <li> There is a little piece that you slide up to keep the iron closed when you store it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy, but it&#x27;s quite wide</li>
            <li> Having a pretty thick head of hair this can get exhausting after over twenty minutes of straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> my previous one.</li>
            <li> So this product is a hidden gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works beautifully on my long, thick, wavy, often frizzy, hair.</li>
            <li> : The $75 price seemed a little steep for me</li>
            <li> The lightness of the Remington did lighten fatigue on my arm a little bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it took forever to straighten with a round brush and blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical because I haven&#x27;t found a straightener that completely got rid of frizz</li>
            <li> Heavy:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the product itself or because the product weighs so much less, but I didn&#x27;t feel as though the plates were closing fully against my hair.</li>
            <li> First off, the bad.</li>
            <li> On those days, I&#x27;m forced to just wear it in a ponytail because if it&#x27;s down it looks like I got</li>
            <li> Past hair straighteners tend to &amp;#34;fry&amp;#34;</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I did a lot of research before buying a new flat iron to replace the $20 drugstore model I borrowed from my sister, and this product was the clear winner based on reviews. My hair responds well to heat styling, but this straightener would not straighten my hair. I cranked it up as high as the heat would go (past 400 degrees), and it still wouldn&#x27;t straight my hair as well as my drugstore straightener on a lower heat setting. Not sure what the problem is, but I discussed it with my stylist (who also used less than 300 degrees to get my hair wonderfully straight), and we couldn&#x27;t figure out what the problem could be, except that maybe the coating in the plates to make it anti-frizz impairs its straightening ability. And, the multiple passes I had to make with this were a big problem, given that it is quite a bit heavier than a one inch straightener. Tried using it for a week, but in the end I returned it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this straightener. I didn&#x27;t except it to be as well made as it is. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that tends to frizz easily. This is the best straightener that I have ever used. It works quickly and easily to smooth my hair and make it look like I had it professionally styled.</li>
            <li> Supposed to be &amp;#34;anti-frizz but my ends were more frizzy than ever. Returned the next day.</li>
            <li> Pretty great for my thick hair. Definitely helps narrow down my hair prep time with less frizz in the Summer. Awesome price too!</li>
            <li> It was everything I wanted and such a great price.  Easy to use and fast results.</li>
            <li> Love it!! And great price!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a cheap hair straightener for many years... I think it was around $5, and I couldn&#x27;t hazard a guess at the brand. I did a little research into what product would be the best investment, setting a much higher budget... I was very pleased to find this particular Remington straightener at the top of the list (and near the bottom of the price points!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve been very happy with it! Even the little things that I had become used to with my tiny, cheap straightener - the burned fingers, the one temperature (surface of the sun), the pulling and pinching of my hair - were improved. But most telling was my hair. I was able to set a lower temperature that suited my fine, long red hair, so I ended with shiny, healthy, and straight locks. Bingo! I tend to straighten my hair only once every couple weeks - at most, once a week - but the health and feel of my hair indicates I&#x27;d be safe if I wanted to up the frequency. It heats very quickly and just as important, it also cools quickly so I&#x27;m able to store it sooner.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I just used this straightener twice since I bought it about 3 weeks ago.  It is the best.  easy to use too. did not regret it at all.</li>
            <li> I really liked how this works and heats up fast</li>
            <li> Such an amazing product !</li>
            <li> Great price, good built quality, easy to use and fast heat. It worths every penny.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter - the latest in years of straighteners. She loves it! There were others that were more expensive, but this is the favorite of all that she has owned. It will automatically switch off after a certain period of non-use (I think an hour?), which was a huge plus for me. As far as she is concerned, she loves the width of the plates, and her hair is smooth and shiny when she is done. Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is great, it heats up really fast &amp; does the job better than flat irons twice the price.</li>
            <li> Love it gets my hair straight fast. And my hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Heats up in seconds and straightens my hair much faster then my previous one. I have only had it for almost a week so I am not sure how long it will last but I definitely would recommend as its only about $43 which is not expensive at all compared to other straighteners I have purchased in the past. Def give it a try!</li>
            <li> Well I used this product twice then I returned it. I love how my hair felt but it made my hair really flat and I have thick hair. Plus my hair would tangle easily. I really wish I liked it because it was affordable. It definitely does the job that is says it does. I didn&#x27;t even have to use any hair serums.</li>
            <li> The price and quality are great!</li>
            <li> I received this flat iron on a Monday and I used it the same day it turned on and heated up within a minute. It worked great! And then Thursday I tried to used it again and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. Nothing happened to it between Monday and Thursday  because I put it back in the box. I&#x27;m in the process of returning the item.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints with this flat iron. It heats very quickly &amp; the temperature enables quick and easy starightening as desired (and I still didn&#x27;t set it at the highest temperature). It leaves the hair sleak, refined and no frizz. I love it-and I will be buying the REMINGTON CURLING WAND next. I trust this brand! It is truly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this!  I have pretty thick hair and my 1&amp;#34; straightener just took too long to get my hair straight.  The other reviews looked good and for the price, I decided to buy it.  You should too!  The first time I used it, my mom asked if I had used a different product on my hair to make it look so shiny.  I told her no, it was this straightener.  She was very impressed.  And it knocked off my time to get it straight by at least 5 mins.  That is a lot of time in the mornings!  :-)</li>
            <li> I loved my old SEDU straightener and was so sad when it broke! I couldn&#x27;t stand to spend over another $100 on a new one. I read some reviews on this product and thought I would give it a shot for $27!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the job and worth every penny! I recommend buying this product before spending near the amount on a CHI or any other straightener!</li>
            <li> I have used this once and was hugely impressed!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last straightening iron that I owned (and that his is replacing) was a Remington. It was a great iron, and this is BETTER than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PADDLES: they&#x27;re large and longer than the last one I had! Perfect! VERY SMOOTH when going over my hair. It even straightens THE FIRST TIME over.  My hair is VERY THICK, which is amazing! SO IMPRESSED!  NO SNAGS too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle: very easy! There&#x27;s even a locking mechanism so you don&#x27;t accidentally push the buttons. I don&#x27;t think this will be an issue for me, but I&#x27;m happy to know it&#x27;s there!  The handle, though close to the paddles, never felt hot! That&#x27;s a huge plus! The handle also has a digital display with very big numbers! I love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great iron! I hope this one lasts me 10 years like my last Remington!</li>
            <li> I used it immediately to see if I liked it I was delighted within a few strokes I love the straightener</li>
            <li> This works very well. I already have straight hair, so I didn&#x27;t need a high temp or a lot of styling. It&#x27;s the easiest to use and makes my hair shiny. Fast heat up, as well.</li>
            <li> I have an old ceramic Wigo flat iron and wanted to try this Remington flat iron in the same size.  I do like that you can alter the temperature based on your hair type.  Mine is thick and course (never quite curly but always frizzy) so I set it to almost the highest temperature at 425.  It on truly only took 30 seconds to heat up.  I felt that it did a good job straightening my hair.  It took several passes over each section of my hair to become straight.  I do like the finger indents so you keep your fingers from burning when applying pressure.  I don&#x27;t think this does anything for anti frizz.  We live in Las Vegas where the weather is dry and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair frizzing due to humidity. But I can guarantee that if we lived in the south and I used this, my hair would be frizzy!  If you want a flat iron without spending as much money I would recommend the Wigo with ceramic plates.  If you want to control the temperature for your hair type look into this Remington.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and initially she said \\&quot;there&#x27;s no way it&#x27;ll be better than my chi\\&quot; or something or other.  When she opened it , she became intrigued and low and behold, she uses it rather often.&lt;br /&gt;She informed me that the only issues were that it seemed to dry her hair faster than the chi and it was smaller width wise.&lt;br /&gt;however, she loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this new Remington flat iron. Since I have very long hair, a 2 inch straightener is a must. The auto shut-off is a great feature that all flat irons and curling irons should have. This product shuts off after an hour. There is a nice LCD indicator and a heat guide to what type of hair you have. Looks like I&#x27;ve been using too much heat in the past. As my hair doesn&#x27;t have any frizz (naturally straight), I can&#x27;t speak to the &amp;#34;Anti Frizz Therapy.&amp;#34; I just use this to tame flyaways and bed head some mornings. It&#x27;s a great product that is now my new favorite flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever purchased for my hair. I have very thick hair and recently got a bob cut just above shoulder length and it took forever to straighten with a round brush and blow dryer. My arms got so tired that I dreaded washing my hair because of the torture of straightening it. This Remington straightener has changed my life! I love it&#x27;s light weight and it straightens large sections of hair in one pass, leaving it sleek and shiny. It heats up very fast and lets you program the temperature as desired. Thank you for an awesome hair straightener!!</li>
            <li> My wife says that the Remington S8530 straightener has a quick heat up time.  The larger than average heat plates cut her straightening time in half. Her hair feels silky smooth and her straight hair doesn&#x27;t frizz, even during fairly humid days here in NEw England.  Past hair straighteners tend to &amp;#34;fry&amp;#34; her hair and cause a burning smell, but not the Remington S8530.  Not even at the highest setting.  She even manages to avoid any hair pulling or tangles that can happen with other brands of straighteners.</li>
            <li> This product is ok. But just that......ok. It&#x27;s not the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used or owned. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t consider this as an anti-frizz therapy option for your hair. It straightens the hair to a degree, but not with  salon type quality. The heat doesn&#x27;t really penetrate the hair enough to totally get rid of the frizziness. I do like that it has a 2 inch plate, rather than a 1 inch because you could get more hair done in less time, but for me it will be used as a back up straightener to bring on vacation so that if I lost it or left it someplace I wouldn&#x27;t be devastated over it.</li>
            <li> The flat iron heats quickly and gets really hot.  Does a great job straightening hair.  I&#x27;m sorry to say since we live in South Louisiana, it&#x27;s hard to say if the anti frizz really works.  It does seem to help but the humidity is outrageous compared to other parts of the country.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is very long, curly and frizzy.  It does a great job of straightening her hair.</li>
            <li> This is such an awesome flat iron!! It heats up incredibly fast, is durable (I tend to drop stuff) and the cord is a great length. It is very smooth, my hair looks sleek and gorgeous after one run over. It has a digital read out, and can heat up to 450 degrees. I normally keep mine much lower than that though at about 385. It has so many great features- lock buttons, increase/decrease temperature buttons, turbo feature, 1 hour auto shut off and 4 year warranty. The 4 year warranty is just awesome. Especially because this is pretty pricey. Anyway, I found my new favorite flat iron. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the ONE brand flat iron the retails for $200. This Remington flat iron sells for about $40 and let me tell you, it works just as well. I typically look for a few things in a great flat iron: how fast it heats, whether or not I can control the temperature, and how high the temperature goes. The Remington is quick to heat, has a digital dial for regulating the temperature and goes up to 450 degrees like most professional and uber expensive flat irons. Given, 450 degrees is really only necessary for really coarse unruly hair so the digital dial is especially useful in regulating the temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4 year warranty is a definite plus since I&#x27;ve found most flat irons don&#x27;t last that long - it tells me that Remington really stands behind their product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a hair straightener before and now I&#x27;m hooked for life. I have thick black hair and while on most days it&#x27;s usually pretty straight, there are some days when it&#x27;s humid outside and my hair just grows exponentially. On those days, I&#x27;m forced to just wear it in a ponytail because if it&#x27;s down it looks like I got electrocuted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I really like about this straightener: it&#x27;s really easy to use. if you&#x27;ve never used one before, it&#x27;s incredibly simple. it heats up really fast. very easy to clean. temperature controls are adjustable. make my hair look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m not really a fan of is sometimes while I&#x27;m holding it and styling, the location of the buttons makes it so that I accidentally turn up the heat more than I tend to. I have to hold it in a certain angle to avoid this. It&#x27;s a minor thing but I&#x27;ve found it a little annoying at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s a fantastic product. The very first time I used it, I wondered why on earth did I never use a hair straightener before?</li>
            <li> From the lady of the house:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder length hair that is mild-moderately curly when left to dry on its own. The Remington S8530 is a very good flat iron. It heats up super fast and has a large readable LCD display for setting the temperature. The auto shut off is always a welcome feature as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of testing this has really turned out to be a great flat iron. The floating plates, surprisingly do a great job of straightening my hair without grabbing it real tight. I live in the desert southwest so constant humidity isn&#x27;t a big issue, but on humid days the frizz control has really worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far 300 degrees is all that has been needed to give me a nice straight look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of straightners at friends&#x27; houses over the years and this is by far my favorite. I bought this based on Good Housekeeping recommending it, and I am pleased that I didn&#x27;t buy a Chi. Great product with quick results that last!</li>
            <li> Love it so much! Good price, you don&#x27;t need an expensive straightener. Glides smoothly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this straightener for my wife to use and she wasn&#x27;t much into it as it was the wrong style apparently. That&#x27;s what I get as a guy for ordering it. I asked her for her opinion and she said that if it was the right style she would have loved it. The build quality is solid, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap but isn&#x27;t too heavy. It heats up very well and does work as you would expect. It just wasn&#x27;t for her.</li>
            <li> While this straightener is functional, I don&#x27;t really see the \\&quot;anti frizz\\&quot; portion of it. It works about as well as my other straightener, which does not claim to be anti frizz.</li>
            <li> Good price...not all that different from other straighteners ive used</li>
            <li> Maybe the most appealing feature about this Frizz Therapy Straightener is the speed with which it smooths and straightens wild kinky hair. Time is valuable these days - as valuable as looking your best. There are several heat settings, making it easy to find the right setting for you. So far we have quick and easy. It&#x27;s a quality hair straightener, with cool features and many benefits. One small feature I didn&#x27;t care for was the price. I really believe I could do better than $77. But hey, two out of three ain&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great!!!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair straight in the southern humidity.  I was very impressed for the price.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical because I haven&#x27;t found a straightener that completely got rid of frizz but I was amazed that after I straightened my hair with this product, it stayed straight for two whole days.  The width of the plates are a bit cumbersome because my hands are small but otherwise, I just love how this straightener works. It has a nice digital display, the controls are out of the way and it has a swivel cord.  It&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side but it really works on my stubborn wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have ridiculously thick, frizzy hair, &amp; this straightener works wonders for it! It use to take me 30+ minutes to straighten my hair with my old straightener. I only need 5 minutes to straighten it with this one. :)</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It&#x27;s not too heavy, but it&#x27;s quite wide so you can straighten your hair pretty quickly. There are various temperature settings and all agree that this is a solid product that does an excellent job at giving the desired results. It actually reduces frizz, as it proclaims to do. This is the best straightener in my house</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!! Makes my curly frizzy hair straight!!!!</li>
            <li> I, like many others, have tried so many different hair straighteners to try and tame my thick, curly, frizzy, unruly hair. This one ranks pretty high on my list. It doesn&#x27;t beat my favorite hair straightener, but I would say that it ranks second on my list. First off, the bad. I don&#x27;t like that it has 2 inch plates. I have really long hair (it goes all the way down my back) and I know that the larger plates are supposed to be better for longer hair, but I just don&#x27;t like them. I feel that the larger plates make the straightener heavier (although this one is fairly light), harder to squeeze shut, and they make it a lot more difficult to get the root of the hair, especially around the ears. Usually, when I use my other straightener, I only have to make 2 passes along my hair to get it straight, but with this one I had to do about 4, so that pretty much doubled the amount of time it took to finish my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the good. It heats up extremely quickly. I like the automatic shut off feature. It shuts off after 1 hour, which is plenty of time to finish your entire head so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it shutting off in the middle, but I also like to take a break about halfway through my hair to rest my arms and sometimes I get distracted so the automatic shut off is a great safety feature. This straightened my hair really nicely and has definitely cut down on a lot of the frizz. Usually if I brush my hair after straightening, it turns into a big ball of fluff, with this straightener that didn&#x27;t happen. I&#x27;m very pleased with this straightener and will continue to use it in addition to my other one.</li>
            <li> Best straightener I have ever owned! I have very frizzy hair when the humidity goes up and this product is my best friend! My hair stays straight and frizz free all day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of flat irons and would say this one is pretty average to good. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d pay the price for what you&#x27;re getting, but it&#x27;s a solid iron. My go to iron is made by Hot Tools and cost around $35. So when I saw the price tag on this I truly felt it needed to be spectacular to live up to the $75 sale price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;- Digital Display: This was especially nice for accuracy (if you have thinner hair set it to the lowest temp, higher to the highest, etc).&lt;br /&gt;- Quick Heat: This is by far the fastest iron I&#x27;ve ever had. Within seconds the temperature goes to the desired setting and you&#x27;re off straightening your hair. I&#x27;m so used to slower machines that I&#x27;ve sometimes gone away to fill the time while it heats up only to realize it&#x27;s hot within seconds. It&#x27;s fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;- Frizz Factor: The verdict is still out on this. Yes, it cuts down on frizz without question, but almost every solid flat iron I&#x27;ve had does that. So I&#x27;m not sure that this is technically a &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; feature. That said, it absolutely cuts down on frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;- Heavy: This is by FAR the heaviest flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had. Having a pretty thick head of hair this can get exhausting after over twenty minutes of straightening my hair. If you have weak wrists or arms I&#x27;d look into a smaller size, they do have a 1&amp;#34; size made with the same features that may be a better option.&lt;br /&gt;- Digital Display: Partially my own fault, but I didn&#x27;t know you could lock the settings until just recently. Every time before this I would accidentally bump the buttons which would instantly change the temperature. It&#x27;s quick to reset, but it&#x27;s a pain as the buttons are exactly where you hold the iron. If you run into this problem be sure to lock the settings to avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;- Price: The $75 price seemed a little steep for me having only recently paid around $35 for my favorite flat iron, but I should add that the less expensive one I have does NOT have a digital display. I&#x27;m not fussed about the digital display, but others might be so be sure to take that into consideration when buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good solid flat iron that will, no doubt, last for quite a while. Having only had it for a couple of months I can tell I will be using it off and on for many more years without needing to replace it. Definitely one to consider if you&#x27;re looking for a sturdy, quick and reliable flat iron.gital display.

            <li> Careful touching your hair immediately after because this iron gets really hot but other than that I love this flat iron works amazing</li>
            <li> Works so well. Heats up QUICK and helps with frizz. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use flat irons much, but this was very easy to use and worked well. I like the digital read-out for accuracy of temperature and it heated up wonderfully quickly. The locking function makes it easy to store. My one quibble is that the anti-frizz coating caused some steam or something to come up from the hair -- I was NOT burning the hair (it was on the lowest setting) and the hair was completely dry before starting, but every time I pressed the hair this chemical smelling steam came up and caused me to cough. It dissipated quickly and didn&#x27;t linger on the hair itself, but it made the process of using the straightener kind of unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully on my long, thick, wavy, often frizzy, hair. No straightener has ever worked this well for me.  I get lots of compliments on my hair when I use it.  In fact, the first time I used it, a co-worker remarked, &amp;#34;You got a new straightener, didn&#x27;t you? Looks great!&amp;#34;  :)</li>
            <li> In love with it one of the best straighteners I have ever bought</li>
            <li> I just sent my daughter off to college with my straitening iron (HerStyler) which I thought was great. After doing my research and reading reviews I decided to buy this Remington (the latest HerStyler didn&#x27;t get great reviews). I iron my hair (usually) while still wet/damp so I don&#x27;t have to damage it twice with blow drying then ironing. This did a fantastic job! My hair looks more like I had it professionally blown dry as opposed to the usual super straight no body look my last iron gave me. Also my last iron was narrow and I have to say I appreciate this wide iron, it gets the job done fast!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this flat iron, I owned a more expensive one that broke, so I bought this one, and the funny thing is my other iron I could not make my hair come out right, so I would go and pay to have my hair done, and I used to think why did I spend 100.00 on an iron that I cannot use? I read the reviews on this one and I decided to try again, all you ladies out there this is the one.</li>
            <li> Great hair straightener and great price!</li>
            <li> Best hair straightener ever.</li>
            <li> My wife had been using the BaByliss Pro BAB2590 1.5-inch iron for a couple years, and then switched to this...a wider, higher temperature iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results?  Her immediate complaint was the heat...the low temperature on this model is 300 degrees (the BaByliss was 260).  At this lowest setting, she burned herself on the iron itself, and noticed that she even burned herself on her own hair.  I assume this is probably normal for irons like this, and that she needs to get used to it, but she was amazed that this would happen at 300 degrees, and can&#x27;t even imagine what it would be like if it were turned up to its 400-degree max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, she has been happy with the results, but has not noticed any &amp;#34;anti-frizz&amp;#34; improvements over her other iron (maybe there is a difference if she kicks it up to 450 degrees?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this has been a good iron so far, but not particularly better than her older less expensive iron.</li>
            <li> I use straighteners through necessity and have developed a hate-hate relationship with them. I did find the Remington straightener to be a good surprise.  I have had other straighteners with ceramic plates but my hair would get snagged on the sides etc.  This straightener has wide smooth plates that moved through my hair like glass it was a very welcome discovery.  The controls are super simplistic you can pick your desired degrees up to 450 and it is just a matter of pushing the plus/negative sign.  I really appreciated that the cord rotates totally (it avoids unnecessary cord tangles while you are using the straightener).  The heat was accurate and did not leave my hair in a dry crackling mess.  It also comes with ant-frizz sheets that you can apply to your hair.  So far this straightener has worked well for me and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair can be out of control, but during the summer it&#x27;s completely unmanageable. If you live in a humid region then this is the flat iron you need. My hair frizzes out at the hint of rain - this straightener keeps it nice and smooth without me having to worry about it growing into 80&#x27;s hair by the end of the day. Love it!</li>
            <li> This straightener gets HOT! Love how you do not have to wait for it to heat up as well. Thick 2 inches helps get the job done sooner! This is a great flat iron. Smooths out my frizz and even comes with 12 anti frizz sheets as an added bonus for touch ups!</li>
            <li> I’m one of those girls who have the worst trouble doing her hair. I have more bad hair days then not yet using this straightener has helped. It heats up beyond quick (30 seconds) and how it has 2 inch ceramic plates makes the job go that much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another huge selling point of this product is its digital screen in the handle and it’s easy to follow directions when it comes to how hot to heat for various hair types makes this great for just about all. All of the instructions for use are easy to follow and make things pretty simple to remember without feeling bogged down and have to be a rocket scientist to operate.</li>
            <li> I am pretty hopeless when it comes to styling my own hair due to a lack of patience and thick shoulder length tresses. My teen daughter usually styles it for me as she does a much better job with the straight iron and says I miss spots on the back of my head when I do it plus I go too quickly. Well, she went out of town for 3 weeks and I had to try to do it on my own and with this tool I FINALLY achieved beautiful straight hair all on my own!&lt;br /&gt;The anti-frizz ceramic plates infused with micro-conditioners along with the 450-degree temperature heat and the 2 in. size all factored in with helping a novice like me transform my frizzy semi curly hair into beautiful strands!  The 30 second heat up time saves energy and with the larger plates I think it saves time as the larger plate takes more hair. I love this device and will be using it even more once my daughter moves out and I am left on my own to style my unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair that I wear in a just-above-the-shoulder bob that I choose to keep straight. I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for the past 7 years on a regular basis. And I have a drawer of hair straighteners and one straightener that has become my &amp;#34;workhorse:&amp;#34; a HAI 2&amp;#34; ceramic plate straightener that cost just over $100 when I bought it almost 10 years ago. I&#x27;m always open to trying new straighteners to see how they measure up, and I&#x27;d never tried the Remington brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for years, I never, ever use the highest heat setting. I also never straighten my hair every day, though I may touch it up. I prefer a 2&amp;#34; plate because my hair is so thick, it would take forever straightening it with a 1&amp;#34; plate. A very important feature is also for a straightener to have ceramic plates, as I feel this protects the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side this straightener:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Is very lightweight. My HAI has a bit of weight to it. The lightness of the Remington did lighten fatigue on my arm a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Heated up very, very quickly. It almost seemed as though as soon as the unit was turned on it was heated up and ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It has an automatic shut-off, which is probably true of most straighteners today. Not true of my 10 year old HAI. Nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The product states &amp;#34;anti-frizz,&amp;#34; and I did notice there was no frizzing. It did get humid during the time I was using the product, and there was still no frizzing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with anything, there were things I didn&#x27;t care for with this product. Those were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The handle on the Remington is shorter than what is on my HAI. This might seem small, but while using the Remington my fingers kept grabbing onto where the plates were (HOT!!) and it was painful! I didn&#x27;t feel as though I was able to get as good a grip on the straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m not sure if it was the product itself or because the product weighs so much less, but I didn&#x27;t feel as though the plates were closing fully against my hair. I had to go over the same sections of hair multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Although my hair didn&#x27;t frizz, my hair didn&#x27;t remain straight. When I sleep my hair normally does develop some slight waves that I need to touch up the next morning. However, with the Remington product, those waves were much more pronounced and much more difficult to straighten the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this product has some good features, it really isn&#x27;t enough to replace my HAI. I&#x27;ll keep it as a back-up.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a hair straightener or anti-frizz iron so I have nothing to compare this product with. That said, this iron did the job: it sleeked down my hair in humid weather and made it look much better. I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I have used a 2&amp;#34; flat iron before and I did not get the same results as with this one. This really does eliminate frizz in the humid weather and this is without using any product. I thought it might be too big as my hair is on the shorter side now, but it worked very well and I used less heat than normal. This made my hair look as if I was born with straight hair. It lasts all day, all night, and my hair still would still be straight when I woke up. Messy, but straight. The iron heats up super quick as do most of them these days. You do have to make sure when you push the on button that you do it firmly or it might not turn on. This does prevent accidentally turning it off or adjusting the temperature when you grip the handle. There is a little piece that you slide up to keep the iron closed when you store it. This broke after a week, but no big deal to me. I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Well, I was completely taken aback by how well this works. When I use the flat iron, my hour 1 my hair is already frizzy due to the high humidity. So, I was extremely skeptical of the &amp;#34;anti frizz therapy.&amp;#34; I thought it was complete bull and gimmicks. I was so wrong and I am happy that I was. It actually works. I have been using this straight iron for over a month and the frizziness is under control. It lasts the entire day and night. I don&#x27;t have to change styles halfway through the day because my hair is all frizzy and sticking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener heats up very fast and you has an easily adjustable temperature. It has a read out display for temperature. It also auto-shuts off for safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best irons I have had in a while. Quick to heat, efficient and controls frizz!</li>
            <li> This is the best straightner outside of the high-end line I&#x27;ve ever used.  Yes, that anti-frizz benefit gives much to a head of hair that makes this a straightener that&#x27;s useful even if your hair isn&#x27;t particular curly, like mine.  As the day wears on, my hair stays in place without any tendency to flip out at the end (my biggest problem) and I think this is largely due to this straigtner.  I used it in more humid areas with the same level of success and would recommed it this to those in humid areas.  This heats up fast, evenly, and leaves hair wonderfully sleek.</li>
            <li> This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve owned! Keeps the frizz out and really straightens my naturally curly hair. Was not sure with the price being so low but it&#x27;s great! Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Gets hot fast! Works great! I just hope it lives for a long time!</li>
            <li> The Remington Anti Frizz Therapy Straightener is great.  I worried that since it was wider than what I was used to that it would not be as feasible to use in my hair.  But it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really, really worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a short, layered, chin length bob and I was worried that since my hair was so short that the wand was too wide to use.  It wasn&#x27;t and I love how the heat can be turned up or down depending on the preference of the user.  Can this straightener be used with really short hair, probably not.  Chin length and longer? Definitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it around the mid setting -- as with any new product, I wanted to make sure I didn&#x27;t burn my hair into tiny pieces so I gradually started in the middle and turned it up.  I don&#x27;t think I used it at the highest setting, but the setting I used kept my hair straight for more than two days with no frizzing and no waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend? Most definitely.  And the price is right.  So this product is a hidden gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie S. for Amazon Vine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it regularly for months without any problems.It simply does it&#x27;s thing well.</li>
