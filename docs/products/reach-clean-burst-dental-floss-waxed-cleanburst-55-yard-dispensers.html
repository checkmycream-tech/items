            <li>This floss had the right width.</li>
            <li>to see amazon do bulk packs, but I get these for just under buck each at a very large discount store beginning with \\&quot;W\\&quot;.</li>

            <li>This is great floss and it seems to be becoming harder and harder to find these days.</li>

            <li>Exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>I have used this before and had not been able to find it in the local drug store any longer.  </li>
            <li>the delivery was super fast and we will certainly order from SUPPLIESPLUS again.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin (which I prefer over the thicker dental \\&quot;tape,\\&quot; etc.), strong, comfortable to use, cuts easily and cleanly from the dispenser, and smells/tastes great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different brands and types of floss, the Reach Clean Burst Waxed Spearmint is my favorite by far.  </li>
            <li>Never want to use any other kind or brand.</li>
            <li>It really does clean teeth better than other brands.  </li>
            <li>it tastes good, does not break unless trapped, and the order was so much more economical than individually at the local stores...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite Floss and hard to find on the shelf, buying it here makes it easy to have it on hand.</li>
            <li>Rosa is the stuff your hygienist wants you to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no floss aficionado or anything, but I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>It is also much thinner than it used to be.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li>something i really needed</li>
            <li>The mint flavor is crisp and natural.</li>
            <li>Amazon is the new 1940s &amp;#34;sears catalog&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always floss, but when I do, I choose Reach Clean Burst Dental Floss, Waxed, Icy Spearmint, 55-Yard Dispensers (Pack of 12)</li>
            <li>I really like it opposed to the tiny thread stuff that breaks and cut your gums.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find this item at my local stores and similar product is way more expensive in the stores.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, I have also purchased a similar product under the &amp;#34;Equate&amp;#34; brand that is even worse.</li>
            <li>Decent deal compared to the local stores.</li>
            <li>The floss is thin enough to fit between the tight spaces and it leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>She suggested I floss first with any other floss, then use this.  </li>
            <li>It is a little sticky so it seems to pick up more food particles than other flosses I have used.</li>
            <li>The icy spearmint floss is not thin like the reg. mint version.  </li>
            <li>It has just the right thickness w/wax to floss comfortably without snagging, cutting gums.  </li>
            <li>It is strong, doesn&#x27;t leave fibers behind, and unlike some braided/woven types, does not cut my fingers off in the use of it.</li>
            <li>but this stuff is so slimy and slippery that you can&#x27;t hold on to it without first washing it with soap and then wiping it down with a dry towel.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite Floss and hard to find on the shelf, buying it here makes it easy to have it on hand.</li>
            <li> Rosa is the stuff your hygienist wants you to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no floss aficionado or anything, but I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> It is also much thinner than it used to be.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li> something i really needed</li>
            <li> The mint flavor is crisp and natural.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the new 1940s &amp;#34;sears catalog&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always floss, but when I do, I choose Reach Clean Burst Dental Floss, Waxed, Icy Spearmint, 55-Yard Dispensers (Pack of 12)</li>
            <li> I really like it opposed to the tiny thread stuff that breaks and cut your gums.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find this item at my local stores and similar product is way more expensive in the stores.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, I have also purchased a similar product under the &amp;#34;Equate&amp;#34; brand that is even worse.</li>
            <li> Decent deal compared to the local stores.</li>
            <li> The floss is thin enough to fit between the tight spaces and it leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> She suggested I floss first with any other floss, then use this.  </li>
            <li> It is a little sticky so it seems to pick up more food particles than other flosses I have used.</li>
            <li> The icy spearmint floss is not thin like the reg. mint version.  </li>
            <li> It has just the right thickness w/wax to floss comfortably without snagging, cutting gums.  </li>
            <li> It is strong, doesn&#x27;t leave fibers behind, and unlike some braided/woven types, does not cut my fingers off in the use of it.</li>
            <li> but this stuff is so slimy and slippery that you can&#x27;t hold on to it without first washing it with soap and then wiping it down with a dry towel.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums as much, but the little sharp thing that cuts the line tends to pop out.</li>
            <li> (strange it may seem but</li>
            <li> Been using it for over a year but getting harder to find locally for some reason.</li>
            <li> Other people who reviewed this product and panned it for various reasons need to  know what they are buying.  </li>
            <li> but when you wipe them off or let them dry the stickyness is gone.</li>
            <li> And finally because it is GREEN</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not stringy and doesn&#x27;t have a powder like some other floss I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> In addition it is wider or thicker than other floss which I want.  </li>
            <li> So I experimented with a couple of other flosses just to see</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy any other floss again.</li>
            <li> About a year and a half ago, I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores and ended up buying other varieties, which I didn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s not slippery like other brands&#x27; green flosses, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;Useful tips: pull out a 2-foot piece, then fold in half, and make a knot.</li>
            <li> do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note when my teeth were spaced tightly together this floss would not have been an option for me.  </li>
            <li> It doea tear a little in tight spots.</li>
            <li> I expended fuel looking for a little object like this on and off for a few months.</li>
            <li> Floss is green and minty taste.</li>
            <li> The floss is mint green color</li>
            <li> This floss (at least for me) does not split into threads when used between tight spaces.</li>
            <li> ; but i like this color better than just white.&lt;br /&gt;Cinnamon make me bored :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s so hard to find it in stores.</li>
            <li> that was just as thick.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews had me thinking that this stuff was so thick that I could never get it between my teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s minty flavor is subtle but still can leave your mouth smiling.</li>
            <li> Impossible to find locally.</li>
            <li> Also, it is not too thin and is not too thick.</li>
            <li> My Wife introduced me to this and for anyone that&#x27;s tough on floss</li>
            <li> (picture a piece of straw in a cowboy&#x27;s mouth), the ladies will go crazy!</li>
            <li> the cinnamon version, feels like there&#x27;s a bump at about every foot of floss which I hate</li>
            <li> but the smell is horrible and it splits into threads.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received this product on time, in good package and perfect condictions. It´s a excellent dental floss and my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have been using this floss for years and could no longer find it at my local stores. The floss is thin enough to fit between the tight spaces and it leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean. Use this every morning and occasionally after lunch, My hygienist always says I very good home care, my twice a year dental cleanings are quick and painless.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite floss, and I&#x27;ve tried many.  For some reason it is unavailable in local stores.</li>
            <li> It has the right size and feel for me and works great.  It doea tear a little in tight spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many floss brands.  Even within the J&amp;J floss family there are variations.  I like the Reach Clean-Burst mint the best. (strange it may seem but the cinnamon version, feels like there&#x27;s a bump at about every foot of floss which I hate and I can&#x27;t understand it).  The icy spearmint floss is not thin like the reg. mint version.  It has just the right thickness w/wax to floss comfortably without snagging, cutting gums.  The price is fair, great scent.  My favorite floss to date.  (I did try the more expensive ones by Tom of Maines and don&#x27;t like it.)</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Nice floss. I&#x27;ve used it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good to see amazon do bulk packs, but I get these for just under buck each at a very large discount store beginning with \\&quot;W\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Love having a supply for home and travel.  Always need floss.</li>
            <li> This is great floss and it seems to be becoming harder and harder to find these days. So happy I was able to get it here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dental hygienist and this is my fave floss!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best dental floss you can get. It&#x27;s thicker than glide and actually gets the plaque out between your teeth like it&#x27;s supposed to. It&#x27;s minty flavor is subtle but still can leave your mouth smiling. It&#x27;s not stringy and doesn&#x27;t have a powder like some other floss I&#x27;ve used that was just as thick. I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in stores anymore so will continue to buy it on line. So glad Amazon has it!</li>
            <li> Floss is very personal, isn&#x27;t it. This works well for me, in my over-crowded mouth. It is strong, doesn&#x27;t leave fibers behind, and unlike some braided/woven types, does not cut my fingers off in the use of it. The mint flavor is crisp and natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Reach floss for years and this type has been one of my favorites.  Excellent price and will order again.</li>
            <li> For me and I emphasize FOR ME...this product is ideal as I have spaces between my teeth.  Also I like the flavor as opposed to mint.  In addition it is wider or thicker than other floss which I want.  And finally because it is GREEN it shows the crud i remove when I floss as opposed to white floss products...I had no problem with shredding as I have spaces between by teeth as mentioned so it does not get caught. Other people who reviewed this product and panned it for various reasons need to  know what they are buying.  This is a great product and I will buy again in the future</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different brands and types of floss, the Reach Clean Burst Waxed Spearmint is my favorite by far.  It is thick and strong enough to stand up to a good flossing, has a great taste and smell, and is of very good quality.  It&#x27;s not always easy to find, so I buy it here in bulk.  A good quality product makes flossing a lot more enjoyable, so it&#x27;s worth it to buy the best.  Just wish I had discovered it sooner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always floss, but when I do, I choose Reach Clean Burst Dental Floss, Waxed, Icy Spearmint, 55-Yard Dispensers (Pack of 12)</li>
            <li> Killer deal and this is my favorite floss.</li>
            <li> This is the best floss out there. Can&#x27;t seem to find it in my local stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought these at a greatly reduced price. (I think they&#x27;re on clearance because Reach is being renamed to Listerine.) The product came quickly and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> A dental assistant told me this is the best on the market.  I agree.  She suggested I floss first with any other floss, then use this.  So I experimented with a couple of other flosses just to see and she was right.  Happy that Amazon carries it and hope they always do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note when my teeth were spaced tightly together this floss would not have been an option for me.  It would get caught between them.  Glide was a lifesaver for me just after getting my braces removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that my teeth shifted and I can use &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; floss I only use this one.</li>
            <li> I love this floss! It does make you fingers feel sticky but when you wipe them off or let them dry the stickyness is gone. This floss tastes great and cuts smoothly and easily on the little cutter. This floss (at least for me) does not split into threads when used between tight spaces. I enjoy using this floss. I recently bought CVS brand mint floss as I lost my Reach floss but the smell is horrible and it splits into threads. So I checked on amazon and bought this floss. Love it! I&#x27;ll never buy any other floss again.</li>
            <li> Love this. They leave a mint flavor in your mouth after use. Don&#x27;t fray and don&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> My Wife introduced me to this and for anyone that&#x27;s tough on floss this is really great without being harsh on your gums!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Better then GLIDE anyday.  All that texture and no shredding.  Rosa is the stuff your hygienist wants you to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no floss aficionado or anything, but I really like this stuff. It&#x27;s thin (which I prefer over the thicker dental \\&quot;tape,\\&quot; etc.), strong, comfortable to use, cuts easily and cleanly from the dispenser, and smells/tastes great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have discovered that if you let a 5-6\\&quot; piece dangle from your mouth when you&#x27;re out on the town (picture a piece of straw in a cowboy&#x27;s mouth), the ladies will go crazy! \\&quot;Oooh, you floss?\\&quot; they will say. \\&quot;Why, yes...yes, I do.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time. Love it. Great job thanks.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dental floss!  I&#x27;ve used it for years.  About a year and a half ago, I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores and ended up buying other varieties, which I didn&#x27;t like.  One day I searched Amazon.com for the heck of it, to see if they had it.  Lo and behold, they did!  I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am to have this floss again!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t leave without this dental floss.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Use it every day.  It does not break or shred</li>
            <li> This is my favorite floss. Over the years I&#x27;ve tried various types from various brands. Finally, after some experimentation, I&#x27;ve decided to stick to this one. Especially when I&#x27;ve found one at a local retailer for almost a dollar, I&#x27;ve just purchase a dozen of them right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavored feature helps to feel how deep did the floss go in between the tooth and the gum. Nice feeling. Also, it is not too thin and is not too thick. Just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Useful tips: pull out a 2-foot piece, then fold in half, and make a knot. Don&#x27;t use the the same portion on several teeth. Keep moving the work portion.</li>
            <li> This floss workd great for me. It is the only one I like.</li>
            <li> Fresh mint flavor. Strong floss. Easy to carry and easy to use dispenser. Quality product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast service.  Recommended A+++</li>
            <li> Excellent floss - good price!</li>
            <li> I am so glad to get this and try it. Some of the reviews had me thinking that this stuff was so thick that I could never get it between my teeth. My teeth are fairly close together, but evidently not as close as some persons.I really like it opposed to the tiny thread stuff that breaks and cut your gums. I have enough to last for a long/long time, but I would definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> Great dental floss with great flavor.. I like buying in bulk and the price is right! Minty taste that is great and my mouth is happy :)</li>
            <li> hello,&lt;br /&gt;  this cleanburst reach floss is the best... it tastes good, does not break unless trapped, and the order was so much more economical than individually at the local stores...only if you can find the product at local stores.  the delivery was super fast and we will certainly order from SUPPLIESPLUS again.  outstanding product and delivery...</li>
            <li> Good floss &amp; good price!</li>
            <li> I am always concerned about receiving counterfeit items on Amazon, but this dental floss is great. It doesn&#x27;t break or unravel and dependably does the job. I like not having to always buy floss at $2- $3 per unit.</li>
            <li> This is the only dental floss I use and have been using for years.  I love the flavor burst when using the floss.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Stocked up for the rest of the year.  I like the spearmint flavor and that it is waxed.</li>
            <li> Uam very pleased with the reach clean burst spearmint dental floss. I can no longer find it in the store so I ordered it through Amazon. Reach clean burst spearmint is a better floss because it is thicker and is able to catch the particles that are in between my teeth.  So I am able to floss better thank you so much</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this in the stores anymore I think they quit making it.  Floss is green and minty taste.</li>
            <li> Did not buy mine from Amazon but never again!  I think they have changed the waxing process and are using an oil instead but this stuff is so slimy and slippery that you can&#x27;t hold on to it without first washing it with soap and then wiping it down with a dry towel. It is also much thinner than it used to be.  To be fair, I have also purchased a similar product under the &amp;#34;Equate&amp;#34; brand that is even worse.</li>
            <li> The best floss I&#x27;ve used. Impossible to find locally.</li>
            <li> great product, great delivery service, I&#x27;m a happy camper.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier, I never have to go to Walgreens Again.  Also saved 40%!!</li>
            <li> My family love this Clean Burst Dental Floss.  The floss is mint green color so we can easily see the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; on the floss when flossing.  Also it&#x27;s not slippery like other brands&#x27; green flosses, so it&#x27;s easy to handle.  We used to purchase this product at Walmart, but they do not carry this item any longer.  I&#x27;m glad I could find this floss on Amazon, although the price is slightly higher than Walmart...</li>
            <li> I love the taste of this floss and how well it cleans. Unfortunately it&#x27;s so hard to find it in stores.</li>
            <li> I love this dental floss. It doesn&#x27;t separate, it&#x27;s waxed, so slides easily. Why, WHY did they take it off the shelves?</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased.  Good price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The right thickness, proper strength, easy grip, smooth comfort...and great tasting too.  Makes flossing a pleasure.</li>
            <li> I love this floss because it cleans my teeth without hurting my gums. It is easy to use without sacrificing cleanliness. My teeth look and feel clean after use.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done and the mint flavor is an added bonus. Doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums as much, but the little sharp thing that cuts the line tends to pop out.</li>
            <li> The best floss ever!  Never want to use any other kind or brand.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Great price!</li>
            <li> Good price. Works well.</li>
            <li> Greats price, arrived on time. Perfectly satisfied.</li>
            <li> This was an awesome deal!  I have not been able to find this item at my local stores and similar product is way more expensive in the stores.  This is very affordable, the shipping and service was amazing.  The product itself can not be beat!  It really does clean teeth better than other brands.  I am so happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dental floss and I could not find it at my local stores.  I stocked up!</li>
            <li> As advertised and recommended; this vendor is very efficient and easy to do business with.</li>
            <li> i love this flavor!&lt;br /&gt;i like &amp;#34;mint waxed&amp;#34; but i like this color better than just white.&lt;br /&gt;Cinnamon make me bored :(</li>
            <li> Received order on time and intact.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this kind of floss. It is a little sticky so it seems to pick up more food particles than other flosses I have used. It may shred a little compared to Glide, but the stickiness makes it seem superior.</li>
            <li> Exactly as stated. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Very good product that I have used for some years and many other flosses break because my teeth are very close together.  Like the flavor, and it works.  Good price and do not have to go to the store.</li>
            <li> This is the only dental floss I use. It is thicker and better.</li>
            <li> This floss had the right width. It also has a great taste. I like flossing with it.</li>
            <li> Very good. Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> only floss I will use.. thank the lord amazon stocks it!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this before and had not been able to find it in the local drug store any longer.  Very happy to get it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s floss. It works. Decent deal compared to the local stores.</li>
            <li> really excellent floss. used it for years than it disappeared from drug stores and wally mart. Replaced by store brands that sucked. Bought a dozen on amazon  or the same price I used to pay.  Amazon is the new 1940s &amp;#34;sears catalog&amp;#34; . I expended fuel looking for a little object like this on and off for a few months. Thanks amazon. Sounds like a commercial but this was one of the best buys I have made in months. something i really needed</li>
            <li> take it from a retired dental professional this great floss</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite Floss and hard to find on the shelf, buying it here makes it easy to have it on hand.</li>
            <li> Love this flavor.  Now I have enough to last till I have dentures.</li>
            <li> Been using it for over a year but getting harder to find locally for some reason. It does the job and tastes good at the same time.</li>
            <li> This product works the best for flavor and strength.</li>
