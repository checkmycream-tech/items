            <li> Product was exactly what I was expecting and came in a timely manor. I am a manicurist and will continue to order.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all falls off very easy wouldn&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and as described. Cures in 3 minutes in a 36 watt UV lamp. I have used IBD gels for years, and this was a great price.</li>
            <li> I have a home based business where I do nails out of, sometimes I need products quickly and I used this company to try it out.  I was inpressed with the product in the timely matter that it was delivered.  I would recommend this company to anyone.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Thanks A+</li>
            <li> Good product, I had used it for a while but wish it had been a little more pink, and therefore would cover the line from a tip better. great product if you are planning on using polish over it</li>
            <li> I was hoping I could save $30 every two weeks, but no such luck.  I&#x27;ve tried and tried and it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is not a clear pink, rather a translucent pink or more whitish pink. Other than that, its a great product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;IBD is a great  product!!</li>

            <li> Original and high quality item recieved, item was in good condition, I like it, and i will by more in future.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, the pink isnt super pigmented so it takes a couple of layers if you want it to look that way but this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great, easy-to-use gel! I wasn&#x27;t aware it needed to be cured with a UV light (I saw postings saying LED would work), but once I used the UV it cured smooth, shiny, and very quickly! Saves me a lot of money and trips to the salon</li>
            <li> wish the pink was a little more pink but still a great deal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first-time user and I just bought what my nail person used to use.  I think I&#x27;ll buy it again when the time comes</li>
            <li> I love this gel builder. I have very poor nails from having celiac disease. I would never have any length if I did not have this to build the nail. I also love the IBD gel nail forms to give the extender nail the perfect shape and desired length. I get about a week  out of them, but I am a nurse and my hands are always very hard working. Most people can get 2-3 weeks out of an extender set.</li>
            <li> Great works as expected</li>
