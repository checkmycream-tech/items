            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and it does foam.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser is great at that.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>This is a good cleanser that I would purchase again.  </li>
            <li>They have wisely found the use of the foaming pump for froth, rather than sodium sulfates/sulfites (chemicals).  </li>
            <li>It is a light foaming cleanser with a wonderful citrus scent.</li>
            <li>but I am very glad I did.  </li>
            <li>First, the smell is great!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used plenty of cleansers over the years--way too many to count!</li>
            <li>Amazing products.  </li>
            <li>Makes skin bright and more even.  </li>

            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>But honestly - it feels like water.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser does a wonderful job of removing makeup and grime without stripping the skin of vital moisture.  </li>
            <li>Almost everything I have purchased from this line has been amazing, and love this cleanser as well.</li>
            <li>It comes out foamy and it gets most of the make-up off, but I don&#x27;t think it brightens the skin any.</li>
            <li>Ehh, it doesn&#x27;t brighten that&#x27;s for sure..</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>, I prefer the scrub mask and use that more often.  </li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>love how my skin looks afterwards......</li>

            <li>- I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up and feel that I look better now that I use this.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this line of products and am looking for an exfoliating cleanser for them that would maybe address the scars and anti-aging.</li>
            <li>Cleans my skin and takes off makeup for the most part.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>:)</li>

            <li>product specifically is pretty good -</li>
            <li>Takes most makeup off really easily.  </li>
            <li>Foams up from a quarter size squirt, did I mention rinses clean!</li>
            <li>My skin looks perfect and i don&#x27;t know if it is because of the cleanser or because of other factors</li>
            <li>Has a strong lemony smell which I love, and really does effectively brighten the skin tone.</li>
            <li>Smells fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>I bought the Avon Luminosity and quickly realized that a gel substance may not be the thing I need to solve a skin problem!  </li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic and it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>Its gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and its amazing at night because it removes your makeup gently.</li>
            <li>Enjoy life.</li>
            <li>Love the ingredients, fresh energizing scent..</li>
            <li>It is so light and works so well.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and super clean feel from this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It almost does not lather, wich i think that is what makes it to great, because strong soap dry your skin,</li>
            <li>First off, I love this company.  </li>
            <li>Mild and rinses so clean, great facial wash.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this product got my skin really clean or removed all of my make-up.</li>
            <li>I use it with a sisal washcloth for a polished clean.  </li>
            <li>It smells like citrus and makes my face so clean.</li>
            <li>This is truly the best natural facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin</li>
            <li>Nothing special.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is 100% pure of toxic chemicals that is harmful to my skin.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and as far as I can tell</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and 100 natural.  </li>
            <li>I feel this cleanser really did brighten my skin and make me seem more awake</li>
            <li>Nice natural products</li>
            <li>I have super oily skin and am prone to break outs.</li>
            <li>This is a super product.</li>
            <li>It has a refreshing citrus smell, and it leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I love the natural ingredients, too!</li>
            <li>Highly worth the money in order to treat your skin well and take care of yourself.</li>
            <li>It brightened my dark spots and definitely gave my skin a wonderful glow.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and tend to break out easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for sensitive skin and does the trick nicely!</li>
            <li>YAY for 100% Pure products.</li>
            <li>has absolutely nothing harmful or chemical in it at all.  </li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t really put any in a travel size to take with you.</li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser -</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone to use this product!</li>
            <li>I cleans the makeup very well.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light lemon scent that lingers for only a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>The foam does not get very sudsy because it does not contain the chemical ingredients to do so</li>
            <li>% pure is my new go to company for skin care, make-up, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love how light and fluffy it is, but I feel like I have to use several pumps to feel it on my face.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this anymore!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 47 and have spent 1000 and 1000 of dollars on skin care products, this cleanser is by far my FAVORITE.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have found I can use every single 100% pure product I have tried with success.  </li>
            <li>so I was a bit worried about trying something new</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of 100 pure!</li>
            <li>it also doesn&#x27;t help clear up my skin whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Really like this as a daily cleanser!  </li>
            <li>Roche Posay Effaclar Dual Action Acene treatement (5.5% benzoyl peroxide) on problem</li>
            <li>Perhaps that is the trade off for a natural safer product.  </li>
            <li>and I suggest  this to my friends and family who need an all natural cleanser ...</li>
            <li>but I really really like the smell and overall feel of this product.</li>
            <li>I also have the SPF face cream and that goes on thick and white...but seems to be ok even though I don&#x27;t wear foundation it eventually blends or fades.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is very gentle on my normal/dry skin and after using it a few times, my skin does look a little brighter, very clean and soft!</li>
            <li>Yes, it does dry your skin, but to me, that&#x27;s how I know it&#x27;s really getting into the pores!  </li>
            <li>I love the subtle smell.  </li>
            <li>On a side note:If you wear heavy makeup or have oily skin it may take two washes to get all the makeup off and clean skin</li>
            <li>but with this one face feels soft and no dry at all.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry and tight and I enjoy the citrus smell.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it really cleans well and leaves my face feeling soft &amp; hydrated without the use of harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I would need to follow up with another cleanser to make sure my skin didn&#x27;t have any dirt or residue left behind.</li>
            <li>That includes other all natural or sensitive skin products (like Aveeno, Tarte, Clinique, etc).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Whether you are looking for an all natural product or not I highly recommend this product.  </li>

            <li> Whether you are looking for an all natural product or not I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me, since it&#x27;s all natural it expires a lot faster than other cleansers.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure how much I like that either.</li>
            <li> Another plus it last a long time!</li>
            <li> It left my skin dry after washing.</li>
            <li> A single bottle lasts me ( and my husband - he uses this once daily )</li>
            <li> I also recently had a baby and due to lack of sleep, am looking pretty dull.</li>
            <li> I cleans all your make up off without leaving your skin dry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or give any reactions.  </li>
            <li> A single pump does the job</li>
            <li> It is also fading my dark marks left from acne.</li>
            <li> Only down side is its a foam</li>
            <li> The foam makes it less messy and it never irritates my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These are cons when compared to other facial cleansers but being that it is so natural and pure, it is to be expected and not at all a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> I use it about every other day because it&#x27;s a foam and that can sometimes be drying.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have oily/combination skin with pretty bad acne that I keep at bay with prescription topical creams.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this just didn&#x27;t really seem to work.</li>
            <li> This product penetrates down to the pores and gets rid of dirt and oil.</li>
            <li> It removes makeup well without all the harsh chemicals that other products have.  </li>
            <li> Since I am dark skinned, my blemishes were practically black!  </li>
            <li> but that is a little inconvenience compared to the benefits.  </li>
            <li> I use the cleanser on the problem areas and I have noticed my dark spots fading!  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ever go wrong with 100% natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> but this cleanser is erasing all evidence of trouble skin.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I feel about the foaming pump after being used to lathering soaps in the past.</li>
            <li> Though the product delivery was prompt, it was not great as I expected.</li>
            <li> Hard to believe there is any soap in this at all.  </li>
            <li> regularly (at least 10-30 mins</li>

            <li> Does not break out my case like all the others do!</li>
            <li> Nothing special.  It comes out foamy and it gets most of the make-up off, but I don&#x27;t think it brightens the skin any.</li>
            <li> Great product  and shipping</li>
            <li> I adore this cleanser.  It smells amazing and as far as I can tell has absolutely nothing harmful or chemical in it at all.  My skin loves it.  Takes most makeup off really easily.  Sometimes I have to wash my eyes a second time to get all the eye makeup off, no big deal.  I can&#x27;t live without this anymore!</li>
            <li> First off, I love this company.  Amazing products.  This cleanser does a wonderful job of removing makeup and grime without stripping the skin of vital moisture.  I feel like it really cleans well and leaves my face feeling soft &amp; hydrated without the use of harsh chemicals.  I love the subtle smell.  And, you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I highly recommend this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Ehh, it doesn&#x27;t brighten that&#x27;s for sure.. it also doesn&#x27;t help clear up my skin whatsoever. very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I cleans all your make up off without leaving your skin dry. The smell is fantastic and it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have found I can use every single 100% pure product I have tried with success.  Not one of them has caused a reaction... and understand that 99% of products I try cause a rash/hives/a break out of some sort.  That includes other all natural or sensitive skin products (like Aveeno, Tarte, Clinique, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% pure is my new go to company for skin care, make-up, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product specifically is pretty good - I don&#x27;t feel I need it though, I prefer the scrub mask and use that more often.  I use this just in the sink to remove make up if I&#x27;m not gonna hop in the shower.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  Whether you are looking for an all natural product or not I highly recommend this product.  It removes makeup well without all the harsh chemicals that other products have.  It also works well with the toner made by 100 Percent.  On a side note:If you wear heavy makeup or have oily skin it may take two washes to get all the makeup off and clean skin well but that is a little inconvenience compared to the benefits.  Another plus it last a long time!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> This is a good cleanser that I would purchase again.  It&#x27;s gentle enough for sensitive skin and does the trick nicely!</li>
            <li> This cleanser is really excellent. It has a refreshing citrus smell, and it leaves my skin feeling clean and soft. I love the natural ingredients, too! Great product!</li>
            <li> love how my skin looks afterwards...... love that it is made with cleaner ingredients so will be buying this on a regular basis</li>
            <li> Mild and rinses so clean, great facial wash. Foams up from a quarter size squirt, did I mention rinses clean!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ever go wrong with 100% natural ingredients.  No complains at all.  Great product.  Zero chemicals.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me, since it&#x27;s all natural it expires a lot faster than other cleansers. Smells nice.</li>
            <li> Really like this as a daily cleanser!  Makes skin bright and more even.  Almost like it exfoliated the skin.  Will continues to use it.  Only down side is its a foam so you can&#x27;t really put any in a travel size to take with you.</li>
            <li> This stuff works.  I have sensitive skin and tend to break out easily so I was a bit worried about trying something new but I am very glad I did.  It takes off all of my make up, has not made me break out (I have been using it for almost two months now) and leaves my skin with a nice glow.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product got my skin really clean or removed all of my make-up.</li>
            <li> Its gentle and effective. Has a strong lemony smell which I love, and really does effectively brighten the skin tone. I use it twice a day and its amazing at night because it removes your makeup gently.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and 100 natural.  I will definitely purchase again.  It brightened my dark spots and definitely gave my skin a wonderful glow.</li>
            <li> I have honestly tried every product in the store. I really like this cleanser - it smells great and does a wonderful job of cleaning my face both morning and night. I have super oily skin and am prone to break outs. I also recently had a baby and due to lack of sleep, am looking pretty dull. I feel this cleanser really did brighten my skin and make me seem more awake - I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up and feel that I look better now that I use this. I should add that I use it with the clarisonic skin brush. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will be doing more research on this brand!</li>
            <li> I used this product for one day, went to work and immediately my co-worker commented on my face looking \\&quot;brighter\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;wow. I use it about every other day because it&#x27;s a foam and that can sometimes be drying.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this line of products and am looking for an exfoliating cleanser for them that would maybe address the scars and anti-aging.</li>
            <li> Great ingredients!  Cleans my skin and takes off makeup for the most part.  Gave it 4 stars because I have to wash my eyes 3 times before it will get off all the mascara.  Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cleanser. First, the smell is great! Second, I have noticed that my skin is clearing up after about a week of use. I&#x27;ve had problems with breakouts for years but this cleanser is erasing all evidence of trouble skin. This product penetrates down to the pores and gets rid of dirt and oil. It is also fading my dark marks left from acne. I pair it with this regimen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-La Roche Posay Effaclar Dual Action Acene treatement (5.5% benzoyl peroxide) on problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;-Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated and remove toxins from body.&lt;br /&gt;-Exercise regularly (at least 10-30 mins a day)&lt;br /&gt;-Stop stressing. Enjoy life. It&#x27;s a blessing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is just the icing on the cake! It removes makeup perfectly as well! Big PLUS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly hope this cleanser never gets discontinued. It is now my staple and hasnt stopped working yet! YAY for 100% Pure products. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 47 and have spent 1000 and 1000 of dollars on skin care products, this cleanser is by far my FAVORITE.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry and tight and I enjoy the citrus smell.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I really love this company and this is another of my favorites from them.  They have wisely found the use of the foaming pump for froth, rather than sodium sulfates/sulfites (chemicals).  I love the scent and super clean feel from this cleanser.  I use it with a sisal washcloth for a polished clean.  Can&#x27;t express my gratitude for this product enough.</li>
            <li> Smells fine. Works fine. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or give any reactions.  Not sure how I feel about the foaming pump after being used to lathering soaps in the past. Perhaps that is the trade off for a natural safer product.  The body washes have the same pump and I&#x27;m not sure how much I like that either. The body lotions are amazing though, I have the honey almond one. Yummy! I like the coffee bean eye cream a lot.  I also have the SPF face cream and that goes on thick and white...but seems to be ok even though I don&#x27;t wear foundation it eventually blends or fades.</li>
            <li> love how light and fluffy it is, but I feel like I have to use several pumps to feel it on my face.</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients, fresh energizing scent.. I use it to remove makeup and cleanse each night &amp; look forward to it. The foam makes it less messy and it never irritates my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this just didn&#x27;t really seem to work. My skin always felt unclean afterwards because it literally was! I would need to follow up with another cleanser to make sure my skin didn&#x27;t have any dirt or residue left behind.</li>
            <li> This is a super product. It smells like citrus and makes my face so clean. Wonderful. I didn&#x27;t realize it was a foam when it comes out. Marvelous</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I read the reviews. Though the product delivery was prompt, it was not great as I expected. It left my skin dry after washing.</li>
            <li> This is truly the best natural facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin and I&#x27;ve used plenty of cleansers over the years--way too many to count! This cleanser is very gentle on my normal/dry skin and after using it a few times, my skin does look a little brighter, very clean and soft! I love the fact that it is 100% pure of toxic chemicals that is harmful to my skin. I highly recommend it to anyone to use this product!</li>
            <li> I did not want chemicals on my cleanser and so I got this a year back  with no expectations ... Since then it has got me hooked ... A single bottle lasts me ( and my husband - he uses this once daily ) three months .. A single pump does the job and I love love love the smell and feel of it .. I am gonna continue using this and I suggest  this to my friends and family who need an all natural cleanser ...</li>
            <li> Nice natural products</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the foam dispenser. Just started using it last week.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and it does foam.  But honestly - it feels like water.  Hard to believe there is any soap in this at all.  I&#x27;ve used it to wash my face and got the same results as if using water alone.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Love this. It is a foam cleanser. It almost does not lather, wich i think that is what makes it to great, because strong soap dry your skin, but with this one face feels soft and no dry at all. I cleans the makeup very well.</li>
            <li> I bought the Avon Luminosity and quickly realized that a gel substance may not be the thing I need to solve a skin problem!  This cleanser smells like lemonade and comes out foamy.  Since I am dark skinned, my blemishes were practically black!  I use the cleanser on the problem areas and I have noticed my dark spots fading!  Yes, it does dry your skin, but to me, that&#x27;s how I know it&#x27;s really getting into the pores!  It&#x27;s a cleanser, not an all in one skin solution.  I will definitely keeps this is stock!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of 100 pure! Almost everything I have purchased from this line has been amazing, and love this cleanser as well. It is a light foaming cleanser with a wonderful citrus scent.</li>
            <li> I have oily/combination skin with pretty bad acne that I keep at bay with prescription topical creams.  Because these acne medications are so harsh, I need a face wash that will keep oil at bay but still be gentle enough for daily use.  This cleanser is great at that.  It has a nice light lemon scent that lingers for only a few minutes.  The foam does not get very sudsy because it does not contain the chemical ingredients to do so and it is only supposed to last 6 months since it doesnt have the synthetic preservatives to make it last years.  These are cons when compared to other facial cleansers but being that it is so natural and pure, it is to be expected and not at all a bad thing.  Highly worth the money in order to treat your skin well and take care of yourself.</li>
            <li> This is my third order of this cleanser. It is so light and works so well. My skin looks perfect and i don&#x27;t know if it is because of the cleanser or because of other factors but I really really like the smell and overall feel of this product.</li>
