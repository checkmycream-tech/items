            <li>My favorite lotion of all time!!!!</li>
            <li>The Pacifica brand is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>Best body/hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Smells delightful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
            <li>This is the best body butter!  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s not the best moisturiser I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the best I can say.  </li>
            <li>This is so moisturizing and smells great.  </li>
            <li>$50.&lt;br /&gt;I use almost all of their products, and am happy with all but one.  </li>
            <li>great moisturizer, amazing fragrance!</li>
            <li>It smells pleasantly like sunscreen but without the added carcinogenic chemicals.</li>
            <li>It smells so good</li>
            <li>People always tell me I smell so good.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to leave a rating for the Island Vanilla scent, so I&#x27;ll leave it here: Uck!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>The scent is great and it absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Really nice stuff.</li>
            <li>Once the lotion is on, it does dissipate and smells really nice.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves it on me, which is good.  :)</li>
            <li>So nice and creamy.</li>
            <li>Pacifica is by far the best brand out there for vegan organic products.  </li>
            <li>just as effective that is so delightful to apply and smells simply divine.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d read the information more closely before I purchased.  </li>
            <li>This however, seems more like something you would find at a Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li>OKAY.</li>
            <li>I love pacifica products and was looking to see if I could find them cheaper here.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of coconut</li>
            <li>I love this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is a nice, light coconut-vanilla and not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It also smells kind of cheap and doesn&#x27;t rub in as well.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The scent is like toasted coconuts; it&#x27;s delicious and lingers for a very long time.</li>
            <li>All of the flavors with the exception of Indian Coconut can be simply described as DELICIOUS and unique.</li>
            <li>The vanilla is overpowered by a strong, perfumed musk-like scent that made me sneeze and gave me a headache almost immediately.</li>
            <li>You need to buy it either at Sprout&#x27;s (if you have them nearby) or Whole Foods, or better yet on the Pacifica website, as they have deals, and give free samples if you spend $30, and free shipping with</li>
            <li>This lotion is fairly thick, and has a fabulous, delicious scent.  </li>
            <li>On the whole I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>It is sickeningly sweet and plasticky-smelling.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll start the day with my other better moisturisers, but still carry this with me to top up during the day as I love the scent</li>
            <li>my skin feels very soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Love Pacifica and the fact that they are all natural and vegan.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a wonderful sweet, but not cloying scent, and it is very non irritating.</li>
            <li>It smells good, like coconuts for sure, but there&#x27;s a bit of a strange smell mixed in it as well</li>
            <li>I really love this brand and am so glad to have found it a few dollars cheaper here.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin and most lotions dry me out even more.</li>
            <li>It offers great moisture without feeling oily or greasy like other body butters.</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth and soft and using the body butter.  </li>
            <li>So moisturizing, such a lovely product.</li>
            <li>Well all of their large lotions are$15 on their site and if you sign up you get e-mail offers and can get free stuff or knock like 20% off.  </li>
            <li>I had to give it away because my hubby is pretty much deathly allergic to mango, but that was my fault.  </li>
            <li>Love the fragrance with the coconut and shea butter combination; it&#x27;s light, but definitely reminds you of days at the beach, maybe with a pina colata mixed in.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is so gentle that it doesn&#x27;t both mel.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>But, if you&#x27;re prone to crocodile skin levels of dryness like me, this shouldn&#x27;t be your main moisturiser.</li>
            <li>Warning if you or someone you live with is allergic to mango; this contains mango butter.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First I will say that I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Absolutely love the scent and feel of this lotion and definitely looking into other Pacifica products!</li>
            <li>For a period of time I had to schmear on straight shea butter because it was the only thing that did the job.</li>
            <li>So far I have no complains and</li>
            <li>(Their natural soap wasn&#x27;t for me)&lt;br /&gt;I am addicted to this scent, and to this brand, and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>I have recently learned to love Pacifica&#x27;s body butters (mainly the French Lilac and Hawaiian Ruby Guava), but the Indian Coconut Nectar is a little disappointing--especially for how pricey it is.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick but completely non-greasy, and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth for hours.</li>
            <li>Just about all lotion irritates my skin, so I can especially forget about finding scented lotion that will be gentle enough.</li>
            <li>Nice, thick and moisurizing!!</li>
            <li>if you have normal to slightly dry skin, this will be a dream.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way too, so it is worth the price.</li>

            <li> My favorite lotion of all time!!!! So moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Really nice stuff. Scent reminiscent of the beach.</li>
            <li> Love it! Nice, thick and moisurizing!!</li>
            <li> This review is for the Indian Coconut Nectar scent. This stuff is amazing. I have very dry skin and have to wash my hands several times a day so I was desperately in need of a very rich, thick lotion that wouldn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling greasy or wet and slick after use. The Pacifica brand is perfect for me. It&#x27;s thick but completely non-greasy, and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth for hours. The scent is like toasted coconuts; it&#x27;s delicious and lingers for a very long time. I just love it. It smells so good I want to eat it! I wasn&#x27;t able to leave a rating for the Island Vanilla scent, so I&#x27;ll leave it here: Uck! The vanilla is overpowered by a strong, perfumed musk-like scent that made me sneeze and gave me a headache almost immediately. Even my husband hated it. Stick with the Indian Coconut scent and avoid the vanilla!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It smells pleasantly like sunscreen but without the added carcinogenic chemicals.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Best body/hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used. Smells delightful.</li>
            <li> This is so moisturizing and smells great.  I wish I&#x27;d read the information more closely before I purchased.  Warning if you or someone you live with is allergic to mango; this contains mango butter.  I had to give it away because my hubby is pretty much deathly allergic to mango, but that was my fault.  I wish I could use it without risking his life.  It&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
            <li> This stuff does wonders for my extremely dry skin. Seriously, I have about the driest skin ever. For a period of time I had to schmear on straight shea butter because it was the only thing that did the job. But straight shea is rather messy and sticky, so I&#x27;m relieved to find something just as effective that is so delightful to apply and smells simply divine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all flavors under the Pacifica label. All of the flavors with the exception of Indian Coconut can be simply described as DELICIOUS and unique. This however, seems more like something you would find at a Bath and Body Works. OKAY.</li>
            <li> I love pacifica products and was looking to see if I could find them cheaper here.  Well all of their large lotions are$15 on their site and if you sign up you get e-mail offers and can get free stuff or knock like 20% off.

            <li> This is the best body butter!  My skin is so smooth and soft and using the body butter.  My boyfirend loves the feel of my skin.  The scent lasts too!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of coconut and I decided to try this only because it caught my eye at Target!&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love the scent and feel of this lotion and definitely looking into other Pacifica products! So far I have no complains and my skin feels very soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;First I will say that I have very sensitive skin and I can&#x27;t use products with fragrance. A friend gave this to me as a gift so I decided to try it. The fragrance is so gentle that it doesn&#x27;t both mel. I have used this numerous times with no skin irritation at all. It offers great moisture without feeling oily or greasy like other body butters.</li>
            <li> So moisturizing, such a lovely product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Just about all lotion irritates my skin, so I can especially forget about finding scented lotion that will be gentle enough. This lotion has a wonderful sweet, but not cloying scent, and it is very non irritating. A little goes a long way too, so it is worth the price.</li>

            <li> Very moisturizing. The scent is a nice, light coconut-vanilla and not too overpowering. I really love this brand and am so glad to have found it a few dollars cheaper here. I also like the Island Vanilla scent, which is a stronger smelling vanilla than this one.</li>
            <li> Pacifica is by far the best brand out there for vegan organic products.  No animal testing either.  This lotion is fairly thick, and has a fabulous, delicious scent.  It makes your skin look younger than it is too.  I love it.  I would not purchase it on here though.  You need to buy it either at Sprout&#x27;s (if you have them nearby) or Whole Foods, or better yet on the Pacifica website, as they have deals, and give free samples if you spend $30, and free shipping with $50.&lt;br /&gt;I use almost all of their products, and am happy with all but one.  (Their natural soap wasn&#x27;t for me)&lt;br /&gt;I am addicted to this scent, and to this brand, and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  Only body butter for me.</li>
            <li> On the whole I&#x27;m pleased with this product. The scent is great and it absorbs easily. However, it&#x27;s not the best moisturiser I&#x27;ve had. Usually within 30-60mins my skin is starting to dry again. So I&#x27;ll start the day with my other better moisturisers, but still carry this with me to top up during the day as I love the scent so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have normal to slightly dry skin, this will be a dream. But, if you&#x27;re prone to crocodile skin levels of dryness like me, this shouldn&#x27;t be your main moisturiser.</li>
            <li> I have recently learned to love Pacifica&#x27;s body butters (mainly the French Lilac and Hawaiian Ruby Guava), but the Indian Coconut Nectar is a little disappointing--especially for how pricey it is.  I almost feel like the bottle I got was a knock-off or something.  The bottle feels different, and the cap is different than the other bottles I have.  It also smells kind of cheap and doesn&#x27;t rub in as well.  It is sickeningly sweet and plasticky-smelling.  Not a fan of this one.</li>
            <li> Love Pacifica and the fact that they are all natural and vegan. I wanted to love this coconut smell as I&#x27;m obsessed with the scent.  It smells good, like coconuts for sure, but there&#x27;s a bit of a strange smell mixed in it as well that I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on.  Almost like play doh, that&#x27;s the best I can say.  Once the lotion is on, it does dissipate and smells really nice.  My boyfriend loves it on me, which is good.  :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! People always tell me I smell so good. A bit pricey but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and I like that she smells like the beach.</li>
            <li> So nice and creamy. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance with the coconut and shea butter combination; it&#x27;s light, but definitely reminds you of days at the beach, maybe with a pina colata mixed in.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves the smell of it, smells like the beach!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and most lotions dry me out even more. This is the only one that hasn&#x27;t! Will continue to order it over and over!</li>
