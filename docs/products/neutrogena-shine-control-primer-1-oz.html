    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This product is awesome, even for darker skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best primer I have used.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Bottom line-a great primer for the price!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Great for under eyes, too!  </li>
            <li>I thought because of the cost it would be awesome.</li>
            <li>The BEST for day use cream#.</li>
            <li>Then I mix Revlon Colorstay foundation with my Dermalogica foundation and that creates the perfect makeup for my combination skin and oil.</li>
            <li>me, this primer is a perfect dupe for Pop Beauty&#x27;s Face Magnet Primer.</li>
            <li>That was a joy and it seemed to bring out the best in the foundation.</li>
            <li>I bought this primer after reading not so great reviews.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, it does give a really great matte finish that workS in two ways.  </li>
            <li>But now I&#x27;m so happy</li>
            <li>It was very nice.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying my own tube!</li>
            <li>The the best part was not having to reapply powder midday:)</li>
            <li>so I did research and found that primers were the latest and greatest.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not surprisingly, I haven&#x27;t been successful.  </li>
            <li>I use Neutrogena Shine Control Rice Protein powder on top to set it as its very good for that.</li>
            <li>It is a good substitute.</li>
            <li>which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>or so then it is a good compromise.  </li>
            <li>and so I bought Revlons Coverstay Cream foundation too, since Ally had good things to say and if you watch her blogs, you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
            <li>I love this primer!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Love that girl!    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Make-up goes on nicely and seems to \\&quot;stick\\&quot; longer.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I try this primer and works great.</li>
            <li>I do have very light skin (see my profile photo to get an idea of my skin tone).  </li>
            <li>I see Neutrogena makes a Healthy Skin primer with SPF, but reviews say it&#x27;s oily.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li>I also work at Mcdonalds which makes my face even more oily.</li>
            <li>I was skeptic at using this product, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>It also held my makeup together much better than without it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re planning to purchase this product to wear without applying foundation over it afterwards you better be Casper the ghost.</li>
            <li>use it over my moisturizer as a primer/light foundation for day to day, or over moisturizer and under my foundation for more dressy occasions.</li>
            <li>I love how my make up looked on this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>I am sure it does what it is suppose to do</li>
            <li>My latest purchase was Neutrogena&#x27;s Shine Control.  </li>
            <li>Although it performs better than a couple of others I have tried (which couldn&#x27;t even qualify as mattifiers at all)</li>
            <li>If you pay any more than that</li>
            <li>I find that it blends better when you put it on over moisturizer.</li>
            <li>just make sure you don&#x27;t put on anything moisturizing after the primer.</li>
            <li>While, it worked better than most products I still saw some oilyness.</li>
            <li>Although I wish they had it in a bigger amount, I&#x27;am happy about my purchase!</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After about 3-4 hours, I do see some shine coming through, mostly on my nose.  </li>
            <li>After a couple more hours, I start to see shine on my forehead as well as my nose.  </li>
            <li>I still have to use a couple of blotting papers throughout the day (maybe not as many as before).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Dermalogica, Lancomb, Murad,and Jan Marini, so I am used to using the better brands but with the recession, I have not been able to afford those anymore.    </li>
            <li>I decided to read up on reviews on Amazon #love Amazon# for primers</li>
            <li>But Maybelline primer was better than Neutrogena&#x27;s.    </li>
            <li>Then I splurged on L&#x27;Oreal because the teller said it was her favorite.</li>
            <li>and then I added a tad more to fill in the pores and let that sit for a moment.</li>
            <li>Love that stuff</li>
            <li>Love it.    </li>
            <li>ONE MORE THING..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>(which is my all-time favorite primer)</li>
            <li>you love the Pop Beauty Face Magnet Primer</li>
            <li>This is great if your main concern is shine.  </li>
            <li>I tried this primer and so far it seems to be working great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a lotion which doesn&#x27;t make applying your make-up with a foundation brush easy.</li>
            <li>I was just as shiny and makeup wore off just as easily as without it.</li>
            <li>Compact and easy to carry on trips.</li>
            <li>However, if you buy the Neutrogena product here on Amazon for $25 then you might as well pay $4 more and buy Philosophy&#x27;s far superior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, and it does a nice job of keeping my skin pretty matte for the day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like a really fine sandpaper going on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with the smell of this product &amp; it does exactly what its supposed too!</li>
            <li>My skin tone is a light olive.  </li>
            <li>( using neutrogena oil free foundation and powder with it btw)</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic and it is not drying to my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>After it dries the grittiness is gone and smooth.</li>
            <li>This will give you light coverage and a matte finish.  </li>
            <li>My skin stayed oil free, however the make up still had some separation around the circumference of my pores</li>
            <li>B004S0YSFG Mini Original Face Primer]].  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the Avon and had doubts that anything else would work on my super, super oily skin.</li>
            <li>I have used many primers, including Clarins beauty balm and Smashbox camera ready, to name a couple.</li>
            <li>but my skin is quite fair, so this might be different for medium or darker skin tones.</li>
            <li>onto my story: I let the primer soak for 2minutes this time and applied Colorstay Cream in Sand Beige and Natural Beige and boy did it apply nicely.</li>
            <li>but I will blame that on Colorstay since it is a full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin silky smooth, completely erases fine lines, AND pores!  </li>
            <li>i got this in store if you have oily face always having to powder because your make up is super shiny because of your oily face i recommend you don&#x27;t buy this because it does nothing your face will still be oily weather</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I do go on a fairly vigorous walk with my dog at lunch time and climb 8 flights of stairs to get back to the office, so I am taking part in activities that may lead to increased shine.  </li>
            <li>It also dries super</li>
            <li>The first options is to put this with your moisturizer and smooth it on in the morning.  </li>
            <li>it is not as good as Philosophy&#x27;s product by a long shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried it twice and found that it really does a great job keeping my face from looking shiny all day long.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider my skin super sensitive or anything, but at the same time I had the image of neutrogena products being pretty good for most skin types.</li>
            <li>Either by itself or under foundation it really does wonders to keep my skin looking matte throughout the day which is HUGE for me because of how oily my skin is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope this review helps others who are looking for an oil free and oil controlling primer that lasts the whole day.  </li>
            <li>The second way that works well is to mix moisturizer, primer, and foundation on your hand and apply it to your face as your own tinted beauty balm.  </li>
            <li>and she is right</li>
            <li>Normally a primer would allow for a smooth make-up application.</li>
            <li>So today I went back to an old standard foundation that is the best in my book: Dermalogica Treatment Foundation in 1g.</li>
            <li>The grittiness didn&#x27;t bother me so much, but by 11am I already had shininess on my T-zone!</li>
            <li>First off, it doesn&#x27;t feel like a primer.</li>
            <li>Will buy more definitely</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve had that experience</li>
            <li>The more you blend with your fingers, its gritty consistency pills, so</li>
            <li>To it&#x27;s mattifying powers, it works pretty well, but not for 8 continuous hours.</li>
            <li>this product really helps!</li>
            <li>The next time I applied it, I put some on my finger tips and worked it into my T-zone, focusing on where I know I have the most issues.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>on my nose and forehead, it dries immediately and will last 12 hours or more.  </li>
            <li>This applies almost as heavily as a sunscreen and does not spread easily, meaning you have to use much more product than is desired when it comes to primer.</li>
            <li>I was even more amazed when I finishes my shift and my face pretty much looked the same as it did during my break.</li>
            <li>It is white, as most primers are, and best used underneath foundation of some sort, because it doesn&#x27;t get dry clear like other primers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I have a lot of problems with breakouts, and most of popular brands of makeup make that worse.</li>
            <li>Its a truly good product and remember that a very little bit of this product is all you need.</li>
            <li>I lost my shiny nose which is great, but I was hoping my makeup would stay on for longer, I will try the other Neutrogena primer next time</li>
            <li>I found [...] who recommends certain drug store brands too</li>
            <li>What others have written is accurate - the product does come out as a white lotion....</li>
            <li>I can use a touchup mid-day, but overall, it&#x27;s a huge improvement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly; none of the gritty feel that others have mentioned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m also very prone to breakouts</li>
            <li>and it really gets the job done.</li>
            <li>but when rubbing it in it was very gritty and didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>It really really dries out my face and makes me break out though.</li>
            <li>and this really did it for me.</li>
            <li>This improved my skin so much that I no longer need a moisturizer during the day time hours</li>
            <li>For those of you who really have oily skin, this product does not work.</li>
            <li>Really controls the shine like nothing else I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>so, again, care must be taken to not use too much  3)  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>My experience has been that it&#x27;s very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used L&#x27;Oreal primer and it really had no effect on my makeup whatsoever.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I get a really oily t-zone throughout the day and it really helps to minimize that.</li>
            <li>but this really helps my make up stay longer and helps control my shine.</li>
            <li>I am curious to know what others think or if there are even better products, but after a week</li>
            <li>or so I am really liking this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really testing the limits of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>like I had a really crappy mask on.</li>
            <li>There is something in Dermalogica&#x27;s ingrediants that prevent the pores from showing much and so</li>
            <li>, it works really well.</li>
            <li>So I didn&#x27;t really expect much from this primer.</li>
            <li>This primer is very lightweight.</li>
            <li>I wear it bare if I&#x27;m going out somewhere quickly.</li>
            <li>It really keeps the shine down for hours, I like it more than the powder</li>
            <li>In a world where people just want to rush you to purchase, Calamity Jane took the time to make my purchase extra special.  </li>
            <li>Hope this helps for my dark people &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>main downsides to the Neutrogena product are:  1)  </li>
            <li>The foundation did not separate around the circumference of my pores and my face was &#x27;dewey&#x27; and vibrant.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a white silicon based primer, so it comes out white and finishes pretty light.</li>
            <li>I use a VERY light coat (just a few drops)</li>
            <li>This one performs just as well as the high end version.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend you give this one</li>
            <li>I will say that it does manage oil levels in my t-zone a significant amount, but the downsides are far too vast in comparison to that fact.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time if used right!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a ton of primers before and this is the first that has really worked not only as a primer, but also to keep oil at bay.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is well worth the money, and I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li>I find that it blends right in and is not gritty.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and extremely matte.</li>
            <li>today I used Maybelline Primer #so far my favorite# after the Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Cream and then added little dabs of Colorstay on my cheeks, forehead, chin and cheeks where I wanted fuller even coverage and then added my 1G Dermalogica Treatment Foundation with it....</li>
            <li>so this OCM is totally new to me.</li>
            <li>But this is the first time in 25 years I have actually WASHED my skin with an oil.</li>
            <li>I find that it does as good of a job, if not better, than the more expensive department store shine control gels and creams.</li>
            <li>My makeup does seem to stay on better when I use it and it does make me less shiny but only for like 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li>I think Neutrogena is fine if you use the primer and then powder for a sheer look or a foundation that is super thin that doesn&#x27;t need much coverage.    </li>
            <li>It is very easy to blend, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I just had to make sure I rubbed it in well since it has a little white tint to it.</li>
            <li>It was a little gritty when applied but that would not have been enough to bother me if it had just been effective in controlling the oiliness.</li>
            <li>and it was clear, gel like and smoothed over my skin like silk.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>I REALLY wanted to like this stuff and hoped it would work for me despite the mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>This ones gritty sand texture really bothers me but it works.</li>
            <li>I m a natural look addict</li>
            <li>This came as a complete surprise for me.</li>
            <li>What surprised me was how it felt on my skin....</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve only used this product a couple of times, so I still don&#x27;t quite have the knack of how much to use)</li>
            <li>I bought mine at Ulta Beauty for $9, which is far cheaper than Psychology&#x27;s $29.  </li>
            <li>I can have flaky skin and at the same time have too much sebum or oil because I&#x27;m hypothyroid and that can give you flakey skin.</li>
            <li>Its gritty but nothing to really complain about.</li>
            <li>Here is my bottom line so far on Drug Store Primers.</li>
            <li>But I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I have few wrinkles for my age but its because I have always used evening primrose or borage oil on my face with Rose Otto, Carrot essential oil and Frankincense essential oils for 20 years</li>
            <li>And the formula doesn&#x27;t not make my face whiter unlike the revlon primer that I mentioned earlier, This is definitely my new go-to primer!</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re doing a full face make-up application or just dusting you face with a little mineral powder it will CONTROL the oil.</li>
            <li>However I inherited my dads oily skin and larger than normal pores for women.</li>
            <li>My large pores are on the cheeks closer to the nose than towards my out cheeks near my ears, my chin and the center of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I feel that I use more of this primer than I typically would any other primer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>really well otherwise you look dry and chalky.</li>
            <li>it goes on white and stays somewhat white, so care must be taken to not use too much</li>
            <li>First of all, like the other reviews on here say, this probably isn&#x27;t for you if you have a darker complexion.</li>
            <li>Even on my major grease ball of a nose, my foundation stays on.</li>
            <li>Aside from how well it works, there is another major plus to this foundation.</li>
            <li>New York Instant Age Rewind Primer Skin Transformer, Clear, 0.85 Fluid Ounce (Misc.)  </li>
            <li>Those are amazing, yes, but expensive.</li>
            <li>At least not like the smooth primers that I&#x27;m used to using.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old daughter bought this as she has the same issue.  </li>
            <li>If you have combo skin and are middle aged, mixing the drug store brands with the higher quality Dermalogica</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried primers before that claimed to control shine, but usually that isn&#x27;t true for me.</li>
            <li>If you want a primer to go on under medium to heavy coverage, this is not  the right product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the only other primer (other than the Pop Beauty) that keeps me shine and oil free all day.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it I almost treated it like a lotion and just put it on, waited a little bit and put my foundation on and keep it moving.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it was right before my shift at Mcdonalds and during my break, I usually have to blot my face with an oil blotter, but I was amazed to see that my face only had a little shine on my forehead.</li>
            <li>If you blend too much, it starts to pill into these little balls which you then have to towel or dust off your face.</li>
            <li>I was using revlon photo ready primer for a while it would even out my skin and keep the oil off my skin but only for a little while until I started sweating.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This product is awesome, even for darker skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best primer I have used.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Bottom line-a great primer for the price!</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> Great for under eyes, too!  </li>
            <li> I thought because of the cost it would be awesome.</li>
            <li> The BEST for day use cream#.</li>
            <li> Then I mix Revlon Colorstay foundation with my Dermalogica foundation and that creates the perfect makeup for my combination skin and oil.</li>
            <li> me, this primer is a perfect dupe for Pop Beauty&#x27;s Face Magnet Primer.</li>
            <li> That was a joy and it seemed to bring out the best in the foundation.</li>
            <li> I bought this primer after reading not so great reviews.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it does give a really great matte finish that workS in two ways.  </li>
            <li> But now I&#x27;m so happy</li>
            <li> It was very nice.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying my own tube!</li>
            <li> The the best part was not having to reapply powder midday:)</li>
            <li> so I did research and found that primers were the latest and greatest.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not surprisingly, I haven&#x27;t been successful.  </li>
            <li> I use Neutrogena Shine Control Rice Protein powder on top to set it as its very good for that.</li>
            <li> It is a good substitute.</li>
            <li> which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> or so then it is a good compromise.  </li>
            <li> and so I bought Revlons Coverstay Cream foundation too, since Ally had good things to say and if you watch her blogs, you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
            <li> I love this primer!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Love that girl!    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Make-up goes on nicely and seems to \\&quot;stick\\&quot; longer.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I try this primer and works great.</li>
            <li> I do have very light skin (see my profile photo to get an idea of my skin tone).  </li>
            <li> I see Neutrogena makes a Healthy Skin primer with SPF, but reviews say it&#x27;s oily.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li> I also work at Mcdonalds which makes my face even more oily.</li>
            <li> I was skeptic at using this product, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> It also held my makeup together much better than without it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re planning to purchase this product to wear without applying foundation over it afterwards you better be Casper the ghost.</li>
            <li> use it over my moisturizer as a primer/light foundation for day to day, or over moisturizer and under my foundation for more dressy occasions.</li>
            <li> I love how my make up looked on this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I am sure it does what it is suppose to do</li>
            <li> My latest purchase was Neutrogena&#x27;s Shine Control.  </li>
            <li> Although it performs better than a couple of others I have tried (which couldn&#x27;t even qualify as mattifiers at all)</li>
            <li> If you pay any more than that</li>
            <li> I find that it blends better when you put it on over moisturizer.</li>
            <li> just make sure you don&#x27;t put on anything moisturizing after the primer.</li>
            <li> While, it worked better than most products I still saw some oilyness.</li>
            <li> Although I wish they had it in a bigger amount, I&#x27;am happy about my purchase!</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about 3-4 hours, I do see some shine coming through, mostly on my nose.  </li>
            <li> After a couple more hours, I start to see shine on my forehead as well as my nose.  </li>
            <li> I still have to use a couple of blotting papers throughout the day (maybe not as many as before).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dermalogica, Lancomb, Murad,and Jan Marini, so I am used to using the better brands but with the recession, I have not been able to afford those anymore.    </li>
            <li> I decided to read up on reviews on Amazon #love Amazon# for primers</li>
            <li> But Maybelline primer was better than Neutrogena&#x27;s.    </li>
            <li> Then I splurged on L&#x27;Oreal because the teller said it was her favorite.</li>
            <li> and then I added a tad more to fill in the pores and let that sit for a moment.</li>
            <li> Love that stuff</li>
            <li> Love it.    </li>
            <li> ONE MORE THING..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> (which is my all-time favorite primer)</li>
            <li> you love the Pop Beauty Face Magnet Primer</li>
            <li> This is great if your main concern is shine.  </li>
            <li> I tried this primer and so far it seems to be working great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a lotion which doesn&#x27;t make applying your make-up with a foundation brush easy.</li>
            <li> I was just as shiny and makeup wore off just as easily as without it.</li>
            <li> Compact and easy to carry on trips.</li>
            <li> However, if you buy the Neutrogena product here on Amazon for $25 then you might as well pay $4 more and buy Philosophy&#x27;s far superior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , and it does a nice job of keeping my skin pretty matte for the day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like a really fine sandpaper going on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the smell of this product &amp; it does exactly what its supposed too!</li>
            <li> My skin tone is a light olive.  </li>
            <li> ( using neutrogena oil free foundation and powder with it btw)</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic and it is not drying to my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> After it dries the grittiness is gone and smooth.</li>
            <li> This will give you light coverage and a matte finish.  </li>
            <li> My skin stayed oil free, however the make up still had some separation around the circumference of my pores</li>
            <li> B004S0YSFG Mini Original Face Primer]].  </li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the Avon and had doubts that anything else would work on my super, super oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have used many primers, including Clarins beauty balm and Smashbox camera ready, to name a couple.</li>
            <li> but my skin is quite fair, so this might be different for medium or darker skin tones.</li>
            <li> onto my story: I let the primer soak for 2minutes this time and applied Colorstay Cream in Sand Beige and Natural Beige and boy did it apply nicely.</li>
            <li> but I will blame that on Colorstay since it is a full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin silky smooth, completely erases fine lines, AND pores!  </li>
            <li> i got this in store if you have oily face always having to powder because your make up is super shiny because of your oily face i recommend you don&#x27;t buy this because it does nothing your face will still be oily weather</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I do go on a fairly vigorous walk with my dog at lunch time and climb 8 flights of stairs to get back to the office, so I am taking part in activities that may lead to increased shine.  </li>
            <li> It also dries super</li>
            <li> The first options is to put this with your moisturizer and smooth it on in the morning.  </li>
            <li> it is not as good as Philosophy&#x27;s product by a long shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it twice and found that it really does a great job keeping my face from looking shiny all day long.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider my skin super sensitive or anything, but at the same time I had the image of neutrogena products being pretty good for most skin types.</li>
            <li> Either by itself or under foundation it really does wonders to keep my skin looking matte throughout the day which is HUGE for me because of how oily my skin is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope this review helps others who are looking for an oil free and oil controlling primer that lasts the whole day.  </li>
            <li> The second way that works well is to mix moisturizer, primer, and foundation on your hand and apply it to your face as your own tinted beauty balm.  </li>
            <li> and she is right</li>
            <li> Normally a primer would allow for a smooth make-up application.</li>
            <li> So today I went back to an old standard foundation that is the best in my book: Dermalogica Treatment Foundation in 1g.</li>
            <li> The grittiness didn&#x27;t bother me so much, but by 11am I already had shininess on my T-zone!</li>
            <li> First off, it doesn&#x27;t feel like a primer.</li>
            <li> Will buy more definitely</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve had that experience</li>
            <li> The more you blend with your fingers, its gritty consistency pills, so</li>
            <li> To it&#x27;s mattifying powers, it works pretty well, but not for 8 continuous hours.</li>
            <li> this product really helps!</li>
            <li> The next time I applied it, I put some on my finger tips and worked it into my T-zone, focusing on where I know I have the most issues.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> on my nose and forehead, it dries immediately and will last 12 hours or more.  </li>
            <li> This applies almost as heavily as a sunscreen and does not spread easily, meaning you have to use much more product than is desired when it comes to primer.</li>
            <li> I was even more amazed when I finishes my shift and my face pretty much looked the same as it did during my break.</li>
            <li> It is white, as most primers are, and best used underneath foundation of some sort, because it doesn&#x27;t get dry clear like other primers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I have a lot of problems with breakouts, and most of popular brands of makeup make that worse.</li>
            <li> Its a truly good product and remember that a very little bit of this product is all you need.</li>
            <li> I lost my shiny nose which is great, but I was hoping my makeup would stay on for longer, I will try the other Neutrogena primer next time</li>
            <li> I found [...] who recommends certain drug store brands too</li>
            <li> What others have written is accurate - the product does come out as a white lotion....</li>
            <li> I can use a touchup mid-day, but overall, it&#x27;s a huge improvement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly; none of the gritty feel that others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m also very prone to breakouts</li>
            <li> and it really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> but when rubbing it in it was very gritty and didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> It really really dries out my face and makes me break out though.</li>
            <li> and this really did it for me.</li>
            <li> This improved my skin so much that I no longer need a moisturizer during the day time hours</li>
            <li> For those of you who really have oily skin, this product does not work.</li>
            <li> Really controls the shine like nothing else I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> so, again, care must be taken to not use too much  3)  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> My experience has been that it&#x27;s very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used L&#x27;Oreal primer and it really had no effect on my makeup whatsoever.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I get a really oily t-zone throughout the day and it really helps to minimize that.</li>
            <li> but this really helps my make up stay longer and helps control my shine.</li>
            <li> I am curious to know what others think or if there are even better products, but after a week</li>
            <li> or so I am really liking this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really testing the limits of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> like I had a really crappy mask on.</li>
            <li> There is something in Dermalogica&#x27;s ingrediants that prevent the pores from showing much and so</li>
            <li> , it works really well.</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t really expect much from this primer.</li>
            <li> This primer is very lightweight.</li>
            <li> I wear it bare if I&#x27;m going out somewhere quickly.</li>
            <li> It really keeps the shine down for hours, I like it more than the powder</li>
            <li> In a world where people just want to rush you to purchase, Calamity Jane took the time to make my purchase extra special.  </li>
            <li> Hope this helps for my dark people &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> main downsides to the Neutrogena product are:  1)  </li>
            <li> The foundation did not separate around the circumference of my pores and my face was &#x27;dewey&#x27; and vibrant.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a white silicon based primer, so it comes out white and finishes pretty light.</li>
            <li> I use a VERY light coat (just a few drops)</li>
            <li> This one performs just as well as the high end version.</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend you give this one</li>
            <li> I will say that it does manage oil levels in my t-zone a significant amount, but the downsides are far too vast in comparison to that fact.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time if used right!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a ton of primers before and this is the first that has really worked not only as a primer, but also to keep oil at bay.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money, and I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I find that it blends right in and is not gritty.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and extremely matte.</li>
            <li> today I used Maybelline Primer #so far my favorite# after the Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Cream and then added little dabs of Colorstay on my cheeks, forehead, chin and cheeks where I wanted fuller even coverage and then added my 1G Dermalogica Treatment Foundation with it....</li>
            <li> so this OCM is totally new to me.</li>
            <li> But this is the first time in 25 years I have actually WASHED my skin with an oil.</li>
            <li> I find that it does as good of a job, if not better, than the more expensive department store shine control gels and creams.</li>
            <li> My makeup does seem to stay on better when I use it and it does make me less shiny but only for like 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li> I think Neutrogena is fine if you use the primer and then powder for a sheer look or a foundation that is super thin that doesn&#x27;t need much coverage.    </li>
            <li> It is very easy to blend, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I just had to make sure I rubbed it in well since it has a little white tint to it.</li>
            <li> It was a little gritty when applied but that would not have been enough to bother me if it had just been effective in controlling the oiliness.</li>
            <li> and it was clear, gel like and smoothed over my skin like silk.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to like this stuff and hoped it would work for me despite the mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> This ones gritty sand texture really bothers me but it works.</li>
            <li> I m a natural look addict</li>
            <li> This came as a complete surprise for me.</li>
            <li> What surprised me was how it felt on my skin....</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve only used this product a couple of times, so I still don&#x27;t quite have the knack of how much to use)</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Ulta Beauty for $9, which is far cheaper than Psychology&#x27;s $29.  </li>
            <li> I can have flaky skin and at the same time have too much sebum or oil because I&#x27;m hypothyroid and that can give you flakey skin.</li>
            <li> Its gritty but nothing to really complain about.</li>
            <li> Here is my bottom line so far on Drug Store Primers.</li>
            <li> But I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I have few wrinkles for my age but its because I have always used evening primrose or borage oil on my face with Rose Otto, Carrot essential oil and Frankincense essential oils for 20 years</li>
            <li> And the formula doesn&#x27;t not make my face whiter unlike the revlon primer that I mentioned earlier, This is definitely my new go-to primer!</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re doing a full face make-up application or just dusting you face with a little mineral powder it will CONTROL the oil.</li>
            <li> However I inherited my dads oily skin and larger than normal pores for women.</li>
            <li> My large pores are on the cheeks closer to the nose than towards my out cheeks near my ears, my chin and the center of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I feel that I use more of this primer than I typically would any other primer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> really well otherwise you look dry and chalky.</li>
            <li> it goes on white and stays somewhat white, so care must be taken to not use too much</li>
            <li> First of all, like the other reviews on here say, this probably isn&#x27;t for you if you have a darker complexion.</li>
            <li> Even on my major grease ball of a nose, my foundation stays on.</li>
            <li> Aside from how well it works, there is another major plus to this foundation.</li>
            <li> New York Instant Age Rewind Primer Skin Transformer, Clear, 0.85 Fluid Ounce (Misc.)  </li>
            <li> Those are amazing, yes, but expensive.</li>
            <li> At least not like the smooth primers that I&#x27;m used to using.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter bought this as she has the same issue.  </li>
            <li> If you have combo skin and are middle aged, mixing the drug store brands with the higher quality Dermalogica</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried primers before that claimed to control shine, but usually that isn&#x27;t true for me.</li>
            <li> If you want a primer to go on under medium to heavy coverage, this is not  the right product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is the only other primer (other than the Pop Beauty) that keeps me shine and oil free all day.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it I almost treated it like a lotion and just put it on, waited a little bit and put my foundation on and keep it moving.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it was right before my shift at Mcdonalds and during my break, I usually have to blot my face with an oil blotter, but I was amazed to see that my face only had a little shine on my forehead.</li>
            <li> If you blend too much, it starts to pill into these little balls which you then have to towel or dust off your face.</li>
            <li> I was using revlon photo ready primer for a while it would even out my skin and keep the oil off my skin but only for a little while until I started sweating.</li>
            <li> I have a small laugh lines around my eye&#x27;s but not very noticeable.    </li>
            <li> You apply it on the highly porous parts of your skin and wait a few minutes for it to &#x27;set&#x27;</li>
            <li> yes it is a little gritty but just a little but once blended into the skin it smooths right out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame this product cost so much money, because I&#x27;m NOT pleased to throw it away</li>
            <li> I NEVER had an issue with breakouts with this primer, the primer goes on clear and weightlessly, and I use much less of the product.  </li>
            <li> only upside to the Neutrogena product is the price, and that is only if you purchase it from some source other than Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Even as an extremely fair skinned person, the stark white color of this primer instantly washes my face out and makes me look sickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late thirties but have never worn much make up.</li>
            <li> and I wonder if this happens when the product sits on the shelf too long.  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely no shine or dewiness in that entire time.</li>
            <li> All day long my skim was like velvet.</li>
            <li> The castor oil is kicking butt ladies on sebum and now my pores aren&#x27;t grey specks in need of extractions from a cosmetologist.</li>
            <li> The tube is a lot smaller than it looks, being that it&#x27;s flat, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> (I have combination skin with an oily T-zone and dry cheeks.)  </li>
            <li> Here are my results: My skin is combo oil and dry.</li>
            <li> a dry.</li>
            <li> It does keep my face looking less oily and gives my 38 year old skin a less caked on make-up look</li>
            <li> whereas after going through an entire tube of this I&#x27;ve been using foundation less and less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it does last a few hours, but not as long as Philosophy&#x27;s product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being a guy with a slightly oily face, I figure it&#x27;s only a couple of bucks, why not?</li>
            <li> Some people wrote that it gives a whitish hue to your face ( not true )  and that the texture and consistency were very gritty.  </li>
            <li> And it made a face a little white.</li>
            <li> I use liquid foundations, I sometimes use a foundation brush, beauty blender sponge, or just my fingers to rub in depending which of my foundations I will use that day) and when I would rub any foundation in, I could still feel the grittiness and little tiny sandpaper like bumps</li>
            <li> Even so, after applying the product, if my face is not 100% exfoliated, this accentuates dry skin flakes that occur with my combination skin unlike any other product I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> It does go on a bit whitish and you have to blend carefully.</li>
            <li> But be careful.</li>
            <li> Have spent a lot of money on prestige brands that didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Correct, unless you are pale white you shouldn&#x27;t wear alone.</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;m naturally pale (although get moderately tan in the summer) and that isn&#x27;t an issue for me in any season.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you cannot if you are black because you would look dry and ashy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricy for the amount you get, but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Blending it alone is just a dry mess waiting to happen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Philosophy&#x27;s mattifier (called \\&quot;The Present\\&quot;) for years; recently I&#x27;ve tried a few mattifiers made by other companies, hoping to find one that works as well for less</li>
            <li> With other lighter primers, a pea sized amount is plenty.</li>
            <li> so people say I look 25 and one person carded me the other day when I bought some liquor and thought I was 19.</li>
            <li> Those who have larger pores have blackheads usually.</li>
            <li> In previous usages the accentuation of my dryness has been so extreme that I&#x27;ve had to wipe all of the primer off and start over.</li>
            <li> It also leaves a white shadow which is hard to hide and you could not wear it alone.</li>
            <li> It can be hard to find products that explicitly say they are non-acnegenic and that actually are--but Neutrogena is a reliable line in that department.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I say it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and has a lot of weight to it - like applying regular lotion or suntan lotion.  </li>
            <li> This was too thick and gritty.</li>
            <li> With this primer, it takes much more than twice that to create a sufficient base for my makeup.</li>
            <li> The cream is rather gritty and thick.</li>
            <li> Only need to use a very small amount.</li>
            <li> and there is just a slight bit of sheen on my nose</li>
            <li> I also tried this product without any makeup at all and it worked well to keep me less oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely less shine than without using this product; I&#x27;d say it was maybe 80% under control after 8 hours.  </li>
            <li> But at the end of the day, slightly masky again.    </li>
            <li> Also not true.  </li>
            <li> little pimples that can be hidden.  </li>
            <li> but it is so little.</li>
            <li> If I put a little on after toner and moisturizer, it reduces the shine for the day, and I couldn&#x27;t even feel that it&#x27;s there -- practically unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> squeeze a little of this out and apply it to my nose and forehead.  </li>
            <li> I had which only made my skin worse...</li>
            <li> After a few minutes I applied my foundation.</li>
            <li> My shiny skin drives me crazy though, and as I get older I find myself putting on makeup almost every day.</li>
            <li> Honestly it&#x27;s my first &amp;#34;real primer&amp;#34; since the only other I&#x27;ve used was an awful nyc one that did NOTHING.</li>
            <li> I live in a very cold and dry climate now (</li>
            <li> Before I begin, I have to say that my face gets really oily throughout the day and its so bad that I have &amp;#34;pools&amp;#34; of oil on the side of my nose at times.</li>
            <li> If you eat fast food and bad foods, no matter what you put on your face for acne won&#x27;t work because its all coming from the inside.....</li>
            <li> With that being said, I do NOT love THIS Neutrogena product.  </li>
            <li> It may take a couple of squeezes to cover the face, so you can&#x27;t get away with just a small amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with a shine problem in the T zone but no more.  </li>
            <li> It does not break me out and its slick without being oily.</li>
            <li> One thing I did do, is I used the L&#x27;Oreal primer in the small jar for my eyelids and it was alright.    </li>
            <li> I usually apply it after I use soap #evening primrose and borage#</li>
            <li> I think I paid $11.99 for the usual 1 once.</li>
            <li> I usually use a Biore strip to pull then up but after 5 days of using the castor oil method of cleansing for oily skin, I tried Biore strips today and hardly anything surfaced.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s extremely hard to find something that stays on and absorbs all of the oil on my face.</li>
            <li> It controls the oil for 3 or 4 hours at least then my face becomes shiny again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all those negative reviewers are talking about.  </li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers who say that this product makes their foundation look chalky or weird.  </li>
            <li> It is also a very small bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> What the previous reviewer may have failed to understand is that this is a face PRIMER.</li>
            <li> Like I said, the Neutrogena product did last, but was just annoying.</li>
            <li> I like Neutrogena&#x27;s idea behind this product</li>
            <li> I have never used a primer in my life because I thought it was so unnecessary</li>
            <li> and I get broken capillaries on my cheeks in winter</li>
            <li> I have insanely oily skin and nothing I seem to do or put on ever seems to keep the oil at bay, especially under foundation.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to splurge on the expensive brands until I tried the drug store ones.</li>
            <li> and it drove me crazy.</li>
            <li> problem that I have is that this product caused me to break out really bad.  </li>
            <li> but Neutrogena disappointed me this time.</li>
            <li> and I hate looking at them,</li>
            <li> I have a nasty T-zone area and thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is awesome, even for darker skin. What the previous reviewer may have failed to understand is that this is a face PRIMER. It is not meant to be worn alone - it&#x27;s meant to be worn under either foundation, BB cream, or face powder. There are products on the market that can be worn with our without make-up but this is not one. Correct, unless you are pale white you shouldn&#x27;t wear alone. But if you&#x27;re doing a full face make-up application or just dusting you face with a little mineral powder it will CONTROL the oil. I only gave it 4-stars because it doesn&#x27;t prevent oil, just keeps it under control. Hope this helps for my dark people &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I tried this because I was out of town and had forgotten my Avon Magix. I am a huge fan of the Avon and had doubts that anything else would work on my super, super oily skin. I was pleasantly surprised by this product. It went on smoothly; none of the gritty feel that others have mentioned. As for controlling shine, it does just as well as the Avon, which for me, is about 4 hours. It does go on a bit whitish and you have to blend carefully. My skin tone is a light olive.  My only issue is that it has no SPF. I see Neutrogena makes a Healthy Skin primer with SPF, but reviews say it&#x27;s oily. Still, I would not hesitate to purchase this again if I am without my Avon. It is a good substitute.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Neutrogena products.  With that being said, I do NOT love THIS Neutrogena product.  What others have written is accurate - the product does come out as a white lotion.... and that&#x27;s just what it seems like - lotion.  It&#x27;s thick and has a lot of weight to it - like applying regular lotion or suntan lotion.  However, I don&#x27;t see the problem that others have about the lotion not blending into their skin, and I have a relatively tan/olive complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem that I have is that this product caused me to break out really bad.  We&#x27;re talking big, raised, embarrassing acne - not little pimples that can be hidden.  It&#x27;s a shame this product cost so much money, because I&#x27;m NOT pleased to throw it away but I simply can&#x27;t wear this anymore since it has wreacked such havoc on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this primer to try out when I ran out of [[ASIN:B004S0YSFG Mini Original Face Primer]].  This is the primer for me.  I NEVER had an issue with breakouts with this primer, the primer goes on clear and weightlessly, and I use much less of the product.  If you have problematic or combination skin like me, go with the Prime Time product instead.  You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Before I begin, I have to say that my face gets really oily throughout the day and its so bad that I have &amp;#34;pools&amp;#34; of oil on the side of my nose at times. I also work at Mcdonalds which makes my face even more oily. I was skeptic at using this product, but I&#x27;m so glad I did. The first time I used it was right before my shift at Mcdonalds and during my break, I usually have to blot my face with an oil blotter, but I was amazed to see that my face only had a little shine on my forehead. I was even more amazed when I finishes my shift and my face pretty much looked the same as it did during my break. It also held my makeup together much better than without it. Its a truly good product and remember that a very little bit of this product is all you need.</li>
            <li> This was too thick and gritty. It also leaves a white shadow which is hard to hide and you could not wear it alone. It is also a very small bottle for the price. I would not recommend this to anyone that is tan or darker</li>
            <li> It controls the oil for 3 or 4 hours at least then my face becomes shiny again</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to like this stuff and hoped it would work for me despite the mixed reviews. Sadly, it did absolutely nothing. The grittiness didn&#x27;t bother me so much, but by 11am I already had shininess on my T-zone! I don&#x27;t think I have over oily skin so I was thinking this may work but Neutrogena disappointed me this time. Save your money!!!!</li>
            <li> This applies almost as heavily as a sunscreen and does not spread easily, meaning you have to use much more product than is desired when it comes to primer. With other lighter primers, a pea sized amount is plenty. With this primer, it takes much more than twice that to create a sufficient base for my makeup. Even so, after applying the product, if my face is not 100% exfoliated, this accentuates dry skin flakes that occur with my combination skin unlike any other product I&#x27;ve used before. In previous usages the accentuation of my dryness has been so extreme that I&#x27;ve had to wipe all of the primer off and start over. Even as an extremely fair skinned person, the stark white color of this primer instantly washes my face out and makes me look sickly. If you&#x27;re planning to purchase this product to wear without applying foundation over it afterwards you better be Casper the ghost. I will say that it does manage oil levels in my t-zone a significant amount, but the downsides are far too vast in comparison to that fact. I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> First of all, like the other reviews on here say, this probably isn&#x27;t for you if you have a darker complexion. It&#x27;s a white silicon based primer, so it comes out white and finishes pretty light. That being said, I&#x27;m naturally pale (although get moderately tan in the summer) and that isn&#x27;t an issue for me in any season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally have combination skin, with oily patches on my cheeks and nose. I&#x27;ve used a ton of primers before and this is the first that has really worked not only as a primer, but also to keep oil at bay.&lt;br /&gt;I use it over my moisturizer as a primer/light foundation for day to day, or over moisturizer and under my foundation for more dressy occasions. Either by itself or under foundation it really does wonders to keep my skin looking matte throughout the day which is HUGE for me because of how oily my skin is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also very prone to breakouts and this has actually helped to improve my skin. I used to use foundation almost every day before trying this primer to cover up any tiny blemishes or oily patches I had which only made my skin worse... whereas after going through an entire tube of this I&#x27;ve been using foundation less and less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you&#x27;re of a fair/medium skintone and have issues with oily skin I would recommend trying this out. It&#x27;s a bit pricy for the amount you get, but a little goes a long way and it really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I was using revlon photo ready primer for a while it would even out my skin and keep the oil off my skin but only for a little while until I started sweating. And it made a face a little white. So as soon as I ran out ,I bought this from my local Walmart and I&#x27;ve been wearing this all day. I sweated a lot earlier and my face is still matte! And my foundation hasn&#x27;t moved one bit!( using neutrogena oil free foundation and powder with it btw) yes it is a little gritty but just a little but once blended into the skin it smooths right out. It has a pleasant scent too. Kinda floral. And the formula doesn&#x27;t not make my face whiter unlike the revlon primer that I mentioned earlier, This is definitely my new go-to primer!</li>
            <li> I  purchased the Neutrogena shine control matte primer, and it did it&#x27;s job but when rubbing it in it was very gritty and didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling smooth. Then I would always have to wait like 10 minutes to put any foundation on (note: I use liquid foundations, I sometimes use a foundation brush, beauty blender sponge, or just my fingers to rub in depending which of my foundations I will use that day) and when I would rub any foundation in, I could still feel the grittiness and little tiny sandpaper like bumps and it drove me crazy. Like I said, the Neutrogena product did last, but was just annoying.</li>
            <li> Honestly it&#x27;s my first &amp;#34;real primer&amp;#34; since the only other I&#x27;ve used was an awful nyc one that did NOTHING. This ones gritty sand texture really bothers me but it works. It really really dries out my face and makes me break out though. My makeup does seem to stay on better when I use it and it does make me less shiny but only for like 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li> I have a nasty T-zone area and thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I&#x27;ve been using pricier primers and thought I&#x27;d cut back on my beauty budget. First off, it doesn&#x27;t feel like a primer. At least not like the smooth primers that I&#x27;m used to using. It&#x27;s like a lotion which doesn&#x27;t make applying your make-up with a foundation brush easy. Normally a primer would allow for a smooth make-up application. Not this one. Also, the color of this primer is WHITE. You need to blend it in really well otherwise you look dry and chalky. But be careful. If you blend too much, it starts to pill into these little balls which you then have to towel or dust off your face. The blending that&#x27;s required also causes you to use an ample amount of product. I feel that I use more of this primer than I typically would any other primer I&#x27;ve used. I also apply the primer over my moisturizer which I think makes it easier to blend and prevents the pilling. Blending it alone is just a dry mess waiting to happen. It does keep my face looking less oily and gives my 38 year old skin a less caked on make-up look which is a good thing. I like Neutrogena&#x27;s idea behind this product but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I will continue using it until it&#x27;s all gone but I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> i got this in store if you have oily face always having to powder because your make up is super shiny because of your oily face i recommend you don&#x27;t buy this because it does nothing your face will still be oily weather you use foundation or powder</li>
            <li> I love how my make up looked on this.  I m a natural look addict and this really did it for me. Will buy more definitely</li>
            <li> I bought this primer after reading not so great reviews.  I don&#x27;t know what all those negative reviewers are talking about.  I love this primer! Not only does it keep my oily skin from showing through, it acutally has improved the look of my skin as well.  Some people wrote that it gives a whitish hue to your face ( not true )  and that the texture and consistency were very gritty.  Also not true.  The smell is fantastic and it is not drying to my skin at all.  In fact I now only moisturize at night before bed.  This improved my skin so much that I no longer need a moisturizer during the day time hours and I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s.  I hope this review helps others who are looking for an oil free and oil controlling primer that lasts the whole day.  This is the best primer I have used.</li>
            <li> For those of you who really have oily skin, this product does not work. I tried to use this with the Neutrogena Shine Control Foundation and it did nothing for my oily skin. I would not recommend this product for anyone who truly needs shine control.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me. I was just as shiny and makeup wore off just as easily as without it. It was a little gritty when applied but that would not have been enough to bother me if it had just been effective in controlling the oiliness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. I am sure it does what it is suppose to do but it feels gritty when you apply it. I couldn&#x27;t get use to it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Will purchase it again and will recommend it to my friends.  Compact and easy to carry on trips.</li>
            <li> Really controls the shine like nothing else I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and it&#x27;s extremely hard to find something that stays on and absorbs all of the oil on my face. I wear it bare if I&#x27;m going out somewhere quickly. It definetly gives a matte look with makeup. And you don&#x27;t even need a lot of this stuff to work just a dot in your T-zone or any places that get oily on your face.</li>
            <li> It really keeps the shine down for hours, I like it more than the powder</li>
            <li> This is gritty. Did not blend well with my Clinique foundation.  Won&#x27;t  buy again.</li>
            <li> Why, neutrogena, why? This came as a complete surprise for me. I don&#x27;t consider my skin super sensitive or anything, but at the same time I had the image of neutrogena products being pretty good for most skin types. The cream is rather gritty and thick. It may take a couple of squeezes to cover the face, so you can&#x27;t get away with just a small amount. After it dries the grittiness is gone and smooth. What surprised me was how it felt on my skin.... It felt like I took a bottle of exfoliating liquid and used it as a primer... What the fudge chips?? Skin reaction like that is the last thing I would imagine from this brand?</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time if used right! It doesn&#x27;t control my oily skin though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Philosophy&#x27;s mattifier (called \\&quot;The Present\\&quot;) for years; recently I&#x27;ve tried a few mattifiers made by other companies, hoping to find one that works as well for less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not surprisingly, I haven&#x27;t been successful.  My latest purchase was Neutrogena&#x27;s Shine Control.  Although it performs better than a couple of others I have tried (which couldn&#x27;t even qualify as mattifiers at all) it is not as good as Philosophy&#x27;s product by a long shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main downsides to the Neutrogena product are:  1)  it goes on white and stays somewhat white, so care must be taken to not use too much (I&#x27;ve only used this product a couple of times, so I still don&#x27;t quite have the knack of how much to use) 2) it has a tendency to be a bit gritty and pill on the skin (no doubt from the rice factor) so, again, care must be taken to not use too much  3)  it does last a few hours, but not as long as Philosophy&#x27;s product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only upside to the Neutrogena product is the price, and that is only if you purchase it from some source other than Amazon.  I bought mine at Ulta Beauty for $9, which is far cheaper than Psychology&#x27;s $29.  However, if you buy the Neutrogena product here on Amazon for $25 then you might as well pay $4 more and buy Philosophy&#x27;s far superior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So -- if you don&#x27;t want to spring $30 for The Present and can get Neutrogena&#x27;s product for $9 or so then it is a good compromise.  If you pay any more than that for it I say it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have had oily skin all my life.  I&#x27;m in my middle forties now.  My 16 year old daughter bought this as she has the same issue.  I tried it twice and found that it really does a great job keeping my face from looking shiny all day long.  First time I&#x27;ve had that experience and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of product for oily skin.  I&#x27;m buying my own tube!</li>
            <li> Basically, if you&#x27;re not the color of this product, which is white, it is going to show up on you. The more you blend with your fingers, its gritty consistency pills, so if you have any fuzz on your face from your towel, you&#x27;re going to have to pick it off. I&#x27;ve applied it all over as well as just on my t-zone over my moisturizer. I find that it blends better when you put it on over moisturizer. Make-up goes on nicely and seems to \\&quot;stick\\&quot; longer. I used a kabuki brush to apply a mineral foundation and was out the door. In photos of me with a flash, I appeared chalky. NO BUENO! To it&#x27;s mattifying powers, it works pretty well, but not for 8 continuous hours. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I&#x27;ll finish it up.</li>
            <li> I have always had shine and grease problems and I avoid wearing foundation because of it. this product really helps! just make sure you don&#x27;t put on anything moisturizing after the primer. sometimes i wear tinted moisturizer instead of foundation but that totally defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> It does help with my oily skin, but it makes my face white from the lotion. I probably won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I find that it does as good of a job, if not better, than the more expensive department store shine control gels and creams. I do use it in conjunction with the [[ASIN:B0081E6THU Neutrogena Shine Control Powder]], and it does a nice job of keeping my skin pretty matte for the day. I can use a touchup mid-day, but overall, it&#x27;s a huge improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone else mentioned that the cream was gritty, which hasn&#x27;t been my experience at all. My experience has been that it&#x27;s very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I have a lot of problems with breakouts, and most of popular brands of makeup make that worse. It can be hard to find products that explicitly say they are non-acnegenic and that actually are--but Neutrogena is a reliable line in that department.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I have insanely oily skin and nothing I seem to do or put on ever seems to keep the oil at bay, especially under foundation. I took a chance on this and i think it works fantastically. The first time I applied it I almost treated it like a lotion and just put it on, waited a little bit and put my foundation on and keep it moving. While, it worked better than most products I still saw some oilyness. The next time I applied it, I put some on my finger tips and worked it into my T-zone, focusing on where I know I have the most issues. Then applied to the rest of my face. After a few minutes I applied my foundation. Around 3:30 I work I realized I wasn&#x27;t feeling oily and looked at my face and there is just a slight bit of sheen on my nose but it is so little. I also tried this product without any makeup at all and it worked well to keep me less oily. I just had to make sure I rubbed it in well since it has a little white tint to it.</li>
            <li> Product crumbled when applied to my face.</li>
            <li> This seller put personalization back into shopping.  In a world where people just want to rush you to purchase, Calamity Jane took the time to make my purchase extra special.  I will be spreading the word about her.  Thank you so much!  I can not wait to purchase from you again!</li>
            <li> I have used many primers, including Clarins beauty balm and Smashbox camera ready, to name a couple. Those are amazing, yes, but expensive. I have used L&#x27;Oreal primer and it really had no effect on my makeup whatsoever. So this is the second drugstore primer I&#x27;ve used and I really like it. It&#x27;s smooth and extremely matte. I get a really oily t-zone throughout the day and it really helps to minimize that. It is white, as most primers are, and best used underneath foundation of some sort, because it doesn&#x27;t get dry clear like other primers. Bottom line-a great primer for the price!</li>
            <li> I have never used a primer in my life because I thought it was so unnecessary but this really helps my make up stay longer and helps control my shine.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;m in love with the smell of this product &amp; it does exactly what its supposed too! Although I wish they had it in a bigger amount, I&#x27;am happy about my purchase! Will def. be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product through YouTube videos. Being a guy with a slightly oily face, I figure it&#x27;s only a couple of bucks, why not? The tube is a lot smaller than it looks, being that it&#x27;s flat, but a little goes a long way. If I put a little on after toner and moisturizer, it reduces the shine for the day, and I couldn&#x27;t even feel that it&#x27;s there -- practically unnoticeable. As for its effectiveness in being a makeup primer, well I wouldn&#x27;t know, would I? ;)</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers who say that this product makes their foundation look chalky or weird.  HOWEVER, it does give a really great matte finish that workS in two ways.  The first options is to put this with your moisturizer and smooth it on in the morning.  This is great if your main concern is shine.  The second way that works well is to mix moisturizer, primer, and foundation on your hand and apply it to your face as your own tinted beauty balm.  This will give you light coverage and a matte finish.  If you want a primer to go on under medium to heavy coverage, this is not  the right product.&lt;br /&gt;I did not find the product to be gritty and I wonder if this happens when the product sits on the shelf too long.  I also did not find that it left a white residue but my skin is quite fair, so this might be different for medium or darker skin tones.</li>
            <li> Finally something that works! Have spent a lot of money on prestige brands that didn&#x27;t work as well. Only need to use a very small amount.</li>
            <li> Love this. Actually works.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have found this product years ago.  I&#x27;ve always struggled with a shine problem in the T zone but no more.  I use a VERY light coat (just a few drops) on my nose and forehead, it dries immediately and will last 12 hours or more.  There is absolutely no shine or dewiness in that entire time. Amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late thirties but have never worn much make up. My shiny skin drives me crazy though, and as I get older I find myself putting on makeup almost every day. I tried this primer and so far it seems to be working great. I am curious to know what others think or if there are even better products, but after a week or so I am really liking this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting warmer outside and, as a result, I&#x27;m battling increasing amounts of shine.  (I have combination skin with an oily T-zone and dry cheeks.)  I have been using blotting papers, but I&#x27;ve been going through 3-5 a day.  So I decided to try this primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I squeeze a little of this out and apply it to my nose and forehead.  I find that it blends right in and is not gritty.  Note: I do have very light skin (see my profile photo to get an idea of my skin tone).  I then apply a Neutrogena liquid foundation over this primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 3-4 hours, I do see some shine coming through, mostly on my nose.  I&#x27;d say it was 90-95% under control.  Blotting papers still work to get rid of the shine.  After a couple more hours, I start to see shine on my forehead as well as my nose.  It&#x27;s definitely less shine than without using this product; I&#x27;d say it was maybe 80% under control after 8 hours.  For what it&#x27;s worth, I do go on a fairly vigorous walk with my dog at lunch time and climb 8 flights of stairs to get back to the office, so I am taking part in activities that may lead to increased shine.  I&#x27;m really testing the limits of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this does definitely improve things, but it doesn&#x27;t totally eliminate the problem.  I still have to use a couple of blotting papers throughout the day (maybe not as many as before).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like a really fine sandpaper going on.  doesn&#x27;t control shine.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin silky smooth, completely erases fine lines, AND pores!  Great for under eyes, too!  No problems with concealers creasing anymore! The the best part was not having to reapply powder midday:) I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This review is from: Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind Primer Skin Transformer, Clear, 0.85 Fluid Ounce (Misc.)  I am 43 and had not purchased make up in ages and when I found out about primers I felt like I had to try several to know which one would work for me. I didn&#x27;t want to splurge on the expensive brands until I tried the drug store ones. I bought Neutrogena&#x27;s primer, Maybelline&#x27;s primer and L&#x27;Oreals primer. I have few wrinkles for my age but its because I have always used evening primrose or borage oil on my face with Rose Otto, Carrot essential oil and Frankincense essential oils for 20 years so people say I look 25 and one person carded me the other day when I bought some liquor and thought I was 19. My background in skin care: Facials since I was 12. I&#x27;ve used Dermalogica, Lancomb, Murad,and Jan Marini, so I am used to using the better brands but with the recession, I have not been able to afford those anymore.    What started this shopping spree and sampling different product lines was me purchasing Estee Lauders Double Wear Maximum Cover Camouflage Make Up in Creamy Vanilla at Dillards. I thought because of the cost it would be awesome. I live in a very cold and dry climate now (Montana# and I get broken capillaries on my cheeks in winter and I hate looking at them, but when I applied Estee Lauders foundation by the end of my work day is was as though all the foundation separated and made my pores look humongous and any dryness was so visible I was so embarrassed as I work in retail and I knew people were looking at me like I had a really crappy mask on. I didn&#x27;t want to take back the Estee Lauder make up so I did research and found that primers were the latest and greatest. So now that you know I am not a novice to skin care, this is my story.    I decided to read up on reviews on Amazon #love Amazon# for primers and so I bought 3 brands and have experimented in different ways. I found [...] who recommends certain drug store brands too and so I bought Revlons Coverstay Cream foundation too, since Ally had good things to say and if you watch her blogs, you&#x27;ll be hooked. She is a crack up. Love that girl!    Here are my results: My skin is combo oil and dry. I can have flaky skin and at the same time have too much sebum or oil because I&#x27;m hypothyroid and that can give you flakey skin. However I inherited my dads oily skin and larger than normal pores for women. My large pores are on the cheeks closer to the nose than towards my out cheeks near my ears, my chin and the center of my eyebrows. I have a small laugh lines around my eye&#x27;s but not very noticeable.    Neutrogena&#x27;s shine control: Its gritty but nothing to really complain about. Just use enough moisturizer before hand, give it 4-5 minutes to let the moisturizer sink in to your skin and then apply Neutrogenas primer. I waited another 3-4 minutes before I applied foundation. I used Lancombs foundation in matte and Neutrogena&#x27;s rice protein powder afterwards. Results: My skin stayed oil free, however the make up still had some separation around the circumference of my pores and so I felt it was too masky again. Then I used Neutrogena Primer with Colorstay Foundation per Ally and same thing, my poors are too big. I think Neutrogena is fine if you use the primer and then powder for a sheer look or a foundation that is super thin that doesn&#x27;t need much coverage.    Next was Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Primer. I always moisturize my face with Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Cream #The BEST for day use cream#. Then after 5 minutes applied Maybellines primer and it was clear, gel like and smoothed over my skin like silk. It was very nice. Because I know that acne is 90% diet and 10% hormonal or hygene I don&#x27;t care about the silicones because they don&#x27;t break my face out because I eat well. If you eat fast food and bad foods, no matter what you put on your face for acne won&#x27;t work because its all coming from the inside..... onto my story: I let the primer soak for 2minutes this time and applied Colorstay Cream in Sand Beige and Natural Beige and boy did it apply nicely. That was a joy and it seemed to bring out the best in the foundation. Then I applied Neutrogena&#x27;s rice powder setting powder and went to work. End of day it was so-so, still a tad masky but I will blame that on Colorstay since it is a full coverage foundation. But Maybelline primer was better than Neutrogena&#x27;s.    Then I splurged on L&#x27;Oreal because the teller said it was her favorite. This is a neat primer because its like stucko. You apply it on the highly porous parts of your skin and wait a few minutes for it to &#x27;set&#x27; and then I added a tad more to fill in the pores and let that sit for a moment. Then I decided to use Colorstay again and this was so-so. It could be the Colorstay, have no idea yet. But at the end of the day, slightly masky again.    So today I went back to an old standard foundation that is the best in my book: Dermalogica Treatment Foundation in 1g. Love that stuff but Dermalogica does not make it anymore. The company is sending me samples of a newer version of their foundation line. There is something in Dermalogica&#x27;s ingrediants that prevent the pores from showing much and so today I used Maybelline Primer #so far my favorite# after the Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Cream and then added little dabs of Colorstay on my cheeks, forehead, chin and cheeks where I wanted fuller even coverage and then added my 1G Dermalogica Treatment Foundation with it.... And Viola! I found the Holy Grail. All day long my skim was like velvet. The foundation did not separate around the circumference of my pores and my face was &#x27;dewey&#x27; and vibrant.    Here is my bottom line so far on Drug Store Primers. Maybelline Instant Age Rewind will be my primer of choice. It does not break me out and its slick without being oily. You have to try it to know. Then I mix Revlon Colorstay foundation with my Dermalogica foundation and that creates the perfect makeup for my combination skin and oil. I use Neutrogena Shine Control Rice Protein powder on top to set it as its very good for that. By the end of the day, my skin looks radiant. One thing I did do, is I used the L&#x27;Oreal primer in the small jar for my eyelids and it was alright.    As per[...] she recommends Maybelline eye concealer that is the Brightener and she is right, it works really well. Love it.    So there you have it. If you have combo skin and are middle aged, mixing the drug store brands with the higher quality Dermalogica I think you will be ecstatic by the results. Its trial and error. But now I&#x27;m so happy my capillaries don&#x27;t show up.    ONE MORE THING.. I also implemented the Oil Cleansing Method this week for washing my face. Google that and do what she says. It&#x27;s amazing. Those who have larger pores have blackheads usually. I swear to God, the castor oil #mixed with 1 drop of essential oil of Orange# will dissolve the sebum, blackheads and your pores will eventually shrink alittle. But this is the first time in 25 years I have actually WASHED my skin with an oil. I usually apply it after I use soap #evening primrose and borage# so this OCM is totally new to me. After day 5 of that method, I have zero blackheads. I usually use a Biore strip to pull then up but after 5 days of using the castor oil method of cleansing for oily skin, I tried Biore strips today and hardly anything surfaced. The castor oil is kicking butt ladies on sebum and now my pores aren&#x27;t grey specks in need of extractions from a cosmetologist. I&#x27;ve never been happier about getting rid of blackheads in my life. Had I known castor oil dissolved blackheads 28 years ago when I went thru puberty I would have been doing that all along.    So I hope this helps y&#x27;all on the primers and what I mixed with foundation so you don&#x27;t have to buy the entire drug store to find out what works.  TTFN</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but I just wish it was the color of my skin not a white cream color because it says you can wear it alone and you cannot if you are black because you would look dry and ashy.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I try this primer and works great. I´m using it with my clients and it helps smoothing the texture of their skin and prevents creasing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try this primer for awhile. So I finally bit the bullet and bought some at Target on a whim. I think I paid $11.99 for the usual 1 once. I&#x27;ve tried primers before that claimed to control shine, but usually that isn&#x27;t true for me. So I didn&#x27;t really expect much from this primer. But I was pleasantly surprised. This primer is very lightweight. It is very easy to blend, and a little goes a long way. It also dries super fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, this primer is a perfect dupe for Pop Beauty&#x27;s Face Magnet Primer. (which is my all-time favorite primer) This one performs just as well as the high end version. This is the only other primer (other than the Pop Beauty) that keeps me shine and oil free all day. I&#x27;ve never been one to do touch ups on my foundation. I don&#x27;t have the time or the desire to do that. Even on my major grease ball of a nose, my foundation stays on. It doesn&#x27;t fade away or separate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love the Pop Beauty Face Magnet Primer, I highly recommend you give this one a dry. Aside from how well it works, there is another major plus to this foundation. The price. The Pop Beauty Primer sells for $26. This baby is around $12. This is well worth the money, and I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I lost my shiny nose which is great, but I was hoping my makeup would stay on for longer, I will try the other Neutrogena primer next time</li>
