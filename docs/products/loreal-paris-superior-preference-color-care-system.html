            <li>Happy with hair after using Loreal Preference.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I am on the Amazon automatic ordering, and it&#x27;s great to know the product will be arriving every six weeks.</li>
            <li>They arrived in great shape, just the color I needed.</li>
            <li>This works great.  </li>
            <li>and I have great results.  </li>
            <li>Good product too.</li>
            <li>Wanting to save money and dye my hair myself I purchased L&#x27;Oreal Paris Superior Preference in LB-02.</li>
            <li>Preference Lightest Golden Brown is my perfect hair color.</li>
            <li>My hair is always more manageable on those days!</li>
            <li>how pretty the color is, how perfect it is for me</li>
            <li>and the nice highlights it give.</li>
            <li>I guess this is a popular color because when I go to the store they are often out of this shade.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nice when you get one that does.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was confident in ordering this product online because I have had a lot of experience doing hair coloring, my own and for others.  </li>
            <li>It was nice to be able to buy a quantity of this hair color at one time.  </li>
            <li>I did a test strand and was happy with the outcome, it looked exactly like the color on the box...</li>
            <li>I tried a couple of colors in this series before deciding I liked this best for my dark brown hair; it gives it a nice coppery-golden sheen.</li>
            <li>This color is absolutely lovely on dark/medium brown hair.</li>
            <li>Needles to say I wasn&#x27;t pleased and have since been trying to get it out.</li>
            <li>but now its a muddy unnatural carrot orange (still better than it was).</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Just a warm light brown.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal Preference for years now and I am totally satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>it is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>and I need more than what they give you in the tube.  </li>
            <li>Easy application.</li>
            <li>So easy to apply.</li>
            <li>My scalp was almost burned, the solution is so strong ...</li>
            <li>The conditioner is amazing and leaves my hair super soft and smelling nice as well.</li>
            <li>I have been using the L&#x27;Oreal Preference, Lightest Golden Brown shade for many years now, and still get compliments on the golden highlights and how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li>It was pretty healthy before I started.</li>
            <li>Suave makes a good one for $3 (not a treatment, just a regular conditioner, but leaving it on overnight should do the job).</li>
            <li>maybe given the full amount of time it will get there&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>the only good thing about it it that is</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or reactions to chemicals, but this was VERY strong.</li>
            <li>The sample color result swatches printed on the package are pretty accurate.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t this color is orange not &amp;#34;golden brown&amp;#34; I&#x27;m not sure why it has so many good reviews</li>
            <li>Looks natural, covers gray, love the look of healthy&lt;br /&gt;hair</li>
            <li>It fills in the cuticles and ensures that color is absorbed uniformly.</li>
            <li>I have problems finding in local stores, because it is so popular.  </li>
            <li>I found that going lighter like this works better to camouflage my gray, and I like that the color seems to have variation and depth, not just a solid monotone all over.</li>
            <li>Consistent color.</li>
            <li>first idk</li>
            <li>Now, if the product could only make my face look as smooth and wide-eyed as the model, I would give it 10 stars !</li>
            <li>was, wanting to go into a natural strawberry blonde/ light brown</li>
            <li>I bought this hair dye twice hoping I&#x27;d get better results the second time</li>
            <li>I pretty much knew right away</li>
            <li>The color is always consistent and natural looking and the coverage very effective, though with the increasing amount of gray in my natural hair, I have to be careful with the application, particularly around the temples and where I part my hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t try my hair out too much.</li>
            <li>So I proceeded with my whole head.</li>
            <li>Very damaging and drying.</li>
            <li>Love it (58 years old now) and totally gray</li>
            <li>By the way, my friends now call me \\&quot;Sunny\\&quot; :) At least I can laugh about this!</li>
            <li>I had pre-lightened hair that was very light blonde on the last 5 inches  and had a lot of yellow and light orange tones everywhere else.</li>
            <li>Others complained about the smell, but I thought it was quite nice with the exception of making my eyes water (which happens at the salon anyway).</li>
            <li>When I finally rinsed (right at the cut off time)</li>
            <li>maybe it only works well on blonde or light brown hair</li>
            <li>My 8 year old says it is GOLD!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t quite as light as the box--but it does match the side of the box that indicates what it would be on dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>There is an option that you can set this and other things that you use all the time on a special service that automatically sends them to you at a reduced price.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to someone wanting to lighten their already light brown/dirty blond hair, but probably not to someone with dark brown hair like myself (unless you like screaming orange)!</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s intense condition and only needs to be used once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For myself, I know very well how my results are likely to turn out compared to what you see on the box.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try to get back to a bit darker all over shade that was between a strawberry blonde and light brown, so I took a chance on this because Id rather have red than ash tones</li>
            <li>Even my stylist who cuts my hair approves of it and doesn&#x27;t try to convince me to get my hair professionally colored.  </li>
            <li>I bought two boxes and I am thinking of applying the second box in a few days with the hopes of lightening it more without frying it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t do that last time, and ended up with dark brown roots and light brown ends.</li>
            <li>I thought since it was considerably darker than my existing haircolor it would be dark enough to look okay, and I did need to deposit red back into my ends.</li>
            <li>No other complaints at all.</li>
            <li>My natural color is sort of a dingy brown - no grey -</li>
            <li>I washed it the first night with a mix of lemon juice/head and shoulders/hair mask, and managed to get the gray out and tone down the orange</li>
            <li>The conditioner tube is more than enough product, so I actually use it at least twice a week instead of only once.</li>

            <li> either I&#x27;m bad at dying my own hair or I need to bleach it</li>
            <li> It really covers gray; I have to leave it on for at least 40 minutes</li>
            <li> This works well and stays for a long time.</li>
            <li> and I have been dying about every three to six months for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it is overly red, but rather a copper unlike any other I&#x27;ve found in a box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair like other hair dyes</li>
            <li> The quality is what I expected, the included conditioner works wonders.  </li>
            <li> While processing it looked very dark raspberry red on the roots and dark brown on my ends.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I wish L&#x27;Oreal would sell the conditioner separately because I have long hair</li>
            <li> While it did lighten my hair drastically it turned out extremely brassy/orange/yellow.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Looking forward\\&quot; to a few greasy days, as I haven&#x27;t shampooed in two days and don&#x27;t anticipate doing so for another two, but a dry shampoo should help.</li>
            <li> My hair is really dark brown</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair</li>
            <li> I find ordering this hair color on Amazon makes my life a little easier.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years to cover a little gray.  </li>
            <li> : use a keratin (protein) treatment--or even just conditioner--a few days before you dye.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair that I have had dyed to a dirty blond for several years.</li>
            <li> what a waste of 18 dollars!!</li>
            <li> the color results are ridiculous</li>
            <li> Like a muddy orangish, red :(</li>

            <li> Great to just have it delivered when I need it.  Good product too.</li>
            <li> This works well and stays for a long time. It doesn&#x27;t try my hair out too much.</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal since I turned 30... Love it (58 years old now) and totally gray&lt;br /&gt;no one suspect that I have colored for years.  Looks natural, covers gray, love the look of healthy&lt;br /&gt;hair and the nice highlights it give.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair that I have had dyed to a dirty blond for several years. Wanting to save money and dye my hair myself I purchased L&#x27;Oreal Paris Superior Preference in LB-02. While it did lighten my hair drastically it turned out extremely brassy/orange/yellow. My 8 year old says it is GOLD! I bought two boxes and I am thinking of applying the second box in a few days with the hopes of lightening it more without frying it.

By the way, my friends now call me \\&quot;Sunny\\&quot; :) At least I can laugh about this!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year. I tried a couple of colors in this series before deciding I liked this best for my dark brown hair; it gives it a nice coppery-golden sheen. The sample color result swatches printed on the package are pretty accurate. I found that going lighter like this works better to camouflage my gray, and I like that the color seems to have variation and depth, not just a solid monotone all over. The conditioner tube is more than enough product, so I actually use it at least twice a week instead of only once. My hair is always more manageable on those days!</li>
            <li> This color is absolutely lovely on dark/medium brown hair. It isn&#x27;t quite as light as the box--but it does match the side of the box that indicates what it would be on dark brown hair. I wouldn&#x27;t say it is overly red, but rather a copper unlike any other I&#x27;ve found in a box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color has held up beautifully. I use a purple color toning shampoo (John Frieda for blondes), cool/warm water, and color protective shampoo and conditioner, alternating days, to ensure that it doesn&#x27;t get too red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip for those who are dying hair: use a keratin (protein) treatment--or even just conditioner--a few days before you dye. It fills in the cuticles and ensures that color is absorbed uniformly. I didn&#x27;t do that last time, and ended up with dark brown roots and light brown ends. I just used a Dove conditioner that had keratin in it, left it on overnight, dealt with the greasiness, and dyed my hair. Suave makes a good one for $3 (not a treatment, just a regular conditioner, but leaving it on overnight should do the job). Argan oil or somesuch isn&#x27;t what you want. In a pinch, use an egg yolk or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely do not shampoo your hair 24 hours before or after dying, because that will wash it away, too. \\&quot;Looking forward\\&quot; to a few greasy days, as I haven&#x27;t shampooed in two days and don&#x27;t anticipate doing so for another two, but a dry shampoo should help.</li>
            <li> Easy application. Consistent color. Leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I find ordering this hair color on Amazon makes my life a little easier. I guess this is a popular color because when I go to the store they are often out of this shade.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Happy with hair after using Loreal Preference.  I have used the brand before but not in years I would guess.  The quality is what I expected, the included conditioner works wonders.  Some brands don&#x27;t give a separate conditioner to use for the following weeks, it&#x27;s nice when you get one that does.  It&#x27;s intense condition and only needs to be used once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was confident in ordering this product online because I have had a lot of experience doing hair coloring, my own and for others.  For myself, I know very well how my results are likely to turn out compared to what you see on the box.  Otherwise I may have been nervous to make a color choice online.  Depends on your knowledge and comfort level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting this during an order I was already making was a simple convenience..  The package was protective of the product, both the way the product is packed in the box and the packaging amazon does for shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have problems finding in local stores, because it is so popular.  I am on the Amazon automatic ordering, and it&#x27;s great to know the product will be arriving every six weeks.</li>
            <li> It was nice to be able to buy a quantity of this hair color at one time.  There is an option that you can set this and other things that you use all the time on a special service that automatically sends them to you at a reduced price.  They arrived in great shape, just the color I needed. I would recommend this product...</li>
            <li> My hair is really dark brown I was hoping to lighten it a bit this product changed my hair the smallest amount possible I notice it but no one else will... either I&#x27;m bad at dying my own hair or I need to bleach it first idk it also left my hair oily</li>
            <li> I have been using the L&#x27;Oreal Preference, Lightest Golden Brown shade for many years now, and still get compliments on the golden highlights and how healthy my hair looks. The color is always consistent and natural looking and the coverage very effective, though with the increasing amount of gray in my natural hair, I have to be careful with the application, particularly around the temples and where I part my hair. Now, if the product could only make my face look as smooth and wide-eyed as the model, I would give it 10 stars !</li>
            <li> Unfortunatly when searching for a review on a specific color in this product line on Amazon you get 300 reviews all together but they are on different colors. I had pre-lightened hair that was very light blonde on the last 5 inches  and had a lot of yellow and light orange tones everywhere else. It was pretty healthy before I started. I wanted to try to get back to a bit darker all over shade that was between a strawberry blonde and light brown, so I took a chance on this because Id rather have red than ash tones In my results. I thought since it was considerably darker than my existing haircolor it would be dark enough to look okay, and I did need to deposit red back into my ends. I did a test strand and was happy with the outcome, it looked exactly like the color on the box... So I proceeded with my whole head. Yikes! I pretty much knew right away I wasn&#x27;t going to get a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; color, but I thought ..&amp;#34;well, maybe given the full amount of time it will get there&amp;#34;. While processing it looked very dark raspberry red on the roots and dark brown on my ends. When I finally rinsed (right at the cut off time) I had muddy greyish ends and a color I don&#x27;t even have words for on the rest.. Like a muddy orangish, red :( My scalp was almost burned, the solution is so strong ... and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or reactions to chemicals, but this was VERY strong. Very damaging and drying. Needles to say I wasn&#x27;t pleased and have since been trying to get it out. I washed it the first night with a mix of lemon juice/head and shoulders/hair mask, and managed to get the gray out and tone down the orange but now its a muddy unnatural carrot orange (still better than it was). So I guess I would say proceed with caution, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone with pre-lightened blonde hair like mine was, wanting to go into a natural strawberry blonde/ light brown</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years to cover a little gray.  Love it.  I am a born redhead.  When my hair started to look mousy brown I just couldn&#x27;t take it.  This works great.  Not a brassy red at all.  Just a warm light brown.</li>
            <li> Preference Lightest Golden Brown is my perfect hair color. So easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and I wanted to go lighter but not to lighter I bought this hair dye twice hoping I&#x27;d get better results the second time but I didn&#x27;t this color is orange not &amp;#34;golden brown&amp;#34; I&#x27;m not sure why it has so many good reviews maybe it only works well on blonde or light brown hair I probably won&#x27;t buy it again the color results are ridiculous you can&#x27;t even tell I dyed my hair the only good thing about it it that is doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair like other hair dyes what a waste of 18 dollars!!</li>
            <li> Perfect color for my hair !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal Preference for years now and I am totally satisfied with the results.  It doesn&#x27;t damage hair at all and the conditioner that comes with it is fantastic!  Even the girl who cuts my hair says there is no damage whatsoever and I have been dying about every three to six months for a long time.  It really covers gray; I have to leave it on for at least 40 minutes and I have great results.  The only complaint I have is that I wish L&#x27;Oreal would sell the conditioner separately because I have long hair and I need more than what they give you in the tube.  No other complaints at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this color for over 20 years and I continue to get comments on it - how pretty the color is, how perfect it is for me etc.  Even my stylist who cuts my hair approves of it and doesn&#x27;t try to convince me to get my hair professionally colored.  My natural color is sort of a dingy brown - no grey - and I touch up the roots every 3-4 weeks.  If this color is ever discontinued, I&#x27;ll be picketing in front of Loreal headquarters!</li>
            <li> Well packed.  Arrived with no problems.</li>
