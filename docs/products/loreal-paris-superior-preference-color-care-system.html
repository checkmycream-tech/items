    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this color.</li>
            <li>Amazon subscribe-and-save is the best way to buy it.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Hi-Lift products seem to provide the best anti-brass protection in hair color.</li>
            <li>I received something I didn&#x27;t order on time and in great condition!</li>
            <li>This color &amp;#34;hi lift ash brown&amp;#34; was perfect.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, freckles, hazel eyes..</li>
            <li>I had great results with the hi lift ash brown.</li>
            <li>I obtained this dye after reading some good reviews.  </li>
            <li>but what you will be shipped is Superior Preference Sun-Kissed Caramels, Hi-Lift Ash Brown UL61 which is a darker shade(more brassy in shade).</li>
            <li>LOVE the COLOR!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of washings my hair looked really nice, it did lighten up.  </li>
            <li>so it kind if faded.</li>
            <li>So therefore nice toner</li>
            <li>BECAUSE APPARENTLY IT&#x27;S HAZARDOUS.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m loving the color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super happy.  </li>
            <li>This color allows me to do my own touch ups easily every month.</li>
            <li>I would recommend :)  John 14:6</li>
            <li>but after this product (has ammonia), I literally lost way too many hair.</li>
            <li>I debated doing this as I have short hair--but decided I should follow the directions regardless and it turned out perfectly.  </li>
            <li>6.3 light golden brown (which, by the way smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Also, the fumes are so strong</li>
            <li>I received this item much more quickly than I had hoped and at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>I will, however, enjoy the conditioner that was included and might consider re-purposing the developer.</li>
            <li>My hair, which was smooth and silky before, turned crunchy.</li>
            <li>My hair turned into a beautiful color but not what I expected.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll get the end result I originally want.</li>
            <li>It may lighten more over time, but it certainly did not look like the color showed on the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I lost like combs full of hair.</li>
            <li>its a nice color wish it came out completely</li>
            <li>I love this color and it suits me very well.</li>
            <li>I am truly truly impressed because I have tried so mang other products and this really surprised me.</li>
            <li>Also it makes my hair smell really fresh and didn&#x27;t damage my hair at all.</li>
            <li>I buy like 10 at the time so that the duty / shipping costs are worth it.</li>
            <li>My normal color is  Preference True Brunettes Ultra Light Ash Brown UL61</li>
            <li>next day my hair lightened even more so it is now a rich chocolate</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for a quick lightening without bleaching if you are going to use vegetable dye, but I would not recommend for a natural hair color.</li>
            <li>The lightener in the product made my eyes water at first until I opened the bathroom window</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions exactly</li>
            <li>and I think it looks pretty close the picture on the box.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly...</li>
            <li>I washed my hair first with a clarifying shampoo, blowdried then followed the directions.</li>
            <li>the first time around.</li>
            <li>I put this on my ends for 20 minutes, then put the color on the roots for 10 minutes EXACTLY as it instructed.</li>
            <li>and I did exactly what the instructions said.</li>
            <li>So after deep conditioning my hair a couple times hopefully it will revive because I certainly got the color I wanted :)</li>
            <li>It does look good but the fumes have me searching for same results, different product.</li>
            <li>And my hair is more brittle and dry, which I did expect to happen with using box dyes</li>
            <li>Did not lighten my hair as much as I was hoping.  </li>
            <li>in the sun its much lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very upset with this product.</li>
            <li>It really works better than others to cover stubborn gray and lightens my dark hair well!</li>
            <li>UL61 is the first at-home coloring product that hasn&#x27;t left me super duper red tones.</li>
            <li>helpful tip- don&#x27;t use it right after using another box color, it will only make the hair draker..</li>
            <li>All the other dyes that I&#x27;ve used was ammonia free</li>
            <li>I dyed my hair exactly as the directions said and it literally dyed only my roots</li>
            <li>I bought the hi-lift ash brown UL61, and like many others stated, I waited a week to use it because I was not sure if I wanted too...</li>
            <li>It made my top roots orange and the bottom the same color dark brown how i had it before dying it.....</li>
            <li>but I nearly got the exact same shade as advertised on the front of the box.</li>
            <li>However, that might be just me because of I guess I&#x27;m sensitive to ammonia.</li>
            <li>hi-lift natural brown.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to dyeing</li>
            <li>sun-kissed caramels UL51 hi-lift natural brown and just used the L&#x27;Oreal sun-kissed caramels UL61 hi-lift ash brown</li>
            <li>Go get it done by a professional.</li>
            <li>Complete virgin hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally medium brown ashy color hair</li>
            <li>Now that my hair is colored I will have to use bleach or color remover which is completely damaging to my hair just to get my hair lighter.</li>
            <li>About a year ago, i began using box colors to cover the grays because I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep having it done professionally.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a real brunette and this is the only color that will NOT turn my hair red; it will give me a true dark blond color without the redness.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to get the red tones out and go normal brown.</li>
            <li>but like I said, it definitely lifted my hair color considerin that I originally had black</li>
            <li>I used to live in the States and since I discovered this specific color</li>
            <li>I have DARK BROWN HAIR and this gives me a really pretty Gold color with Reddish highlights.</li>
            <li>My hairs always been a medium brown with red in it, ive always had my hair professionally highlighted or colored.</li>
            <li>I have red in my hair naturally, the color is a Carmel brown and looks like I have natural highlights, it covered my grays and didn&#x27;t pull any red and doesn&#x27;t look brassy at all..</li>
            <li>It is a soft black and I really wanted the color lifted rather than bleached to a brown color.  </li>
            <li>(I also heard asian hair tends to have natural red hues in general?)</li>
            <li>I love the effect of my soft black hair&#x27;s subtle gradation to the brown from roots to tips.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Do not buy and waste your money unless you want to end up paying a professional to fix it!!!</li>
            <li> This probably wouldn&#x27;t work on super dark hair, but it works well for changing tones and going a few shades lighter.</li>
            <li> or you just want to lighten your natural dark hair</li>
            <li> I have dark brown natural hair but tons of grays</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having gotten over my fear of dye, the next day I went on a dye rampage (not advisable given the fact that no professional has ever colored my hair</li>
            <li> Once in a while I go do some highlights in a salon to avoid a &#x27;flat&#x27; color effect, and it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I have to do my roots every month on my long hair, it would cost me a fortune to go to the hairdresser all the time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reason I gave it a three was because I have very thin and fine hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was the right shade of subtle dark brown.</li>
            <li> with dark brown asian hair I dyed this on virgin hair expecting some lightening after leaving it in for 40 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My hair is now dark blonde</li>
            <li> Naturally I assumed this would come out at least somewhat close to the color I purchased (UL61).</li>
            <li> I figure 20+ years of no chemical processes and then 4 box dyes in 24 hours should balance each other out.  </li>
            <li> Definitely one of the very few products that has worked...</li>
            <li> I expected an ash brown, not a warm red brown.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the colors and products that work for for me at home, we this past fall, I used one of the same products I always use and it turned my hair pitch black.</li>
            <li> The effect was so subtle, I could barely tell anything had been done to my hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> One burgundy faded to an orangy-Brown,  I dyed it a dark burgundy</li>
            <li> I have medium to dark auburn hair</li>
            <li> but my bleached ends turned dark ash blond.  </li>
            <li> My poor cats won&#x27;t come near me</li>
            <li> This toned it down a lot.</li>
            <li> so I have almost black hair</li>
            <li> but it turned my hair black.</li>
            <li> I got one of the hi-lift products from another company and it almost looked like it made the black darker</li>
            <li> It also stripped away the black...</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a little background of my hair.</li>
            <li> bevause I already so little hair</li>
            <li> My hair was a little lighter than the lightest shade recommended on the shade guide on the side of the box</li>
            <li> It dried my hair out a bit and the color was a little orange.</li>
            <li> I had colored my hair a very dark brown- nearlyblack-</li>
            <li> and I got a little bit of formula on my skin, well it BURNED!</li>
            <li> Not sure how or why, but no matter what I tried it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Some people may be getting crazy colors because of what they put in their hair or dyed their hair with last, idk.</li>
            <li> The color lifted at least two shades of brown, which was good.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Wait at least 4 weeks invetween..</li>
            <li> I wanted a subtle ombre effect</li>
            <li> My hair get&#x27;s a REALLY ugly red in the summer when I&#x27;m in the Sun.</li>
            <li> I hated it so much</li>
            <li> and I can barely stand myself :(</li>
            <li> I got addicted.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a little bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> i was nervous to try this product and some of the reviews were so vague and misleading since no one seems to specify what color they are using.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see what could go wrong.</li>
            <li> Fail, Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mad and upset</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Did not lighten my hair as much as I was hoping.  It may lighten more over time, but it certainly did not look like the color showed on the box.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;VE CHANGED MY MIND.....&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of washings my hair looked really nice, it did lighten up.  So if you have dyed your hair a darker shade and want to lighten it up or you just want to lighten your natural dark hair I would recommend :)  John 14:6</li>
            <li> My hair get&#x27;s a REALLY ugly red in the summer when I&#x27;m in the Sun. I have to use an Ash Color This toned it down a lot. I had to do my end&#x27;s for 10 minutes and then all over for another 15-20. My hair tend&#x27;s to not dye evenly if I don&#x27;t do it this way. Even when I pay A TON of Money at Salon&#x27;s. I&#x27;m very happy with this color. I have been dying my hair for 30 year&#x27;s and  have tried almost every color. I used to use Feria, but I&#x27;m sold on this now!!!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a little background of my hair. I&#x27;m asian so I have almost black hair but I had dyed it burgundy. One burgundy faded to an orangy-Brown,  I dyed it a dark burgundy but it turned my hair black. I hated it so much so I did everything I could to fade it so it kind if faded. Then I put this hairdye on and it definitely lightened my hair however not like the box (box didn&#x27;t recommend for already dyed hair) but like I said, it definitely lifted my hair color considerin that I originally had black hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason I gave it a three was because I have very thin and fine hair. All the other dyes that I&#x27;ve used was ammonia free so I had no hair fall out but after this product (has ammonia), I literally lost way too many hair. I&#x27;m mad and upset bevause I already so little hair but this made me lose hair for two days. I lost like combs full of hair. I&#x27;m not even joking. I wanted to cry. However, that might be just me because of I guess I&#x27;m sensitive to ammonia. Like others said it smells horrendous and you won&#x27;t get the same box results unless u have virgin hair but it will still lighten your hair. I went from blackish red to maybe the medium brown but in the sun its much lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Def try it out if you want to however i won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> i was nervous to try this product and some of the reviews were so vague and misleading since no one seems to specify what color they are using. I had great results with the hi lift ash brown. I have medium to dark auburn hair and I wanted to get the red tones out and go normal brown. The lightener in the product made my eyes water at first until I opened the bathroom window but after that it didn&#x27;t bother me. Follow the instructions exactly and I don&#x27;t see what could go wrong. Some people may be getting crazy colors because of what they put in their hair or dyed their hair with last, idk. This somehow covered all the red in my hair and lightened it as well and I think it looks pretty close the picture on the box. Also it makes my hair smell really fresh and didn&#x27;t damage my hair at all. This probably wouldn&#x27;t work on super dark hair, but it works well for changing tones and going a few shades lighter. Overall I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> UL61 is the first at-home coloring product that hasn&#x27;t left me super duper red tones. I followed the directions exactly... so put it on everything but the roots for 20 minutes, and then the roots for 10.  I debated doing this as I have short hair--but decided I should follow the directions regardless and it turned out perfectly.  I&#x27;m super happy.  I just wish they&#x27;d make this formula in foam.  Hopefully one of these days.  Amazon subscribe-and-save is the best way to buy it.  Cheaper than the store, plus guaranteed that it will arrive when you need it.</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair exactly as the directions said and it literally dyed only my roots its a nice color wish it came out completely I&#x27;ll have to redo it</li>
            <li> My hair saga is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;I have never dyed my hair before so I had the requisite virgin hair. It is a soft black and I really wanted the color lifted rather than bleached to a brown color.  I wanted to stay away from bleach because I did not want my hair to turn orange.&lt;br /&gt;So I chose the L&#x27;oreal Paris sun-kissed caramels UL51 hi-lift natural brown.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to dyeing, I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for a day. I followed the instructions.  I wanted a subtle ombre effect so I only applied the dye from chin length to the ends. I left it on for 30 minutes. The effect was so subtle, I could barely tell anything had been done to my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Having gotten over my fear of dye, the next day I went on a dye rampage (not advisable given the fact that no professional has ever colored my hair - I just watched a lot of Youtube videos).&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to stay with the ash/cooler dyes to avoid the orange effect so I chose the L&#x27;oreal sun-kissed caramels UL61 hi-lift ash brown. I washed my hair first with a clarifying shampoo, blowdried then followed the directions. The color lifted at least two shades of brown, which was good.&lt;br /&gt;But I didn&#x27;t stop there. I then washed my hair again with a clarifying shampoo, blowdried, then applied Garnier Olia 6.3 light golden brown (which, by the way smells amazing. The L&#x27;Oreal has ammonia and made my nose run and my eyes burn). It made it darker. Not good.&lt;br /&gt;So I washed my hair again with a clarifying shampoo, blowdried, then applied another layer of the L&#x27;oreal sun-kissed caramels UL61 hi-lift ash brown. My hair was the right shade of subtle dark brown. I love the effect of my soft black hair&#x27;s subtle gradation to the brown from roots to tips.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re fearing for the damage to my hair, you&#x27;re not alone. I figure 20+ years of no chemical processes and then 4 box dyes in 24 hours should balance each other out.  Anyway, I applied the Pantene overnight miracle to my hair and now my hair feels even softer than before.&lt;br /&gt;The next day my hair lightened even more so it is now a rich chocolate brown.&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict: If I had to do it all over again - I would have skipped L&#x27;oreal Paris sun-kissed caramels UL51 hi-lift natural brown and just used the L&#x27;Oreal sun-kissed caramels UL61 hi-lift ash brown the first time around.</li>
            <li> It made my top roots orange and the bottom the same color dark brown how i had it before dying it..... i dont recommend it. But every hair is different. . Go get it done by a professional.</li>
            <li> I love this color and it suits me very well. Thank you.</li>
            <li> If I could give this color 0 stars I would. My hair has not been colored before. Complete virgin hair. Naturally I assumed this would come out at least somewhat close to the color I purchased (UL61). I have naturally medium brown ashy color hair about a level 4 or 5. I put this on my ends for 20 minutes, then put the color on the roots for 10 minutes EXACTLY as it instructed. After washing my hair I see that the color is now a medium reddish brown with orange looking roots!! What did I miss?? I have not colored my hair before and I did exactly what the instructions said. So why am I left with reddish brown hair that is maybe one shade lighter than what I started with?! Very upset with this product. Now that my hair is colored I will have to use bleach or color remover which is completely damaging to my hair just to get my hair lighter. I am so upset with this product and the results. Do not buy and waste your money unless you want to end up paying a professional to fix it!!!</li>
            <li> It really works better than others to cover stubborn gray and lightens my dark hair well! Still have to add additive to avoid brassiness and red tones.</li>
            <li> This turned my hair from black/brown to burnt orange.  My husband is a Texas Longhorns fan so he loves it but it&#x27;s not his hair on his head and I&#x27;m a little bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> LOVE the COLOR! I have DARK BROWN HAIR and this gives me a really pretty Gold color with Reddish highlights. I would have given it a 5 STAR rating HOWEVER ,the ammonia smell while you wait for it to process is KILLER! My poor cats won&#x27;t come near me and I can barely stand myself :( It does look good but the fumes have me searching for same results, different product.</li>
            <li> Well I do NOT have virgin hair, lost it at 12 when I put Sun-in in my hair.  I have dark brown natural hair but tons of grays so I use box dye for my roots every 3-4 weeks.  I bought this to possibly add to my some of what ombré look I have left.  So I tested two strands to see results and it did lighten my hair maybe a shade but what ever brassiness my hair had it worked well as a toner.  So therefore nice toner but did not come even close to the color it shows on the box</li>
            <li> I received this item much more quickly than I had hoped and at a fantastic price. L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Hi-Lift products seem to provide the best anti-brass protection in hair color.</li>
            <li> I received this item on time. Well, I should rephrase. I received something I didn&#x27;t order on time and in great condition! I received a product in the Sun Kissed Caramels line of products when I ordered an ASH brown. Ash is not caramel. I&#x27;m scared to use it and guess what? I CAN&#x27;T RETURN IT BECAUSE APPARENTLY IT&#x27;S HAZARDOUS. I will, however, enjoy the conditioner that was included and might consider re-purposing the developer. Just not with a caramel color. Caveat emptor, you won&#x27;t get what you ordered. Fail, Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have medium brown hair and I used this to lighten it so I could apply red dye on. It dried my hair out a bit and the color was a little orange. It&#x27;s fine for a quick lightening without bleaching if you are going to use vegetable dye, but I would not recommend for a natural hair color.</li>
            <li> I have never once written a review for anything, although I read reviews on everything. I have very fair skin, freckles, hazel eyes.. My hairs always been a medium brown with red in it, ive always had my hair professionally highlighted or colored. About a year ago, i began using box colors to cover the grays because I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep having it done professionally.  I&#x27;ve found the colors and products that work for for me at home, we this past fall, I used one of the same products I always use and it turned my hair pitch black. Not sure how or why, but no matter what I tried it didn&#x27;t work. I got one of the hi-lift products from another company and it almost looked like it made the black darker, I was so stressed out.. I let it fade out for a couple of months, my gray hair was filling In and I had no idea what to do. I bought the hi-lift ash brown UL61, and like many others stated, I waited a week to use it because I was not sure if I wanted too... Finally on impulse i used it and cannot believe how well it worked.. I have red in my hair naturally, the color is a Carmel brown and looks like I have natural highlights, it covered my grays and didn&#x27;t pull any red and doesn&#x27;t look brassy at all.. It also stripped away the black... I am truly truly impressed because I have tried so mang other products and this really surprised me. Definitely one of the very few products that has worked...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A helpful tip- don&#x27;t use it right after using another box color, it will only make the hair draker.. Wait at least 4 weeks invetween..</li>
            <li> My hair was a little lighter than the lightest shade recommended on the shade guide on the side of the box but I nearly got the exact same shade as advertised on the front of the box. I&#x27;m  just concerned about my curls because they fell a bit after using this which would probably have to do with the overpowering ammonia that was burning my eyes while applying the product. And my hair is more brittle and dry, which I did expect to happen with using box dyes (though I didn&#x27;t get this result from using L&#x27;oreal Excellence Creme Triple Protection color, but I didn&#x27;t see the color results from that product as did this one, go figure). So after deep conditioning my hair a couple times hopefully it will revive because I certainly got the color I wanted :)</li>
            <li> This product did nothing to my hair. It didn&#x27;t lighten it at all, just made it kinda shinier...slightly. it also damaged it. My hair, which was smooth and silky before, turned crunchy. Also, the fumes are so strong and I got a little bit of formula on my skin, well it BURNED!</li>
            <li> I obtained this dye after reading some good reviews.  Yet I also read some bad.&lt;br /&gt;Starting with dark brown asian hair I dyed this on virgin hair expecting some lightening after leaving it in for 40 minutes.  The ends of my hair were bleached from before so the result? My hair turned into a beautiful color but not what I expected. Red hues  showed instead but my bleached ends turned dark ash blond.  The application was even but not the color I wanted.  I expected an ash brown, not a warm red brown.  I do like however how this product lightened my hair without drying it out.  My friend did mention I should dye my hair the same color and I&#x27;ll get the end result I originally want. (I also heard asian hair tends to have natural red hues in general?) I will try this product again.</li>
            <li> I had colored my hair a very dark brown- nearlyblack- several years ago and wanted to lighten it gradually. This color &amp;#34;hi lift ash brown&amp;#34; was perfect. My hair is now dark blonde and i&#x27;m loving the color.</li>
            <li> I used to live in the States and since I discovered this specific color I got addicted. I&#x27;m a real brunette and this is the only color that will NOT turn my hair red; it will give me a true dark blond color without the redness. As I have to do my roots every month on my long hair, it would cost me a fortune to go to the hairdresser all the time. This color allows me to do my own touch ups easily every month. Once in a while I go do some highlights in a salon to avoid a &#x27;flat&#x27; color effect, and it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I moved to Europe, I have been struggling to find this number and I ended up buying from Amazon US and shipping it to Switzerland. I buy like 10 at the time so that the duty / shipping costs are worth it.</li>
            <li> The item that is pictured is totally different from what you will be sent! My normal color is  Preference True Brunettes Ultra Light Ash Brown UL61 but what you will be shipped is Superior Preference Sun-Kissed Caramels, Hi-Lift Ash Brown UL61 which is a darker shade(more brassy in shade). So before you order this item just know...what is pictured isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s being sent.</li>
