    <ol>
            <li>I recommend talking to a stylist about how to make it work best with your hair and what look you&#x27;re trying to get.</li>

            <li>Absolute best for fine hair!</li>
            <li>This stuff is a miracle for those with fine hair!</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite styling products.</li>
            <li>It may do better in a dryer climate.    </li>
            <li>&quot; tops with many holes.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and have used it for years.</li>
            <li>Granted some people don&#x27;t like that effect, but when it gets later in the day for me it is absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I have never found another product that provides better volume that this.</li>
            <li>It adds way more than 20% more volume for me.</li>
            <li>My hair is super fine, the kind of fine</li>
            <li>For me it easily doubles my hair volume- and does so without leaving any trace of a product-y feel in my hair.</li>
            <li>When used correctly, it give great results that last all day.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS ITEM, it gives my curls so much volume</li>
            <li>Love this just don&#x27;t sprinkle too much</li>
            <li>The powder is extremely sensitive to any kind of moisture in the air.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I end up adding too much</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best hair product I have EVER found.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I live in St Louis and we&#x27;ve got really high humidity.  </li>
            <li>: too much of the products will make your hair look very oily and clumpy, especially on clean hair, so I normally save it until I need it.</li>
            <li>I do like the single hole in the top as I have more control, unlike the \\&quot;salt shaker-like\\</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really worth the money.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, it is light and works brilliantly for providing volume and that \\&quot;pieced\\&quot; look.  </li>
            <li>It worked well the first couple of times I used it</li>
            <li>It makes my bangs soooo much thicker and super clean; the oily/separated look is completely gone.</li>
            <li>I have used others that add more volume than this one, but I didn&#x27;t like the texture it left on my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair has body, especially where I need it; in the front and on the top.  </li>
            <li>This product was either damaged or old or not as originally made by Aveda.  </li>
            <li>a very light amount by tapping the product on the hair while damp and blow dry</li>
            <li>Too much money for something that doesn&#x27;t work consistently.</li>
            <li>It is a really good product to enhance body in hair, specially talking about thin hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this on the recommendation of a friend who absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>However, when I opened the bottle purchased through Amazon.com, it was a watery and very sticky.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could give it 4.5 stars because it really does work very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much volume this really adds.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and thin on the top and front and always seemed to lay really flat on top...</li>
            <li>but I already use the shampoos meant for older women with thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t buy it again because of the high price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got short, fine hair and this product seems to glob, even when I barely sprinkle.  </li>
            <li>, I mix it into my hair gel and then apply my gel like normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one for fancy mousses or serums (however I probably should be), but this is one thing I really can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>With a quick blow dry, you look presentable to the office cohorts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a problem after its in your hair, but it&#x27;s a pain to deal with when you&#x27;re trying to store the bottle in a super dry place.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle - the first was given to me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m twenty years old</li>
            <li>I like soft bouncy curls so the gel i use is from Deva.</li>
            <li>Works very well on thin fine hair, even in high humidity.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>This works best when your hair is a little dirty because it dries your hair.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s pretty short) but it didn&#x27;t seem to stay that long.    </li>
            <li>As completely cheesy as this sounds, I really cannot stress this enough: this Hair Potion is literally magic.</li>
            <li>A  tiny, TINY, TINY sprinkle of this (as evenly distributed as possible) straight onto my bangs and combed through makes it look like I just finished drying my hair-</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s true....</li>
            <li>If you have fine or thin hair this product is a home run.</li>

            <li> If you have fine or thin hair this product is a home run.</li>
            <li> but after the 3rd or 4th time, my hair felt dry and strawlike.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a powder that turns to liquid and that makes it hard to figure out how much you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li> This product is different from any other I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Not as much of a hold as some other similar products, but honestly needing to refresh every other day isn&#x27;t that horrible.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the annoyance of losing half the stuff if you forget about the moisture issue and accidentally leave it in the bathroom where moisture from the shower can get into the bottle.</li>
            <li> Just what was expected</li>
            <li> Your hair will also probably stick out at strange angles if you sleep with the product in, so if you&#x27;re intending on spending the night and want to look presentable in the morning, I&#x27;d save the product for morning vs. night- at least until you can actually wash your hair.  </li>
            <li> Allows you to mess your hair up a bit and not worry all to much about spots looking thin.</li>
            <li> far as daily use, it is expensive and yes goopy even when you know how to use it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, like magic, it&#x27;s a little difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> You sprinkle a little on your hands and the rub into your hair.  </li>
            <li> Once even a little moisture gets in the bottle, a lot of the powder gets ruined.</li>
            <li> but it defintely is something someone with a little bit of thinning going on should get a hold of.</li>
            <li> and this helps add a little volume and hold style for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Just a few sprinkles gives body and volume!</li>
            <li> For small areas like your bangs.</li>
            <li> and it still feels icky in your hair.</li>
            <li> Very, very small bottle.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and used a very small amount</li>
            <li> My hair is also embarrassingly thin-</li>
            <li> So, of course, my bangs are also terribly embarrassingly thin, and become extremely oily by 6-7 pm everyday.  </li>
            <li> Works, but if you shake the bottle itgels up and becomes totally useless</li>
            <li> I literally have to take a shower every day, sometimes twice a day if I&#x27;m going out, I&#x27;ve tried the every other day thing and my hair becomes absolutely disgusting.</li>
            <li> So what happens when you don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair and are making a mad dash out the door?  </li>
            <li> Very expensive product</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just what was expected</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite styling products. I recommend talking to a stylist about how to make it work best with your hair and what look you&#x27;re trying to get. A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s true....don&#x27;t shake it. When used correctly, it give great results that last all day.</li>
            <li> This product is different from any other I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s a powder that turns to liquid and that makes it hard to figure out how much you&#x27;re using. It worked well the first couple of times I used it but after the 3rd or 4th time, my hair felt dry and strawlike. I don&#x27;t think you can use it everyday. Just once or twice a week. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. Too much money for something that doesn&#x27;t work consistently.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on the recommendation of a friend who absolutely loves it.  She did tell me not to shake the bottle or the powder will turn to liquid.  Unfortunately mine did shake a bit in shipping, however most was still in powder form.  You sprinkle a little on your hands and the rub into your hair.  It did make my hair a bit fuller (it&#x27;s pretty short) but it didn&#x27;t seem to stay that long.    To be fair, I live in St Louis and we&#x27;ve got really high humidity.  It may do better in a dryer climate.    My friend has longer and thicker hair than I do and it does well for her.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me.    Thank you.  MEF</li>
            <li> Very, very small bottle. Works as good as DustIt.  I do like the single hole in the top as I have more control, unlike the \\&quot;salt shaker-like\\&quot; tops with many holes.  Won&#x27;t buy it again because of the high price.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that works like it does.  A little goes a long way, it is light and works brilliantly for providing volume and that \\&quot;pieced\\&quot; look.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This works best when your hair is a little dirty because it dries your hair. Only use a litlel and don&#x27;t shake the bottle.  I love this stuff and have used it for years.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best hair product I have EVER found. I&#x27;m not one for fancy mousses or serums (however I probably should be), but this is one thing I really can&#x27;t live without. I just stumbled upon it about a month ago when I was getting my bangs trimmed at an Aveda Institute.   Description of My Hair  My hair is super fine, the kind of fine you can&#x27;t get away from. That, combined with my incredibly oily face and scalp, is just a disaster. I literally have to take a shower every day, sometimes twice a day if I&#x27;m going out, I&#x27;ve tried the every other day thing and my hair becomes absolutely disgusting. My hair is also embarrassingly thin- I&#x27;m twenty years old but I already use the shampoos meant for older women with thinning hair. So, of course, my bangs are also terribly embarrassingly thin, and become extremely oily by 6-7 pm everyday.  How I Use the Product/Product Results  A  tiny, TINY, TINY sprinkle of this (as evenly distributed as possible) straight onto my bangs and combed through makes it look like I just finished drying my hair- NO- like I just left a salon. It makes my bangs soooo much thicker and super clean; the oily/separated look is completely gone. Granted some people don&#x27;t like that effect, but when it gets later in the day for me it is absolutely perfect. WARNING though: too much of the products will make your hair look very oily and clumpy, especially on clean hair, so I normally save it until I need it. Your hair will also probably stick out at strange angles if you sleep with the product in, so if you&#x27;re intending on spending the night and want to look presentable in the morning, I&#x27;d save the product for morning vs. night- at least until you can actually wash your hair.  As completely cheesy as this sounds, I really cannot stress this enough: this Hair Potion is literally magic.</li>
            <li> A friend let me borrow this, and I immediately had to buy it. Especially great for summer humidity. Gives great volume, washes out clean.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle for those with fine hair! Love it! Just a few sprinkles gives body and volume!</li>
            <li> Absolute best for fine hair!</li>
            <li> This product is clumpy in your hair. I followed the instructions and used a very small amount and it still feels icky in your hair.</li>
            <li> This product was either damaged or old or not as originally made by Aveda.  When my stylist used her own bottle, it came out as a powder and worked wonderfully.  However, when I opened the bottle purchased through Amazon.com, it was a watery and very sticky.  I will purchase from a certified Aveda location in the future to be assured I get what is supposed to be in the bottle.</li>
            <li> This Is a wonderful Product. It gives your body Especially where it thinning. I would recommend this Product to anyone!</li>
            <li> It is a really good product to enhance body in hair, specially talking about thin hair. Aveda is the best Brand.</li>
            <li> This product definitely adds volume and does what it claims. I have used others that add more volume than this one, but I didn&#x27;t like the texture it left on my hair. This product keep hair silky with volume rather than powdery.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle - the first was given to me.  I&#x27;ve got short, fine hair and this product seems to glob, even when I barely sprinkle.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my lack of experience and knowledge using it, but I was hopeful that it would be lighter than a paste . . . would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Works, but if you shake the bottle itgels up and becomes totally useless</li>
            <li> So what happens when you don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair and are making a mad dash out the door?  Throw on a scarf? Try again.  Rub a dime sized amount of this gunk into your palms and then massage into crown at roots. With a quick blow dry, you look presentable to the office cohorts.&lt;br /&gt;As far as daily use, it is expensive and yes goopy even when you know how to use it so I would save for the above referenced scenario.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS ITEM, it gives my curls so much volume, I mix it into my hair gel and then apply my gel like normal. I like soft bouncy curls so the gel i use is from Deva. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Works very well on thin fine hair, even in high humidity. Apply to roots of hair to give tons of body.</li>
            <li> If you have fine or thin hair this product is a home run. I have never found another product that provides better volume that this.</li>
            <li> Love this just don&#x27;t sprinkle too much</li>
            <li> Works like magic! Unfortunately, like magic, it&#x27;s a little difficult to manage. The powder is extremely sensitive to any kind of moisture in the air. This isn&#x27;t a problem after its in your hair, but it&#x27;s a pain to deal with when you&#x27;re trying to store the bottle in a super dry place. Once even a little moisture gets in the bottle, a lot of the powder gets ruined. I wish I could give it 4.5 stars because it really does work very well. I would even say that it undersells itself for some people. It adds way more than 20% more volume for me. For me it easily doubles my hair volume- and does so without leaving any trace of a product-y feel in my hair. The only downside is the annoyance of losing half the stuff if you forget about the moisture issue and accidentally leave it in the bathroom where moisture from the shower can get into the bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much volume this really adds. Most of the time I end up adding too much and then my hair looks greasy and feels sticky. Wasn&#x27;t really worth the money.</li>
            <li> It defintely adds thickness and density to your hair. As everyone says not a miracle but it defintely is something someone with a little bit of thinning going on should get a hold of. Allows you to mess your hair up a bit and not worry all to much about spots looking thin.</li>
            <li> a real magic potion! Gives hair amazing volume at the roots for about an hour. Just wished it lasted a bit longer.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works well</li>
            <li> For small areas like your bangs. Not for all over hair use. No directions on the bottle. Check the directions with a supplier before you buy!</li>
            <li> Great and vegan. Not as much of a hold as some other similar products, but honestly needing to refresh every other day isn&#x27;t that horrible.</li>
            <li> Great product with clean scent</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair and this helps add a little volume and hold style for me.</li>
            <li> Very expensive product</li>
            <li> My hair has body, especially where I need it; in the front and on the top.  My hair is fine and thin on the top and front and always seemed to lay really flat on top...now, it is styled and normal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a very light amount by tapping the product on the hair while damp and blow dry</li>
