            <li>I love the scent of this - mild and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Vitamins are very important for skin protection too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth, quick-absorbing, and smells delish.</li>

            <li>I just love using it, it feels so nourishing on my face.  </li>
            <li>Favorite moisturizer to date.</li>
            <li>I love looove this sunscreen...</li>
            <li>ONLY thing that would make it Absolutely Perfect for me, would be if they made it tinted!</li>
            <li>which will consist of more sun and hikes.</li>
            <li>Love how organic it is...</li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>I always make sure to buy one before I run out</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product.  </li>
            <li>I have many allergies and have found that I tolerate this sun screen well.  </li>
            <li>Will order again! :)</li>
            <li>I so wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>I thought it was more of a cream.</li>
            <li>I mostly use this as a moisturizer under my BB cream.</li>
            <li>Lasts longer than many others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This product has too many chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d do it again :)</li>
            <li>Been using it on myself and my kids for two summers now and LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and no one gets burned.</li>
            <li>i love this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>I will not be able to use this for the sun again.</li>
            <li>Much better than spending $25 for 1 oz.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent, covers like lotion vs sunscreen.</li>
            <li>We just love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Have used this many times before and will keep using it..</li>
            <li>It is my experience if the ingredient list has more than 5 ingredients it is a chemical bomb.</li>
            <li>We love this line of products.  </li>
            <li>- love the smell and feel.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have top wear sunscreen all the time, even in the winter.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is the ingredient list</li>
            <li>Would also love to see it come in a pump bottle.</li>
            <li>I love this since</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using it and will reorder when the time comes.</li>
            <li>Love it - doesn&#x27;t sting my very sensitive skin - great for my face</li>
            <li>smells so good and really protects you!</li>
            <li>Great product, amazing actually.</li>
            <li>love the smell, but it is strong and may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li>So strong that I will not be able to use</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am happy with this 70% natural organic sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wear it for more than a day as I smelt like a cheap lady of the night.</li>
            <li>Wishing it were available in more stores.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, happy and protected</li>
            <li>Best sunscreen in the absolute, positively huge world that we live in today.</li>
            <li>goes on easily and blends well.</li>
            <li>It had a really really strong smell.</li>
            <li>and it is really strong.</li>
            <li>We first found it at a zoo when I forgot to bring our own.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen,  the natural and effective moisturing qualities and the LACK of harmful additives make the Naked Bee products perfect for our household</li>
            <li>Hands down the best smell ever!!!</li>
            <li>I try LOTS of new organic skin care products and this by far is one of the best face SPF lotions I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Tocopherol acetate is not oxidized and can penetrate through the skin to the living cells, where about 5% is converted to free tocopherol, and provides beneficial antioxidant effects.    </li>
            <li>My dye free family loves this stuff.  </li>
            <li>that is dye free.  </li>
            <li>Now that the cast is off I can use this, it feels good on the  skin, so far I like it quite a bit.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Got on time and very well packeged!!!</li>
            <li>The ingredients are safe for me and my 4 year old grand daughter (who also loves the smell).  </li>
            <li>This is an overall good product and is my sunscreen of choice.</li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of sweet tarts</li>
            <li>BUT the smell is sickerly sweet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only sunblock I&#x27;ve found that is organic and smells really good.</li>
            <li>Some people complain of the smell, I found it to be mild-smelling and sweet, so</li>
            <li>Having a cool name and hiding ingredients from the website doesn&#x27;t cut it with me.</li>
            <li>This product is gentle on the skin, created no greasy film, and even smells lovely.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tested this in harsh sun, but it&#x27;s brilliant.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad either.  </li>
            <li>If you only want a nice smell and moisturizer, then it is fine.</li>
            <li>It also gets into your eyes very easily even though you don&#x27;t place it anywhere near your eyes.</li>
            <li>I love the way the cream is not sticky, it smells amazing, and I don&#x27;t count down the minutes until it can be washed off.  </li>
            <li>but I am bright pink.</li>
            <li>Too Many chemicals that help cause cancer for 70 percent natural</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a more natural sunscreen and hoped this would be &amp;#34;the One&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I love knowing it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>Being sensitive to many foods I read the the labels on everything.</li>
            <li>You get a ton for your money (compared to other lotion-sunscreen combos out there), it smells like heaven (VERY orange-y and fresh), and it feels great.</li>
            <li>I love it so much, and highly give this 10 stars if Amazon let me.</li>
            <li>I discovered this the hard way after a very innocent and enjoyable ride wakeboarding.</li>
            <li>In the market for a natural sunscreen, so many positive reviews but one reviewer raised a flag about the cancer causing ingredients they use (just because 70% ingredients are organic</li>
            <li>Would recommend if you, your entire family and everyone you&#x27;ll ever likely meet suffer from anosmia.&lt;br /&gt;If not expect to be hit on by rich sugar daddies looking for a $20 good time.</li>
            <li>I love knowing this is made from mostly organic ingredients, and its pretty reasonably priced compared to other brands out there.</li>
            <li>Noticed a difference within the first week.</li>
            <li>I love Naked Bee products.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast!</li>
            <li>Most sunscreens left my face feeling even dryer after application but my skin is drinking this stuff up!  </li>
            <li>As it is just April it has not been tested in the really hot sun, but I am hopeful.  </li>
            <li>Does the trick, thanks!</li>
            <li>The difficulty that I&#x27;ve had with many products is either that they create a visible white film or that they sting my skin.</li>
            <li>But for the first time in my life (and I grew up in Florida)</li>
            <li>Lots of organic components, not nearly as scary (in terms of chemicals) as the majority of sunscreens out there.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I fight over it, if there isn&#x27;t much left :)</li>
            <li>is like applying body lotion instead of paste like most sunscreen that&#x27;s leaves white mark</li>
            <li>But the trouble I have finding a reasonably priced, GOOD tint in a tinted sunscreen...</li>
            <li>Very soft and creamy, goes on so smooths and easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>It smells great, makes my skin softer, protects me from the sun&#x27;s damaging rays, without a lot of the bad stuff that more mainstream products contain.  </li>
            <li>(Vitamins should really be listed in the description.)</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle and I have a desert trip coming up</li>
            <li>I paid $13 for it and haven&#x27;t had the heart to look to see how much I may have over paid.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Price and shipped fast</li>
            <li>I was out in the sun for a couple of hours and was very sunburned.</li>
            <li>If you are struggling as I was to find a good quality product that moisturizes and protects in one step at a great value without a ton of nasty chemicals, then this is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>Goes on really well.  </li>
            <li>As I sit here typing this with my boiling, flaming shoulders, it is a sure reminder to me to always put on plenty of sunscreen in the future... and to read the label on the bottle clearly stating it is not water-proof.</li>
            <li>So another product in the trash as it would be more trouble than it is worth to refund it.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Just a fair warning too all you other sun and beach lovers, remember to reapply often, especially after getting in the water.</li>
            <li>I have used other Naked Bee products and loved them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to smells &amp; there is no way I could put this on my whole body.</li>
            <li>Finally, a natural sunscreen that is reasonably priced!  </li>
            <li>Tried on my teenage daughter who is struggling with mild acne.</li>
            <li>I work as a lifeguard and use many different sunscreens of all brands, even generic.  </li>
            <li>The main thing for me: the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>We put a little more on the children but it didn&#x27;t seem to greasy to me</li>
            <li>The honey scent and creaminess make use of sunscreen easy and routine as opposed to the drying agents in other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I would 100% recommend this product to anyone looking for a new moisturizer</li>
            <li>I live in Miami</li>
            <li>Really really irritated another $12 down the drain because a company did not give full disclosure on its product.</li>
            <li>this got high marks on a consumer web site for safety and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Fine lines seem less noticeable and gives skin a youthful glow.</li>
            <li>Been using it for 2 years now and can&#x27;t go back to other stuff :)</li>
            <li>Hopefully next time I will get exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>No one likes to have a spray sunblock anywhere near their faces!</li>
            <li>Very matte, no thick white residue.</li>
            <li>My previous sunscreen/day cream (Olay Total effects SPF 15) seemed provided better protection from tanning that this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely plan to buy it again next summer as well as the stick.</li>
            <li>Now, I never have to worry about sun damage to my hands and it keeps my hands soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m typically sensitive to scents</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a chalky white residue and it absorbs into the skin really fast.</li>
            <li>and I got very greasy, so I would only recommend it for body use.</li>
            <li>The biggest offenders in this sunscreen claiming to be natural are oxybenzone (hormone disrupting chemical) and retinyl palmitate (may damage sun exposed skin).</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t mean the rest are safe).</li>
            <li>I bought this in Ocean City New Jersey this weekend and used it on my second day at the beach.</li>
            <li>I then spent a few hours under the blistering heat waves of the sun under a spot where there is surely a hole in the ozone.</li>
            <li>I rubbed a very small place on my hand to see how strong the smell is</li>
            <li>I used it on my two year old last summer every time we went swimming</li>
            <li>This is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The negative reviews are from people who should be using a sun block product due to being very light skinned.</li>
            <li>I forgot to apply any sunscreen to my lower back (new swimsuit), and my lower back looks the same as my upper back, where plenty of this sunscreen was applied.</li>

            <li> As a Floridian, who is in the sun frequently, I can&#x27;t live without this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with it and use it more because it feels and smells good.</li>
            <li> Ok so this is some really good smelling sunscreen, i love that.</li>

            <li> It smells good and seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and goes on smooth and smells good too.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizer and sunscreen that I have come across.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for my somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The lotion smelled great, went on smooth not greasy, and rubbed in easily.</li>
            <li> Not only is this is a very effective sunscreen, it smells wonderful and has a rich, emollient, non greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this - mild and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Vitamins are very important for skin protection too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth, quick-absorbing, and smells delish.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and is an effective blocker.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is amazing, it works great and is all natural which is very important to me.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I just love using it, it feels so nourishing on my face.  </li>
            <li> Favorite moisturizer to date.</li>
            <li> I love looove this sunscreen...</li>
            <li> ONLY thing that would make it Absolutely Perfect for me, would be if they made it tinted!</li>
            <li> which will consist of more sun and hikes.</li>
            <li> Love how organic it is...</li>
            <li> My favorite.</li>
            <li> I always make sure to buy one before I run out</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product.  </li>
            <li> I have many allergies and have found that I tolerate this sun screen well.  </li>
            <li> Will order again! :)</li>
            <li> I so wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li> I thought it was more of a cream.</li>
            <li> I mostly use this as a moisturizer under my BB cream.</li>
            <li> Lasts longer than many others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This product has too many chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d do it again :)</li>
            <li> Been using it on myself and my kids for two summers now and LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and no one gets burned.</li>
            <li> i love this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> I will not be able to use this for the sun again.</li>
            <li> Much better than spending $25 for 1 oz.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent, covers like lotion vs sunscreen.</li>
            <li> We just love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Have used this many times before and will keep using it..</li>
            <li> It is my experience if the ingredient list has more than 5 ingredients it is a chemical bomb.</li>
            <li> We love this line of products.  </li>
            <li> - love the smell and feel.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have top wear sunscreen all the time, even in the winter.</li>
            <li> My favorite part is the ingredient list</li>
            <li> Would also love to see it come in a pump bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this since</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using it and will reorder when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Love it - doesn&#x27;t sting my very sensitive skin - great for my face</li>
            <li> smells so good and really protects you!</li>
            <li> Great product, amazing actually.</li>
            <li> love the smell, but it is strong and may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> So strong that I will not be able to use</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am happy with this 70% natural organic sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wear it for more than a day as I smelt like a cheap lady of the night.</li>
            <li> Wishing it were available in more stores.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, happy and protected</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen in the absolute, positively huge world that we live in today.</li>
            <li> goes on easily and blends well.</li>
            <li> It had a really really strong smell.</li>
            <li> and it is really strong.</li>
            <li> We first found it at a zoo when I forgot to bring our own.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen,  the natural and effective moisturing qualities and the LACK of harmful additives make the Naked Bee products perfect for our household</li>
            <li> Hands down the best smell ever!!!</li>
            <li> I try LOTS of new organic skin care products and this by far is one of the best face SPF lotions I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Tocopherol acetate is not oxidized and can penetrate through the skin to the living cells, where about 5% is converted to free tocopherol, and provides beneficial antioxidant effects.    </li>
            <li> My dye free family loves this stuff.  </li>
            <li> that is dye free.  </li>
            <li> Now that the cast is off I can use this, it feels good on the  skin, so far I like it quite a bit.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> Got on time and very well packeged!!!</li>
            <li> The ingredients are safe for me and my 4 year old grand daughter (who also loves the smell).  </li>
            <li> This is an overall good product and is my sunscreen of choice.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of sweet tarts</li>
            <li> BUT the smell is sickerly sweet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only sunblock I&#x27;ve found that is organic and smells really good.</li>
            <li> Some people complain of the smell, I found it to be mild-smelling and sweet, so</li>
            <li> Having a cool name and hiding ingredients from the website doesn&#x27;t cut it with me.</li>
            <li> This product is gentle on the skin, created no greasy film, and even smells lovely.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tested this in harsh sun, but it&#x27;s brilliant.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad either.  </li>
            <li> If you only want a nice smell and moisturizer, then it is fine.</li>
            <li> It also gets into your eyes very easily even though you don&#x27;t place it anywhere near your eyes.</li>
            <li> I love the way the cream is not sticky, it smells amazing, and I don&#x27;t count down the minutes until it can be washed off.  </li>
            <li> but I am bright pink.</li>
            <li> Too Many chemicals that help cause cancer for 70 percent natural</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a more natural sunscreen and hoped this would be &amp;#34;the One&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love knowing it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> Being sensitive to many foods I read the the labels on everything.</li>
            <li> You get a ton for your money (compared to other lotion-sunscreen combos out there), it smells like heaven (VERY orange-y and fresh), and it feels great.</li>
            <li> I love it so much, and highly give this 10 stars if Amazon let me.</li>
            <li> I discovered this the hard way after a very innocent and enjoyable ride wakeboarding.</li>
            <li> In the market for a natural sunscreen, so many positive reviews but one reviewer raised a flag about the cancer causing ingredients they use (just because 70% ingredients are organic</li>
            <li> Would recommend if you, your entire family and everyone you&#x27;ll ever likely meet suffer from anosmia.&lt;br /&gt;If not expect to be hit on by rich sugar daddies looking for a $20 good time.</li>
            <li> I love knowing this is made from mostly organic ingredients, and its pretty reasonably priced compared to other brands out there.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference within the first week.</li>
            <li> I love Naked Bee products.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast!</li>
            <li> Most sunscreens left my face feeling even dryer after application but my skin is drinking this stuff up!  </li>
            <li> As it is just April it has not been tested in the really hot sun, but I am hopeful.  </li>
            <li> Does the trick, thanks!</li>
            <li> The difficulty that I&#x27;ve had with many products is either that they create a visible white film or that they sting my skin.</li>
            <li> But for the first time in my life (and I grew up in Florida)</li>
            <li> Lots of organic components, not nearly as scary (in terms of chemicals) as the majority of sunscreens out there.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I fight over it, if there isn&#x27;t much left :)</li>
            <li> is like applying body lotion instead of paste like most sunscreen that&#x27;s leaves white mark</li>
            <li> But the trouble I have finding a reasonably priced, GOOD tint in a tinted sunscreen...</li>
            <li> Very soft and creamy, goes on so smooths and easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> It smells great, makes my skin softer, protects me from the sun&#x27;s damaging rays, without a lot of the bad stuff that more mainstream products contain.  </li>
            <li> (Vitamins should really be listed in the description.)</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and I have a desert trip coming up</li>
            <li> I paid $13 for it and haven&#x27;t had the heart to look to see how much I may have over paid.</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Price and shipped fast</li>
            <li> I was out in the sun for a couple of hours and was very sunburned.</li>
            <li> If you are struggling as I was to find a good quality product that moisturizes and protects in one step at a great value without a ton of nasty chemicals, then this is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Goes on really well.  </li>
            <li> As I sit here typing this with my boiling, flaming shoulders, it is a sure reminder to me to always put on plenty of sunscreen in the future... and to read the label on the bottle clearly stating it is not water-proof.</li>
            <li> So another product in the trash as it would be more trouble than it is worth to refund it.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Just a fair warning too all you other sun and beach lovers, remember to reapply often, especially after getting in the water.</li>
            <li> I have used other Naked Bee products and loved them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to smells &amp; there is no way I could put this on my whole body.</li>
            <li> Finally, a natural sunscreen that is reasonably priced!  </li>
            <li> Tried on my teenage daughter who is struggling with mild acne.</li>
            <li> I work as a lifeguard and use many different sunscreens of all brands, even generic.  </li>
            <li> The main thing for me: the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> We put a little more on the children but it didn&#x27;t seem to greasy to me</li>
            <li> The honey scent and creaminess make use of sunscreen easy and routine as opposed to the drying agents in other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I would 100% recommend this product to anyone looking for a new moisturizer</li>
            <li> I live in Miami</li>
            <li> Really really irritated another $12 down the drain because a company did not give full disclosure on its product.</li>
            <li> this got high marks on a consumer web site for safety and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Fine lines seem less noticeable and gives skin a youthful glow.</li>
            <li> Been using it for 2 years now and can&#x27;t go back to other stuff :)</li>
            <li> Hopefully next time I will get exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> No one likes to have a spray sunblock anywhere near their faces!</li>
            <li> Very matte, no thick white residue.</li>
            <li> My previous sunscreen/day cream (Olay Total effects SPF 15) seemed provided better protection from tanning that this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely plan to buy it again next summer as well as the stick.</li>
            <li> Now, I never have to worry about sun damage to my hands and it keeps my hands soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m typically sensitive to scents</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a chalky white residue and it absorbs into the skin really fast.</li>
            <li> and I got very greasy, so I would only recommend it for body use.</li>
            <li> The biggest offenders in this sunscreen claiming to be natural are oxybenzone (hormone disrupting chemical) and retinyl palmitate (may damage sun exposed skin).</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean the rest are safe).</li>
            <li> I bought this in Ocean City New Jersey this weekend and used it on my second day at the beach.</li>
            <li> I then spent a few hours under the blistering heat waves of the sun under a spot where there is surely a hole in the ozone.</li>
            <li> I rubbed a very small place on my hand to see how strong the smell is</li>
            <li> I used it on my two year old last summer every time we went swimming</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The negative reviews are from people who should be using a sun block product due to being very light skinned.</li>
            <li> I forgot to apply any sunscreen to my lower back (new swimsuit), and my lower back looks the same as my upper back, where plenty of this sunscreen was applied.</li>
            <li> Thick cream goes on well and sinks into skin quickly and greaselessly.</li>
            <li> Actually helped clear up the small amount she had when used daily.</li>
            <li> After its absorption into the skin, retinyl palmitate is converted to retinol, and ultimately to retinoic acid (the active form of *vitamin A* present in Retin-A).    </li>
            <li> My family used this all summer long, including on a trip to Florida.  </li>
            <li> She also wore this sunscreen at the beach the same day as me and since she didn&#x27;t get wet</li>
            <li> I purchased this for I wanted to try a product without a long list of chemicals.</li>
            <li> It has strange honey odor</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry skin, yet this sun screen was too sticky for me.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day and feel that my skin is protected from limited sun exposure.</li>
            <li> &quot; A little goes a long way, making a tube last for an unexpectedly long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t go on thick or greasy like other sunscreens do.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a slight white tint to the face, but it is sunblock.</li>
            <li> Probably due to that my skin stays hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li> and then I spray on my reapplications, so I&#x27;m not really sure how long this actually lasts</li>
            <li> i really like it, and like knowing that i&#x27;m doing the least damage with few chemicals.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NO animal testing...</li>
            <li> It sinks in well and does not feel sticky.</li>
            <li> waste of my time ordering, calling Amazon for return label and returning same.</li>
            <li> It was sold in a gift shop at a place where you can swim with dolphins, sting rays, and other sea life.  </li>
            <li> When I went golfing the other week, the person on the front desk asked what perfume I was wearing.  </li>
            <li> It says SPF 30 which is what I use in all the other brands.  </li>
            <li> Typically if I had used a regular SPF 30 sunscreen I would get hardly any color in that amount of time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had way too many sleepless nights due to the unholy sunburns I have ruthlessly endured from this beach despite the massive amounts of sunscreen I&#x27;ve slathered myself in over the years.</li>
            <li> Skin cancer is on the rise due to over use of sunscreens containing chemicals!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lovely smell - slightly citrus-y....</li>
            <li> Nothing like your typical sunblock smell.</li>
            <li> (the lower the score the less harmful chemicals were being used in a product).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 5-stars if they could come up with a &#x27;sport&#x27; version that leaves less or no tacky residue.  </li>
            <li> My friend and I both suffered serious sunburn after applying and reapplying Naked Bee spf 30 sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Before spending a day at one of the beaches, we stopped into a gift shop with limited options - they did however sell this sunscreen and I complained about the brand/price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little stick.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday on my twin girls (5 years-old).</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of using harsh chemicals on mine or my children&#x27;s bodies</li>
            <li> It may make a nice moisturizer, but as a sunscreen it is worthless!!</li>
            <li> I use it on my face everyday, all year round.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me excessively oily and it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> for this reason, I only wear it for casual activities.  </li>
            <li> I used very little and didn&#x27;t slather it on thick, maybe a pea size for each arm and face, and I didn&#x27;t need to reapply and was still protected.  </li>
            <li> The place did not allow traditional sun screens due to the chemicals being bad for the animals.  </li>
            <li> It coats like crazy, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have a child that is allergic to dyes and has a hard time finding lotion she likes</li>
            <li> It feels hydrating, and leaves behind a bit of tack, so if you are working in the wind, dirt and dust you will end up with little particles stuck to your skin by the end of the day...</li>
            <li> vitamin E* acetate, is a common vitamin supplement ....</li>
            <li> next letter will be to the company telling them of my disappointment in their product.</li>
            <li> But it was too late.  </li>
            <li> Not as thick as some organic sunscreens I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly thick, yet takes a bit of rubbing to absorb.  </li>
            <li> It is an odd fake orange scent thrown in with grandmas perfume.</li>
            <li> Not good to use if you plan to go swimming or sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> The Naked Bee is making me sick to my stomach and giving me a headache</li>
            <li> I only use cream or lotion as a base</li>
            <li> Tired of the chem freaks in the world.  </li>
            <li> Well if your outside and chances are you will be if your wearing sunblock this stuff runs into your mouth and tastes god awful.</li>
            <li> It is the other 30% that is awful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are crazy not to put it in the description here on Amazon - it&#x27;s what I look for in a sunscreen, especially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> great!&lt;br /&gt;and doesn&#x27;t have any of the bad stuff you&#x27;d want to put on yourself</li>
            <li> I burned BADLY when I used sunscreen - this &amp;#34;sunscreen.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Too bad it washes off immediately in the water</li>
            <li> From Wikipedia: (astrix&#x27;s put by me)  </li>
            <li> but it is not waterproof :( :( :(</li>
            <li> and you hate shining on your face.</li>
            <li> But I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Boring read describing what ingredient is what...    </li>
            <li> This stuff is AWFUL!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this everyday on my twin girls (5 years-old). It goes on like lotion, so applying it to the face works great. It smells really good too. We are always getting asked what &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; are we wearing. We first found it at a zoo when I forgot to bring our own. I&#x27;ve been buying it from Amazon ever since.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this sunscreen.  It smells AMAZING ... finally a sunscreen that does not smell like chemicals !!!!!!  I just love using it, it feels so nourishing on my face.  My family used this all summer long, including on a trip to Florida.  I am very fair skinned and the only difference between this and the SPF 50 store brand sunscreens is that I need to reapply this just a bit sooner than the others.  I absolutely plan to buy it again next summer as well as the stick.</li>
            <li> Vitamins are very important for skin protection too. (Vitamins should really be listed in the description.) Boring read describing what ingredient is what...    From Wikipedia: (astrix&#x27;s put by me)  Retinyl palmitate is also a constituent of some topically applied skin care products. After its absorption into the skin, retinyl palmitate is converted to retinol, and ultimately to retinoic acid (the active form of *vitamin A* present in Retin-A).    And:  Tocopheryl acetate, also known as *vitamin E* acetate, is a common vitamin supplement .... It is often used in dermatological products such as skin creams. Tocopherol acetate is not oxidized and can penetrate through the skin to the living cells, where about 5% is converted to free tocopherol, and provides beneficial antioxidant effects.    ([...])  ([...])</li>
            <li> Favorite moisturizer to date. It smells lovely and is packed with vitamin C which is great if you go in the sun like I do. And the texture is so light and flawless. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love looove this sunscreen...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is from their website...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * Paraben-Free&lt;br /&gt;  * No propylene glycol or mineral oil&lt;br /&gt;  * No dyes or pigment&lt;br /&gt;  * No lauryl or laureth sulfate&lt;br /&gt;  * Absolutely NO animal testing... ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are crazy not to put it in the description here on Amazon - it&#x27;s what I look for in a sunscreen, especially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lovely smell - slightly citrus-y....I have Never been irritated by this creamy sunscreen. It sinks in well and does not feel sticky. Its light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the ONLY thing that would make it Absolutely Perfect for me, would be if they made it tinted! But the trouble I have finding a reasonably priced, GOOD tint in a tinted sunscreen...sheesh....so never mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m happy to use this one and blend it with an SPF tinted moisturizer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND its CHEAP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy.  The smell is nice.  UVA and UVB protection.  What else could one want in a sunscreen?  This is an overall good product and is my sunscreen of choice.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is amazing, it works great and is all natural which is very important to me. I love it so much, and highly give this 10 stars if Amazon let me.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! Noticed a difference within the first week. Fine lines seem less noticeable and gives skin a youthful glow. Tried on my teenage daughter who is struggling with mild acne. Actually helped clear up the small amount she had when used daily.</li>
            <li> Someone gave me this sunscreen and I fell in love with it! I used the whole bottle and I have a desert trip coming up which will consist of more sun and hikes. Hands down the best smell ever!!! Love how organic it is...</li>
            <li> Favorite Sunscreen!  Pleasant smell, could use as every day moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My favorite. I always make sure to buy one before I run out</li>
            <li> Love it - doesn&#x27;t sting my very sensitive skin - great for my face</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product.  I keep it in my purse and reapply it each time I wash my hands. Now, I never have to worry about sun damage to my hands and it keeps my hands soft.</li>
            <li> smells great, it applies nicely, and it seems to cover well.  I only use cream or lotion as a base and then I spray on my reapplications, so I&#x27;m not really sure how long this actually lasts</li>
            <li> I love Naked Bee products. They smell is so amazing. The smell reminds me of sweet tarts</li>
            <li> Great smell - good ingredients. I used it on my two year old last summer every time we went swimming and it worked well. I use it as a facial moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of using harsh chemicals on mine or my children&#x27;s bodies so I thought I would give this a try, in fact I have never used a sunscreen in my life...until now.  This stuff seems to work great.  We used this before walking around a zoo for 5 hours and nobody got burnt.  I used very little and didn&#x27;t slather it on thick, maybe a pea size for each arm and face, and I didn&#x27;t need to reapply and was still protected.  We put a little more on the children but it didn&#x27;t seem to greasy to me and I didn&#x27;t notice any white residue or anything odd.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with this 70% natural organic sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Very effective. Not as thick as some organic sunscreens I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen - it smells wonderful and feels great when you apply it to the skin.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t go on thick or greasy like other sunscreens do.  It provides a wonderful layer of protection against the sun, though I wish it had a slightly higher SPF rating.  The ingredient list is mostly organic, and I love that it contains aloe, which is excellent for the skin.  Overall it&#x27;s an excellent sunscreen/moisturizer hybrid, and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Been using it for 2 years now and can&#x27;t go back to other stuff :)</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen. actually goes into your skin, disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;smells great!&lt;br /&gt;and doesn&#x27;t have any of the bad stuff you&#x27;d want to put on yourself</li>
            <li> I bought this in Ocean City New Jersey this weekend and used it on my second day at the beach. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as waterproof sunscreen; however, I waited 30 mins to reapply after swimming in the ocean. I will use it as a daily moisturizer on days that I am outside in the yard or at a daytime party. I also purchased the moisturizing Hand and Body lotion (orange blossom honey) I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I discovered this product in the Florida Keys.  It was sold in a gift shop at a place where you can swim with dolphins, sting rays, and other sea life.  The place did not allow traditional sun screens due to the chemicals being bad for the animals.  It was the best purchase.  I love the way the cream is not sticky, it smells amazing, and I don&#x27;t count down the minutes until it can be washed off.  I have many allergies and have found that I tolerate this sun screen well.  As a Floridian, who is in the sun frequently, I can&#x27;t live without this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/617846/The_Naked_Bee_Vitamin_C_Moisturizing_Sunscreen%2C_SPF_30_%28old_formulation%29/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please read this before you purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Great product! BUT the smell is sickerly sweet. I couldn&#x27;t wear it for more than a day as I smelt like a cheap lady of the night. Felt good on though and as it&#x27;s mostly organic, hence 3 stars. Would recommend if you, your entire family and everyone you&#x27;ll ever likely meet suffer from anosmia.&lt;br /&gt;If not expect to be hit on by rich sugar daddies looking for a $20 good time. You have been warned.</li>
            <li> Too Many chemicals that help cause cancer for 70 percent natural</li>
            <li> Great product, amazing actually. It&#x27;s the only sunblock I&#x27;ve found that is organic and smells really good. Delivery was fast! Will order again! :)</li>
            <li> I so wanted to love this product. I liked all of the ingredients, the consistency... But the smell!!! It is an odd fake orange scent thrown in with grandmas perfume. I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to smells &amp; there is no way I could put this on my whole body.</li>
            <li> It is great. This is our favorite sunscreen!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little stick. I thought it was more of a cream. Wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this item if it said stick in the description.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is like moisturizer.  It&#x27;s creamy and goes on smooth and smells good too.  I&#x27;m in love with it and use it more because it feels and smells good.</li>
            <li> I mostly use this as a moisturizer under my BB cream. I&#x27;m typically sensitive to scents and I find this one rather pleasant, it rather reminds me of what Smarties smelled like when I was a kid. It doesn&#x27;t leave a chalky white residue and it absorbs into the skin really fast. With that said, I still use SPF of &amp;#34;solar flare&amp;#34; when I go to the pool with the kiddos so I mostly only use it for a daily moisturizer and on my arms when I go running. It is a sunscreen not a sunblock though so keep that in mind, you will still tan.</li>
            <li> Seems to do what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Thick cream goes on well and sinks into skin quickly and greaselessly. Lasts longer than many others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen goes on very smoothly and smells wonderful.  I took it on a trip to Hawaii and never burned once.</li>
            <li> Just a fair warning too all you other sun and beach lovers, remember to reapply often, especially after getting in the water. This is NOT water-proof sunscreen. I discovered this the hard way after a very innocent and enjoyable ride wakeboarding. I then spent a few hours under the blistering heat waves of the sun under a spot where there is surely a hole in the ozone. I&#x27;ve had way too many sleepless nights due to the unholy sunburns I have ruthlessly endured from this beach despite the massive amounts of sunscreen I&#x27;ve slathered myself in over the years. As I sit here typing this with my boiling, flaming shoulders, it is a sure reminder to me to always put on plenty of sunscreen in the future... and to read the label on the bottle clearly stating it is not water-proof. However, I should mention, my fair-skinned toddler uses the face sticks from this company almost daily and never gets burned. She also wore this sunscreen at the beach the same day as me and since she didn&#x27;t get wet and I reapplied on her often, she didn&#x27;t burn at all. Some people complain of the smell, I found it to be mild-smelling and sweet, so no complaints here.</li>
            <li> I like the sunscreen. It smells good and seems to work fine. However, I ordered a tube and received a stick (I guess I&#x27;m reviewing the stick). Sent it back with no problems and got the replacement - another stick. I was going out of town and didn&#x27;t have time to bother with another return, plus I needed sunscreen, so I ended up just keeping the stick. I paid $13 for it and haven&#x27;t had the heart to look to see how much I may have over paid. If you order this, I hope you can figure out a way to specify that you want the item shown. I would buy this product again - in a store if I see it.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. Applies very easily and protects well. It does not say waterproof but even after swimming in the ocean and not re-applying, it worked great. The scent is really nice too.</li>
            <li> Now that the cast is off I can use this, it feels good on the  skin, so far I like it quite a bit.</li>
            <li> It works alright, but if you forget to slather yourself with it every 30 mins you will pay for it.</li>
            <li> It goes on well &amp; is not greasy. The smell is not bad either.  I just wish it was water resistant.  I didn&#x27;t realize it after I purchased it.  Not good to use if you plan to go swimming or sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> amazing suncreen!! highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very soft and creamy, goes on so smooths and easily absorbed. I try LOTS of new organic skin care products and this by far is one of the best face SPF lotions I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and is an effective blocker.  Will purchase again. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product has too many chemicals in it. I would not use this product. Skin cancer is on the rise due to over use of sunscreens containing chemicals!</li>
            <li> While I will keep what I received because I like the product. I did want to let you know that I received one (1) Naked Bee Vitamin C Sunscreen and one (1)  Naked Bee Moisturizer.  Hopefully next time I will get exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I wanted a replacement for my toxic store-bought facial lotion with SPF and tried this. I am very happy with it. It does smell &amp;#34;different&amp;#34;, but I have grown used to the smell and now rather like it. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on the smell, too. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Amazon needs to review its products and the details for this item--plus ALL the items it offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A waste of my time ordering, calling Amazon for return label and returning same.</li>
            <li> love the smell, but it is strong and may not be for everyone. i really like it, and like knowing that i&#x27;m doing the least damage with few chemicals. this got high marks on a consumer web site for safety and natural ingredients. goes on easily and blends well. i&#x27;d do it again :)</li>
            <li> Been using it on myself and my kids for two summers now and LOVE IT.  Love the smell and no one gets burned.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Just feels like lotion and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Was everything perfect!!! Nothing to complain about! Got on time and very well packeged!!! i love this smells so good and really protects you! Worth every penny</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen. I&#x27;m not worried about what&#x27;s in it. I used this on my face for awhile and it made me break out and I got very greasy, so I would only recommend it for body use. Worked great.</li>
            <li> My skin looks awesome with this lotion. I&#x27;m in love. Feels so moisturized and smells amazing. I would 100% recommend this product to anyone looking for a new moisturizer</li>
            <li> Works nicely, non greasy&lt;br /&gt;Good Price and shipped fast</li>
            <li> Finally, a natural sunscreen that is reasonably priced!  Nice scent, absorbs well &amp; is not greasy. This is perfect for the whole family.</li>
            <li> I have used other Naked Bee products and loved them. I have been looking for a more natural sunscreen and hoped this would be &amp;#34;the One&amp;#34;. But I was very disappointed. The lotion smelled great, went on smooth not greasy, and rubbed in easily. But it did not work! I was out in the sun for a couple of hours and was very sunburned. Typically if I had used a regular SPF 30 sunscreen I would get hardly any color in that amount of time but I am bright pink. I will not be able to use this for the sun again. However, I do like the feel of the product and will probably just use it as a regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  The negative reviews are from people who should be using a sun block product due to being very light skinned. The elements they say are carcinogens are NOT.  Tired of the chem freaks in the world.  They use chemicals every day.  Water is a chemical compound folks.  Gheesh!!</li>
            <li> Creamy moisturizing sun protection with a delicious smell.  Most sunscreens left my face feeling even dryer after application but my skin is drinking this stuff up!  If you are struggling as I was to find a good quality product that moisturizes and protects in one step at a great value without a ton of nasty chemicals, then this is definitely worth a try. Much better than spending $25 for 1 oz.  Sheesh!</li>
            <li> Not only is this is a very effective sunscreen, it smells wonderful and has a rich, emollient, non greasy feel. It&#x27;s like using my best moisturizer.  The ingredients are safe for me and my 4 year old grand daughter (who also loves the smell).  She calls it \\&quot;The good stuff.\\&quot; A little goes a long way, making a tube last for an unexpectedly long time. This is one of those products that I hope never goes away.  I&#x27;ve never found anything comparable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for I wanted to try a product without a long list of chemicals. I suffer from dry skin, yet this sun screen was too sticky for me. Probably due to that my skin stays hydrated all day long. However I would like it a lot moe if it were not so sticky. Secondly, for a SPF 30 sunscreen it provides below par protection from sun. My previous sunscreen/day cream (Olay Total effects SPF 15) seemed provided better protection from tanning that this product.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, covers like lotion vs sunscreen. Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Needed it for my family as we cruise through summer. The kids never complain with he application of this product.  We just love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Goes on really well.  As it is just April it has not been tested in the really hot sun, but I am hopeful.  When I went golfing the other week, the person on the front desk asked what perfume I was wearing.  I told her it was my sunscreen.  She was very impressed.</li>
            <li> I loved it. It is amazing. Very matte, no thick white residue. Simly moisturizing. It has strange honey odor but you might like it.  I live in Miami and I recommend it. If you have oliy skin and you hate shining on your face. This is the produict for you.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen, it smells so good! Nothing like your typical sunblock smell. I love knowing it&#x27;s natural and I&#x27;m not covering my body in chemicals.</li>
            <li> Luxurious feel and wonderful orangie smell. Love it!</li>
            <li> I use this product every day and feel that my skin is protected from limited sun exposure.</li>
            <li> Have used this many times before and will keep using it.. Love the smell and it works great for that Fl. sun..</li>
            <li> Love this, excellent sun block!!</li>
            <li> I just received this product today and upon opening the box could smell it before I opened the lid. It had a really really strong smell. I take a medicine that does not allow me to be in the sun so I bought this to put on my face and hands. I rubbed a very small place on my hand to see how strong the smell is and it is really strong. Putting this on my hands and face would be a mistake.So strong that I will not be able to use it.&lt;br /&gt;They advertise it 70% organic. Can not just about any product make this claim. It is the other 30% that is awful. Being sensitive to many foods I read the the labels on everything. It is my experience if the ingredient list has more than 5 ingredients it is a chemical bomb. I quit counting at 20 with several things in  there that I have never heard of and I have read hundreds of labels.&lt;br /&gt;My next letter will be to the company telling them of my disappointment in their product. Having a cool name and hiding ingredients from the website doesn&#x27;t cut it with me. So another product in the trash as it would be more trouble than it is worth to refund it.&lt;br /&gt;In the time it had took me to write this The Naked Bee is making me sick to my stomach and giving me a headache so if you like stuff that smells this is definitely for you. Really really irritated another $12 down the drain because a company did not give full disclosure on its product.</li>
            <li> In the market for a natural sunscreen, so many positive reviews but one reviewer raised a flag about the cancer causing ingredients they use (just because 70% ingredients are organic doesn&#x27;t mean the rest are safe). So I looked it up on ewg.org site to see how they rate it, it&#x27;s a 7 on a scale of 1-10 (the lower the score the less harmful chemicals were being used in a product). The biggest offenders in this sunscreen claiming to be natural are oxybenzone (hormone disrupting chemical) and retinyl palmitate (may damage sun exposed skin). Hope this helps someone make a decision on whether to buy this or not.</li>
            <li> Does the trick, thanks!</li>
            <li> I work as a lifeguard and use many different sunscreens of all brands, even generic.  Someone gave this to me as a gift.  It says SPF 30 which is what I use in all the other brands.  OUCH!!!  This stuff gave me NO PROTECTION.  I felt myself burning after only 2 hours and then changed to a different lotion.  But it was too late.  Do NOT use this if you need sunscreen protection.  If you only want a nice smell and moisturizer, then it is fine.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizer and sunscreen that I have come across.  It smells great, makes my skin softer, protects me from the sun&#x27;s damaging rays, without a lot of the bad stuff that more mainstream products contain.  I put this on my face, neck, decollete and arms before leaving the house in the morning.  This is a must have.</li>
            <li> I work outdoors and must apply sunscreen regularly to my face. The difficulty that I&#x27;ve had with many products is either that they create a visible white film or that they sting my skin. This product is gentle on the skin, created no greasy film, and even smells lovely.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tested this in harsh sun, but it&#x27;s brilliant. I wear it every day, and have for about two months now. You get a ton for your money (compared to other lotion-sunscreen combos out there), it smells like heaven (VERY orange-y and fresh), and it feels great. It doesn&#x27;t make me excessively oily and it doesn&#x27;t break me out. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> My dye free family loves this stuff.  I have a child that is allergic to dyes and has a hard time finding lotion she likes that is dye free.  This one is the best she has tried.</li>
            <li> Like the idea, it breaks me out though.</li>
            <li> We love this line of products.  The honey scent and creaminess make use of sunscreen easy and routine as opposed to the drying agents in other sunscreens.  Will continue to expand our use of these products.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it ZERO stars if that was an option. This stuff is AWFUL!  I wanted to like it - love the smell and feel. But for the first time in my life (and I grew up in Florida) I burned BADLY when I used sunscreen - this &amp;#34;sunscreen.&amp;#34;  I forgot to apply any sunscreen to my lower back (new swimsuit), and my lower back looks the same as my upper back, where plenty of this sunscreen was applied. Further, my burned upper back feels noticably different (bumpy/blistery) than my burned lower back. It may make a nice moisturizer, but as a sunscreen it is worthless!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have top wear sunscreen all the time, even in the winter. This is not greasy, feels and smells great!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this - mild and pleasant.  It&#x27;s not overly thick, yet takes a bit of rubbing to absorb.  It feels hydrating, and leaves behind a bit of tack, so if you are working in the wind, dirt and dust you will end up with little particles stuck to your skin by the end of the day... for this reason, I only wear it for casual activities.  My favorite part is the ingredient list - I feel safer using it.  Lots of organic components, not nearly as scary (in terms of chemicals) as the majority of sunscreens out there.  I&#x27;d give it 5-stars if they could come up with a &#x27;sport&#x27; version that leaves less or no tacky residue.  Would also love to see it come in a pump bottle.</li>
            <li> My husband and I were in Chicago and forgot sunscreen. Before spending a day at one of the beaches, we stopped into a gift shop with limited options - they did however sell this sunscreen and I complained about the brand/price. I&#x27;ve never been a person to care about natural/organic stuff, and I&#x27;ll admit I was irritated they didn&#x27;t sell the regular stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny, since that was a year ago and now, I get online to special-order this sunscreen. I&#x27;ve even told family &amp; friends about it, and now they buy it. The main thing for me: the way it feels on my skin. It&#x27;s like lotion - and if it was marketed as lotion, I wouldn&#x27;t know the difference. It doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen; it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like sunscreen; it doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout like sunscreen; and it isn&#x27;t greasy like sunscreen. It&#x27;s very smooth, quick-absorbing, and smells delish. But, it IS sunscreen - haven&#x27;t burned once when using this (of course, we do re-apply every couple hours.) My husband and I fight over it, if there isn&#x27;t much left :)</li>
            <li> Really great I love this since is like applying body lotion instead of paste like most sunscreen that&#x27;s leaves white mark what ever you touch!!!</li>
            <li> great moisturizer and sun screen. Love it.</li>
            <li> Feels good, smells good.</li>
            <li> Do NOT trust this product for protection from beach sun. My friend and I both suffered serious sunburn after applying and reapplying Naked Bee spf 30 sunscreen. It&#x27;s bogus.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen,  the natural and effective moisturing qualities and the LACK of harmful additives make the Naked Bee products perfect for our household</li>
            <li> I want to looooooove this sunscreen but it is not waterproof :( :( :( The smell is great, the list of ingredients is perfect and it spreads easily. Too bad it washes off immediately in the water and I got quite a burn to show for it.</li>
            <li> Love the coverage and love the aroma!  Best sunscreen in the absolute, positively huge world that we live in today.</li>
            <li> I use this on my and my children&#x27;s faces when we are going to be out in the sun a lot. No one likes to have a spray sunblock anywhere near their faces! It coats like crazy, a little goes a long way. Leaves a slight white tint to the face, but it is sunblock. Smells yummy!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen, it smells great, its not sticky, its mostly organic, safe for children to use. All my ta&#x27;s used to fight over who got to put on sunscreen in daycare because this is so awesome. The children loved it too.</li>
            <li> Been using this sunscreen as aftershave for years and feel naked without it.  First bought it at a small store outside of Yosemite and thought I&#x27;d never see it again.  Wishing it were available in more stores.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I use it on my face everyday, all year round. Perfect for my somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  I have enjoyed using it and will reorder when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Ok so this is some really good smelling sunscreen, i love that. But I do not suggest putting this on your face, why you ask?? Well if your outside and chances are you will be if your wearing sunblock this stuff runs into your mouth and tastes god awful. It also gets into your eyes very easily even though you don&#x27;t place it anywhere near your eyes. I like this for everywhere else but the face. I love knowing this is made from mostly organic ingredients, and its pretty reasonably priced compared to other brands out there.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I adore everything about this product. Smells great, wonderful quality. My skin is soft, happy and protected</li>
