            <li> sulfates give the shampoo the foaming property and dry your hair out over time..........</li>
            <li> I ordered this expecting it to work as well as the old formula, but sadly it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> Although before using the conditioner my hair felt rough</li>

            <li> Strips the remnants of the gel and the conditioner I use on my naturally long curly away without being harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li> I will use this once a month to get rid of all the gels, sprays and other buildups on my hair.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I used this shampoo on a friend who dyed her hair too dark and was frantic with worry.  </li>

            <li> Also the item was poorly packaged by Amazon and leaked over the entire content in the box.</li>
            <li> Now I use it just a couple times a month as a clarifier because it dried out my hair.  </li>
            <li> Does what&#x27;s asked of it without being overly harsh.</li>
            <li> My hair has been getting oilier over the past few months</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and the wrong shampoo formula will make it greasy and weight it down, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I was told I needed to clarify at least weekly.</li>
            <li> At least he&#x27;ll use it up.</li>
            <li> Since I had kids and found the need to start coloring the grey, I found my hair getting very bad buildup.</li>
            <li> it is NOT good for you!!!.........</li>
            <li> After using an expensive clarifier I started looking for alternatives and tried vinegar rinsing but to no avail.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed about this product because it dries out my hair..</li>
            <li> and i was very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great smell, fast ship,</li>
            <li> Have tried other deep cleansing shampoos and they dried my hair out.  The Pantene takes all the build up out off hair an leaves it soft. Live this shampoo and will continue to buy!!</li>
            <li> makes my hair so so clean! amazing</li>
            <li> I was so excited when this came out because I used to have a really good Pantene clarifying shampoo that got discontinued. My hair has been getting oilier over the past few months and I try to only wash it every other day, so a good clarifying shampoo is a must. I ordered this expecting it to work as well as the old formula, but sadly it doesn&#x27;t really work. The first day, hair is okay, but by the second day it looks dirty again--and this doesn&#x27;t even happen to me when I use moisturizing shampoos. If you wash your hair everyday, then this might not be an issue for you, but I definitely don&#x27;t feel like it delivers a good deep-cleaning. Also the item was poorly packaged by Amazon and leaked over the entire content in the box. Amazon refunded me, but still. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed about this product because it dries out my hair..&lt;br /&gt;not recommended.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  I use it about once a week instead of my regular shampoo.  It helps by removing build up from other products.  It lathers well and the minty smell is wonderful.  The price from Amazon is great and it will be shipped on a regular schedule with my regular Pantene Shampoo on Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has sulfates in it............they are horrible for your hair...........sulfates give the shampoo the foaming property and dry your hair out over time..........look for a shampoo with NO SULFATES........I wonder why shampoo companies continue to use this ingredient KNOWING it is NOT good for you!!!.........the bottom line is money..........hmmm...........</li>
            <li> Since I had kids and found the need to start coloring the grey, I found my hair getting very bad buildup. When I first went to the salon about it I was told I needed to clarify at least weekly. So off I went to the beauty supply store. After using an expensive clarifier I started looking for alternatives and tried vinegar rinsing but to no avail. Stumbled across this product, gave it a whirl and so far have seen a great improvement. Wish it didn&#x27;t contain sulfate a or some of the other complex scientific products that I can&#x27;t pronounce, prefer a more ngurl product but hey, if it does the job and saves time and money, I&#x27;ll take it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair when using this shampoo on a weekly basis. I haven&#x27;t tried to use it more often, because I feel like it would dry out my hair. I like the smell, but i would rather try something a little more nurturing.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and texture. My hair felt softer and cleaner, might be my next favorite shampoo</li>
            <li> Leaves hair squeaky clean. Smells great</li>
            <li> This is one of Pantenes best shampoos in my opinion. It left my hair feeling clean and weightless. My hair felt extra clean and smelled wonderful! Pantene you did it again!! I have been recommending it to all family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li> The instructions on the bottle says to use weekly.  I used it daily for about two weeks until I actually read the instructions.  Now I use it just a couple times a month as a clarifier because it dried out my hair.  It smells good and is a really good price compared to salon shampoos.</li>
            <li> Strips the remnants of the gel and the conditioner I use on my naturally long curly away without being harsh on my hair. LOVE Pantene products!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo for weekly usage!  I have oily hair, and it is great for getting everything all cleaned out.  Highly recommended for people with oily hair, or people who use a lot of hair products!</li>
            <li> leaves my hair feeling clean without drying it out. I like the hint of mint smell also</li>
            <li> Works well to gently clarify the hair. Does what&#x27;s asked of it without being overly harsh. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo, leaves your hair squeaky clean! (No joke, your hair really squeaks)</li>
            <li> I had my reservations about the product ans what it could do for me. My hair is very thin and the wrong shampoo formula will make it greasy and weight it down, but I was pleasantly surprised. Although before using the conditioner my hair felt rough but I guess is part of the deep cleanse. My scalp feels clean. I will continue to use. Great product.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how soft this shampoo left my hair.  I could tell that it was very clean and all the built up residue was gone.  I will use this once a month to get rid of all the gels, sprays and other buildups on my hair.  This did not remove my hair color...great!</li>
            <li> This works so well, it will wash your hair color down the drain!  Literally!  It is certainly strong enough to get rid of any buildup, that&#x27;s for sure.  But it&#x27;s not for color treated hair, especially reds.  There are two buildup removing shampoos that work for colored hair: Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil apple cider vinegar clarifying shampoo, which is sulfate free and ION sulfate free clarifying shampoo for color treated hair. The Jamaican formula smells really fresh and clean and lathers really well, which is unusual for a sulfate free shampoo.  It also does not contain silicone, which can weigh hair down, and is color safe.  There is also Malibu Un Do Goo, which is sulfate free as well and works like a charm.  The Ion formula requires that you leave it on for 5 minutes before rinsing.  It takes a bit more shampoo to make a lather, but it leaves hair shiny and bouncy and has no effect on hair color.  It&#x27;s available at Sally Beauty Supply (and on Amazon).  The Jamaican formula runs about $11 at Walgreens, CVS or ULta.  The Ion shampoo is about $7 at the Sally store.  Both work great, although I personally prefer the fragrance of the Shea Moisture Jamaican formula.  I also like several other formulas from Shea Moisture, all of which are sulfate free and therefore safe for color treated hair.  Sulfates are far too harsh for colored hair and numerous supposedly color safe shampoos have sulfates and therefore completely defeat the purpose (Pantene is one).  As someone who&#x27;s been coloring her hair for 40 years, I should know.  If you don&#x27;t have color in your hair, then this Pantene formula may work wonders for you, especially if you have considerable conditioner or styling product buildup.  I used it twice.  I didn&#x27;t notice my fading color the first time, but by the second use, it was readily apparent I&#x27;d have to do my color over.  I should have known.  In fact, I used this shampoo on a friend who dyed her hair too dark and was frantic with worry.  A few lathers of this shampoo and her color looked fine.  But those with colored hair SHOULD NOT USE this shampoo.  It&#x27;s for normal haired folks.  I&#x27;ll give my bottle to my husband, who does not care what he uses.  At least he&#x27;ll use it up.rs of this shampoo and her color looked fine.  But those with colored hair SHOULD NOT USE this shampoo.  It&#x27;s for normal haired folks.  I&#x27;ll give my bottle to my husband, who does not care what he uses.  At least he&#x27;ll use it up.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Affordable and exactly what I was looking for!  Fast shipping and excellent customer service!!  Will certainly do business again!</li>
            <li> The smell is good my problem was i didnt get to try much of it because the bottle was busted all over my stuff and i was very disappointed.</li>
