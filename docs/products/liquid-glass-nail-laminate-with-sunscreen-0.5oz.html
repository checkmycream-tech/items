            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super shiny, adds some volume to make nails thicker and stronger, plus its quick dry!  </li>

            <li> This chips off and dries out your nails, especially if they&#x27;re already in bad shape.</li>
            <li> It was way to thin to build up any strength.</li>

            <li> I love this so much that I obviously moved it around the house to use it often.  I have misplaced it somewhere in the house, it is not in my manicure shoebox!!</li>
            <li> had to purchase online because local stores stopped carrying.  probably because of the \\&quot;evil\\&quot; (so I&#x27;ve heard) pthalates inside.  will dislike having to find a replacement that is pthalate-free, but will do so when this last order runs dry.  I actually coat this ON TOP of my seche vite [[ASIN:B0018CQKXK Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat .5 Fl Oz]] and really helps my homemade manis last.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best top coat on the market. I&#x27;m so thrilled that Amazon carries this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE USED LIQUID GLASS FOR YEARS.  OVER POLISH OR JUST OVER UNPOLISHED NAILS.  I NOW USE IT OVER MY GEL NAIL MANICURE AS SOON AS I GET HOME FROM HAVING THEM DONE.  IT TRULY CREATES A BRILLIANT GLASS SHINE THAT ENDURES ANYTHING SHORT OF POLISH REMOVER.  THERE&#x27;S NEVER ANY CHIPS, RUB OFF OR PEALING OF NAIL POLISH.  I GET MY GEL NAILS DONE EVERY FOUR WEEKS AND MY NAILS KEEP THEIR HIGH GLASS SHINE FROM MANICURE TO MANICURE, THEREFORE, A BOTTLE WILL LAST A VERY LONG TIME.&lt;br /&gt;I PANICKED WHEN I DID RUN OUT AND COULDN&#x27;T FIND IT IN ANY OF THE DRUG STORES THAT USED TO CARRY IT.  I WAS SO HAPPY TO FIND IT HERE ON AMAZON!  SO I BOUGHT 2 BOTTLES JUST IN CASE I WOULD HAVE TROUBLE FINDING IT AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;I CAN&#x27;T SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT LIQUID GLASS!!  JUST THAT I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!!!!  YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Stays on a long time and does make your nails stronger and helps them to grow.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago and have not been able to find it again since.  It is absolutely the best and very shiny.  Makes your nails look great.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product was useless. It was way to thin to build up any strength. Whoever likes this product should try good old Sally Hansen&#x27;s \\&quot;Dries Instantly\\&quot; top coat. It&#x27;s super shiny, adds some volume to make nails thicker and stronger, plus its quick dry!  I saw this and thought I&#x27;d try it. I put it over my color and added a 2nd coat next day, and one more cost the next day. My color chipped off on two separate nails and was wearing off the tips on other nails in two days. What a waste of time. My polish lasts one to two weeks other times. Glass?  More like thin sheet of plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> I have found this to me be one of the best top coats.. my old bottle was &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;!  Try the Google! and there it is on Amazon. Of course, I bought 2 bottles.. Hopefully, it will still be available when I need more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a Super shiny glossy top coat.  I&#x27;ve tried sooo many brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve NEVER found one that has a super shiny finish like this does.  It looks and last the same amount as a professional manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if it would let me.  I just purchased this, but I am tempted to buy like 10 in case they ever stop selling it!</li>
            <li> Makes nails strong and it is perfectly clear.  I don&#x27;t know if it is stronger than Rock, but it is very helpful for weak nails.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this product. I was looking for a top coat that is super shiney like gel top coat. This was just not it. I did not use it enough to know how well it works because it was not super shiney, glass like finish I wanted</li>
            <li> Compared to the top coats you typically find in the drugstore, this stuff is amazing.  However, I bought the \\&quot;Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat High Shine\\&quot;, and it&#x27;s much better than the Liquid Glass.  In my experience, the Seche Vite product really does dry faster, harder, and shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This top coat would be the best ever... if only I hadn&#x27;t also tried the Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> Listen please, there is nothing fancy about this. I think it will do the job, but nothing amazing about it. I think you can get the same effect when buying this at your local drug store or dollar store or tree.</li>
            <li> Not too happy. Does not live up to the promises. Even though my nails were very clean, my nail polish chips off faster with this under neath. Maybe it needs a bonder underneath .  .???</li>
            <li> This is the best Laminate I&#x27;ve ever used. I can&#x27;t find it in retail stores anymore and was glad to find it on Amazon. Ever get marks from bedsheets on your nails after polishing them prior to going to bed the night before? Brush a coat or two of this laminate on and your nails will look great and with a shine that&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> Save your money.  Peels off and does not protect my very fragile nails.  I just have to get some good repair strips.</li>
            <li> I have been using this nail polish for decades, and every year it becomes harder to find. The best part about it is it dries so quickly, within a minute or so and keeps my nails strong!</li>
            <li> Great product! Keeps polish in place perfectly for 2 weeks. Also, like the shine it provides. Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Am so happy to find this wonderful nail polish online as local stores have stopped carrying it. I use it over a base coat and it never chips.  Stays shiny with a high gloss.  (I don&#x27;t understand negative reviews; these women must need nail repair instead of just strong nail polish.)</li>
            <li> Love it ! I&#x27;ve used it for years, but can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a waste of money.  This chips off and dries out your nails, especially if they&#x27;re already in bad shape.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a durable nail topcoat polish, look no further. Liquid Glass Laminate is the best out there-anywhere! I have used countless other topcoat polishes and&lt;br /&gt;none last as long or stay as shiny as \\&quot;Liquid Glass\\&quot;. Not even so-called &#x27;salon&#x27; topcoats last as long or look as good as &#x27;Liquid Glass&#x27;. I clean houses for a living and my hands are in chemicals and water all day long but my manicure looks good for weeks. I strongly suggest you try this product \\&quot;Liquid Glass Laminate\\&quot;. long lasting, reasonably priced, with beautiful results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found/used a nail laminate that gives better results.  I apply it after every manicure and the high gloss and protection it provides is nothing short of amazing.  And I mean weeks, and not just days worth.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I never had a gel/shellac nail treatment before.  It lasts twice as long for twice the price.  My smart friend suggested I buy Liquid Glass to make the manicure last even longer.  Yes, it works.  I use it about every 3 days and we&#x27;ve got good-looking nails.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Keeps your polish&lt;br /&gt;from chipping for 1 week.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the three bottles for around $29.99, but I got one bottle so I called Citi Master card to dispute the charge.</li>
            <li> Love this clear polish!!!  Really helps to keep nails free from breakage.  I use it as a base and top coat.  Would highly recommend if your nails are brittle and susceptible to breaking or peeling.</li>
            <li> This polish dries quickly and really strengthens my nails. I usually put one coat of this on my nails every day or every other day to prolong the life of my manicures.</li>
            <li> It is very strong the glossy shine lasts the whole month. Not easy to find in stores. Been using it 25 years.</li>
            <li> The best top coat you will ever use.  Once you put it on nothing chips for days.  My manicurist turned me on to it and the price at amazaon is the best.</li>
            <li> This product gives your nails both protection and shine. It has a thicker texture than anything else I&#x27;ve found on the market.</li>
