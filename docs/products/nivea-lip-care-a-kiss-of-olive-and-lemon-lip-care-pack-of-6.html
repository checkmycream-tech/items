    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nivea lip balm is the best I have ever used.  I have now used it for several years.  The Olive Oil and Lemon is my favorite.  I have had chapped and dry lips all my life.  That ended when I began to use this product.</li>
            <li> I had no idea what to expect from this lip balm. I like this brand but never tried this combo. I think it&#x27;s my favorite. Lots of moisture and does not have a girly or fruity smell. My husband likes it too.</li>
            <li> I had to keep reapplying it to feel moisturized.  The smell is nice but when it&#x27;s on your lips it becomes overwhelming because it&#x27;s right there under your nose, all the time.  I returned it and will stick to other brands.</li>
            <li> Love the scent!  Kept my lips hydrated!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Not for sale at any of my local stores anymore.</li>
            <li> love the smell. so smooth and moisturizing</li>
            <li> Smell is a little much for me.  Prefer the vanilla scent.  This is a little loud.</li>
            <li> Both the honey flavor and this flavor are my favorites!</li>
            <li> Just to reiterate what everyone else has said...WOW!!! Best lip balm ever! I have tried EOS, Chapstick, Blistex etc, and even the other Nivea lip balms. I literally went from store to store to store (and so on) trying to find this, but could not find it anywhere! So worth the delivery charge. I am obsessive about keeping my lips soft, and this is truly the best!</li>
            <li> This olive oil and lemon lip balm – is smooth and does not feel at all oily or greasy on application. The flavour is subtle and agreeable. We found that the olive oil constituent is good and has a beneficial action on dry lips, so that you get a nice smooth feel on your lips. This lip balm has good hydration properties and creates a nice layer of protection from the environment, but does not have the negatives of being too waxy or glossy on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This then is very good lip balm and my family I highly recommend it. Best to shop around to get the best price for this lip balm.</li>
            <li> The olive oil and lemon combo is genius. Flavor is very light and pleasant. Olive oil is so good for nourishing dry lips, skin, and hair. I love how smooth and soft this makes and keeps my lips. Great hydration and creates a nice layer of protection from the elements but is not waxy thick or gross. Fantastic! Totally wonderful lip balm. I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really love the Nivea Kiss of Mint and Minerals lip balm and alternate between the two to keep things interesting [[ASIN:B00COMJ61Q Nivea Kiss of Mint and Minerals Lip Care Blister Card, 0.17 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Good product, arrived quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it! My 18 years old son describes it as &amp;#34;putting heaven on your lips&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love it. I can&#x27;t get enough of it. I bought a box of six and that will last me 5 months</li>
            <li> I have a bit of a thing for lip products, and Nivea is one of my favorite and trusted brands. When I saw this option while buying my resupply of A Kiss of Milk and Honey, I had to try it. I&#x27;m not overly fond of lemon but I love olive oil products. I&#x27;m so glad I did. This balm isn&#x27;t as heavy as the milk and honey balm and has a refreshing, very light &#x27;green&#x27; scent. I can&#x27;t detect any lemon, which is a plus for me. It keeps my lips soft and supply without needing to frequently reapply.</li>
            <li> Best lip care ever!!  Soothing with a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> WORST stuff ever! I am so disappointed with Nivea! ;( I loved the way it smelled so much I bought this pack to give each of my sisters, my mom and grandma and EVERYONE of us all of a sudden started getting extra chapped lips! None of us ever have chapped lips, ever! I wish I could return them</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Ultra lush going on. Doesn&#x27;t leave a grease on your lips.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm, smells great and no residue on lips afterwards.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!! It is so soft and smooth and does not feel at all oily or greasy. I have read some comments that people are worried about that but don&#x27;t be. It is excellent and my lips have never been more smooth and soft. I will never use another kind and have started stock piling it. You can not find it at all in stores though most of the drug store sites have it right now and for a much better price.</li>
            <li> I really like this lip balm. It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t feel waxy like some lip balms, and I like the flavor because it&#x27;s not perfumy or fruity like so many others. It seems to keep my lips moisturized all day, even during the dead of winter in Alaska. This is now the only lip balm I buy and Amazon is the only place I&#x27;ve been able to find it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product because it leaves your lips feeling so smooth. I use to use Carmen but I have to admit I like this one wayyyyyy better.  I gotta order more just to save for whenever I run out.</li>
            <li> finally I found quantity to purchase,at times when not in my local pharmacies;due to buyers not knowing healing products...pricing in this day and age,make it stress free....</li>
