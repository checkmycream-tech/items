            <li>I need to order more.</li>
            <li>THIS is my favorite tanning product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I e-mailed Famous Daves</li>
            <li>As most people write, I&#x27;ve tried all the well-known names on the market.</li>
            <li>Some not horrible.</li>
            <li>They would look ok for a day or two but then started to mottle even when applying again.</li>
            <li>The lotion went on smoothly and had a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>a lot- smells okay and works beautifully-although I did put it on with a tanning &amp;#34;mitt&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited about this product that I&#x27;ve told all my friends about it!</li>
            <li>I love that it is paraben free.</li>
            <li>this is hands down the best self tanner I have ever used, I have been self tanning for years</li>
            <li>I bought this because I read somewhere that it is paraben free.</li>
            <li>and I find the medium/dark formula to still be on the light side</li>
            <li>Love it, will definitely try more of the Famous Daves product line.</li>
            <li>so I usually layer it on twice in one day to get the perfect color.</li>
            <li>This really makes for a realistic tan-less is more on hands; more is more everywhere else.</li>
            <li>Love the color it gives takes 2 days to get good and dark moisturize</li>
            <li>nothing it says is true.  </li>
            <li>PURCHASED LAST OCTOBER WORKED FINE FIRST 3-4 WEEKS, GOOD TAN COLOR,  </li>
            <li>The next day I had a nice smooth tan.</li>
            <li>HOW MUCH OR HOW OFTEN IS PUT ON (FACE)</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>did&#x27;nt work real well on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>That being said, I really didn&#x27;t see any difference in color between this and my L&#x27;Oreal Sublime that I have been using for years.  </li>
            <li>I have used other self tanners but have been looking for a slightly more &amp;#34;skin healthy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I showered normally with bodywash and applied with latex gloves.</li>
            <li>However with some experimenting, I found that using less product everyday and using mosturizer before doing my hands worked great.  </li>
            <li>My husband says it more orange than my usual brand of St tropez</li>
            <li>It looks so natural and so eady to apply!</li>
            <li>It is literally the only one of dozens of lotions I can say that actually smells pretty decent when you put it on.  </li>
            <li>There is no way to tell where you are putting it because it goes on clear.</li>
            <li>and I have done professional spray tans and have tried foam tanners, lotions, gels ect ect.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m naturally olive toned.</li>
            <li>Expensive but good product.</li>
            <li>THEN AND NOW PRETTY MUCH INEFFECTIVE VERY LITTLE COLOR REGARDLESS OF</li>
            <li>This is compounded by its uneven tone on certain areas.</li>

            <li> The medium dark isn&#x27;t dark enough</li>

            <li> Most self tanners make me smell horrible and flake off of me in patches ( YUCK )</li>
            <li> use this product ALL THE TIME, have very pale skin, and have yet to have somewhat comment that the tan appears orange.</li>
            <li> As another user noted, it looks very fake when out in direct sunlight.</li>
            <li> It is so expensive</li>
            <li> It does not patch off and make you look crazy.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> It streaks quite badly.</li>

            <li> This is my favorite Dave&#x27;s product out of the airbrush spray and mousse.&lt;br /&gt;Although you can&#x27;t see the product as you apply it, you still come out with a flawless tan.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product ALL THE TIME, have very pale skin, and have yet to have somewhat comment that the tan appears orange.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned, that being said this self tanning lotion has given me an even tan without streaks.  My husband says it&#x27;s the darkest he has seen me in years!! I love this self tanner and I am hooked.</li>
            <li> Broken pump made this a total mess!</li>
            <li> excellent product and the customer service is excellent as well....have purchased several times its that awesome!!</li>
            <li> I actually love this stuff! Gives me nice color and if I take my time, no streaks or build up in those rough spots.</li>
            <li> My husband says it more orange than my usual brand of St tropez I really wasn&#x27;t impressed with famous Daves I won&#x27;t be ordering again</li>
            <li> Best self tanner I have ever tried!!  Love it, will definitely try more of the Famous Daves product line.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read somewhere that it is paraben free. I have used other self tanners but have been looking for a slightly more &amp;#34;skin healthy&amp;#34; option. These are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The medium dark isn&#x27;t dark enough&lt;br /&gt;2. It streaks quite badly. A previous reviewer said the mitt helps (but I don&#x27;t want to buy a separate product to use it). I can&#x27;t get my legs to look even regardless of how I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;3. As another user noted, it looks very fake when out in direct sunlight. This is compounded by its uneven tone on certain areas. It looks better indoors-so maybe a winter product only?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this up and not throw it away because I don&#x27;t want to waste the $33. Overall, although with less &amp;#34;chemicals&amp;#34; it is still not so very natural, and the aforementioned downsides, along with price are a big enough turn off that I will be trying something else next time around.</li>
            <li> I need to order more. great product</li>
            <li> this is hands down the best self tanner I have ever used, I have been self tanning for years and I have done professional spray tans and have tried foam tanners, lotions, gels ect ect. THIS is my favorite tanning product I have ever used. the color is AMAZING, I dont get that horrible scent even the next day. The lotion doesn&#x27;t have added fragrance so it does not irritate the skin. It smooths on so beautifully, AND the best part of all aside from the color is that there is no color guide! It goes on white so it does not stain all of your clothes and sheets. I am very very pale naturally and I find the medium/dark formula to still be on the light side so I usually layer it on twice in one day to get the perfect color. ALSO it fades evenly! It does not patch off and make you look crazy. Most self tanners make me smell horrible and flake off of me in patches ( YUCK ) This however does not. HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> works good and customer service is great. really impressed with the &amp;#34;no smell&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love that it is paraben free. Having had cancer at age 38, I am now very careful about products I use. The only drawback is that as it weared off, I had a slight green tinge, like I had jaundice. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m naturally olive toned. I will still continue to use it.</li>
            <li> No smell and totally natura! Best there is.</li>
            <li> The best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This has got to be the very best sunless tanning lotion to be had! I tried the moisture tan and realy liked it but it did&#x27;nt work real well on my face and neck. I e-mailed Famous Daves and he suggested using the Small Batch for med to dark. I am so excited about this product that I&#x27;ve told all my friends about it! It looks so natural and so eady to apply! Don&#x27;t take my word for it. Give it a try! You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> As most people write, I&#x27;ve tried all the well-known names on the market. Some not horrible. The biggest problem has always been my hands. I can never get them to have some color without getting too dark. I had the same problem with Dave&#x27;s.  They would look ok for a day or two but then started to mottle even when applying again. The rest looked so awesome. However with some experimenting, I found that using less product everyday and using mosturizer before doing my hands worked great.  This really makes for a realistic tan-less is more on hands; more is more everywhere else. I will order again for sure! I wanted to make a change to my order and their customer service pulled my order and made the change before sending. Great service-awesome product-priced ok.</li>
            <li> nothing it says is true.  It is no better than your standard store bought self tanner.  waste of $$$</li>
            <li> Expensive but good product.</li>
            <li> I have to say, until the chemical reaction starts darkening your skin, this lotion does not smell.  It is literally the only one of dozens of lotions I can say that actually smells pretty decent when you put it on.  That being said, I really didn&#x27;t see any difference in color between this and my L&#x27;Oreal Sublime that I have been using for years.  I also thought it streaked quite a bit, and I am not a sunless tanner newbie. I know how to prepare my skin and put this stuff on.  It is so expensive, I think I&#x27;ll just put up with the smell.</li>
            <li> I had a good experience with this product. I showered normally with bodywash and applied with latex gloves. The lotion went on smoothly and had a nice fragrance. The next day I had a nice smooth tan.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, best product amazing color really recommend!!! I try a lot of self tanning and I had orange color with this tanning perfect color</li>
            <li> I like it a lot- smells okay and works beautifully-although I did put it on with a tanning &amp;#34;mitt&amp;#34;.  There is no way to tell where you are putting it because it goes on clear.</li>
            <li> Love the color it gives takes 2 days to get good and dark moisturize well and color will last several days</li>
