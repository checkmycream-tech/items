            <li>The texture is nice and creamy.</li>

            <li>I am really enjoying it.</li>
            <li>But if you just need a gentle cleanser, it is a great choice.</li>
            <li>love this stuff...</li>
            <li>and I love the smell, and how my face feels after a shower.  </li>

            <li>Nice fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Very quick shipment.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get rid of oil easily...</li>
            <li>Since using this face wash my skin is clearer, my pores are smaller, and my face feels great.</li>
            <li>This is a great facial soap.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s gentle and takes off make-up very easily.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and supple.</li>
            <li>I have semi-oily skin, and this does leave leave my face feeling clean and not oily anymore.</li>
            <li>but this does not and has help my dry skin great deal ....</li>
            <li>the Neutrogena did clean the oils off my skin</li>
            <li>Face feels clean.  </li>
            <li>Just has a great but subtle citrus smell and nice creamy texture but is not too drying.  </li>
            <li>Best of all I hardly get pimples anymore</li>
            <li>Seems to be working pretty good so far.  </li>
            <li>I tried this based on a good review from a friend and a low toxicity rating on the product safety database.  </li>
            <li>It is especially good for sensitive dry or oily skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and had pretty high hopes for this product, The foaming action is awesome and it smells FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>It irritated my skin and it burns mildly.  </li>
            <li>Mild, pleasing scent.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this because I&#x27;m in the process of making my beauty routines more natural, and this wash has a good rating on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Database.</li>
            <li>Love this facial cleanser; not drying to the skin and leaves my skin feeling clean!</li>
            <li>New favorite wash.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite face wash.</li>
            <li>It smells like fresh oranges when you once put it on.</li>
            <li>I like the smell (like fresh oranges).  </li>
            <li>, I trust you will find the right combination.</li>
            <li>, just research it a little bit or better yet, experiment and watch your skin become more manageable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hopefully my 10 years of searching is a good enough reason to take my advice and try this product or something else natural, so you won&#x27;t harm your skin with free-radicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in the process of switching from toxic beauty products to all natural ones and this face wash didn&#x27;t really have many flaws.</li>
            <li>It was a fair bit cheaper but was about half the size too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked around and chose this because I had some tropical smelling body wash</li>
            <li>Very gentle on the face.</li>
            <li>Very gentle wash.  </li>
            <li>many different \\&quot;natural\\&quot; remedy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>My second favorite product (#1 is Dessert Essence) is \\&quot;ALBA ACNEdote Face &amp; Body Scrub\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Also, it arrived fast!</li>
            <li>yet I didn&#x27;t love the texture enough to buy it again.</li>
            <li>so when I tried this cleanser I knew exactly what was causing the problem.</li>
            <li>Its smell is so invigorating and crisp.</li>
            <li>off the oils off my face very well!</li>
            <li>have tried many face washes too, including an at home honey paste, Jason&#x27;s, ProActiv I have never looked and felt younger</li>
            <li>I use one pump and it is more than enough to wash both my face and neck.</li>
            <li>The new order is the the kind with the brown pump (so you have to twist it to open it).</li>
            <li>I would DEFINITELY recommend this face wash to anyone looking to clean up their beauty products!</li>
            <li>One positive</li>
            <li>I am a long time user of Desert Essence products and this cleanser is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used their nighttime face cream for a long time and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He also urged me that all those commercials I saw about Accutane settlements being hogwash, as you can see Dermo&#x27;s are usually, not always, more interested in selling you something than they arein finding the actual SOLUTION to your skin.</li>
            <li>My face is super sensitive and within a week, my face was on fire.</li>
            <li>I used it too take off my dark blue eye shadow and lip gloss and did great....</li>
            <li>This bottle should last me two months easy.</li>
            <li>was using Origins face cleanser that worked really well,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>This product is VERY drying to my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to switch this product</li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li>I use toner afterwards and find that lifts any crud that the gentle cleanser doesn&#x27;t get on days when I&#x27;ve been exposed to a lot of dirt.</li>
            <li>Washes away all my mineral based makeup and is so gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like Desert Essence products.</li>
            <li>I wanted to really like this cleanser, but it burns a bit sometimes.</li>
            <li>I also noticed I wake up with sinus congestion after using this at night unlike other more non toxic products.</li>
            <li>have tried topical&#x27;s, diets and hundreds of different pills (ex: clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline, epiduo, Duac, Retin-A, ziana, differin, triaz and more).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I said NO and never wen&#x27;t back to my dermatologist after he tried pushing Accutane on me for several years.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>I sure could have used this advice a few months ago.</li>
            <li>The consistency is fairly thick, kind of in between a liquid and a gel, and feels so luxurious on your skin.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and leaves it soft and clean.</li>
            <li>And this might sound crazy, but it kind of smells like diluted orange juice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;ve only used this face wash a few times so far, but I couldn&#x27;t wait to post a review, because I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this because it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>Their products have little to none of the toxic ingredients one sees in other beauty products - including \\&quot;organic\\&quot; brands - and yet their products still do a good job.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle; it won&#x27;t make your skin feel tight and fresh.</li>
            <li>You would think something for dry skin wouldn&#x27;t dry it out even more but moisturize it some.</li>
            <li>I did get a little in my eye once, and while it didn&#x27;t feel great, it definitely didn&#x27;t sting as much as other face washes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe if you&#x27;re like me you will realize, despite what every doctor and commercial told me, your diet DOES in fact have a large possibility of affecting your DIET.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive combination skin and am prone to break outs if I use anything harsh on it, so finding this all natural super gentle face wash was a god send.  </li>
            <li>It can take well over a year to get the dairy completely out of your body.</li>
            <li>this (or a natural equivalent) and experiment with your diet</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive -</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all natural and non toxic.  </li>
            <li>but it is sensitive to a lot of things.</li>
            <li>Leaves it feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>you have sensitive, acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the search for a natural, inexpensive alternative!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No irritation to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have incredibly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Even though the label and ingredients are exactly the same as the old one, this new order is definitely different.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin (not oily and not dry)</li>
            <li>My skin is dry in general though, so maybe it would be fine for those who do not have dry skin to begin with.</li>
            <li>especially after work.&lt;br /&gt;Decent prise \\&quot;It Doesnt take much of the oil to clean your entire face, maybe half a dime size.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is common for people&#x27;s hair too, especially when they switch to a more natural shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip ALL of their hair oils, good AND bad.</li>
            <li>I recently changed all my cleaning products to all natural products.  </li>
            <li>I can only recommend Cetaphil this far.</li>
            <li>I use this with EcoTools: Three Cellulose Facial Sponges and all I can say is wow.  </li>
            <li>but It left my skins extremely dry and didnt really reduce my acne.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s face wash doesn&#x27;t leave my skinfeeling clean, nor did it work very well.</li>
            <li>It worked very well and had walnut shells to help scrub and remove dry skin, but it would occasionally dry my face out...</li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Peroxide\\&quot; that&#x27;s in nearly every single acne wash</li>
            <li>IS NOT MOISTURIZING IN THE LEAST AND CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE USED ON MATURE SKIN!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Seems to be working pretty good so far.  </li>
            <li> I tried this based on a good review from a friend and a low toxicity rating on the product safety database.  </li>
            <li> It is especially good for sensitive dry or oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and had pretty high hopes for this product, The foaming action is awesome and it smells FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> It irritated my skin and it burns mildly.  </li>
            <li> Mild, pleasing scent.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this because I&#x27;m in the process of making my beauty routines more natural, and this wash has a good rating on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Database.</li>
            <li> Love this facial cleanser; not drying to the skin and leaves my skin feeling clean!</li>
            <li> New favorite wash.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite face wash.</li>
            <li> It smells like fresh oranges when you once put it on.</li>
            <li> I like the smell (like fresh oranges).  </li>
            <li> , I trust you will find the right combination.</li>
            <li> , just research it a little bit or better yet, experiment and watch your skin become more manageable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully my 10 years of searching is a good enough reason to take my advice and try this product or something else natural, so you won&#x27;t harm your skin with free-radicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in the process of switching from toxic beauty products to all natural ones and this face wash didn&#x27;t really have many flaws.</li>
            <li> It was a fair bit cheaper but was about half the size too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked around and chose this because I had some tropical smelling body wash</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the face.</li>
            <li> Very gentle wash.  </li>
            <li> many different \\&quot;natural\\&quot; remedy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My second favorite product (#1 is Dessert Essence) is \\&quot;ALBA ACNEdote Face &amp; Body Scrub\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Also, it arrived fast!</li>
            <li> yet I didn&#x27;t love the texture enough to buy it again.</li>
            <li> so when I tried this cleanser I knew exactly what was causing the problem.</li>
            <li> Its smell is so invigorating and crisp.</li>
            <li> off the oils off my face very well!</li>
            <li> have tried many face washes too, including an at home honey paste, Jason&#x27;s, ProActiv I have never looked and felt younger</li>
            <li> I use one pump and it is more than enough to wash both my face and neck.</li>
            <li> The new order is the the kind with the brown pump (so you have to twist it to open it).</li>
            <li> I would DEFINITELY recommend this face wash to anyone looking to clean up their beauty products!</li>
            <li> One positive</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Desert Essence products and this cleanser is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used their nighttime face cream for a long time and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He also urged me that all those commercials I saw about Accutane settlements being hogwash, as you can see Dermo&#x27;s are usually, not always, more interested in selling you something than they arein finding the actual SOLUTION to your skin.</li>
            <li> My face is super sensitive and within a week, my face was on fire.</li>
            <li> I used it too take off my dark blue eye shadow and lip gloss and did great....</li>
            <li> This bottle should last me two months easy.</li>
            <li> was using Origins face cleanser that worked really well,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> This product is VERY drying to my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to switch this product</li>
            <li> but it really didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li> I use toner afterwards and find that lifts any crud that the gentle cleanser doesn&#x27;t get on days when I&#x27;ve been exposed to a lot of dirt.</li>
            <li> Washes away all my mineral based makeup and is so gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like Desert Essence products.</li>
            <li> I wanted to really like this cleanser, but it burns a bit sometimes.</li>
            <li> I also noticed I wake up with sinus congestion after using this at night unlike other more non toxic products.</li>
            <li> have tried topical&#x27;s, diets and hundreds of different pills (ex: clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline, epiduo, Duac, Retin-A, ziana, differin, triaz and more).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I said NO and never wen&#x27;t back to my dermatologist after he tried pushing Accutane on me for several years.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> I sure could have used this advice a few months ago.</li>
            <li> The consistency is fairly thick, kind of in between a liquid and a gel, and feels so luxurious on your skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and leaves it soft and clean.</li>
            <li> And this might sound crazy, but it kind of smells like diluted orange juice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;ve only used this face wash a few times so far, but I couldn&#x27;t wait to post a review, because I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this because it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> Their products have little to none of the toxic ingredients one sees in other beauty products - including \\&quot;organic\\&quot; brands - and yet their products still do a good job.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle; it won&#x27;t make your skin feel tight and fresh.</li>
            <li> You would think something for dry skin wouldn&#x27;t dry it out even more but moisturize it some.</li>
            <li> I did get a little in my eye once, and while it didn&#x27;t feel great, it definitely didn&#x27;t sting as much as other face washes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe if you&#x27;re like me you will realize, despite what every doctor and commercial told me, your diet DOES in fact have a large possibility of affecting your DIET.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive combination skin and am prone to break outs if I use anything harsh on it, so finding this all natural super gentle face wash was a god send.  </li>
            <li> It can take well over a year to get the dairy completely out of your body.</li>
            <li> this (or a natural equivalent) and experiment with your diet</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive -</li>
            <li> The ingredients are all natural and non toxic.  </li>
            <li> but it is sensitive to a lot of things.</li>
            <li> Leaves it feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> you have sensitive, acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the search for a natural, inexpensive alternative!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No irritation to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have incredibly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Even though the label and ingredients are exactly the same as the old one, this new order is definitely different.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin (not oily and not dry)</li>
            <li> My skin is dry in general though, so maybe it would be fine for those who do not have dry skin to begin with.</li>
            <li> especially after work.&lt;br /&gt;Decent prise \\&quot;It Doesnt take much of the oil to clean your entire face, maybe half a dime size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is common for people&#x27;s hair too, especially when they switch to a more natural shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip ALL of their hair oils, good AND bad.</li>
            <li> I recently changed all my cleaning products to all natural products.  </li>
            <li> I can only recommend Cetaphil this far.</li>
            <li> I use this with EcoTools: Three Cellulose Facial Sponges and all I can say is wow.  </li>
            <li> but It left my skins extremely dry and didnt really reduce my acne.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s face wash doesn&#x27;t leave my skinfeeling clean, nor did it work very well.</li>
            <li> It worked very well and had walnut shells to help scrub and remove dry skin, but it would occasionally dry my face out...</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Peroxide\\&quot; that&#x27;s in nearly every single acne wash</li>
            <li> IS NOT MOISTURIZING IN THE LEAST AND CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE USED ON MATURE SKIN!</li>
            <li> Guys, my new order came in and I have to say I need to knock my rating down a star.</li>
            <li> Less gentle cleansers leave my face with dry patches, but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I tried coming back to dairy tons of times and every single time I would have a massive breakout for a week or two.</li>
            <li> the tea tree dried my slightly oily face pretty severely when used twice daily.</li>
            <li> Benzoyl Peroxide has been BANNED in EU and plenty of other areas, not only in their FOOD, but also their facial products.</li>
            <li> the container I got looks slightly different from the picture of this product; the pump is white plastic instead of black.    </li>
            <li> I have stuck with this cleanser for a very long time, as it doesn&#x27;t contribute to breakouts or trigger any redness/irritation.</li>
            <li> self, if you throw lotion on all the time you are teaching your skin not to do anything when it is dry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin.</li>
            <li> does sometimes, about 20% of the time leave your skin \\&quot;partially\\&quot; dry.</li>
            <li> This organic facial wash is extremely gentle and non irritating.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out!</li>
            <li> As far as topical&#x27;s go, I&#x27;ve used over the counter/dermatologist recommended ones, but they never did anything but burn my skin, irritate it, dry it out, and make my acne look worse.</li>
            <li> It is a little gritty and feels a bit like an exfoliant.</li>
            <li> I got all of these little white heads all over my face since I started using it.</li>
            <li> plus, I have found it dries my skin out a little, but I have reallllllly oily skin so to replenish I alternate between jojoba oil and argan oil after using this face wash.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the cleanser dries up and clogs the dispenser, and this needs to be cleared out every few weeks.</li>
            <li> It smells good, isn&#x27;t expensive, but I unfortunately cannot recommend this cleanser for ANY skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> You need very little of the product and the bottle will last you for months and months.</li>
            <li> They usually complain it leaves their hair so oily, but consider that your hair and skin are producing oils in hyperspeed to make up for the shampoo stripping the oils away, same concept as this.</li>
            <li> (I was using Weleda Almond Soothing Cleansing Lotion, but it and EVERY other lotions I have EVER tried, seem to make me breakout)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why that would be, but it has happened a number of times, so I will be looking elsewhere for my next organic cleanser.</li>
            <li> but it leaves my skin a little dry and does not fully remove my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I am sad because I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the cleanser is not as gentle as it claims.  </li>
            <li> I wear foundation and maybe it didn&#x27;t break down the foundation and wash it off?</li>
            <li> was looking for something comparible for less, and found&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> During the cold months especially, I just use it every other day, as not to get too dry.  </li>
            <li> I use this in the shower rather than soap which is so harsh.  </li>
            <li> My skin broke out within a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great for removing makeup, but for simple cleansing it works like a charm for me.</li>
            <li> I can even skip a few days washing my face and no longer break out.</li>
            <li> This combo is rejuvenating without any messy side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use my lotion anymore, except in extreme situations, and I usually regret using it when I do!</li>
            <li> The container conveniently allows you to pump a small amount.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I have shied away from Benzoyl Peroxide and other harmful chemicals, in search of something that doesn&#x27;t irritate and make my acne look worse, I have come across</li>
            <li> To be frank, I&#x27;m a little disappointed with this new bottle :/</li>
            <li> Crazy joker didn&#x27;t know squat about what Accutance does on a physical or scientific level.</li>
            <li> Just because it says its \\&quot;approved\\&quot; in the US, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s safe.&lt;br</li>
            <li> VERY HARSH ON THE EYES!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some of the reviews say that it burns/stings, I have definitely not experienced that.</li>
            <li> In fact, it has gotten worse.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how it managed to accomplish this feat but after 2 weeks of use I had to discontinue using it because it irritated my skin so horribly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sad about it.</li>
            <li> not to bad imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The cleanser seems nice but I have to take the top off to use it as the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Works great! Smells amazing too. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out!</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;I was using Origins face cleanser that worked really well,&lt;br /&gt;but it became unaffordable&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something comparible for less, and found&lt;br /&gt;it in this product</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the face. Pleasant smell. I like it and would purchase again</li>
            <li> Did not like it because it has a waxy consistency.  Left my face and hands feeling waxy even after several rinses of water.</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIES DO NOT USE!! VERY HARSH ON THE EYES! IS NOT MOISTURIZING IN THE LEAST AND CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE USED ON MATURE SKIN!</li>
            <li> This product is VERY drying to my face. You would think something for dry skin wouldn&#x27;t dry it out even more but moisturize it some. Its so drying that I have to put coconut oil on my face afterwards. I will be returning this.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this because it&#x27;s all natural and I LOVE the moisturizer. My face is super sensitive and within a week, my face was on fire. Boooooo</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Desert Essence products and this cleanser is my all time favorite. Wonderful scent and leaves skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Just has a great but subtle citrus smell and nice creamy texture but is not too drying.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> THIS CLEANER is great because it&#x27;s organic, however it dries out my skin. I think it would work great if you have oily skin!</li>
            <li> Nice cleanser with awesome smell. It is a runny type of cleanser so if you are looking for a thicker one this isn&#x27;t for you. My skin feels clean and supple. Organic is my biggest concern for this price point you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> ive tried this and the tea tree face wash by the same company. the tea tree dried my slightly oily face pretty severely when used twice daily. this does a good job.</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance, lathers and cleans well without stripping or drying out the skin. The only downside is that the cleanser dries up and clogs the dispenser, and this needs to be cleared out every few weeks.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t experienced any over-drying of skin, except in the winter, or when I use it MORE than ONCE a day. Regardless, if you have been using products on your face then you facial oils are all out of whack and will take some time before they \\&quot;learn\\&quot; how to react to dryness or oilyness. Think about it, most people have been doing their skin&#x27;s work them self, if you throw lotion on all the time you are teaching your skin not to do anything when it is dry. If you continue to not use lotion your skin will basically re-learn how to moisturize itself. This is common for people&#x27;s hair too, especially when they switch to a more natural shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip ALL of their hair oils, good AND bad. They usually complain it leaves their hair so oily, but consider that your hair and skin are producing oils in hyperspeed to make up for the shampoo stripping the oils away, same concept as this. Hope that make sense, just research it a little bit or better yet, experiment and watch your skin become more manageable.

Once I quit eating dairy I realized my acne had miraculously disappeared. I tried coming back to dairy tons of times and every single time I would have a massive breakout for a week or two. Keep in mind, if you decide to experiment with this, dairy stays in your system for an immense amount of time. It can take well over a year to get the dairy completely out of your body. Despite this, I do notice clearer skin after about 2 weeks of NO dairy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully my 10 years of searching is a good enough reason to take my advice and try this product or something else natural, so you won&#x27;t harm your skin with free-radicals.

I asked how Accutane changes your blood and he shrugged, I laughed out of amazement, not disrespect, and told him I literally know more about the drug than he does (now this was out of disrespect). NEVER WENT BACK! He also urged me that all those commercials I saw about Accutane settlements being hogwash, as you can see Dermo&#x27;s are usually, not always, more interested in selling you something than they arein finding the actual SOLUTION to your skin.</li>
            <li> New favorite wash. No nonsense. Neutral smell. Great for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;No problems, been using for 6+ months.</li>
            <li> Excellent and nourishing to the skin</li>
            <li> I tried this based on a good review from a friend and a low toxicity rating on the product safety database.  But it really dried out my skin, and it also really stings if it gets in my eyes.  One positive, it smells REALLY good!  I am sad because I really wanted to like this product.  My skin is dry in general though, so maybe it would be fine for those who do not have dry skin to begin with.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive - I use this in the shower rather than soap which is so harsh.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this face wash during October 2013 and have been using twice a day for eight months now. It does feel better knowing that I&#x27;m not using harmful chemicals on my face. The smell is GREAT. It smells like fresh oranges when you once put it on. The texture is nice and creamy. The container conveniently allows you to pump a small amount. I have semi-oily skin, and this does leave leave my face feeling clean and not oily anymore. And it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I came back because I plan to get buy refill.    Note: the container I got looks slightly different from the picture of this product; the pump is white plastic instead of black.    *** UPDATE 8.12.2014 ***  Guys, my new order came in and I have to say I need to knock my rating down a star. The new order is the the kind with the brown pump (so you have to twist it to open it). The citrusy smell is gone, and the face wash is more foamy whereas the one before had a gel-like consistency. Even though the label and ingredients are exactly the same as the old one, this new order is definitely different. To be frank, I&#x27;m a little disappointed with this new bottle :/</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, it&#x27;s gentle and takes off make-up very easily.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this face wash. I have extremely sensitive combination skin and am prone to break outs if I use anything harsh on it, so finding this all natural super gentle face wash was a god send.  It has a rating of 0 on EWG, which I love. Since using this face wash my skin is clearer, my pores are smaller, and my face feels great. Also, it arrived fast!</li>
            <li> My skin feels great after I finish using this.  I feel great that it&#x27;s good for my skin too.  Smells good and the pump is convenient.</li>
            <li> Have purchased several times and always arrives quickly &amp; in perfect condition.  Love this facial cleanser; not drying to the skin and leaves my skin feeling clean!</li>
            <li> This organic facial wash is extremely gentle and non irritating. It is especially good for sensitive dry or oily skin. It is especially good&lt;br /&gt;on brown/black skin. It&#x27;s very moisturizing.  Perfect!!!  pj44pj</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this but it arrived slightly open and leaking. When i used it it smelled like oranges and vomit. I&#x27;m very sad about it.</li>
            <li> I recently changed all my cleaning products to all natural products.  I did a lot of research and found this cleanser on ewg.org.  The ingredients are all natural and non toxic.  Unfortunately, the cleanser is not as gentle as it claims.  It irritated my skin and it burns mildly.  I think some kind of citrus type product is in there causing this problem.  I really wanted to switch this product so I used it for two weeks but it really didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite face wash. I have normal skin (not oily and not dry) but it is sensitive to a lot of things. Recently I went organic in my skincare and found this online. I love it! It has only organic ingredients and it smells Iike orange juice concentrate :) it&#x27;s nice and smooth and rinses off cleanly. Best of all I hardly get pimples anymore and I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I like the smell (like fresh oranges).  I like the silky suds but it leaves my skin a little dry and does not fully remove my eye makeup. I also noticed I wake up with sinus congestion after using this at night unlike other more non toxic products.</li>
            <li> This product burns my face. I have been using it for a couple of weeks thinking that it would just take some time for my skin to adapt, but it has not. In fact, it has gotten worse.  I would not buy this again.  It does smell fantastic though!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a face cleanser that works as a makeup remover.  This does not do the job well enough.</li>
            <li> it smell good if you like citrus smell ...pump works great and easy to apply and no burning sensation at all when I&#x27;ve used noxema it burn my face but this does not and has help my dry skin great deal ....for me it works so if allergic to citrus or orange smell might not want use...I used it too take off my dark blue eye shadow and lip gloss and did great....follow instructions too the tee and it been great using...can&#x27;t wait too try more of these products!</li>
            <li> Very quick shipment. Product was as described. I am really enjoying it. It smells terrific!</li>
            <li> Very gentle wash.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and leaves it soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I like this product. It is very gentle; it won&#x27;t make your skin feel tight and fresh. If you wear a lot of makeup it&#x27;s probably not that great. But if you just need a gentle cleanser, it is a great choice. Less gentle cleansers leave my face with dry patches, but this one doesn&#x27;t. Nice fresh smell. I use toner afterwards and find that lifts any crud that the gentle cleanser doesn&#x27;t get on days when I&#x27;ve been exposed to a lot of dirt.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working pretty good so far.  I like the fact that you can also use on the eyes, there is no stinging.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a nice organic cleanser</li>
            <li> Great light smell. Doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin. Leaves it feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial soap. It got an excellent rating by EWG. It foams up well. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in the process of switching from toxic beauty products to all natural ones and this face wash didn&#x27;t really have many flaws. The smell is tangy and wonderful yet I didn&#x27;t love the texture enough to buy it again. It is a little gritty and feels a bit like an exfoliant. I didn&#x27;t notice this wash clearing up any blemishes on my face but it did leave it feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and had pretty high hopes for this product, The foaming action is awesome and it smells FANTASTIC. EXCEPT.....I got all of these little white heads all over my face since I started using it. SOOOO...Not for me. Back to the only chemical cleaner that wont make me break out....BOOOOO&lt;br /&gt;fyi....I wear foundation and maybe it didn&#x27;t break down the foundation and wash it off? (grasping for reasons here)</li>
            <li> My skin broke out within a few days of using it. Had to return this.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it managed to accomplish this feat but after 2 weeks of use I had to discontinue using it because it irritated my skin so horribly. I haven&#x27;t had any issues in years with my skin so when I tried this cleanser I knew exactly what was causing the problem. It smells good, isn&#x27;t expensive, but I unfortunately cannot recommend this cleanser for ANY skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive, acne prone skin I can only recommend Cetaphil this far. It&#x27;s against my personal beliefs (animal testing/byproducts) but it works. I&#x27;m still on the search for a natural, inexpensive alternative!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desert Essence&#x27;s Blemish Touch Stick works great on spots, though!</li>
            <li> I have stuck with this cleanser for a very long time, as it doesn&#x27;t contribute to breakouts or trigger any redness/irritation. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for super oily skin but it works great for my redness-prone, breakout-prone skin. They sell this at specialty supermarkets and online drugstores but I&#x27;ve had good luck ordering it on Amazon twice now. It&#x27;s not great for removing makeup, but for simple cleansing it works like a charm for me. I pair it with Tarte tinted moisturizer or Tarte powder foundation.</li>
            <li> Love love love this face wash! Its smell is so invigorating and crisp. Washes away all my mineral based makeup and is so gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> love this stuff...it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li> I really like Desert Essence products. Their products have little to none of the toxic ingredients one sees in other beauty products - including \\&quot;organic\\&quot; brands - and yet their products still do a good job. And their prices are quite good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the 3rd or 4th time I&#x27;ve used this cleanser. I find that it does the job without drying out my combination skin. You need very little of the product and the bottle will last you for months and months. I&#x27;ve also used their nighttime face cream for a long time and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product and company.</li>
            <li> Bought this stuff after using Neutrogena Men for some time, the difference?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my oppinion the Neutrogena did clean the oils off my skin but It left my skins extremely dry and didnt really reduce my acne. It was a fair bit cheaper but was about half the size too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked around and chose this because I had some tropical smelling body wash and I thought it would go well together. And it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells Good, Smells like a fruit, doesnt have a chemy type smell.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans off the oils off my face very well! especially after work.&lt;br /&gt;Decent prise \\&quot;It Doesnt take much of the oil to clean your entire face, maybe half a dime size.&lt;br /&gt;And it is made in America if that matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does sometimes, about 20% of the time leave your skin \\&quot;partially\\&quot; dry. not to bad imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good buy imo.</li>
            <li> Mild, pleasing scent.  Face feels clean.  No irritation to my sensitive skin.  A little goes a long way.  During the cold months especially, I just use it every other day, as not to get too dry.  The spout clogs up after several uses, so I keep a toothpick next to the bottle to remove the blockage.</li>
            <li> No harmful ingredients when you look at EWG.org/skindeep&lt;br /&gt;A plus, I have found it dries my skin out a little, but I have reallllllly oily skin so to replenish I alternate between jojoba oil and argan oil after using this face wash. If I ever break out, which I tell you is infrequent now I put Desert Essence tea tree oil ointment for those spots. I swear by this route. If you struggle with finding a good, healthy alternative to your toxic face wash this is a good product to try. I can even skip a few days washing my face and no longer break out. I could not be happier!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many face washes too, including an at home honey paste, Jason&#x27;s, ProActiv I have never looked and felt younger and I am only 22!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also suggest taking a vitamin for hair, skin, and nails. This combo is rejuvenating without any messy side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really hope this helps someone cause I sure could have used this advice a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I use this with EcoTools: Three Cellulose Facial Sponges and all I can say is wow.  I&#x27;m a guy and I love the smell, and how my face feels after a shower.  I highly recommend this.  This bottle should last me two months easy.</li>
            <li> I wanted to really like this cleanser, but it burns a bit sometimes. I don&#x27;t think I have incredibly sensitive skin and I&#x27;m able to use all kinds of skin products without irritation, but I wanted to switch to an organic cleanser, so I tried this.  It stings my cheeks and under my eyes when I use it. I&#x27;m not sure why that would be, but it has happened a number of times, so I will be looking elsewhere for my next organic cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;ve only used this face wash a few times so far, but I couldn&#x27;t wait to post a review, because I LOVE it! It is definitely my favorite face wash I have ever used. I decided to try this because I&#x27;m in the process of making my beauty routines more natural, and this wash has a good rating on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Database. I use one pump and it is more than enough to wash both my face and neck. The consistency is fairly thick, kind of in between a liquid and a gel, and feels so luxurious on your skin. I have very dry skin, and when I rinse this off my face feels perfect, before even adding any moisturizer. And this might sound crazy, but it kind of smells like diluted orange juice. It makes me crave OJ every morning I use it! I&#x27;m not sure why some of the reviews say that it burns/stings, I have definitely not experienced that. I did get a little in my eye once, and while it didn&#x27;t feel great, it definitely didn&#x27;t sting as much as other face washes I&#x27;ve used. I would DEFINITELY recommend this face wash to anyone looking to clean up their beauty products!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get rid of oil easily...</li>
