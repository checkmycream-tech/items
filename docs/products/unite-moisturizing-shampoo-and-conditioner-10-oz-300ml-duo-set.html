    <ol>
            <li>Very good product.  </li>
            <li>Over priced and not that great.</li>
            <li>I was purchased this shampoo and conditioner from my hair stylist and I loved them</li>
            <li>I have a good amount of hair which is colored..</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I also got compliments on how nice my hair scent was.  </li>
            <li>In terms of hair products I have tried almost every kind of shampoo and conditioner and nothing compares.</li>
            <li>I use the Unite detangler and liked it (until I found a better cheaper product).  </li>
            <li>By far the best shampoo and conditioner..</li>
            <li>I use Theorie and it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>Love the way this product works with my hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is okay, but I just noticed it contains Wheat Protein, and being allergic to gluten</li>
            <li>This size is great and the pump is very convenient.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The price was good, and this product is very had to find in my area.  </li>
            <li>It might be perfect for other hair types.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner leave my hair clean and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It smells so wonderful and gives my fine limp hair some body.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair smooth and silky at all.</li>
            <li>I like more lather personally, but they do smell very pretty :)</li>
            <li>After the 3rd use I love it!</li>
            <li>Just ok for me, I like their other products better like the Lazer Straight and the 7 seconds.</li>
            <li>Hair is silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>If not, I think it&#x27;s better than a lot of other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo but the conditioner is too heavy for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I like them a lot, and they are good for thin, curly, and highlighted hair.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair incredibly soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re sensitive to gluten, don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>I have been to tons of different hair dressers in the past and one of the many reasons I stick with my lady is because she recommend this product.</li>
            <li>so it really lasts a long time.</li>

            <li> A little on the pricey side but not out of line with other brands.</li>
            <li> It appears to be fake and diluted with generic product in order to keep some of the same fragrance.</li>

            <li> Over priced and not that great. I use the Unite detangler and liked it (until I found a better cheaper product).  The shampoo and conditioner is disappointing. I use Theorie and it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> It was an alright purchase</li>
            <li> The shampoo didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair as advertised.  It turned it into a ball of frizz.  The conditioner weighed down my hair.  Considering the price, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After switching to several other products due to changing hairdressers, I ended up ordering something I used to use because I need to order the 7 seconds detangling conditioner.  I am so glad that I did.  The price was good, and this product is very had to find in my area.  I also got compliments on how nice my hair scent was.

            <li> I have curly hair that I am constantly abusing, between colors, blow drying and the flat iron. This stuff saves me!! In terms of hair products I have tried almost every kind of shampoo and conditioner and nothing compares. I only feel like I need a little so it really lasts a long time. I have been to tons of different hair dressers in the past and one of the many reasons I stick with my lady is because she recommend this product. My hair has never felt healthier!</li>
            <li> Love the way this product works with my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I will use.  My hair dresser recommended it and she uses it.  It smells so wonderful and gives my fine limp hair some body.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair incredibly soft and shiny! A little on the pricey side but not out of line with other brands.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is okay, but I just noticed it contains Wheat Protein, and being allergic to gluten this is a no-go for me. I think my hair reacted a little strange to this shampoo and know now that it&#x27;s because of the Wheat. So if you&#x27;re sensitive to gluten, don&#x27;t do it. If not, I think it&#x27;s better than a lot of other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Everything arrived as promised. I have been using this product for years. This size is great and the pump is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo but the conditioner is too heavy for my hair.  It might be perfect for other hair types.  My hair is thin and damaged from highlighting.</li>
            <li> 1st use I did not like it. After the 3rd use I love it! Hair is silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Got this set for my wife and she loves it. The only caveat is that this stuff is ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> I was purchased this shampoo and conditioner from my hair stylist and I loved them so I purchased them on amazon when I ran out instead of paying salon mark-up prices.&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff. My hair has never looked and felt healthier..</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner leave my hair clean and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> By far the best shampoo and conditioner..even if the Unite types. i have tried all/everything. I have a good amount of hair which is colored..this helps with smoothing out frizzy&#x27;s and adding volume ..it&#x27;s not overly heavy or oily. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just ok for me, I like their other products better like the Lazer Straight and the 7 seconds. I like more lather personally, but they do smell very pretty :)</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Recvd promptly.  Will purchase again from same.</li>
            <li> I would give this product no stars if possible. It appears to be fake and diluted with generic product in order to keep some of the same fragrance. The results were not the same as when I&#x27;ve used this product in the salon. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair smooth and silky at all. Such a waste of money- I don&#x27;t even want to use it.</li>
