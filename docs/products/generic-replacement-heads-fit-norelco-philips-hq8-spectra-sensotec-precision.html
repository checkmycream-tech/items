            <li>You could get a better shave by putting your face in a running weed eater.</li>
            <li>Easy replacement and shaves close</li>
            <li>Fit is good, but the blades are rougher on skin than old ones.&lt;br /&gt;Suggest a laser cut on blades for better comfort.</li>
            <li>The blades (bottom row in the picture) worked fine</li>
            <li>Would strongly suggest paying more and getting real blades...</li>
            <li>And do not match the original product</li>
            <li>I does not give me a clean shave.</li>

            <li>My husband said his old blades were better than new ones</li>
            <li>Replacing the old heads has cut my shaving time substantially as I&#x27;ve had the original heads on the shaver now for some time.</li>
            <li>shaves worth than my 2 year old blades&lt;</li>
            <li>After a couple of attempts, I threw the whole razor in the trash.</li>
            <li>I tried the replacements for a week and got better results going back to the old</li>
            <li>multiple passes and still need to shave again as not as close of shave as original.  </li>
            <li>it is Generic but not even close to the real heads I have to get new original heads after a month</li>
            <li>but hey, these are the only ones available for my old razor</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Not as close shave as the original ones, and the center &#x27;hub&#x27; came out of 2 of the three heads.</li>
            <li>Need new ones already&lt;br /&gt;jwm</li>
            <li>With all new parts, they just pulled the hair out.</li>
            <li>it just did not cut like the new ones</li>
            <li>not as sharp as original blades.</li>
            <li>Works well, but the first time I washed it out the middle part came off (ungluded)</li>
            <li>He had to use the new blades and old parts that run over his face.  </li>
            <li>so far I can&#x27;t tell the difference from Norelco</li>
            <li>I then reinstalled the old ones and the shave was closer.</li>
            <li>replaced with old heads, no problem</li>
            <li>While these blades fit into the unit well enough, they did not seem to be as sharp as I would have supposed.</li>
            <li>As others have commented, these blades are not sharp.  </li>
            <li>I actually get a closer shave from my old blades.</li>
            <li>Not very sharp.</li>
            <li>Slight pull when you move the electric rasor across your fsce too fast.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery but blades were blunt from the start and not fit for purpose, pulling hairs more than cutting them.</li>

            <li> Better than what I had ben using for many years. It&#x27;s all about the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery but blades were blunt from the start and not fit for purpose, pulling hairs more than cutting them. Advised that they needed to be run in!!! As a mechanical engineer I do not know of any cutting blades that get sharper with use?</li>
            <li> Work better than the last store bought replacement parts</li>
            <li> As others have commented, these blades are not sharp.  I actually get a closer shave from my old blades. Somewhat suspect these blades are used.</li>

            <li> The purchase by mistake. Good for nothing. I dropped them</li>
            <li> They were worse than the  originals  needing replaced. Forced to buy new electric razor.</li>
            <li> After replacing the old heads with these I found the shave was not as I expected. I then reinstalled the old ones and the shave was closer.</li>
            <li> shaves worth than my 2 year old blades&lt;br /&gt;don&#x60;t guy it!</li>
            <li> Very dull and pulls hair bad...  Do not recommend these to anyone...  Would strongly suggest paying more and getting real blades...</li>
            <li> This was advertised as &amp;#34;fits all&amp;#34;.  That is not the case.  How do I process a refund?</li>
            <li> it pulls. replaced with old heads, no problem</li>
            <li> Just as good as the original Norelco heads.</li>
            <li> not as sharp as original blades. multiple passes and still need to shave again as not as close of shave as original.  do not fit well.</li>

            <li> They fir good and work well.</li>
            <li> These heads pull whiskers rather than cut them.  Not worth the savings.</li>
            <li> The blades (bottom row in the picture) worked fine but the outside ring didn&#x27;t work (top row in the picture).  He had to use the new blades and old parts that run over his face.  With all new parts, they just pulled the hair out.</li>
            <li> These blades pulled most of the hair out of my face.  What hair it didn&#x27;t pull out, it left.  After a couple of attempts, I threw the whole razor in the trash.</li>
            <li> Slight pull when you move the electric rasor across your fsce too fast.</li>
            <li> Seller is a prompt shipper. Product is junk. You could get a better shave by putting your face in a running weed eater. Shave was painful and I ended up reinstalling my old blades. Save your money!</li>

            <li> sure needed them thanks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the price but they work and redeem my razor to shave well again.</li>
            <li> Instead of buying these, do yourself a real favor and get a different shaver with two rings of cutting blades on each head. Using a single for so long I just had no idea how much better those really are, quicker and closer shave.</li>
            <li> I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THE GENERIC REPLACEMENT HEADS.  THEY ARE NOISY AND THEY PULL ON MY BEARD.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET A CLOSE SHAVE WITH THEM.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM1</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that they work properly. They don&#x27;t seem to turn as quickly.</li>
            <li> These arrived with no packaging or documentation whatsoever. Just three replacement heads in a small zip lock baggie. Just seemed fishy to me. I returned them so I can&#x27;t vouch for their quality on a shaver.</li>
            <li> Was not able to get a decent shave with replacement heads even after repeated circular motion method.&lt;br /&gt;I will not reorder or recommend the heads.</li>
