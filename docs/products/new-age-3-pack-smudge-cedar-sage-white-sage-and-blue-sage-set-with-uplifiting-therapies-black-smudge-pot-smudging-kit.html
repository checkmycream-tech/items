            <li>Easy to use, very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>OK...</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>great item , didn&#x27;t have a chance to do the house yet but seller emailed me helpful tips and procedures so really looking forward to cleansing my house and getting rid of all the negativity</li>
            <li>its okay.</li>
            <li>i will buy more now I know where it get it</li>
            <li>Makes you feel better every time you do a \\&quot;cleansing\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>An expert may want one better but I like this one.</li>
            <li>I liked the nice pure smell of sage.</li>
            <li>love the sage sticks, but the bowl is cheap.</li>
            <li>Looks cheap material</li>
            <li>I would advise buying only the sticks, and finding your own cool ash bowl on your own.</li>
            <li>I must say the bowl that it came with was extremely useful!</li>
            <li>I love the metal pot especially that it comes with its own cover not like the one that I bought before.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>The  little pot that comes with it  is nice and cute.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t miss this exciting bundle too:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok - sage smells good, but smudging pot is actually gold &amp; looks a lot smaller than pictured.</li>
            <li>I have used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I have found that loose sage works much better.  </li>
            <li>Since I have never used one I would have liked a little instructions</li>
            <li>I think this is a good price, but I have a hard time getting these smudge sticks to burn.  </li>
            <li>with smudging doesn&#x27;t really matter so that is why I couldn&#x27;t understand some reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.  </li>
            <li>Really like the smell of the wands.</li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON</li>

            <li> my experience too much smudge is usually creating headaches so less is more in this</li>
            <li> Seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The bowl is tiny, just about 3 inches across and the top is made of wood which I think is dangerous considering you&#x27;re using fire.  </li>
            <li> very thin wood &amp; cover doesnt fit on well.</li>
            <li> The little bowl is really too small.</li>
            <li> will look for other items of this merchant.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> The bundles are very short and small too.  </li>
            <li> It helped me get the job done and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this a 3 star because for me this is like any other product that I&#x27;ve bought before.</li>
            <li> not worth the price charged.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money...</li>
            <li> Little small for the smudge sticks</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the size of the bowl which is represented as much larger than it really is.  </li>
            <li> And the sage was really hard to work with.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the little black container.  </li>
            <li> The black chips off the bowl within a few weeks which is upsetting and annoying.</li>
            <li> I am so very disappointed in this item-</li>
            <li> disgusting scent ..</li>
