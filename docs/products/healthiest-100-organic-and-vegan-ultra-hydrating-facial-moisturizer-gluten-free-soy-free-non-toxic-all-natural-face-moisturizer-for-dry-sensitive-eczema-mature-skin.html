            <li>I love this moisturizer!</li>

            <li>It was smooth and smelled great.</li>
            <li>This worked AMAZING.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to warn anyone who has ordered this product with all of the warm weather.  </li>
            <li>All of my feedback and review are 100% honest and my own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**I received this product for my honest unbiased opinion</li>
            <li>The manufacturer gave me a sample for evaluation so that I could give you this honest review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been loving it.</li>
            <li>also tried this on my heels, elbows and knees and learned that it&#x27;s perfect to use on these drier parts since this moisturizes really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own and are honest..</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own and are honest.</li>
            <li>If your home gets too warm just refrigerate</li>
            <li>Thats my HONEST review</li>
            <li>and I must say, it is a wonderful food for my skin: I normally use as a mask and wipe off the excess before retiring for night.</li>
            <li>Once I&#x27;m able to use I will amend a more detailed review - just wanted to give everyone fair warning!</li>
            <li>have had great results from this moisturizer, it absorbs quickly and is non greasy.</li>
            <li>Thank you for this epic find and for the wonderful customer service!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge relief to know there is not a trace of anything unnatural, although you would never be able to tell, as I truly think it&#x27;s as good as any fancy brand out there.</li>
            <li>I received a free product to try and review however, all opinions are unbiased, honest and my own.</li>
            <li>I’m so happy I finally found a great moisturizer that I don’t have to use a bunch of product to hydrate my skin.</li>
            <li>For best absorption, apply right after getting out of the shower or right after washing the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She gave me very detailed instructions on how to restore the moisturizer to its intended state:)</li>

            <li>I love the way that it smells, which influences me to use it more often like I should.</li>
            <li>The cream has an interesting consistency , it is like a cream and becomes an oil when you apply it It gets</li>
            <li>one or more of those four ingredients is probably why.  </li>
            <li>It should feel much better.</li>
            <li>Thank you for creating healthy, cruelty-free, sustainable products that don&#x27;t skimp on quality &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>This is now one of my favorite moisturizers.  </li>

            <li>love the 100% organic ingredient list</li>
            <li>and I love that there are no preservatives, though this means that the cream should be used within 6 months or kept refrigerated for longer shelf life.</li>
            <li>This is a close as it gets to perfection if you want an all natural product with an incredible formulation.</li>
            <li>All the cruelty free/organic/ naturalness of it all is just a cherry on top.</li>
            <li>This facial moisturizer is impressive.</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>In exchange for My HONEST review, I was offered this product for free..  </li>
            <li>I use it on my forehead and around my eyes, where I need it most.  </li>
            <li>I do love what it does in those areas.  </li>

            <li>I use it day and at night, and I love that it&#x27;s made up of clean, organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Although I think this is a great versatile product, the two downsides for me was that the scent of shea butter was pretty evident</li>
            <li>It was an easy fix though.</li>
            <li>I cannot tolerate strong scents, and thankfully, this does not offend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the super clean ingredients!</li>
            <li>After leaving it in the fridge for a while, it was fine</li>
            <li>Not everyone has a problem with these ingredients, so you might tolerate them just fine.  </li>
            <li>great product...feels a bit greasy at first, but it doesnt last and makes a nice moisturizer.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;I received a free sample for review.</li>

            <li>oxide).&lt;br /&gt;Right now this is my new favorite moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Original Message:  </li>
            <li>I mostly smell the Shea Butter, which is the first ingredient.</li>
            <li>I mostly smell the Shea Butter, which is the first ingredient.</li>
            <li>This product was not for me but it may be for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product for free to try from Nouveau Organica and as always my review is complete honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li>experience with the moisturizer is most positive.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and gentle.</li>
            <li>I switched from pure Argan oil to this product and this moisturizer feels way better on my skin (doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy and does not break me out).  </li>
            <li>This is best for people with normal to very dry skin.</li>
            <li>For being all organic and natural, this is an amazing price.</li>
            <li>and although I’m all for the natural and vegan stuff, this was not something that I completely liked.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>Sure, it is no miracle worker, but it is a natural, effective product that really hydrates well.</li>
            <li>(I am not a big fan of the scent) and I received it in liquid form so a good amount spilled out when I opened it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend keeping it in the fridge, just because I like the feeling of a cool product in the morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m big on organic and vegan products most vegan products are good for the ones who live kosher.</li>
            <li>Oh, one worthy note</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly leaving my skin so hydrated and moisture.</li>
            <li>I try so many face products, most much more expensive, and this is truly one of the best face products I have purchased in a long time.</li>
            <li>This is an okay balm for the skin on your hands, which is generally more tolerant, but if your facial skin is more sensitive (as mine is), then I wouldn&#x27;t use it on your face.  </li>
            <li>and it’s one of my new favorite products out there.</li>
            <li>I’m very picky with what I use in my face because I easily breakout.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not too strong too much of perfume scent etc.</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve have also been using this moisturizer on my hair, and it makes my hair super soft and shiny :) .</li>
            <li>I have been using it every day as a facial moisturizer and it feels amazing on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is well worth 3x the price.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s organic it won&#x27;t stay fresh after a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no artificial ingredient of any sort.</li>
            <li>and this is my latest fave by far.</li>
            <li>in all it is so worth the money</li>
            <li>As the owner of a popular health website I am constantly looking for truly heathy products.</li>
            <li>and so far I love it.  </li>
            <li>This is as organic and natural as I&#x27;m going to get now :)</li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>I received this moisturizer complimentary for review purposes.</li>
            <li>But, keep in mind most organic and all natural products do.</li>
            <li>Due to the entire moisturizing ingredients in this jar, this is the best cream as a lip balm so lick those lips all you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The amount I use is to the right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also seen a positive change on the appearance of my skin!</li>
            <li>anyone who wants to take care of their skin and still be able to live in an organic and vegan lifestyle this product is for you</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time this morning and as soon as I touched it I could tell how fresh the product was.</li>
            <li>The smell of the product was very mellow and mild and did not bother me</li>
            <li>definitely gonna recommend this ,very affordable yet incredible ,its worth in every single penny.</li>
            <li>In the mean time, I will be enjoying and loving this moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li>In the mean time, I will be enjoying and loving this moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li>It has been working great for me, my skin feels very moisturized and the dry patches are now gone, when it arrived it was completely melted because of the Arizona heat</li>
            <li>so I can apply it on easier and then add more if needed since it&#x27;s always better to put on too little than too much.</li>
            <li>Best moisturizer I have tried, and you only need a very little.</li>
            <li>At first it feels oily</li>
            <li>When I received the product, it was hot as *</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I am very happy with the amount of moisture I get from this product</li>
            <li>Two thumbs up for this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I am astonished at how even my skin tone is now and how well this product provides consistent moisture.  </li>
            <li>This facial moisturizer is just fabulous!</li>
            <li>&amp; it goes well under makeup very well!</li>
            <li>first thing I want to note about this product is the texture.</li>
            <li>Initially I bought this for my face, but I&#x27;ve discovered that I love to use it on my feet before I go to bed at night, and on the rest of my body where I might have drier skin.  </li>
            <li>More recently, I have simplified and streamlined my skin care routine, and I appreciate multi-tasking products.</li>
            <li>: I was a bit worried that the moisturizer would be on the heavier side because Shea Butter is the first ingredient.</li>
            <li>: I was a bit worried that the moisturizer would be on the heavier side because Shea Butter is the first ingredient.</li>
            <li>And it worked really well for that too!</li>
            <li>I also tried just straight coconut oil---that did not work!</li>
            <li>The first thing, I cannot use it all over my face..</li>
            <li>It was a bit of a leap of faith to purchase this right out of the gate - but she seemed to really know her stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy and smooth and makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li>I really really recommend this product, especially to those with problematic skin :).</li>
            <li>the first use, my skin was super hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t affect my makeup which is a positive.</li>
            <li>moisturizer aids in accelerating tissue regeneration and new cell growth, nourish connective tissue, increased collagen production, to helping reduce photo damage, soften fine lines, fight free-radicals, strong anti-microbial properties to help acne breakouts, and eliminate rough skin.</li>
            <li>The first time that I used the product, it kind of tingled on my face a little bit and threw me off.</li>
            <li>I also use it on the dry patches that I sometimes get on my face (nose and jaw area, mostly) and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a need for it on my face but my dry hands love the stuff.</li>
            <li>The texture is very, very high quality.</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderfully gentle and pure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent upwards of $200 on a single moisturizing cream, so I&#x27;m always looking for the next best thing!</li>
            <li>I try to use only organic and all natural products so when I found this I was pretty excited!</li>
            <li>I get that it&#x27;s fragrance-free because this is ideal for sensitive skin, but the smell of the product itself is a little off putting to me personally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked and highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It has really helped with the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I don’t really like it</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s so much of it</li>
            <li>and so it moisturizes very well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>, I was not expecting it to be really greasy.</li>
            <li>The Nouveau Organica is organic and vegan which really made me want to try it.</li>
            <li>It soaks in fast and does&#x27;t melt off in the sun.</li>
            <li>I have very problematic skin ( sensitivity , allergies)</li>
            <li>It really hydrates my skin, without making my skin feel oily.</li>
            <li>my face is smooth and I think younger looking.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it.  </li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy feel which is nice as well.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have an off-putting smell like many other organic beauty products do.</li>
            <li>particular blend of butters, oils, and essentials oils is very healing and nourishing.</li>
            <li>, the dry spots are easily relieved maybe because of the oilier consistency of this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>But I highly recommend this for anybody looking for a gentle way to keep their face</li>

            <li>For how many days so far, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin unlike other moisturizers that claim to be gentle but are not.</li>
            <li>My skin is less inflamed, brighter and has a healthy glow to it.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it on my face</li>
            <li>would recommend Nouveau/Organica 100% Organic Ultra Hydrating Facial Moisturizer because of one of the cleanest ingredients lists that is available in the natural beauty department.</li>

            <li>For people like me who have very sensitive and indecisive skin - this product is for you!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>, I tend to try it a little longer, just to make sure.</li>
            <li>and you need to apply so little that I end up using it on more than just my face.</li>
            <li>I really use it at night because I wake up with soft, moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting the added Vitamins A, C, E, K, F, flavonoids, polysaccharides, antioxidants and fatty acids for phenomenal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>The dark color is important to preserve the qualities of the oil and extend the shelf life, though I wish the jar was made from glass or stainless steel since plastic can leach toxins into the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>For the first time in ages my cuticles were not dry and cracked by the time I had to drive home!</li>
            <li>Im doing a review on this item and did receive it free to review other than that</li>
            <li>(and I live in Georgia</li>
            <li>so I put it in the freezer for about 20 minutes and it was like new.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hard to find effective moisturizing products that don&#x27;t contain alcohol or parabans, so when I saw this was 100% natural, I had to try it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have combination skin with super dry patches on my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li>I think if this company also made a lightly fragranced moisturizer I would definitely purchase that regularly.</li>
            <li>When you first remove a bit from the container, it seems grainy but when you massage it onto the skin, it melts instantly.</li>
            <li>I use this as a facial (including neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;) moisturizer, cuticle conditioner, and hair</li>
            <li>I was actually hesitant to use this at first on my skin because I already have an oily skin type</li>
            <li>Not only did it hydrate my skin and give me a glow all day long, but the fact that it&#x27;s organic and vegan is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li>The scent is light -- I detect slight shea butter, Frankincense and sage.</li>
            <li>I opened mine gently upon receipt and it still dumped all over my pants because it was melted and is especially watery (especially after sitting in the hot UPS truck all day).  </li>
            <li>You get a decent amount in this container and it really will go a long way..</li>
            <li>The product is a little oily, however it makes your skin feel so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>The moisturizing oils are most commonly found in natural skin moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>so you know what I’m saying) and the product was COMPLETELY melted which is understandable and something that I am used to.</li>
            <li>After one use my skin toned evened out completely.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have entirely sensitive skin, but it can get irritated from some moisturizers.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try this out because all of the ingredients are truly natural and organic, and I figured my face deserved some TLC.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed others talking about how it makes their face greasy and it only does IF you use too much.</li>
            <li>My only real issue is the smell.</li>
            <li>I like this product for two reasons, it keeps my face moisturized and feeling soft however</li>
            <li>is for people that like organic and natural products.</li>
            <li>Hundred percent natural product.  </li>
            <li>Hundred percent natural product.</li>
            <li>I went from ashy to classy immediately.</li>
            <li>I tried lush and it worked</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin baby soft and so far has not made me break out.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is a thick balm, sort of like Vaseline, but 100% natural and healthy for your skin.</li>
            <li>I love the way it rubs on, the ingredients list, and subtle or natural scent.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin, so oily in my t-zone but patches on my chin and parts of my cheeks get SUPER dry, flaky, and need deep moisture.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews, but upon opening it for the first time, half of it (liquid) spilled out all over my shirt.  </li>
            <li>So there were all these little bubbles that had become solid, I still used it though and it worked fine</li>
            <li>I use a retinol moisturizer twice a day normally to help with acne, but it had been drying my face recently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the prowl for a new facial moisturizer for quite some time</li>
            <li>and I are going to be fighting over this stuff this winter when dry skin really kicks in.  </li>
            <li>While I use this predominantly as a night cream, I have used it during the day, and it is an excellent base for my sticky, physical sunscreen.</li>
            <li>No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li>No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li>No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li>These oils have been used for people for a long time and compliment each other in this blend to absorb quickly and hydrate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:</li>
            <li>It is so clear that this is made with such attention to every ingredient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping my pants are not stained and that I did not loose too much of the product as I immediately closed the lid and put it in the refrigerator to set.  </li>
            <li>Nouveau/Organics 100% USDA Organic Facial Moisturizer contains natural oils, plant extracts, and essential oils.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and had some dry patches on my cheeks that I wanted to treat, I decided to give this a try since it is organic and made with ingredients that would not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Before I even received this moisturizer, Teri, from the company, emailed me to let me know that since the moisturizer is organic and it is summer, sometimes it will get hot and melt a little in transit to me.</li>
            <li>I love that it is an all natural and vegan moisturizer, as it works well for my crazy sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I probably only lost barely a quarter of product.  </li>
            <li>I only need to use a little bit for my face or super dry spots like elbows and knees.</li>
            <li>I suffer from dry skin at the natural ingredients in this product</li>
            <li>, one of my daughters gets these little bumps on her arms during certain times of the year (keratosis pilaris (sp?))</li>
            <li>I use a small spatula to gather a very small amount, warm it in my hands, and then press it into my skin.</li>
            <li>but if I have taken out a little too much I will apply the extra on the back of my hands and my nails.  </li>
            <li>It does feel a little greasy as first, but that doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>I had recently switched from my previous skin care back to a much more expensive line after noticing changes in my skin (mainly dryness).  </li>

            <li> I mostly smell the Shea Butter, which is the first ingredient.</li>
            <li> This product was not for me but it may be for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product for free to try from Nouveau Organica and as always my review is complete honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li> experience with the moisturizer is most positive.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and gentle.</li>
            <li> I switched from pure Argan oil to this product and this moisturizer feels way better on my skin (doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy and does not break me out).  </li>
            <li> This is best for people with normal to very dry skin.</li>
            <li> For being all organic and natural, this is an amazing price.</li>
            <li> and although I’m all for the natural and vegan stuff, this was not something that I completely liked.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> Sure, it is no miracle worker, but it is a natural, effective product that really hydrates well.</li>
            <li> (I am not a big fan of the scent) and I received it in liquid form so a good amount spilled out when I opened it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend keeping it in the fridge, just because I like the feeling of a cool product in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m big on organic and vegan products most vegan products are good for the ones who live kosher.</li>
            <li> Oh, one worthy note</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly leaving my skin so hydrated and moisture.</li>
            <li> I try so many face products, most much more expensive, and this is truly one of the best face products I have purchased in a long time.</li>
            <li> This is an okay balm for the skin on your hands, which is generally more tolerant, but if your facial skin is more sensitive (as mine is), then I wouldn&#x27;t use it on your face.  </li>
            <li> and it’s one of my new favorite products out there.</li>
            <li> I’m very picky with what I use in my face because I easily breakout.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too strong too much of perfume scent etc.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have also been using this moisturizer on my hair, and it makes my hair super soft and shiny :) .</li>
            <li> I have been using it every day as a facial moisturizer and it feels amazing on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is well worth 3x the price.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s organic it won&#x27;t stay fresh after a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no artificial ingredient of any sort.</li>
            <li> and this is my latest fave by far.</li>
            <li> in all it is so worth the money</li>
            <li> As the owner of a popular health website I am constantly looking for truly heathy products.</li>
            <li> and so far I love it.  </li>
            <li> This is as organic and natural as I&#x27;m going to get now :)</li>
            <li> So far I love it.</li>
            <li> I received this moisturizer complimentary for review purposes.</li>
            <li> But, keep in mind most organic and all natural products do.</li>
            <li> Due to the entire moisturizing ingredients in this jar, this is the best cream as a lip balm so lick those lips all you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The amount I use is to the right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also seen a positive change on the appearance of my skin!</li>
            <li> anyone who wants to take care of their skin and still be able to live in an organic and vegan lifestyle this product is for you</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time this morning and as soon as I touched it I could tell how fresh the product was.</li>
            <li> The smell of the product was very mellow and mild and did not bother me</li>
            <li> definitely gonna recommend this ,very affordable yet incredible ,its worth in every single penny.</li>
            <li> In the mean time, I will be enjoying and loving this moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li> In the mean time, I will be enjoying and loving this moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li> It has been working great for me, my skin feels very moisturized and the dry patches are now gone, when it arrived it was completely melted because of the Arizona heat</li>
            <li> so I can apply it on easier and then add more if needed since it&#x27;s always better to put on too little than too much.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I have tried, and you only need a very little.</li>
            <li> At first it feels oily</li>
            <li> When I received the product, it was hot as *</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am very happy with the amount of moisture I get from this product</li>
            <li> Two thumbs up for this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I am astonished at how even my skin tone is now and how well this product provides consistent moisture.  </li>
            <li> This facial moisturizer is just fabulous!</li>
            <li> &amp; it goes well under makeup very well!</li>
            <li> first thing I want to note about this product is the texture.</li>
            <li> Initially I bought this for my face, but I&#x27;ve discovered that I love to use it on my feet before I go to bed at night, and on the rest of my body where I might have drier skin.  </li>
            <li> More recently, I have simplified and streamlined my skin care routine, and I appreciate multi-tasking products.</li>
            <li> : I was a bit worried that the moisturizer would be on the heavier side because Shea Butter is the first ingredient.</li>
            <li> : I was a bit worried that the moisturizer would be on the heavier side because Shea Butter is the first ingredient.</li>
            <li> And it worked really well for that too!</li>
            <li> I also tried just straight coconut oil---that did not work!</li>
            <li> The first thing, I cannot use it all over my face..</li>
            <li> It was a bit of a leap of faith to purchase this right out of the gate - but she seemed to really know her stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy and smooth and makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li> I really really recommend this product, especially to those with problematic skin :).</li>
            <li> the first use, my skin was super hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t affect my makeup which is a positive.</li>
            <li> moisturizer aids in accelerating tissue regeneration and new cell growth, nourish connective tissue, increased collagen production, to helping reduce photo damage, soften fine lines, fight free-radicals, strong anti-microbial properties to help acne breakouts, and eliminate rough skin.</li>
            <li> The first time that I used the product, it kind of tingled on my face a little bit and threw me off.</li>
            <li> I also use it on the dry patches that I sometimes get on my face (nose and jaw area, mostly) and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a need for it on my face but my dry hands love the stuff.</li>
            <li> The texture is very, very high quality.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderfully gentle and pure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent upwards of $200 on a single moisturizing cream, so I&#x27;m always looking for the next best thing!</li>
            <li> I try to use only organic and all natural products so when I found this I was pretty excited!</li>
            <li> I get that it&#x27;s fragrance-free because this is ideal for sensitive skin, but the smell of the product itself is a little off putting to me personally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked and highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It has really helped with the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I don’t really like it</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s so much of it</li>
            <li> and so it moisturizes very well.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> , I was not expecting it to be really greasy.</li>
            <li> The Nouveau Organica is organic and vegan which really made me want to try it.</li>
            <li> It soaks in fast and does&#x27;t melt off in the sun.</li>
            <li> I have very problematic skin ( sensitivity , allergies)</li>
            <li> It really hydrates my skin, without making my skin feel oily.</li>
            <li> my face is smooth and I think younger looking.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it.  </li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy feel which is nice as well.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have an off-putting smell like many other organic beauty products do.</li>
            <li> particular blend of butters, oils, and essentials oils is very healing and nourishing.</li>
            <li> , the dry spots are easily relieved maybe because of the oilier consistency of this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> But I highly recommend this for anybody looking for a gentle way to keep their face</li>
            <li> However, the Shea Butter mixed with the other ingredients and essential oils creates a great balance of ultra hydration.</li>
            <li> However, the Shea Butter mixed with the other ingredients and essential oils creates a great balance of ultra hydration.</li>
            <li> For how many days so far, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin unlike other moisturizers that claim to be gentle but are not.</li>
            <li> My skin is less inflamed, brighter and has a healthy glow to it.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it on my face</li>
            <li> would recommend Nouveau/Organica 100% Organic Ultra Hydrating Facial Moisturizer because of one of the cleanest ingredients lists that is available in the natural beauty department.</li>
            <li> would recommend Nouveau/Organica 100% Organic Ultra Hydrating Facial Moisturizer because of one of the cleanest ingredients lists that is available in the natural beauty department.</li>
            <li> For people like me who have very sensitive and indecisive skin - this product is for you!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> , I tend to try it a little longer, just to make sure.</li>
            <li> and you need to apply so little that I end up using it on more than just my face.</li>
            <li> I really use it at night because I wake up with soft, moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting the added Vitamins A, C, E, K, F, flavonoids, polysaccharides, antioxidants and fatty acids for phenomenal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> The dark color is important to preserve the qualities of the oil and extend the shelf life, though I wish the jar was made from glass or stainless steel since plastic can leach toxins into the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> For the first time in ages my cuticles were not dry and cracked by the time I had to drive home!</li>
            <li> Im doing a review on this item and did receive it free to review other than that</li>
            <li> (and I live in Georgia</li>
            <li> so I put it in the freezer for about 20 minutes and it was like new.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find effective moisturizing products that don&#x27;t contain alcohol or parabans, so when I saw this was 100% natural, I had to try it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with super dry patches on my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li> I think if this company also made a lightly fragranced moisturizer I would definitely purchase that regularly.</li>
            <li> When you first remove a bit from the container, it seems grainy but when you massage it onto the skin, it melts instantly.</li>
            <li> I use this as a facial (including neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;) moisturizer, cuticle conditioner, and hair</li>
            <li> I was actually hesitant to use this at first on my skin because I already have an oily skin type</li>
            <li> Not only did it hydrate my skin and give me a glow all day long, but the fact that it&#x27;s organic and vegan is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li> The scent is light -- I detect slight shea butter, Frankincense and sage.</li>
            <li> I opened mine gently upon receipt and it still dumped all over my pants because it was melted and is especially watery (especially after sitting in the hot UPS truck all day).  </li>
            <li> You get a decent amount in this container and it really will go a long way..</li>
            <li> The product is a little oily, however it makes your skin feel so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> The moisturizing oils are most commonly found in natural skin moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> so you know what I’m saying) and the product was COMPLETELY melted which is understandable and something that I am used to.</li>
            <li> After one use my skin toned evened out completely.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have entirely sensitive skin, but it can get irritated from some moisturizers.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try this out because all of the ingredients are truly natural and organic, and I figured my face deserved some TLC.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed others talking about how it makes their face greasy and it only does IF you use too much.</li>
            <li> My only real issue is the smell.</li>
            <li> I like this product for two reasons, it keeps my face moisturized and feeling soft however</li>
            <li> is for people that like organic and natural products.</li>
            <li> Hundred percent natural product.  </li>
            <li> Hundred percent natural product.</li>
            <li> I went from ashy to classy immediately.</li>
            <li> I tried lush and it worked</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin baby soft and so far has not made me break out.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It is a thick balm, sort of like Vaseline, but 100% natural and healthy for your skin.</li>
            <li> I love the way it rubs on, the ingredients list, and subtle or natural scent.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin, so oily in my t-zone but patches on my chin and parts of my cheeks get SUPER dry, flaky, and need deep moisture.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews, but upon opening it for the first time, half of it (liquid) spilled out all over my shirt.  </li>
            <li> So there were all these little bubbles that had become solid, I still used it though and it worked fine</li>
            <li> I use a retinol moisturizer twice a day normally to help with acne, but it had been drying my face recently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the prowl for a new facial moisturizer for quite some time</li>
            <li> and I are going to be fighting over this stuff this winter when dry skin really kicks in.  </li>
            <li> While I use this predominantly as a night cream, I have used it during the day, and it is an excellent base for my sticky, physical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li> No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li> No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li> These oils have been used for people for a long time and compliment each other in this blend to absorb quickly and hydrate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:</li>
            <li> It is so clear that this is made with such attention to every ingredient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping my pants are not stained and that I did not loose too much of the product as I immediately closed the lid and put it in the refrigerator to set.  </li>
            <li> Nouveau/Organics 100% USDA Organic Facial Moisturizer contains natural oils, plant extracts, and essential oils.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and had some dry patches on my cheeks that I wanted to treat, I decided to give this a try since it is organic and made with ingredients that would not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Before I even received this moisturizer, Teri, from the company, emailed me to let me know that since the moisturizer is organic and it is summer, sometimes it will get hot and melt a little in transit to me.</li>
            <li> I love that it is an all natural and vegan moisturizer, as it works well for my crazy sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I probably only lost barely a quarter of product.  </li>
            <li> I only need to use a little bit for my face or super dry spots like elbows and knees.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry skin at the natural ingredients in this product</li>
            <li> , one of my daughters gets these little bumps on her arms during certain times of the year (keratosis pilaris (sp?))</li>
            <li> I use a small spatula to gather a very small amount, warm it in my hands, and then press it into my skin.</li>
            <li> but if I have taken out a little too much I will apply the extra on the back of my hands and my nails.  </li>
            <li> It does feel a little greasy as first, but that doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> I had recently switched from my previous skin care back to a much more expensive line after noticing changes in my skin (mainly dryness).  </li>
            <li> At first it seemed pricey but this jar should last a long time because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Note: I am in my late 40s, and my skin is relatively normal -- no excessive oiliness or dryness.</li>
            <li> It was completely liquified when I got it due to the heat.</li>
            <li> I only need a small amount because it is a bit oily but absorbs very well.</li>
            <li> But this is not too big of a deal since the scent does not linger for too long, and</li>
            <li> You hardly need anything as it covers so much with a tiny dot of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Extremely hydrating and does the job that no other moisturizer has done.</li>
            <li> Recently, I have been using it a lot on my hands because it has been severely dry and there aren&#x27;t a lot of products that works for me with regards to this issue.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry skin and always am looking for different oils or moisturizers to put on my skin.</li>
            <li> It has a yellowish color in the solid state and turns into a clear, oily liquid once I let it stand for a few seconds on my fingers.</li>
            <li> A single tub should last at least 6 months with daily use, so it is very cost-effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Growing up with severe eczema and skin sensitivity, it was always difficult for me to find products that did not cause further irritation and one that I can actually stick to for more than a few months.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for an interesting, organic facial moisturizer without any weird ingredients, I&#x27;d say give this a try!</li>
            <li> In fact, often after I apply moisturizer it leaves my skin a little bit red for a few minutes, but with Nouveau/Organica I don&#x27;t have any irritation whatsoever - I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Nourishing, lasting and all-natural (total bonus), I can use it on my face, elbows and any other dry areas.</li>
            <li> Once upon a time, I was a product junkie, but over the past several years, I transitioned to organic, cruelty-free, natural skin care products and cosmetics.</li>
            <li> BUT when the products finally got a little solid, it started oxidizing.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a night cream because it would be a little too greasy for the day, especially if your looking to put on makeup afterwards.</li>
            <li> So only using such a small amount this will last me forever.</li>
            <li> but I can already notice an improvement in my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and nothing</li>
            <li> but I tried it on dry spots on my skin like my chin and the sides of my nose.</li>
            <li> I have also been using this moisturizer on dry elbows and dry</li>
            <li> I have also been using this moisturizer on dry elbows and dry</li>
            <li> have helped to balance my skin in all of its oily dry madness.</li>
            <li> it is not greasy and helps moisturize my face and its no longer so dry.</li>
            <li> Plus my cuticles where really dry one day</li>
            <li> So if you have really dry skin, USE IT..</li>
            <li> I decided to try this face cream because even with the most expensive brands, I find harsh chemicals running rampant.</li>
            <li> I got this earlier today, it came melted (as is common for natural or organic creams)</li>
            <li> facial moisturizer comes in a dark plastic container.</li>
            <li> I literally tap my finger into the jar and that is all I need for my entire face because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> : A little of the facial moisturizer goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is not a typical moisturizer and you only need a very small amount.</li>
            <li> I am glad to finally find a moisturizer made with RAW, FOOD-GRADE, UNREFINED, COLD PRESSED ingredients.</li>
            <li> Even when essential oils are used, I still prefer less</li>
            <li> Even when essential oils are used, I still prefer less</li>
            <li> and I get very dry on the cheek area.</li>
            <li> I had my mom, who has very dry skin, use it as well, and she loves it for her skin</li>
            <li> Big oily mess.  </li>
            <li> It keeps the dry parts of my face moisturized but it doesn&#x27;t mix with the oily parts and make it greasy like some other products do.</li>
            <li> But If you start noticing a rash, little red bumps that could be zits but not really...</li>
            <li> Using this moisturizer on a daily basis will last me at least 6 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although this product was moisturizing (as it should be), I did not really like this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY appreciate Nouveau Organica for sending me this product to try and I recommend this product to those of you who like really thin moisturizers that remind you of a serum or oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not ready to give an official star rating/review yet -</li>
            <li> I did see a warning from another user and was careful -</li>
            <li> but I put it in the fridge for a few minutes and it became solid.</li>
            <li> going to skin care center .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You just have to be careful when opening it after delivery because mine came in liquid form.</li>
            <li> There really is no smell,</li>
            <li> It’s been a rough time trying to find skin products that work for me</li>
            <li> The thing that I like especially is that it is all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain the numerous and questionable ingredients from other products.  </li>
            <li> The ingredient list contains ylang ylang, frankincense and some other oils.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of skincare and never got to fix the problem until now.</li>
            <li> I wish this existed when I spent 3 hours in the sun each day practicing!</li>
            <li> jar, it may seem small but a little comes a very long way so this jar would last me for months.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> but it was mighty ugly now.</li>
            <li> the calamine lotion calms down the redness and seems to protect it from the sun (probably from the zinc</li>
            <li> Not a watered down product at all.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see what other products come out in this line!</li>
            <li> And just a small amount goes a long way!</li>
            <li> What I do is take about that amount or less</li>
            <li> This leaves a slight greasy sheen on your skin; some people might not like that part.  </li>
            <li> moisturizer has a slight smell, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE bit goes a LONG way, meaning, this jar will last you for quite some time, which makes it not that expensive after all.  </li>
            <li> so I was a little worried but no itching or break-outs.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating and does not cracked your lips in the cold because when this cream solidifies it does become hard but it does not crack or dry up.</li>
            <li> I tried this products out for a total of 2 weeks to see the effects that it game to me.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are beyond and I was missing using a cream form moisturizer.</li>

            <li> Growing up with severe eczema and skin sensitivity, it was always difficult for me to find products that did not cause further irritation and one that I can actually stick to for more than a few months. When I was introduced to the NOUVEAU/ORGANICA moisturizer, I knew I hit the jackpot. Nourishing, lasting and all-natural (total bonus), I can use it on my face, elbows and any other dry areas. I&#x27;m hooked and highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a week but I can already notice an improvement in my dry skin.  At first it seemed pricey but this jar should last a long time because a little goes a long way.  I love the organic ingredients and the smell.  At first it feels oily but then it gradually soaks in.  I mainly use it on my face but if I have taken out a little too much I will apply the extra on the back of my hands and my nails.  It has really helped with the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have roscea which is hard to treat but I have found a treatment that works for me.  I apply a thin layer of NOUVEAU/ORGANICA on my face and then apply a tiny amount of calamine lotion on my trouble areas.  It works like a charm!  The NOUVEAU protects my skin from drying out and the calamine lotion calms down the redness and seems to protect it from the sun (probably from the zinc oxide).&lt;br /&gt;Right now this is my new favorite moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I tried this products out for a total of 2 weeks to see the effects that it game to me. This products is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% Organic&lt;br /&gt;Vegan&lt;br /&gt;Gluten free&lt;br /&gt;Soy free&lt;br /&gt;Dairy free&lt;br /&gt;All Natural&lt;br /&gt;I took all of these things into account when trying it and although I’m all for the natural and vegan stuff, this was not something that I completely liked. When I received the product, it was hot as **** (and I live in Georgia so you know what I’m saying) and the product was COMPLETELY melted which is understandable and something that I am used to. BUT when the products finally got a little solid, it started oxidizing. So there were all these little bubbles that had become solid, I still used it though and it worked fine but it was mighty ugly now. The texture of this moisturizer is quite thin and reminded me of an oil. The first time that I used the product, it kind of tingled on my face a little bit and threw me off. I’ve never had a face moisturizer make my face tingle. So I kept trying it. When I am trying out a product and I don’t really like it, I tend to try it a little longer, just to make sure. Although this product was moisturizing (as it should be), I did not really like this product. For a moisturizer, I prefer a creamy feel, but that’s just me. The smell of the product was very mellow and mild and did not bother me but this was not the product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY appreciate Nouveau Organica for sending me this product to try and I recommend this product to those of you who like really thin moisturizers that remind you of a serum or oil. This product was not for me but it may be for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product for free to try from Nouveau Organica and as always my review is complete honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li> I love it! It is so clear that this is made with such attention to every ingredient. I tried it for the first time this morning and as soon as I touched it I could tell how fresh the product was. The smell is wonderfully gentle and pure. So luxurious! The texture is very, very high quality. This is well worth 3x the price. I try so many face products, most much more expensive, and this is truly one of the best face products I have purchased in a long time. Thank you for this epic find and for the wonderful customer service!</li>
            <li> I love this. You hardly need anything as it covers so much with a tiny dot of moisturizer. Keeps my skin looking and feeling healthy. The best part is there are zero chemicals and zero alcohol in this moistirizer. Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> For people like me who have very sensitive and indecisive skin - this product is for you! I love how well this product works on my skin - not just for my face but for my body as well. Recently, I have been using it a lot on my hands because it has been severely dry and there aren&#x27;t a lot of products that works for me with regards to this issue. I have tried an ultra hydrating hand cream before that left water nodules on my fingers. Needless to say, I am very happy with the amount of moisture I get from this product and I am very happy that it is helping make my hands look sane! I also use it on the dry patches that I sometimes get on my face (nose and jaw area, mostly) and it works very well. I love that it is an all natural and vegan moisturizer, as it works well for my crazy sensitive skin. Two thumbs up for this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try.

            <li> Updated:  This is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  I had recently switched from my previous skin care back to a much more expensive line after noticing changes in my skin (mainly dryness).  However, that wasn&#x27;t even helping me as it used to years ago.  Through a series of events I ended up finding Teri&#x27;s youtube channel and with that, found her moisturizer.  It was a bit of a leap of faith to purchase this right out of the gate - but she seemed to really know her stuff.  And she does!  After one use my skin toned evened out completely.  I had gotten so used to my rosy cheeks and splotchy forehead that I didn&#x27;t even realize how bad it really was.  I am astonished at how even my skin tone is now and how well this product provides consistent moisture.  Everything washed out of my pants with no problem and I probably only lost barely a quarter of product.  After leaving it in the fridge for a while, it was fine and I haven&#x27;t had an issue with it since.    I&#x27;m a customer for life!  Original Message:  I&#x27;m not ready to give an official star rating/review yet - but I wanted to warn anyone who has ordered this product with all of the warm weather.  I opened mine gently upon receipt and it still dumped all over my pants because it was melted and is especially watery (especially after sitting in the hot UPS truck all day).  I&#x27;m hoping my pants are not stained and that I did not loose too much of the product as I immediately closed the lid and put it in the refrigerator to set.  I did see a warning from another user and was careful - but it did not matter.  I would not even open upon receipt - but put in the fridge for a while to allow to set before opening.  There is no protective seal...you open the jar and that is that.  Once I&#x27;m able to use I will amend a more detailed review - just wanted to give everyone fair warning!</li>
            <li> The jar is pretty small but the moisturizer will last quite some time. Since it&#x27;s organic it won&#x27;t stay fresh after a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this moisturizer is dominated by coconut oil and shea butter. There is no artificial ingredient of any sort. It is 100% food grade and organic. The ingredient list contains ylang ylang, frankincense and some other oils. However I do not smell any of these oil on the list. The moisturizer just smell like shea butter and some coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer seems to have three different form; liquid, semi-solid and solid. You want to keep this moisturizer in semi-solid state. So try to keep it out of hot/humid places. You do not need refrigerator but you can leave it in the frig for 20 minutes for it to solidify a little.&lt;br /&gt;My experience with the moisturizer is most positive. No irritation, no overwhelming stench. Very smooth and gentle. Extremely hydrating and does the job that no other moisturizer has done. I am confident to say that this is my favorite moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use this cream as a lip balm. Very hydrating and does not cracked your lips in the cold because when this cream solidifies it does become hard but it does not crack or dry up. Due to the entire moisturizing ingredients in this jar, this is the best cream as a lip balm so lick those lips all you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a discount for the cream. All of my feedback and review are 100% honest and my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past week. A little of this goes a very long way. I&#x27;ve tried it at night and also during the day under makeup (I always use makeup). It didn&#x27;t affect my makeup which is a positive. The ingredients are beyond and I was missing using a cream form moisturizer. Loving it!</li>
            <li> great product...feels a bit greasy at first, but it doesnt last and makes a nice moisturizer.  It&#x27;s important for me to use natural products and i am happy that this works for me.</li>
            <li> I am glad to finally find a moisturizer made with RAW, FOOD-GRADE, UNREFINED, COLD PRESSED ingredients. I was not expecting the added Vitamins A, C, E, K, F, flavonoids, polysaccharides, antioxidants and fatty acids for phenomenal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer aids in accelerating tissue regeneration and new cell growth, nourish connective tissue, increased collagen production, to helping reduce photo damage, soften fine lines, fight free-radicals, strong anti-microbial properties to help acne breakouts, and eliminate rough skin. I use it all over including face, neck, d&amp;eacute;colletage, cuticles, elbows, heels, knees and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had great results from this moisturizer, it absorbs quickly and is non greasy. I love the way that it smells, which influences me to use it more often like I should.</li>
            <li> This facial moisturizer is just fabulous! I try to use only organic and all natural products so when I found this I was pretty excited! It feels very nice on the skin, not greasy at all!!! &amp; it goes well under makeup very well! It has replaced my primer!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and I get very dry on the cheek area. I have tried other brands of skincare and never got to fix the problem until now. The cream has an interesting consistency , it is like a cream and becomes an oil when you apply it It gets absorbs to the skin very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling at all . I am very impressed that I see my skin improvement in days. I am already recommending this product to my friends and family. Thank you Teri for bring us an excellent product at a good price</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with super dry patches on my cheeks and chin. I don&#x27;t have entirely sensitive skin, but it can get irritated from some moisturizers. So I decided to try this out because all of the ingredients are truly natural and organic, and I figured my face deserved some TLC. I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised at how great this works. It keeps the dry parts of my face moisturized but it doesn&#x27;t mix with the oily parts and make it greasy like some other products do. I&#x27;ve noticed others talking about how it makes their face greasy and it only does IF you use too much. The directions on the bottle say to take a pea size into your palms and rub it on your face and neck. What I do is take about that amount or less but I put the moisturizer on my index and middle fingers and rub my fingers together so I can apply it on easier and then add more if needed since it&#x27;s always better to put on too little than too much. My only real issue is the smell. I get that it&#x27;s fragrance-free because this is ideal for sensitive skin, but the smell of the product itself is a little off putting to me personally. I think if this company also made a lightly fragranced moisturizer I would definitely purchase that regularly. But I highly recommend this for anybody looking for a gentle way to keep their face moisturized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product for my honest unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> This is an okay balm for the skin on your hands, which is generally more tolerant, but if your facial skin is more sensitive (as mine is), then I wouldn&#x27;t use it on your face.  It contains Clary Sage, Ylang Ylang, Frankincense and Geranium oils, all of which are known skin irritants that can cause contact dermatitis.  Not everyone has a problem with these ingredients, so you might tolerate them just fine.  But If you start noticing a rash, little red bumps that could be zits but not really... one or more of those four ingredients is probably why.  *The manufacturer gave me a sample for evaluation so that I could give you this honest review.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of money to keep my skin looking good. I&#x27;m one of those people who is always in Sephora or browsing online for skincare products. I&#x27;ve spent upwards of $200 on a single moisturizing cream, so I&#x27;m always looking for the next best thing! I decided to try this face cream because even with the most expensive brands, I find harsh chemicals running rampant. It&#x27;s really hard to find effective moisturizing products that don&#x27;t contain alcohol or parabans, so when I saw this was 100% natural, I had to try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I want to note about this product is the texture. It is not a cream. It is a thick balm, sort of like Vaseline, but 100% natural and healthy for your skin. To use it, take a pea-sized amount into your hands, rub hands together, and apply on your skin. This took me some getting use to.  I do have oily skin, so I found a pea-sized amount to be excessive. If you like me, have oily skin, try use about 1/2 that amount. It should feel much better. Instead of feeling greasy, your face should feel amazing and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first use, my skin was super hydrated and soft. I could actually see it plumping my skin and filling in wrinkles a bit. Sure, it is no miracle worker, but it is a natural, effective product that really hydrates well. It contains lots of good for you ingredients like argan oil (which I LOVE).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an interesting, organic facial moisturizer without any weird ingredients, I&#x27;d say give this a try! A single tub should last at least 6 months with daily use, so it is very cost-effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--This genuine product feedback is intended to aid fellow consumers towards informed choice in product selection. A sample had been provided for the purpose of this independent review.--</li>
            <li> I immediately stopped using toner after this arrived in the mail. It seems oily to the touch but it does not make your skin appear so at all. Such an incredible product... there&#x27;s so much of it and you need to apply so little that I end up using it on more than just my face. Looking forward to whatever else this amazing brand will be offering soon! Thank you for creating healthy, cruelty-free, sustainable products that don&#x27;t skimp on quality &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It has been 2 weeks since I started using this cream and I must say, it is a wonderful food for my skin: I normally use as a mask and wipe off the excess before retiring for night. Thank you Teri for creating this wonder.</li>
            <li> This is now one of my favorite moisturizers.  Reading the ingredient&#x27;s label, it is truly an all-natural product.  This is best for people with normal to very dry skin. Initially I bought this for my face, but I&#x27;ve discovered that I love to use it on my feet before I go to bed at night, and on the rest of my body where I might have drier skin.  This leaves a slight greasy sheen on your skin; some people might not like that part.  But if you truly want to moisturize your skin without chemicals, this is the stuff to do it with.  A LITTLE bit goes a LONG way, meaning, this jar will last you for quite some time, which makes it not that expensive after all.  I have a feeling my family and I are going to be fighting over this stuff this winter when dry skin really kicks in.  Oh, one worthy note, one of my daughters gets these little bumps on her arms during certain times of the year (keratosis pilaris (sp?)) and nothing has gotten rid of them.  She exfoliates her upper arms, then applies this before going to bed.  UNbelievable, the bumps almost always disappear after a few uses of this stuff.  Can&#x27;t answer why this is so, but it makes her happy.</li>
            <li> The product is like a serum and so it moisturizes very well.  I have only used the product about a month but it definitely hydrates well.  The thing that I like especially is that it is all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain the numerous and questionable ingredients from other products.  I ordered my second jar.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this product!  I have been using it every day as a facial moisturizer and it feels amazing on my skin.  I literally tap my finger into the jar and that is all I need for my entire face because a little goes a long way.  I switched from pure Argan oil to this product and this moisturizer feels way better on my skin (doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy and does not break me out).  The price point is absolutely incredible for the amount of organic ingredients and product in this jar!  The Argan oil that I was using prior, was around $15 per ounce!  I am officially hooked!  I will be buying this for family and friends as gifts!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is AMAZING! As a tennis player in the &amp;#34;dry heat&amp;#34; of Arizona, I&#x27;ve been looking for something that keeps my skin feeling moisturized throughout the day. I wish this existed when I spent 3 hours in the sun each day practicing! Also, I just started using it on my cuticles as well, and am impressed with the initial results. For the first time in ages my cuticles were not dry and cracked by the time I had to drive home! Can&#x27;t wait to see what other products come out in this line!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has been working really wonderfully for my combination skin.  I use it day and at night, and I love that it&#x27;s made up of clean, organic ingredients.  I had my mom, who has very dry skin, use it as well, and she loves it for her skin - guess I&#x27;ll have to buy more!</li>
            <li> This product has a light and noticeably smooth consistency. I have applied it as a morning moisturizer, night cream, and makeup remover-- it performs great for all these uses. This is not a typical moisturizer and you only need a very small amount. When you first remove a bit from the container, it seems grainy but when you massage it onto the skin, it melts instantly. Although I think this is a great versatile product, the two downsides for me was that the scent of shea butter was pretty evident (I am not a big fan of the scent) and I received it in liquid form so a good amount spilled out when I opened it. But this is not too big of a deal since the scent does not linger for too long, and refrigerating the cream made it turn back to a solid form.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I suffer from dry skin at the natural ingredients in this product gives my skin the hydration it craves. And just a small amount goes a long way! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> * Just a Fantastic Product * Will Purchase Again *</li>
            <li> The product is a little oily, however it makes your skin feel so soft and smooth once absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a great silk and glow look.</li>
            <li> Even though this product has a balm consistency, (which I was afraid of because all the oils) I&#x27;ve been loving it. It absorbs quickly leaving my skin so hydrated and moisture. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer!! I have really dry skin and nothing seems to work except this one, really happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> Once upon a time, I was a product junkie, but over the past several years, I transitioned to organic, cruelty-free, natural skin care products and cosmetics. More recently, I have simplified and streamlined my skin care routine, and I appreciate multi-tasking products. I use this as a facial (including neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;) moisturizer, cuticle conditioner, and hair balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a light balm -- an oil balm, if you will. I use a small spatula to gather a very small amount, warm it in my hands, and then press it into my skin. The scent is light -- I detect slight shea butter, Frankincense and sage. I cannot tolerate strong scents, and thankfully, this does not offend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular blend of butters, oils, and essentials oils is very healing and nourishing. My skin glows! If you want that dewy look, this is your product -- not for the matte skin lovers. Depending on what my skin needs, I either layer this over a serum, or I use it solo. While I use this predominantly as a night cream, I have used it during the day, and it is an excellent base for my sticky, physical sunscreen. Note: I am in my late 40s, and my skin is relatively normal -- no excessive oiliness or dryness.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is wonderful! It is so nourishing that when I apply at night I feel my skin is hydrated even the next morning after a night&#x27;s sleep. It&#x27;s a huge relief to know there is not a trace of anything unnatural, although you would never be able to tell, as I truly think it&#x27;s as good as any fancy brand out there. In fact, often after I apply moisturizer it leaves my skin a little bit red for a few minutes, but with Nouveau/Organica I don&#x27;t have any irritation whatsoever - I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this product. Not only did it hydrate my skin and give me a glow all day long, but the fact that it&#x27;s organic and vegan is a huge bonus. I&#x27;ve been on the prowl for a new facial moisturizer for quite some time and this is my latest fave by far. Also, it works in multiple climates. I used it while traveling and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> I like this product for two reasons, it keeps my face moisturized and feeling soft however, I was not expecting it to be really greasy. This is definitely a night cream because it would be a little too greasy for the day, especially if your looking to put on makeup afterwards. I have no problem with this cream I&#x27;ll just be looking into something else after its out.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I will 100% be getting it again!&lt;br /&gt;This is for people that like organic and natural products. I got this earlier today, it came melted (as is common for natural or organic creams) so I put it in the freezer for about 20 minutes and it was like new. I would recommend keeping it in the fridge, just because I like the feeling of a cool product in the morning. it helps wake my skin and myself up.&lt;br /&gt;all in all it is so worth the money</li>
            <li> Before I even received this moisturizer, Teri, from the company, emailed me to let me know that since the moisturizer is organic and it is summer, sometimes it will get hot and melt a little in transit to me. Not to worry though! She gave me very detailed instructions on how to restore the moisturizer to its intended state:) it arrived in perfect condition though! I love this moisturizer! It&#x27;s very creamy and smooth and makes my skin feel so soft! I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy or heavy. I use a retinol moisturizer twice a day normally to help with acne, but it had been drying my face recently. I use this moisturizer once a day and the retinol one at night and my skin is almost perfect. I highly recommend this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The cream is a very thick cream that means you&#x27;re going have to use a small amount. Not a watered down product at all. It does have Ouls in it to help hydrate the skin and keep it on your skin. Hundred percent natural product.  Hundred percent natural product. With your order you get a thank you for your purchase card for a Nother free product the coupon that comes with it.  I&#x27;ve been using the lotion for a week now and I like the product.</li>
            <li> The Nouveau Organica Moisturizer is different than the moisturizer I&#x27;m using and the ones that I&#x27;ve tried because similar to the properties of cooking oil, this solidifies when refrigerated and liquefies in warmer conditions. I was actually hesitant to use this at first on my skin because I already have an oily skin type but I tried it on dry spots on my skin like my chin and the sides of my nose. The Nouveau Organica is organic and vegan which really made me want to try it. It has a yellowish color in the solid state and turns into a clear, oily liquid once I let it stand for a few seconds on my fingers. I only need a small amount because it is a bit oily but absorbs very well. It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy feel which is nice as well. I like that with a small amount, the dry spots are easily relieved maybe because of the oilier consistency of this moisturizer. It is unscented and doesn&#x27;t cause me any skin irritations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried this on my heels, elbows and knees and learned that it&#x27;s perfect to use on these drier parts since this moisturizes really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this 2 oz. jar, it may seem small but a little comes a very long way so this jar would last me for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a free product to try and review however, all opinions are unbiased, honest and my own. No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li> Nouveau/Organics 100% USDA Organic Facial Moisturizer contains natural oils, plant extracts, and essential oils. The moisturizing oils are most commonly found in natural skin moisturizers.  These oils have been used for people for a long time and compliment each other in this blend to absorb quickly and hydrate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Organic Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Organic Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Organic Argania Spinosa Kernel (Argan) Oil, Organic Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Organic Rosa Mosqueta (Rosehip) Fruit Oil, Organic Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Organic Salvia Sclarea (Clary Sage) Oil, Organic Cananga odorata (Ylang Ylang) Oil, Organic Boswellia carteri (Frankincense) Oil, Organic Pelargonium roseum asperum (Geranium) Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the 100% organic ingredient list and I love that there are no preservatives, though this means that the cream should be used within 6 months or kept refrigerated for longer shelf life. Using this moisturizer on a daily basis will last me at least 6 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients that cause some concern are Ylang Ylang Oil and Frankincense Oil. Even though they are both organic, there is some possibility of contamination during distillation and extraction. EWG rates Ylang Ylang Oil as 3 (moderate hazard) and Frankincense Oil as a 2 (low hazard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facial moisturizer comes in a dark plastic container. The dark color is important to preserve the qualities of the oil and extend the shelf life, though I wish the jar was made from glass or stainless steel since plastic can leach toxins into the moisturizer. I would like to see Nouveau/Organica move toward glass containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USAGE: A little of the facial moisturizer goes a long way. I usually take just a bit on my finger and rub it on my face. For best absorption, apply right after getting out of the shower or right after washing the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer has a slight smell, but not overpowering. I mostly smell the Shea Butter, which is the first ingredient. Even when essential oils are used, I still prefer less scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS: I was a bit worried that the moisturizer would be on the heavier side because Shea Butter is the first ingredient. I usually don&#x27;t use Shea Butter on my face because it is too &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; for my face. However, the Shea Butter mixed with the other ingredients and essential oils creates a great balance of ultra hydration. I have also been using this moisturizer on dry elbows and dry knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Nouveau/Organica 100% Organic Ultra Hydrating Facial Moisturizer because of one of the cleanest ingredients lists that is available in the natural beauty department. I would like to see the company either reduce or substitute the Ylang Ylang Oil and reduce the potential toxicity caused from contamination. I would also like to see the plastic container be switched to a glass container. In the mean time, I will be enjoying and loving this moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received the product to facilitate this review. No other compensation was received.

            <li> Best moisturizer I have tried, and you only need a very little.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used! I have combination skin and the wonderful ingredients have helped to balance my skin in all of its oily dry madness. It soaks in fast and does&#x27;t melt off in the sun. It also doesn&#x27;t have an off-putting smell like many other organic beauty products do.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and had some dry patches on my cheeks that I wanted to treat, I decided to give this a try since it is organic and made with ingredients that would not irritate my skin. It has been working great for me, my skin feels very moisturized and the dry patches are now gone, when it arrived it was completely melted because of the Arizona heat but I put it in the fridge for a few minutes and it became solid.</li>
            <li> I find this moisturizer a bit on the greasy side.  And it doesn&#x27;t have a particularly pleasant fragrance.  But I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> The safest  products to use is organic products.&lt;br /&gt;Thats why I chooses to try this Nouveau Organica moisturizers which I never disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Its truly very effective to moisturize my skin 24 hrs. and never leaves my skin shiny and oily.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely gonna recommend this ,very affordable yet incredible ,its worth in every single penny.Its gonna save you going to skin care center .&lt;br /&gt;I got this product at discounted price</li>
            <li> The consistency of the product changes dramatically depending on storage, in the fridge it is like rock hard butter, not in the fridge its like separated oil .</li>
            <li> As the owner of a popular health website I am constantly looking for truly heathy products. This goes above and beyond. This is a close as it gets to perfection if you want an all natural product with an incredible formulation. If you truly care about your incredibly fragile skin look no further. I will be recommending this to all of my readers, male and female.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m a dude and I&#x27;m proudly saying I love this product. As does my girlfriend. I don&#x27;t really have a need for it on my face but my dry hands love the stuff. I went from ashy to classy immediately. All the cruelty free/organic/ naturalness of it all is just a cherry on top.</li>
            <li> Very good product, makes your skin look and feel great</li>
            <li> Great quality, 100% organic. I did put this in the refrigerator as recommended when I received it. Makes my skin smooth and feels awesome.</li>
            <li> This facial moisturizer is impressive. I’m very picky with what I use in my face because I easily breakout. I’ve seen that this product is all organic and considering all the vitamins my skin will benefit I gave it a try. I’ve tried it for few days as soon as it arrived and surprisingly my skin loved it. For how many days so far, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin unlike other moisturizers that claim to be gentle but are not. It hydrates and moisturizes the skin without leaving a sticky feel. You just have to be careful when opening it after delivery because mine came in liquid form. Just pop it in the fridge for few hours and it will solidify. I received this as a complimentary product in exchange of my fair review. All in all, I recommend it to everyone because you can’t beat the price for the benefit your skin can get.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great. I have very problematic skin ( sensitivity , allergies) and this doesn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all. It really hydrates my skin, without making my skin feel oily. I&#x27;ve also seen a positive change on the appearance of my skin! My skin is less inflamed, brighter and has a healthy glow to it. I&#x27;ve have also been using this moisturizer on my hair, and it makes my hair super soft and shiny :) . I really really recommend this product, especially to those with problematic skin :).</li>
            <li> I got to try this product free for review but I would have bought it, and will buy it again! I love it and the fact that it&#x27;s vegan is HUGE for me!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a week and so far I love it.  It does feel a little greasy as first, but that doesn&#x27;t last long.  My skin is softer and much more hydrated.</li>
            <li> Im doing a review on this item and did receive it free to review other than that havent been compensated for anything. I Love using using this for my face it is not greasy and helps moisturize my face and its no longer so dry. I would definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> This is sooo hydrating! And chemical free!! I feel like I&#x27;m actually nourishing my skin. Plus my cuticles where really dry one day and I only had this guy on hand so I decided to try it out. And it worked really well for that too!</li>
            <li> ****UPDATE: Now 5 stars because it does work great as a day moisturizer--just use a light hand. My makeup glides on and looks all glowy on top of it.  I have combination skin, so oily in my t-zone but patches on my chin and parts of my cheeks get SUPER dry, flaky, and need deep moisture. This moisturizer is too oily for all over face in the morning, but I do like it as an eye cream under my makeup. I really use it at night because I wake up with soft, moisturized skin. It also has been helping heal my breakouts over night. There isn&#x27;t an overpowering fragrance as I can&#x27;t think of what it even smells like so that&#x27;s good! For being all organic and natural, this is an amazing price. I gave it 4 stars only because I can&#x27;t wear it during the day. Or maybe I can? I haven&#x27;t tried. I will update this review when I do wear it under makeup.  I tried lush and it worked but then after a few weeks stopped working and I believe it was causing my breakouts because when I switched to this they went away. I also tried just straight coconut oil---that did not work! Also tried diy face moisturizers and they also made me breakout! This is as organic and natural as I&#x27;m going to get now :)</li>
            <li> Great natural product! Leaves my skin baby soft and so far has not made me break out.  I love the super clean ingredients!</li>
            <li> I really like it so far. Great service and a great product! Couldn&#x27;t ask for more :)</li>
            <li> this moisture is great!  my face is smooth and I think younger looking.  since using this moisturizer i have not used any foundation or blush..it&#x27;s just not needed!  If your home gets too warm just refrigerate and it becomes thick again, however I haven&#x27; needed to do that! Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> I received this today in the mail. So far I love it. I have sensitive skin so I was a little worried but no itching or break-outs. Probably because it is 100% Organic and doesn&#x27;t have chemicals and fragrances added. It smells amazing. Citrusy and coconut? I&#x27;m not sure but it smells awesome. It was completely liquified when I got it due to the heat. I probably would have been upset if I hadn&#x27;t received an email warning me it would probably be melted. It was an easy fix though. Just stick in the fridge for a bit. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The ingredient list is amazing and the effects on the skin are just as impressive. It was smooth and smelled great. I only need to use a little bit for my face or super dry spots like elbows and knees. Will be fantastic to use in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample for review.</li>
            <li> In exchange for My HONEST review, I was offered this product for free..  I have used it for about a week.  The first thing, I cannot use it all over my face.. Its like an oil but in a solid until you rub in on your fingers..  I use it on my forehead and around my eyes, where I need it most.  I do love what it does in those areas.  This would be great for a night time treatment.  There really is no smell, so thats a good thing.. Its very easy to apply and keeps you moisturized really well.  So if you have really dry skin, USE IT.. If you have oily/dry skin just use it where you need it (thats what I do) You will see and feel an improvement in the health of your skin..  You get a decent amount in this container and it really will go a long way.. Id say it would last me 3+ months using it daily..  Thats my HONEST review and it is not bias..  I do not recommend to someone that has an oily face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m big on organic and vegan products most vegan products are good for the ones who live kosher. The nouveau/organica products is one I don&#x27;t mind the smell it&#x27;s not too strong too much of perfume scent etc. I use this product dauly. I did receive this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review. anyone who wants to take care of their skin and still be able to live in an organic and vegan lifestyle this product is for you</li>
            <li> I received this moisturizer complimentary for review purposes. This review is 100% my opinion and am I no way affiliated with this company. I suffer from dry skin and always am looking for different oils or moisturizers to put on my skin. It’s been a rough time trying to find skin products that work for me and so when I got this I had my fingers crossed that this one would work. This worked AMAZING. Pre-warning that it does have a very distinct smell to it. But, keep in mind most organic and all natural products do. It’s got a very thin consistency and is extremely moisturizing. It almost feels like coconut oil when rubbing onto face. After just a week it has helped restore my skins natural glow and helped with dry patches on my nose which is my main trouble area. This product has made my skin feel great! The best part is I don’t even have to use a lot to get big results. I only use a very tiny amount the size of my pinky finger for my face. The amount I use is to the right and so you can see the consistency of the moisturizer. So only using such a small amount this will last me forever. I’m so happy I finally found a great moisturizer that I don’t have to use a bunch of product to hydrate my skin. I will definitely repurchase after this is gone and it’s one of my new favorite products out there.</li>
            <li> So far the product is working as expected</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews, but upon opening it for the first time, half of it (liquid) spilled out all over my shirt.  Big oily mess.  Incredibly disappointing, especially considering the price.  I really wanted to like it.  Maybe I got a bad batch?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 3 days now.  I love the way it rubs on, the ingredients list, and subtle or natural scent.  It leaves my skin looking great!</li>
