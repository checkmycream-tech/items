    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>the strop is the perfect size of width and length, the quality is great for the price.</li>
            <li>experienced sharpener will know the difference and appreciate it...</li>
            <li>I thought the strop performed very nicely.</li>
            <li>Excellent workmanship and many surfaces that hold compounds nicely.  </li>
            <li>Because I think it is an exceptional value</li>
            <li>The quality is great and the from the experience I have with straight razor shaving, this will work excellent.</li>
            <li>For the money its an ok to good strop.</li>
            <li>Good quality, quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Okay.  </li>
            <li>I have ever been able to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am getting better with practice of course.</li>
            <li>Not the highest quality, but OK</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described and would be a good travel strop.</li>
            <li>I put this to the test on a Solingen razor my great grandfather brought over from the old country in 1890.</li>
            <li>The got a pretty nice edge for a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>It is cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s obviously not the quality of a $100 strop, but it&#x27;s great for a starter or as a travel one.</li>
            <li>I am particular of what kind of material that I lay one of my razors on.  </li>
            <li>The seller was fine and it came quickly</li>
            <li>Not quite excellent but not bad in the least bit.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good entry level strop especially for the money.</li>
            <li>inexpensive strop gets better and better the more it is used, becoming more supple and producing the sharpest cutting edge</li>
            <li>The strop the vendor provided was actually much higher quality than&lt;br /&gt;advertised.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the leather side is first quality, and the linen side is also very good.&lt;br /&gt;An</li>
            <li>/&gt;Short, Cheap, low quality leather.</li>
            <li>I am new to straight razors both honing and shaving.</li>
            <li>I personally would suggest that you just buy I high quality strop to begin with and that is exactly what I plan on doing when I gather the funds.</li>
            <li>I am new in to stroping my knives, i order this one because of the price</li>
            <li>Even though there are two different texture straps, only the smooth leather is usable.</li>
            <li>Not made from real leather, the smooth side is a strange reconstituted material and the rough side is vinyl.  </li>
            <li>However as some other reviewers have said it came in the mail creased which pretty much ruined it</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised when I received this strop.</li>
            <li>really recommended for actual shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This had some bad reviews and I don&#x27;t know why, for $15 this is actually very nice.</li>
            <li>They are much more efficient, require vastly less effort to use and are WAY safer than attempting to use a dull tool.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no pro with a straight razor - that&#x27;s a little before my time.  </li>

            <li> The rough side of the leather was not good at all and if the rest of the strop was like it then I would have given it one star and returned it, however, the smooth side of the leather is at about 4 stars.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, not a bad strop but not a great strop.</li>
            <li> Back to the rough side now.</li>
            <li> use this strop every single week and my tools have never functioned as well as they do now....................</li>
            <li> I would look elsewhere for a high quality strop if you are serious about stropping</li>
            <li> the back,  it appears very course and maybe somewhat useless.  </li>
            <li> It dulls my Dovo.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing in the world like a really sharp tool.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion that ruins it forever.</li>
            <li> The strop is a smaller strop and on the rougher leather side there was about 4 inches of unusable area which in turn means less workable space, which sucks.</li>
            <li> and i was not let down.</li>
            <li> I do understand, that the leather has to be dressed up a little.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this strop for a few days.</li>
            <li> Also is too short an thin.</li>
            <li> However if you are dead set on this strop</li>
            <li> It was in pretty bad shape, but I got into condition to teach myself to shave with it.</li>
            <li> but then you will, or at least, should get another strop for the rougher side.</li>
            <li> The pressed felt (at least what I am assuming is supposed to be pressed felt) is a little weird.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s bad handling from the shipping staff, that fact damaged the strop, quality of the leather not good, after using leather dressing on it all red from the leather</li>
            <li> It need to be broken in.</li>
            <li> Sorry guys</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a bad one.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not made from real leather, the smooth side is a strange reconstituted material and the rough side is vinyl.  No use at all as a shaving strop.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.It is cheap.It dulls my Dovo.I bought another Strop and this one is under my sink anyone want it......No Kielbasa&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Good quality, quick delivery. I put this to the test on a Solingen razor my great grandfather brought over from the old country in 1890. It was in pretty bad shape, but I got into condition to teach myself to shave with it.</li>
            <li> The strop came folded up in the mail which deformed the leather giving it stretch marks. These stretch marks make it so that I can not use the entire strop.</li>
            <li> Okay.  Why 5-Stars?  Especially when everyone else is giving only 4?  Because I think it is an exceptional value and it has propelled my sharpening skills to the next level.  I use this strop for final stropping of my knives, chisels and plane-irons.  There is nothing in the world like a really sharp tool.  They are much more efficient, require vastly less effort to use and are WAY safer than attempting to use a dull tool.  After sharpening with my diamond stones, I use this strop for a final dressing.  With my knives, I use it solely as a touch-up in-between sharpenings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This inexpensive strop gets better and better the more it is used, becoming more supple and producing the sharpest cutting edge I have ever been able to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this strop every single week and my tools have never functioned as well as they do now....................so coupled with the very low price, it is definitely 5-Star in my book.</li>
            <li> The strop the vendor provided was actually much higher quality than&lt;br /&gt;advertised.  I thought I&#x27;d be getting a generic strop, but instead they&lt;br /&gt;shipped a Misaki!  I can&#x27;t guarantee the same results for future&lt;br /&gt;shoppers.  But, if you get the Misaki strop, you will be delighted.&lt;br /&gt;the leather side is first quality, and the linen side is also very good.&lt;br /&gt;An experienced sharpener will know the difference and appreciate it...</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 Star only for the fact I have not yet had the opportunity to use it yet... The quality is great and the from the experience I have with straight razor shaving, this will work excellent. So if you looking to get one, look no further.</li>
            <li> I am new in to stroping my knives, i order this one because of the price and i was not let down. the strop is the perfect size of width and length, the quality is great for the price. i would recommend this to any beginner</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised when I received this strop. I am new to straight razors both honing and shaving. I thought the strop performed very nicely. The got a pretty nice edge for a comfortable shave. I am getting better with practice of course. This is a pretty good entry level strop especially for the money.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting. But I guess for the price it is manageable. Even though there are two different texture straps, only the smooth leather is usable. I also had to place a stack of books on it for a week to get the folds out of it. They shipped it folded up. In my opinion that ruins it forever.</li>
            <li> and not \\&quot;professional\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would serve its purpose if used for decoration.&lt;br /&gt;Not really recommended for actual shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short, Cheap, low quality leather.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use this as I would like but by appearances, it looks like it will work.  Looks just like the strop that hung on the barber chair but it&#x27;s a bit shorter.  It need to be broken in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no pro with a straight razor - that&#x27;s a little before my time.  I use it for honing knives and chisels in the work-shop.  Excellent workmanship and many surfaces that hold compounds nicely.  It&#x27;s an inexpensive, but well made strop strap.</li>
            <li> The seller was fine and it came quickly but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  I would look elsewhere for a high quality strop if you are serious about stropping</li>
            <li> This had some bad reviews and I don&#x27;t know why, for $15 this is actually very nice. It&#x27;s obviously not the quality of a $100 strop, but it&#x27;s great for a starter or as a travel one.</li>
            <li> I have been using this strop for a few days. In my recommendation, this strop doesn&#x27;t quite make it to five stars.  I don&#x27;t understand this canvas&lt;br /&gt;on the back,  it appears very course and maybe somewhat useless.  The leather side: I had to scrap the shoe polish off, before I could get to the&lt;br /&gt;leather part.  I do understand, that the leather has to be dressed up a little.  However, this appeared to regular boot or shoe polish fron esquire&lt;br /&gt;polish.  Now that I have worked on it some, it is doing the job, execpt the back side canvas part.  Although, I do recommend this product for honing&lt;br /&gt;straight razors.  I have Dovo razors,  I am particular of what kind of material that I lay one of my razors on.  I would have gave 5 stars, except&lt;br /&gt;for this canvas (stuff) on the back side and the quarter inch of what appears shoe polish.................</li>
            <li> Not the highest quality, but OK</li>
            <li> Five stars for price. To soon to review performance.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described and would be a good travel strop. However as some other reviewers have said it came in the mail creased which pretty much ruined it</li>
            <li> It came folded. So it&#x27;s bad handling from the shipping staff, that fact damaged the strop, quality of the leather not good, after using leather dressing on it all red from the leather came off. Also is too short an thin. Sorry guys but it&#x27;s a bad one.</li>
            <li> For the money its an ok to good strop. The pressed felt (at least what I am assuming is supposed to be pressed felt) is a little weird. The rough side of the leather was not good at all and if the rest of the strop was like it then I would have given it one star and returned it, however, the smooth side of the leather is at about 4 stars. Not quite excellent but not bad in the least bit. Back to the rough side now. The strop is a smaller strop and on the rougher leather side there was about 4 inches of unusable area which in turn means less workable space, which sucks. I guess you could use that side as a pasted strop but then you will, or at least, should get another strop for the rougher side. I personally would suggest that you just buy I high quality strop to begin with and that is exactly what I plan on doing when I gather the funds. However if you are dead set on this strop atleast buy some Fromm Strop Dressing. I had already had some and it made the strop to where if I had received it in the condition with which I made it with the dressing I would have given it four stars. In conclusion, not a bad strop but not a great strop.</li>
