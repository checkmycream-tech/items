            <li>THis product is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I was so delighted to know that there was an inexpensive hair dryer of professional quality out there.</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>however it lasted EXACTLY 1 YEAR!!  </li>
            <li>Works great not very loud, it&#x27;s hot which is fine with me!</li>
            <li>This hair dryer has made the process time go by SO quickly, leaves my hair smooth, AND is affordable.  </li>
            <li>very powerful, love it so much.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer is powerful and dries my hair quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Nice blow dryer so far had about a month blows very strong and gets pretty hot</li>
            <li>She has used it many times since and absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very evident.</li>
            <li>This hair drier is probably awesome for someone with lots of thick hair, however it is way too hot finer hair.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer gets HOT!  </li>
            <li>with this dryer I&#x27;m able to get the same smooth blow out i get from a salon blow out.</li>
            <li>but with this kind of company backing up their products, I definitely wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy from them again!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind the sound and giving your arms a quick workout (as compared to those featherweight dryers), then I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>After buying cheap, but high watt  dryers for years, I am a convert.</li>
            <li>Dryer is good if you have thick hair - dries your hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li>What I love about this dryer is that it is dries and allows me to style my hair so much quicker than my old dryer.</li>
            <li>Relatively quiet, high velocity, and effective.</li>
            <li>pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have noticed after only about a month of using it, that my hair feels more damaged already, and have decided to give it away.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is not quiet as claimed, it sounded more like a mac truck.</li>
            <li>and that was why I bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I finally found a hair dryer that does what I want it to do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I do not buy anithing without try it first.</li>
            <li>When I found the La Vida X5, I read a review that stated that it was too hot for certain hair types and knew that it was what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>so it makes me think it won&#x27;t last long, which is fine since we don&#x27;t really love it.</li>
            <li>my dream come true!I have been looking for a strong and silent salon quality at affordable price hair dryer and found it!</li>
            <li>but THIS blow dryer is as good as some high end ones and didn&#x27;t cost me anywhere near the expected $140 for the quality.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I have realized that it probably has a high wattage</li>
            <li>Im just in love with this hair dryer, finally found something good for my very thick and frizzy hair..</li>
            <li>Makes my hair drying time much shorter.</li>
            <li>This dryer really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind too much.  </li>
            <li>much easier on my hair</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>but I really hope it holds up</li>
            <li>Very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews posted for this item, i wasn&#x27;t really convinced of getting it.</li>
            <li>had really a problem with all hair blowers in the market, since none can give you the result of a hair dresser.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>And the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really believe all the Ionic hype, but it really does seem to make a difference.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of heavy</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this hair dryer for the first couple of months, then ad some of the other customer reviews had stated it quit working.  </li>
            <li>When I made this purchase I was looking for a high wattage, ceramic ionic hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Only worked for a month and then stopped blowing hot air!</li>
            <li>Those great reviews are probably fake reviews.</li>
            <li>It seems very well built and has a lot of power without being too loud.</li>
            <li>It is on the heavy and noisy side, but I love the strength it puts out and the super long cord.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it works fine so far.</li>
            <li>I tried a digital dryer and it got so hot</li>
            <li>but the other selling points may not be true.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s THAT loud.  </li>
            <li>I have always purchased professional hair dryers and never did they blow out smoke like this one.</li>
            <li>My hair dryer which I use sporadically (since I go to the hair dresser very often) stopped working last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally a professional hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It is loud.</li>
            <li>It was used gently on shoulder length hair for short period of time.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think a powerful dryer such as this will be very quiet.  </li>
            <li>It has hot, warm and cold.  </li>
            <li>However, i insisted due to the fact that it&#x27;s 2200 Watts, and i guess i made the right</li>
            <li>I use it on high heat and low fan.  </li>
            <li>Might be a little hot for normal hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s half the price and totally worth it.</li>
            <li>This dryer is exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>Also the item I was sent was clearly a return the box was open and nothing was in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Very pricy to last just 13 months with limited use.</li>
            <li>I have long very frizzy hair and blows it straight with a round brush</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty heavy</li>
            <li>its fast and powerfull, and reduce the time of drying in half.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, yesterday I heard a popping sound while using it, and it completely stopped working.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s half the price and totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This dryer is exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> Also the item I was sent was clearly a return the box was open and nothing was in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Very pricy to last just 13 months with limited use.</li>
            <li> I have long very frizzy hair and blows it straight with a round brush</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty heavy</li>
            <li> its fast and powerfull, and reduce the time of drying in half.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, yesterday I heard a popping sound while using it, and it completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned (the other lasted about 3 years before I dropped it to it&#x27;s death), and I&#x27;ve come to realize that no other hair dryer compares.  </li>
            <li> Since my hair is short it doesn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> The cord is extra long.</li>
            <li> i only needed 10 minutes to dry and straighten my hair with this one, and it looked like i came out of the hair</li>
            <li> I only used it twice a month to dry my dogs for about 30 minutes each time.</li>
            <li> Louder than I expected it to be but not as loud as other dryers I&#x27;ve had or heard.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected, and works like a salon dryer.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very long and medium thickness.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> Nothing above average about it.</li>
            <li> Supe quiet, Long heavy cord, has a few attachments for different styling options.  </li>
            <li> It is a little heavier and larger in size than I prefer.  </li>
            <li> and it usually takes me forever to dry my hair, but this blow dryer has cut that time in half if not less.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer blows so much smoke, it has to be unhealthy for my hair.</li>
            <li> Dryer does everything she expected.</li>
            <li> I previously owned a hair dryer that did not provide the amount of heat I needed to blow dry my hair without it looking like a frizz ball.  </li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t to heavy the only down side</li>
            <li> I can feel the air blowing at my roots whereas the other dryers I did not have that.  </li>
            <li> She says it has cut her dry time in half!</li>
            <li> 4 stars due to nozzle falls off if you don&#x27;t push it in tight ever time you use it but other than that no complaints.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teen daughter&#x27;s very thick &amp; long hair.  </li>
            <li> Definetely this hair dryer sucks, it did not last not even 30 days.</li>
            <li> the fat its sooooo fast to blow dry my hair style it and then use the cold air to lock in the style</li>
            <li> is that by the switches I have a little gap and on the other side you can see glue holding it together.</li>
            <li> Not very strong.</li>
            <li> This has cut my drying time in half.</li>
            <li> It has cut her drying time in half in the mornings before school</li>
            <li> My hair is smoother and softer and dries in much less time (I&#x27;d say 30-40% faster).  </li>
            <li> Was looking for a blow dryer that would dry my thick hair in under 45 minutes</li>
            <li> I use a blow dryer to dry thin wet layers in acrylic painting.  </li>
            <li> a little bit heavy,</li>
            <li> it is a little heavy so be prepared for that weight to start hitting you at the end of the day in your rotator cuff</li>
            <li> It was heavy and smells when in use.</li>
            <li> Definitely not for thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 2 seconds heavy sparks came out and it died.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product and wish I didn&#x27;t waste my money in such a poor quality tool.</li>
            <li> i was not able to do this with my previous dryer.</li>
            <li> Still disappointed the dryer died so quickly</li>
            <li> Im so relieved because I had gotten previous dryers that were so weak and kept my hair wet.  </li>
            <li> Cons: Runs too hot, buttons are in a bad position.</li>
            <li> This one dries my thick hair in less than 10 minutes</li>
            <li> In the past I thought that the if this type product read Xhairdryer 3000 that these were the watts and that was wrong, when you read the specs they would probably be only 1300 watts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure whether all &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; quality hair dryers smell like fumes, but this one does.</li>
            <li> and they sent a replacement within a few days!  </li>
            <li> My hair is past by rear end.</li>
            <li> Blows to hard frizzed my curly hair</li>
            <li> It only blows cold air.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that is difficult to dry.</li>
            <li> Of course I had to open the box to realize it was a bad hair dryer.</li>
            <li> but they get tired holding this dryer up..</li>
            <li> Was tired of hair dryers that died after 3 years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a lot from Amazon and they should not have sellers on here with such awful policies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost scared to keep using it, I&#x27;m afraid it is going to blow up, no joke.</li>
            <li> So sad :-(</li>
            <li> I regret not to pay attention to the bad reviews which they were saying the thruth.</li>

            <li> my dream come true!I have been looking for a strong and silent salon quality at affordable price hair dryer and found it! It was shipped very quickly and as soon as I got it I used it and love it!!!Love the fat its sooooo fast to blow dry my hair style it and then use the cold air to lock in the style and it works perfectly!!I just love it and will recommend it to anyone who wants fast salon style at home qualiuty product for a good price!!!Thanks for making my dream come true!!!</li>
            <li> very strong and powerful hair dryer. a little bit heavy, but i don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair drying time much shorter.</li>
            <li> This dryer really gets the job done.  My hair is very long and medium thickness.  I don&#x27;t color.  I had another kind I won&#x27;t mention but it was 1875 watts but this is great.  I can feel the air blowing at my roots whereas the other dryers I did not have that.  My hair comes out way more bouncy and shiny with this.  Now, I hope it doesn&#x27;t konk out on me like others did.  It&#x27;s kind of heavy but that&#x27;s a con I don&#x27;t mind too much.  It has hot, warm and cold.  I tried a digital dryer and it got so hot I was burned so back that went but not on here, on another site.  I wanted a nice, powerful dryer and this is really great.  Someone was asking how many watts this is.  It is 2200 watts.  I don&#x27;t think a powerful dryer such as this will be very quiet.  It does not bother me, the sound.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s THAT loud.  I use it on high heat and low fan.  It&#x27;s really a good dryer.</li>
            <li> Nice blow dryer so far had about a month blows very strong and gets pretty hot I have long very frizzy hair and blows it straight with a round brush pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty heavy but I don&#x27;t mind the weight. 4 stars due to nozzle falls off if you don&#x27;t push it in tight ever time you use it but other than that no complaints.</li>
            <li> This hair drier is probably awesome for someone with lots of thick hair, however it is way too hot finer hair.  I have noticed after only about a month of using it, that my hair feels more damaged already, and have decided to give it away. Pros: Supe quiet, Long heavy cord, has a few attachments for different styling options.  Cons: Runs too hot, buttons are in a bad position.</li>
            <li> After buying cheap, but high watt  dryers for years, I am a convert. This has cut my drying time in half.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer blows so much smoke, it has to be unhealthy for my hair. When I made this purchase I was looking for a high wattage, ceramic ionic hair dryer. After the first use, I have realized that it probably has a high wattage but the other selling points may not be true. I have always purchased professional hair dryers and never did they blow out smoke like this one. I do not recommend this product and wish I didn&#x27;t waste my money in such a poor quality tool.</li>
            <li> Not very strong. Does the job. Doesn&#x27;t have a lot of heft so it makes me think it won&#x27;t last long, which is fine since we don&#x27;t really love it.</li>
            <li> Daughter is very satisfied. Dryer does everything she expected. And a great price.</li>
            <li> I am of Hispanic heritage with fairly curly and kinky hair.  I previously owned a hair dryer that did not provide the amount of heat I needed to blow dry my hair without it looking like a frizz ball.  When I found the La Vida X5, I read a review that stated that it was too hot for certain hair types and knew that it was what I was looking for.  I was so delighted to know that there was an inexpensive hair dryer of professional quality out there.</li>
            <li> Definetely this hair dryer sucks, it did not last not even 30 days. I only used once a day, &amp; it got burned out. I regret not to pay attention to the bad reviews which they were saying the thruth.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a present for my wife this Christmas. She has used it many times since and absolutely loves it. She says it has cut her dry time in half!</li>
            <li> I was really happy with this purchase until it just stop working after only 4 months.It only blows cold air.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that is difficult to dry. This hair dryer is powerful and dries my hair quickly and easily. I love it.</li>
            <li> nice hot blow drye, lots of power. it is a little heavy so be prepared for that weight to start hitting you at the end of the day in your rotator cuff but i can breeze through any blowdry with ease. love it.</li>
            <li> Bought for my girlfriend and she proclaims its the best she has ever owned.</li>
            <li> I use a blow dryer to dry thin wet layers in acrylic painting.  This blow dryer does the job with the most efficiently of any blow dryer I have used to date.  Might be a little hot for normal hair.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product five stars at this time yesterday. Unfortunately, yesterday I heard a popping sound while using it, and it completely stopped working. Totally unacceptable.</li>
            <li> Love love love my new dryer. Yay !</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the power and it is! It&#x27;s also very quiet. However, it weighs a lot. I have strong arms but they get tired holding this dryer up.. Since my hair is short it doesn&#x27;t take long. The cord is extra long.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is not quiet as claimed, it sounded more like a mac truck. It was heavy and smells when in use. I got stuck with it because their 30 day return policy is really only 7 days with a 15% restocking fee IF unopened. Of course I had to open the box to realize it was a bad hair dryer. I&#x27;ve purchased a lot from Amazon and they should not have sellers on here with such awful policies. The ratings on this hair dryer were so good and that was why I bought it in the first place. Those great reviews are probably fake reviews. I hope I can find a way to complain to Amazon about this seller.</li>
            <li> Blows to hard frizzed my curly hair</li>
            <li> Its an OK dryer.....however it lasted EXACTLY 1 YEAR!!  My hair dryer which I use sporadically (since I go to the hair dresser very often) stopped working last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible.</li>
            <li> THis product is fabulous. In the past I thought that the if this type product read Xhairdryer 3000 that these were the watts and that was wrong, when you read the specs they would probably be only 1300 watts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was truthful and am very happy with it. It drys the hell out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Only worked for a month and then stopped blowing hot air!</li>
            <li> Im just in love with this hair dryer, finally found something good for my very thick and frizzy hair.. thank you</li>
            <li> excellent dryer! very powerful, love it so much.  Arrived earlier than expected, and works like a salon dryer.  Im so relieved because I had gotten previous dryers that were so weak and kept my hair wet.  This one dries my thick hair in less than 10 minutes</li>
            <li> YA LO RECIB&amp;Iacute;, ME GUSTO EL SECADOR MUY POTENTE,CALIENTA BASTANTE,SECA R&amp;Aacute;PIDO Y DE MANERA PERFECTA,LO &amp;Uacute;NICO QUE ES UN POCO PESADO, POR LO DEM&amp;Aacute;S EXCELENTE.</li>
            <li> It came without instructions.  Works okay.  Nothing above average about it.</li>
            <li> Not sure whether all &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; quality hair dryers smell like fumes, but this one does. Other than that, it works fine so far.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer gets HOT!  I love it and I&#x27;m glad I finally found a hair dryer that does what I want it to do.</li>
            <li> Was a MUST to buy this dryer once I tried the one I bought for my daughter -- was on her birthday list.  Excellent dryer that has loads of power without excess heat -- much easier on my hair and it&#x27;s very evident.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teen daughter&#x27;s very thick &amp; long hair.  It has cut her drying time in half in the mornings before school</li>
            <li> I blow-dry my hair almost everyday-and it used to be a chore. This hair dryer has made the process time go by SO quickly, leaves my hair smooth, AND is affordable.  If you&#x27;re thinking of investing in an amazing hair dryer, invest in this one. It&#x27;s half the price and totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I love it.. It works very well. It&#x27;s totally a professional hair dryer. I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I love it! Heats up nice it isn&#x27;t to heavy the only down side is that by the switches I have a little gap and on the other side you can see glue holding it together. Also the item I was sent was clearly a return the box was open and nothing was in a plastic bag. So far so good but I really hope it holds up</li>
            <li> this hair dryer was recommended byre person who has been doing my hair for 12 years. with this dryer I&#x27;m able to get the same smooth blow out i get from a salon blow out. i was not able to do this with my previous dryer.</li>
            <li> Was tired of hair dryers that died after 3 years so I purchased this.  It died after 4 MONTHS!  the heating element broke.  Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;6/10/2015 update... Called customer service and they sent a replacement within a few days!  Fabulous!  Still disappointed the dryer died so quickly but with this kind of company backing up their products, I definitely wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy from them again!</li>
            <li> This dryer is exactly what I expected! Very powerful and does it job quickly! I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase ;)</li>
            <li> Was looking for a blow dryer that would dry my thick hair in under 45 minutes and I found it. Definitely not for thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews posted for this item, i wasn&#x27;t really convinced of getting it. However, i insisted due to the fact that it&#x27;s 2200 Watts, and i guess i made the right choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had really a problem with all hair blowers in the market, since none can give you the result of a hair dresser.&lt;br /&gt;But this one, is really great!!! i only needed 10 minutes to dry and straighten my hair with this one, and it looked like i came out of the hair salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, i recommend it big time!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this hair dryer at all.  It keeps popping when I turn it on but doesn&#x27;t shut off.  It does pop circuits, I can&#x27;t have anything else plugged in with it and if there are too many things &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; in the house it pops the circuit as well.  I&#x27;m almost scared to keep using it, I&#x27;m afraid it is going to blow up, no joke.</li>
            <li> My hair needs heat that revlon, conair, etc. can&#x27;t give me but THIS blow dryer is as good as some high end ones and didn&#x27;t cost me anywhere near the expected $140 for the quality. I can finally maintain my curly, frizzy, wavy, puffy faux Dominican Afro. I&#x27;m in love!!!</li>
            <li> It is loud. Louder than I expected it to be but not as loud as other dryers I&#x27;ve had or heard. Its a great dryer though. I have looooong hair and it cut my drying time to 1hr. My hair is past by rear end. It is potent and it does the job. I was pleased with product and would recommend it to someone else. I would purchase this item again. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this hair dryer for the first couple of months, then ad some of the other customer reviews had stated it quit working.  The heating part of it just stopped about 6 months in. So sad :-(</li>
            <li> Works great not very loud, it&#x27;s hot which is fine with me!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and it usually takes me forever to dry my hair, but this blow dryer has cut that time in half if not less.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> UPDATED Sept 2015:&lt;br /&gt;This dryer died today after almost catching on fire.  I sniffed a burning smell and 2 seconds heavy sparks came out and it died. I only used it twice a month to dry my dogs for about 30 minutes each time. Always cleaned lint out of the air vent. Very pricy to last just 13 months with limited use. Does anyone make a quality product??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;his is a terrific dryer for the price here on Amazon.  It seems very well built and has a lot of power without being too loud. It has three heat settings and two power settings.  I love it.  Great for blow drying my two dogs on a cooler setting.</li>
            <li> I bought it in May and it blew up in August.  It was used gently on shoulder length hair for short period of time.  Up until the point when it stopped working it was a really good hair dryer.  Relatively quiet, high velocity, and effective.</li>
            <li> Dryer is good if you have thick hair - dries your hair very quickly.  It is a little heavier and larger in size than I prefer.  I like the attachments that come with it as well.  Very well made and good cord quality.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned (the other lasted about 3 years before I dropped it to it&#x27;s death), and I&#x27;ve come to realize that no other hair dryer compares.  It is on the heavy and noisy side, but I love the strength it puts out and the super long cord.  If you don&#x27;t mind the sound and giving your arms a quick workout (as compared to those featherweight dryers), then I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I do not buy anithing without try it first. But this blower its really great. its fast and powerfull, and reduce the time of drying in half. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair dryer when my hair dryer stopped working. I received it in just a couple of days. What I love about this dryer is that it is dries and allows me to style my hair so much quicker than my old dryer. And the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> powerful, great product !!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I didn&#x27;t really believe all the Ionic hype, but it really does seem to make a difference.  My hair is smoother and softer and dries in much less time (I&#x27;d say 30-40% faster).  It is a very hot hair dryer, so be sure to keep it away from your scalp and face.  But, I love it!</li>
