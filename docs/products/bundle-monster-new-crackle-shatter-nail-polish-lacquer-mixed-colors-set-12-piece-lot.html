            <li>These crackle nail polishes are awesome.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The best color out of the bunch is the black.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I printed out the instructions and hints from the company and wonderful reviews, to give with the gift.</li>
            <li>The nail polish is great, some of the lighter colors are not the best because they dont show up well</li>
            <li>and she loved it!  </li>
            <li>This polish is great, it is a knock off</li>

            <li>I was thrilled to see so many colors at a great price.</li>
            <li>but this crackle works better than the name brand in my opinion!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>After going to my cousins and having her do my nails, I decided I needed to get my own nail polish.</li>
            <li>nice.</li>
            <li>i had gotten otger brands that bombed, but these were nice.</li>
            <li>Not as good as others, but better then others.</li>
            <li>If you like funky nail polishes I recommend this set for its great variety of colors and fun!</li>
            <li>but it works even better.</li>
            <li>She was ok with it, so I was, too.  </li>
            <li>One of these reviews said that the crackle came off of her daughters finger nails, so I think a top coat is a must...</li>
            <li>The variety of colors means you can get really creative.</li>
            <li>I love my nail ploish</li>
            <li>Super satisfied with the results!</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and it seemed like a great product, however, the polich was old.</li>
            <li>My Grand-Niece loved them, and that&#x27;s what really mattered to me.</li>
            <li>The colors are classic and the over-all look is more subdued than &#x27;in your face&#x27; trendy.  </li>
            <li>The colors are great and they definitely crackle as stated.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>My niece loved her set for Christmas, the only thing it didn&#x27;t come with is the top coat.  </li>
            <li>Right now, I&#x27;m using ICE Crackle because I want a deep, opaque, vibrant, trendy, bright look.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for my nail polish!!  </li>
            <li>And top with a clear coat</li>
            <li>We researched how to apply and it said to apply a clear coat over top.</li>
            <li>the polish just chalked over and wiped right off.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>The 5 stars are for the price (can&#x27;t beat $1.58 a bottle),excellent packaging, and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors are pretty true but the purple and silver ones in particular are horrid.</li>
            <li>Crackle polishes really give you a bit of individuality and are fun to combine with others.</li>
            <li>They crack perfectly the only issue I have is that they dry very matte and they look washed out but a coat of clear polish will correct that</li>
            <li>but the white and black alone make this set worth it, the darker colors are great too.</li>
            <li>She said that this nail polish works just as good as the more expensive stuff, and she&#x27;s trilled with all the colors it came with.</li>
            <li>The next day she came over with her fingers looking pretty cool!</li>
            <li>She waited about 10 more minutes for it to dry</li>
            <li>Some were a little iffy(they looked old), but I am sure they will work fine.</li>
            <li>they were a lot better than I expected them to be.</li>
            <li>A lot of these colors were really unattractive in person.</li>
            <li>but once I put the top coat on it was black.</li>
            <li>I had a couple crackle polishes that were more expensive and wanted more colors.</li>
            <li>A tip: let your base color dry for a good 20-30 minutes before adding crackle over top and it will come out lots better.</li>
            <li>Decent mid-range product and price.</li>
            <li>Worked well, longer than normal drying time once applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even get around to using the other colors because the green and yellow didn&#x27;t look very good when I applied them.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised about these crackle polishes.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a trend that I hope starts, ;).</li>
            <li>After about 20 minutes, when she was sure it would be dry, she took a towel out of her hair (she was letting her hair dry while she did her nails) and the crackle started coming off.</li>
            <li>This Bundle Monster polish will be fantastic for when my taste quiets down a bit.   </li>
            <li>I was surprised at the quality and rapid shipping of this product.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to have a set of crackle colors..until I used a few of these.</li>
            <li>The polish is not thick, so you will have time to work several brush strokes before the crackling starts.</li>
            <li>I used the black first, at first it looked grey</li>
            <li>For the most part: Applied thinly, you get a finer mesh look that may not be opaque enough to fully cover a darker base color when using a lighter top crackle polish, but nice coverage with the darker crackle colors.  </li>
            <li>She removed it and tried hot pink with  black, and it looked a little better</li>
            <li>This would be a really fun thing to get for a slumber party with a bunch of little girls.</li>
            <li>4 of the bottles of polish were very thick and unusable, I ordered this for my daughter and most of the polishes were unusable</li>
            <li>The only thing is that most, if not all, of the colors need to be used over very light base coats otherwise you can barely see the crackle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2 of the bottle had a broken plastic top</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 5 colors so far and only the white gives a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>not closed all the way prior to packaging.</li>
            <li>Applied thickly, you get more defined cracks, but less of them.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Applied thickly, you get more defined cracks, but less of them.  </li>
            <li> they go on very smooth and thin not gloopy like other crackle finishes.</li>
            <li> One polish was dry and as soon as you open the package you can smell the polish.  </li>
            <li> the white crackle makes the bottom color bleed no matter how long you let it dry.</li>
            <li> Very dry, and doesnt show the colour well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The purple i had to paint on 3 coats to really see the crackle effect and the silver is very dull looking.</li>
            <li> but still the pink looked dulled.</li>
            <li> I used the green and the yellow.</li>
            <li> Seems like they are closed by machine????and</li>
            <li> Cant wait to use other colors.</li>
            <li> Also, a few bottles were obviously used and not full bottles.</li>
            <li> Not worth my money</li>
            <li> The formula is a little thinner than the other brand I have, which makes a finer and better-looking crackle.</li>
            <li> At $19 I was a little weary about how well this product would work (</li>
            <li> something a like a little over $3 a bottle, when the name brand costs $8 a bottle)..</li>
            <li> so I had to work with a little nub when applying.</li>
            <li> I hope we didn&#x27;t waste 20.00 for the trash!</li>
            <li> For dramatic crackles do two coats per nail without allowing drying time between coats.  </li>
            <li> She used orange base coat with the black crackle, and you couldn&#x27;t tell she had anything underneath.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed at how thin the polish is.  </li>
            <li> She tried it once without a base and nothing happened.</li>
            <li> then she tried it with a base and still no crackle.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This polish is great, it is a knock off but it works even better. I used the black first, at first it looked grey but once I put the top coat on it was black. Cant wait to use other colors.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised about these crackle polishes.  they were a lot better than I expected them to be. they go on very smooth and thin not gloopy like other crackle finishes. They crack perfectly the only issue I have is that they dry very matte and they look washed out but a coat of clear polish will correct that and my niece loves to wear the look.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the quality and rapid shipping of this product.  The colors are great and they definitely crackle as stated.&lt;br /&gt;Very please with them!</li>
            <li> The 5 stars are for the price. Can&#x27;t beat 2 dollars a bottle. Excellent packaging. Very fast delivery.  Beyond that, it depends on what you like for a crackle.  Each color works slightly differently.  For the most part: Applied thinly, you get a finer mesh look that may not be opaque enough to fully cover a darker base color when using a lighter top crackle polish, but nice coverage with the darker crackle colors.  Applied thickly, you get more defined cracks, but less of them.  The polish is not thick, so you will have time to work several brush strokes before the crackling starts. Plus, the polish doesn&#x27;t glob on the brush or edge of the bottle. It dries on your nails in under 3 minutes.  The colors are classic and the over-all look is more subdued than &#x27;in your face&#x27; trendy.  As with all crackles, I recommend doing test swatches to see which application technique gives the desired result.  Right now, I&#x27;m using ICE Crackle because I want a deep, opaque, vibrant, trendy, bright look. (4 dollars a bottle).   This Bundle Monster polish will be fantastic for when my taste quiets down a bit.   I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas, and she was very happy with it, until she tried it. She used orange base coat with the black crackle, and you couldn&#x27;t tell she had anything underneath. She removed it and tried hot pink with  black, and it looked a little better but still the pink looked dulled. She was ok with it, so I was, too.  After about 20 minutes, when she was sure it would be dry, she took a towel out of her hair (she was letting her hair dry while she did her nails) and the crackle started coming off. She waited about 10 more minutes for it to dry and then she put her bathrobe away. Whenever she touches something with her nails, the crackle comes off.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> After going to my cousins and having her do my nails, I decided I needed to get my own nail polish. At $19 I was a little weary about how well this product would work (something a like a little over $3 a bottle, when the name brand costs $8 a bottle).. I was impressed when I tried it for the first time! One of these reviews said that the crackle came off of her daughters finger nails, so I think a top coat is a must... but this crackle works better than the name brand in my opinion! Super satisfied with the results! [&#x3D;</li>
            <li> Worked well, longer than normal drying time once applied.&lt;br /&gt;2 of the bottle had a broken plastic top so I had to work with a little nub when applying.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful colors and the crackle works great and looks nice our daughter loves them and uses them all the time!</li>
            <li> this all worked well and lioked nice. i had gotten otger brands that bombed, but these were nice.</li>
            <li> Received my order today and immediately tried some colors. I was a bit disappointed at how thin the polish is.  However, I guess it does the job. The only thing is that most, if not all, of the colors need to be used over very light base coats otherwise you can barely see the crackle. Also, a few bottles were obviously used and not full bottles. Im writing to the seller now to complain about this. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 5 colors so far and only the white gives a noticeable difference. I was very disappointed. Not worth my money</li>
            <li> I was so excited to have a set of crackle colors..until I used a few of these. Some of the colors are pretty true but the purple and silver ones in particular are horrid. The purple i had to paint on 3 coats to really see the crackle effect and the silver is very dull looking. the white crackle makes the bottom color bleed no matter how long you let it dry.</li>
            <li> 4 of the bottles of polish were very thick and unusable, I ordered this for my daughter and most of the polishes were unusable</li>
            <li> Definitely a trend that I hope starts, ;). Crackle polishes really give you a bit of individuality and are fun to combine with others.</li>
            <li> When my youngest sister asked for &amp;#34;Crackle nail polish&amp;#34; for her birthday, I had no idea what she was talking about. So I got on Amazon, and a bunch of different nail polishes came up! This one had a bunch of different colors, so I bought this one and gave it to her for her birthday. She informed me that this wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; but would see how it worked. The next day she came over with her fingers looking pretty cool! She said that this nail polish works just as good as the more expensive stuff, and she&#x27;s trilled with all the colors it came with. This would be a really fun thing to get for a slumber party with a bunch of little girls.</li>
            <li> A lot of these colors were really unattractive in person. They did not &amp;#34;crackle&amp;#34; but they did &amp;#34;blob&amp;#34;. I used the green and the yellow. I didn&#x27;t even get around to using the other colors because the green and yellow didn&#x27;t look very good when I applied them.</li>
            <li> I had a couple crackle polishes that were more expensive and wanted more colors. Found this and decided to order it. I love this stuff! The formula is a little thinner than the other brand I have, which makes a finer and better-looking crackle. The variety of colors means you can get really creative. I did blue nails with red crackle over them and white crackle along the tips for the 4th of July. Very cute. A tip: let your base color dry for a good 20-30 minutes before adding crackle over top and it will come out lots better. And top with a clear coat so it will last longer.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to see so many colors at a great price. I read the reviews and it seemed like a great product, however, the polich was old. Every color I tried turned chalky and refused to crackle. You get what you pay for, it all went in the trash.</li>
            <li> I love my nail ploish A LOT!!  Thank you so much for my nail polish!!  My Aunt Theresa LOVES it A LOT!!!</li>
            <li> Not as good as others, but better then others. Decent mid-range product and price. My Grand-Niece loved them, and that&#x27;s what really mattered to me.</li>
            <li> These crackle nail polishes are awesome. Conveniently packed and great assortment of colors.If you like funky nail polishes I recommend this set for its great variety of colors and fun!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter in law who loves to do her nails. She tried it once without a base and nothing happened. then she tried it with a base and still no crackle. the polish just chalked over and wiped right off. We researched how to apply and it said to apply a clear coat over top. have yet to try it again. I hope we didn&#x27;t waste 20.00 for the trash!</li>
            <li> My niece loved her set for Christmas, the only thing it didn&#x27;t come with is the top coat.  Good price and product.</li>
            <li> great deal for so many and you don&#x27;t have to keep saying \\&quot;I wished I had gotten another\\&quot;. Some were a little iffy(they looked old), but I am sure they will work fine.</li>
            <li> Very dry, and doesnt show the colour well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best color out of the bunch is the black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not recommend.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves the crackle look.  She loves the color selection and hasn&#x27;t had any problems.  For dramatic crackles do two coats per nail without allowing drying time between coats.  For finer crackles just use one coat.  One polish was dry and as soon as you open the package you can smell the polish.  Seems like they are closed by machine????and not closed all the way prior to packaging.</li>
            <li> I got it for a gift and she loved it!  One of my closest friends loves nail polish and this added infinite combinations to her collection.</li>
            <li> The 5 stars are for the price (can&#x27;t beat $1.58 a bottle),excellent packaging, and very fast delivery. I ordered these for my nieces for Christmas, and can&#x27;t wait to give them this gift! I printed out the instructions and hints from the company and wonderful reviews, to give with the gift.</li>
            <li> The nail polish is great, some of the lighter colors are not the best because they dont show up well but the white and black alone make this set worth it, the darker colors are great too.</li>
