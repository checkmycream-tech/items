            <li>Nice works if you give it time.</li>
            <li>Love the Bosely products.. good for thinning air to give body and texture.. makes hair feel fed and healthy ..</li>
            <li>I had been using Nizoral with great success for a year now.  </li>
            <li>Then all the hair even MORE in the shower.</li>
            <li>Style holds better too.</li>
            <li>I have also gotten many compliments on the way me hair looks (which did not happen before).</li>
            <li>Love and would recommend all try.</li>
            <li>I also love the way it makes my head feel while washing my hair.</li>
            <li>I just love this I&#x27;ve had so many compliments</li>
            <li>let&#x27;s me know that it&#x27;s working into the scalp and after using the bosely conditioner my hair has body and shine, I love this product and will continue to buy itüëç</li>
            <li>Ok, I have been using it for over a month.</li>
            <li>In fact Nioxin gave me more volume than Bosley.</li>
            <li>Will give this shampoo more time.  </li>
            <li>I love to feel the the minty burn each time I use it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Goldwell Color Glow for years, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be sold any more, so I started reading reviews to see what the replacement.</li>
            <li>giving the appearance of more volume, but</li>
            <li>Gave it 2 months of use, made my hair brittle and noticed more hair in the drain.  </li>
            <li>There are better alternatives out there.</li>
            <li>It made my hair very soft and fly away.</li>
            <li>and it also seems to aggravate my very mild psoriasis...like the volume but wouldn&#x27;t mind losing the itchy skin.</li>
            <li>The strong irritation when rinsing went away</li>
            <li>I love the tingling cool sensation when washing my hair</li>
            <li>I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>I wish they sold a product for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Love the product - it was sent quickly.</li>
            <li>This might be a good thing if you have course hair, but if you have hair that naturally dies those things, the shampoo compounds the problem.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>It was true.</li>
            <li>Just hope it works better than straight Rogaine -</li>
            <li>Hair doesn&#x27;t even look full out of bath let alone reducing hair fall!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Many thanks.</li>
            <li>and I firmly believe that is why it works so good for me!</li>
            <li>I will now be a loyal consumer of Bosley hair products.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product since I have fine, slightly thinning hair and because it had good reviews.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that less of my hair is falling, so I am so happy with that.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and noticing thinning at the top - female</li>
            <li>Also, I have copper color in my hair which fades really quickly, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to make it fade any faster than any other shampoo which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>So far it is OK, we will see...</li>
            <li>So far what I have noticed is that my hair feel thicker and with more volume.</li>
            <li>My scalp before us to feel a bit irritated, sensitive and oily, but now it feels so much better and healthier.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s worth using just on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>it arrives pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>However my hair appears thicker when I use it and really feels &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought wow this stuff is strong.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo made my hair like hay- which did give my hair more of a thicker look, but only because it was so dry and that&#x27;s not the kind of volume I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I was mortified and have had to cut my hair short in  a pixie cut because any length made it more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my first week of using this and can tell a difference.</li>
            <li>I went back to..mane n tail, much better in growing out your hair</li>
            <li>The first result was not visible until after 90 days of usage so don&#x27;t give up</li>
            <li>So glad I can buy this on line as it is not always convenient to go buy it from a local salon.</li>
            <li>First time I used the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>This product did arrive just as it said it would, however the part about being for color treated hair, NOT after using this item and the conditioner one time it stripped most of the color out of my recently colored hair.</li>
            <li>Most leave in conditioners or oils make my hair flat and greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say if you already have dry hair that is very tangly anyways, this probably won&#x27;t be the best option as it&#x27;s not moisturizing in the least.</li>
            <li>I really like the Bosley line of for thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Had straight hair and now have curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I think this product really helps counter act the drying effect the shampoo and conditioner has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo REALLY works.....</li>
            <li>This product works very well for my husband&#x27;s thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair much fuller.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it re grows hair so much as it puffs up the hair you have (see number 2)</li>
            <li>This shampoo did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>Maybe because i don&#x27;t have any major bald areas i haven&#x27;t noticed any hair regrowth, Overall i love the way this shampoo makes my hair feel and look.</li>
            <li>I like the other bosley shampoo and conditioner more than I do this one, but that&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
            <li>I started to notice significant all over hair thinning 4 years ago, most likely due to menopause.</li>
            <li>all kinds of new hair growing in!  </li>
            <li>and i was able to get it for half the price.</li>
            <li>I noticed all my hair fall is mainly from my roots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use bosley, but not this particular one.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li>This product is not going to give you amazing thick hair</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;ve been useing this shampoo for a little over a year hoping to regrow new hair my thinning spots....</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is true this shampoo will make your hair feel dry.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have said the product is very tingley and if you have a sensitive scalp it may actually give a burning sensation, I actually enjoyed the tingley feeling, to me it was invigorationg like washing with tee tree shampoo.</li>
            <li>It has definitely helped my hair to stop falling out, and now I have A LOT of new hair growth throughout my whole scalp; particularly noticeable in the front, near my hairline.  </li>
            <li>So far I have observed some new hair growth along the front part.  </li>
            <li>I bought the shampoo and conditioner and upon using them I could instantly recognize the positive difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really losing my hair but it is thin and colored and this product gives it great body.</li>
            <li>It smells clean but has a slight medicinal scent also.</li>
            <li>get the conditioner to complete the treatment.</li>
            <li>I am 31 years old and started noticing my hair thinning after I had my kids.</li>
            <li>, my scalp developed a rash I still can&#x27;t get under control, and my ends felt fried.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s hair was falling out and with this product she found it has stopped falling out and leaves her hair soft.</li>
            <li>I had to get BACK in the shower and put some heavy duty conditioner on it, that still barely made me able to get a comb through it.</li>
            <li>Now I still have fine, not so thin hair, and&lt;br /&gt;lots of new hair!!  </li>
            <li>This stuff left it light, fluffy but soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>and hopefully I will see new hair grow within the next couple of months.</li>
            <li>I find that not only is it helping my hair not to fall out, but if my hair isn&#x27;t too long, it also adds curl to my hair (which is straight as sticks).  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help my hair shedding, in fact it may have made it worse because combing my hair was a nightmare and probably pulled more hair out of my head.</li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty well, but it takes time and most of the negative reviews are because they didn&#x27;t give it enough time or washed their hair excessively.</li>
            <li>Anyways, thought this shampoo would be a good option, well, I was wrong!</li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews, I was really disappointed with what this shampoo did to my hair</li>
            <li>Long story short, it did NOT slow the fall out, did not give my hair a healthier look like I was told it would, and my hair wasn&#x27;t growing back in.</li>
            <li>I have really thin, lifeless, oily hair which I have tried livening up with different shampoos like Redken and Big Sexy, sometimes mixing the two in the shower.</li>

            <li> This stuff works pretty well, but it takes time and most of the negative reviews are because they didn&#x27;t give it enough time or washed their hair excessively.</li>
            <li> Anyways, thought this shampoo would be a good option, well, I was wrong!</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews, I was really disappointed with what this shampoo did to my hair</li>
            <li> Long story short, it did NOT slow the fall out, did not give my hair a healthier look like I was told it would, and my hair wasn&#x27;t growing back in.</li>
            <li> I have really thin, lifeless, oily hair which I have tried livening up with different shampoos like Redken and Big Sexy, sometimes mixing the two in the shower.</li>
            <li> The shedding has decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any major bald spots but my hair is very thin and fine</li>
            <li> I had used it 3 months and was about to quit when I started noticing less the thinning spots on my head and found a new hairdresser who told me that I had a lot of hair growth ...</li>
            <li> The peppermint I guess in it actually irritated my lips when I rinsed in the shower and it left my hair dry.  </li>
            <li> I really like the conditioner I am not sure about the shampoo.</li>
            <li> The only thing this will do is, thicken and dry out your hair...</li>
            <li> Used regularly every day but no new growth as of yet.  </li>
            <li> I have tried Nioxin in the past, with success, but after they were sold and production was sent to Mexico, I noticed the quality went down, and it didn&#x27;t work for my hair anymore.  </li>
            <li> After 6 weeks of using this product, my hair loss got worse, my hair became super dry</li>
            <li> A littler goes a long way with both shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works for some, everyone&#x27;s hair loss is for different reasons as everyone&#x27;s hair type is different but from my experience it was pretty awful.</li>
            <li> I have been using now for 4 years, I had very thin, fine hair and losing it in spots, (thyroid problems).  </li>
            <li> I also use a clarifying shampoo when I feel  my hair is too dry and that seems to help.</li>
            <li> It can leave your hair a bit dry, so i just use some Argan oil to moisturize it.</li>
            <li> still tangly, matted, dry, pulling hair trying to comb it out...</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling really dry.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use it long enough to see if it gave me the results of less hair shedding.</li>
            <li> Well, sadly I expected a lot from this product.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I feel the price is in line with other upscale hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all other salycilic acid shampoos, ketoconazole, zinc, etc</li>
            <li> None of the other shampoos even help with soreness.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this since April 2012 for hair loss due to side effect from medication.  </li>
            <li> I am a 64 r old woman who has had what seemed like very thick hair all my life.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it is rather drying.</li>
            <li> A lot of negative reviews are because people don&#x27;t give enough time for the product to work.  </li>
            <li> i have also noticed less hair loss in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This seemed to weigh my hair down a little.</li>
            <li> Thankfully after a few times, I linked the problem to this shampoo and stopped using it -- at that point, my hair stopped breaking off.  </li>
            <li> I am used to using Redken and Pureology and this shampoo leaves my hair feeling dried out and makes it look like I have split ends when I use it on the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo washed out the color after just a few washings.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Not great since I have dry hair to begin with.</li>
            <li> No more hair falling out, no more clumps of hair in my brush, no more hair in the bathtub trap, all I can say it&#x27;s a miracle and have told all my friends about it.</li>
            <li> My hair looks thicker as evidenced by my very narrow part.</li>
            <li> My hair always gets tired of these other shampoos.</li>
            <li> The other shampoo is all of a sudden impossible to find</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> Thought it would at least give volume.  </li>
            <li> The hair is probably coming in slowly.</li>
            <li> I bought this directly from a beauty supply (my parents are hairdressers) because I used to have insane thick hair, but suddenly it&#x27;s been thinning and coming out in wads.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later my mom told my hair looked dry, dull, frizzy, and horrible.</li>
            <li> In reality I had thin hair but a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed that my hair has decreased in the amount that had fallen out.</li>
            <li> Gives body to my thin hair.</li>
            <li> When a stylist at Peninsula Beauty advised me to buy Bosley, even though I&#x27;m not balding, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Disappointing and unsatisfied.  </li>
            <li> A bit disappointed because Bosley is suppose to be in the hair business for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the shampoo was already opened so</li>
            <li> Well, I am just disgusted with it.</li>
            <li> I shed horribly throughout the day and carried a lint roller to around</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like the Bosley line of for thinning hair. It does help to restore hair growth. I intend to continue using it.</li>
            <li> So far I have observed some new hair growth along the front part.  Will continue to observe.</li>
            <li> Have used this shampoo for sometime</li>
            <li> Not so good my hair was still falling .</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and feel that it helps my hair problems  I am very satisfied with your price and shipment speed.  This shampoo is part of a 3-product hair treatment.</li>
            <li> Well, sadly I expected a lot from this product. Chucks of hair gets all matted and falls off. A bit disappointed because Bosley is suppose to be in the hair business for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Real good shampoo for the money.</li>
            <li> I have really thin, lifeless, oily hair which I have tried livening up with different shampoos like Redken and Big Sexy, sometimes mixing the two in the shower. My hair always gets tired of these other shampoos. When a stylist at Peninsula Beauty advised me to buy Bosley, even though I&#x27;m not balding, I was skeptical. I bought the shampoo and conditioner and upon using them I could instantly recognize the positive difference. My hair is shiny and bouncy every wash like I just left the salon. I&#x27;m so happy with this shampoo!!</li>
            <li> I am a 64 r old woman who has had what seemed like very thick hair all my life. In reality I had thin hair but a lot of it.  Then started noticing my bangs were getting thinner and thinner and hair in the sink and shower, the a LOT of it, then on my head thinning spots. I was mortified and have had to cut my hair short in  a pixie cut because any length made it more noticeable.  Every hairdresser&#x27;s answer was Nioxin which did nothing.  Tried others. NOTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried Bosley. At first I thought wow this stuff is strong.  The peppermint I guess in it actually irritated my lips when I rinsed in the shower and it left my hair dry.  Not great since I have dry hair to begin with. Then all the hair even MORE in the shower. I had used it 3 months and was about to quit when I started noticing less the thinning spots on my head and found a new hairdresser who told me that I had a lot of hair growth ...all kinds of new hair growing in!  The strong irritation when rinsing went away and I actually will recommend this product. But you have to STICK WITH IT. Do not expect immediate results. I also use a clarifying shampoo when I feel  my hair is too dry and that seems to help.</li>
            <li> excellent very satisfied with it</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;m not really losing my hair but it is thin and colored and this product gives it great body. Style holds better too.</li>
            <li> I started using the shampoo and conditioner because I started noticing my hair was falling out in the shower and while combing. My friend told me to go to a beauty shop and get another product but when I went they recommended Bosley. I have only been using it for a week and I have noticed that my hair has decreased in the amount that had fallen out. I have also gotten many compliments on the way me hair looks (which did not happen before). Love and would recommend all try. I also love the way it makes my head feel while washing my hair. [[ASIN:B004Y6NVFM BOSLEY BOS REVIVE Shampoo and Conditioner Set Liter 33.8 oz Visible Thining Non Color Treated hair]]</li>
            <li> Bosley is supposed to be the best hair-loss product. My hairstylist says she sees a difference, but I don&#x27;t. Still, I use it because I&#x27;m NOT losing hair with it. The hair is probably coming in slowly.</li>
            <li> I have been using now for 4 years, I had very thin, fine hair and losing it in spots, (thyroid problems).  Now I still have fine, not so thin hair, and&lt;br /&gt;lots of new hair!!  Had straight hair and now have curly hair.  My beauty operator (cuts only) asked me what I have been using and I&lt;br /&gt;was happy to tell her!  My sister in Idaho uses it too.  She is very happy too,  but I asked her if she puts in on, lathers up, and leaves it&lt;br /&gt;while she showers?  She said no, but I told her I do and I firmly believe that is why it works so good for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my first week of using this and can tell a difference. It tingles but I can tell it&#x27;s working. It&#x27;s thicker and it&#x27;s definitely shinier.</li>
            <li> No more hair falling out, no more clumps of hair in my brush, no more hair in the bathtub trap, all I can say it&#x27;s a miracle and have told all my friends about it.</li>
            <li> Nice works if you give it time.</li>
            <li> I have used bosley products before and always end up coming back to them.. A littler goes a long way with both shampoo and conditioner.  I feel the price is in line with other upscale hair products.and it arrives pretty quickly.  I can&#x27;t tell weather it actually increases hair thickness or just appears to.  However my hair appears thicker when I use it and really feels &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean.  The only negative is that it is rather drying.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t figured out if this is making my hair grow Back or it just makes my hair look thicker either way I just love this I&#x27;ve had so many compliments this is a keeper</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered thid product.  I do think it does the job I want.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. I wanted fuller hair and it meets the bill.</li>
            <li> I love the tingling cool sensation when washing my hair let&#x27;s me know that it&#x27;s working into the scalp and after using the bosely conditioner my hair has body and shine, I love this product and will continue to buy itüëç</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve been useing this shampoo for a little over a year hoping to regrow new hair my thinning spots....Nothing!! The only thing this will do is, thicken and dry out your hair...I went back to..mane n tail, much better in growing out your hair</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended this product to me. She also happens to be one of my closest friends so she took me to the beauty supply store and i was able to get it for half the price. This product is not going to give you amazing thick hair and it may not regrow hair either but i believe it helps prevent hair loss and it also makes your hair feel fuller and thicker. I don&#x27;t have any major bald spots but my hair is very thin and fine and i lose a lot in the shower. Maybe because i don&#x27;t have any major bald areas i haven&#x27;t noticed any hair regrowth, Overall i love the way this shampoo makes my hair feel and look. i have also noticed less hair loss in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is true this shampoo will make your hair feel dry. I also purchased the bosley leave in volumizing spray. This stuff is a miracle worker. Most leave in conditioners or oils make my hair flat and greasy. This stuff left it light, fluffy but soft and shiny. I think this product really helps counter act the drying effect the shampoo and conditioner has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cost of this product go through a salon to purchase it..this way you can get it cheaper and it wont be an out of date bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps anyone thinking of purchasing this product...</li>
            <li> I have had significant hair loss over the past five years, mostly due to an auto immune disorder.  I have tried Nioxin in the past, with success, but after they were sold and production was sent to Mexico, I noticed the quality went down, and it didn&#x27;t work for my hair anymore.  So I saw Bosley on amazon.com and decided to give it a try.  This shampoo REALLY works.....but, YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT.  It&#x27;s not going to work miracles overnight.  Give it 3-4 months to see a difference.  A lot of negative reviews are because people don&#x27;t give enough time for the product to work.  It has definitely helped my hair to stop falling out, and now I have A LOT of new hair growth throughout my whole scalp; particularly noticeable in the front, near my hairline.  I will now be a loyal consumer of Bosley hair products.  They work for me.</li>
            <li> BEWARE! I bought the shampoo for visibly thinning hair (white/orange bottle) and it literally made my hair break off in handfuls. Thankfully after a few times, I linked the problem to this shampoo and stopped using it -- at that point, my hair stopped breaking off.  I was on the way to having no hair ... BEWARE!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well, but it takes time and most of the negative reviews are because they didn&#x27;t give it enough time or washed their hair excessively. I would say about 3-6 months and that is fair (Rome wasn&#x27;t built overnight). It can leave your hair a bit dry, so i just use some Argan oil to moisturize it. Bottom line is this stuff is cheaper than Rogaine and Finasteride (Finasteride can make you permanently impotent FYI).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it and be patient with it.</li>
            <li> It arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> Excellent Service. Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for my husband&#x27;s thinning hair.  The first result was not visible until after 90 days of usage so don&#x27;t give up</li>
            <li> So glad I can buy this on line as it is not always convenient to go buy it from a local salon.</li>
            <li> Love the Bosely products.. good for thinning air to give body and texture.. makes hair feel fed and healthy .. get the conditioner to complete the treatment.</li>
            <li> I bought this directly from a beauty supply (my parents are hairdressers) because I used to have insane thick hair, but suddenly it&#x27;s been thinning and coming out in wads. I&#x27;ve stopped coloring it, styling it, and blowdrying it and taking suppliments in order to help, but nothing seems to be working. I initially I thought it was bleach damage but upon counting shedding hairs overtime I wash I noticed all my hair fall is mainly from my roots. Not breakage. Anyways, thought this shampoo would be a good option, well, I was wrong! First time I used the shampoo and conditioner I couldn&#x27;t even get a comb through my hair, it literally matted my hair together. I had to get BACK in the shower and put some heavy duty conditioner on it, that still barely made me able to get a comb through it. So I started using just the shampoo and my regular ultra moisturizing conditioner- still tangly, matted, dry, pulling hair trying to comb it out... but I kept at it. A few weeks later my mom told my hair looked dry, dull, frizzy, and horrible. It was true. This shampoo made my hair like hay- which did give my hair more of a thicker look, but only because it was so dry and that&#x27;s not the kind of volume I was looking for. It didn&#x27;t help my hair shedding, in fact it may have made it worse because combing my hair was a nightmare and probably pulled more hair out of my head. I couldn&#x27;t use it long enough to see if it gave me the results of less hair shedding. It&#x27;s just way too drying. I&#x27;d say if you already have dry hair that is very tangly anyways, this probably won&#x27;t be the best option as it&#x27;s not moisturizing in the least. I&#x27;m sure it works for some, everyone&#x27;s hair loss is for different reasons as everyone&#x27;s hair type is different but from my experience it was pretty awful.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair. This seemed to weigh my hair down a little. I wish they sold a product for fine hair.</li>
            <li> So far it is OK, we will see... I really like the conditioner I am not sure about the shampoo. Will give it a month&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit. Ok, I have been using it for over a month. Hair still falling out. I will give it another month.</li>
            <li> I like the other bosley shampoo and conditioner more than I do this one, but that&#x27;s just my opinion. I&#x27;ll continue to use bosley, but not this particular one.</li>
            <li> I am 31 years old and started noticing my hair thinning after I had my kids. I purchased Bosley shampoo, conditioner and hair treatment month supply about 3 weeks ago. So far what I have noticed is that my hair feel thicker and with more volume. I also noticed that less of my hair is falling, so I am so happy with that. My scalp before us to feel a bit irritated, sensitive and oily, but now it feels so much better and healthier. I will definitely continue to use it and hopefully I will see new hair grow within the next couple of months. Hope this review helps you</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair.  In fact Nioxin gave me more volume than Bosley. I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product did arrive just as it said it would, however the part about being for color treated hair, NOT after using this item and the conditioner one time it stripped most of the color out of my recently colored hair. Couldn&#x27;t tell you if it would give you volume I would never use it again.</li>
            <li> I had been using Nizoral with great success for a year now.  I have a sore scalp, followed by hair loss.  I was diagnosed with chronic telogen effluvium, seborrheic dermatitis (although I never scale or flake at all) and androgenetic alopecia.  The other shampoo is all of a sudden impossible to find so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  I&#x27;ve tried all other salycilic acid shampoos, ketoconazole, zinc, etc and none work for me.  This shampoo does take the soreness away if I use it every day, so it must be working somewhat.  None of the other shampoos even help with soreness.  I have yet to see any regrowth, but it&#x27;s only been about 2 months.  I will say that I only use this product on my scalp and not the rest of my hair because I don&#x27;t like the way it makes my hair feel.  I am used to using Redken and Pureology and this shampoo leaves my hair feeling dried out and makes it look like I have split ends when I use it on the rest of my hair.  But, it&#x27;s worth using just on the scalp.  Also, I have copper color in my hair which fades really quickly, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to make it fade any faster than any other shampoo which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> THis was recommended to me by a friend so I will give it a try and see how it works. I have baby fine hair and noticing thinning at the top - female</li>
            <li> I was approached at an Ulta by a sales rep and encouraged to give this a try for my thinning, post-baby mane. I tried the shampoo, conditioner, and treatment foam for color treated hair. Long story short, it did NOT slow the fall out, did not give my hair a healthier look like I was told it would, and my hair wasn&#x27;t growing back in. What did it do instead? After 6 weeks of using this product, my hair loss got worse, my hair became super dry, my scalp developed a rash I still can&#x27;t get under control, and my ends felt fried. I returned this to the store for a refund and do not recommend this. I was told the apple stem cell was sooo good for my hair and scalp and that this was a vegan product. Well, I am just disgusted with it.</li>
            <li> Used regularly every day but no new growth as of yet.  Will give this shampoo more time.  Just hope it works better than straight Rogaine - never saw any growth there either.</li>
            <li> I DO use it with the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; that stops your hair from falling out, too, though.  I find that not only is it helping my hair not to fall out, but if my hair isn&#x27;t too long, it also adds curl to my hair (which is straight as sticks).  I love it!</li>
            <li> I started to notice significant all over hair thinning 4 years ago, most likely due to menopause. I have tried everything to combat this and felt I would never find a solution. Beginning in July 2012, my shedding increased to the point I was removing a handful of hair from the shower daily. Combing my wet hair nearly brought tears to my eyes as each stroke brought 6-12 hairs out in the comb. I shed horribly throughout the day and carried a lint roller to around so I could get the hair off my clothes several times a day. I decided to try this shampoo a month ago at the urging of my stylist. I have been amazed! The shedding has decreased significantly. I remove maybe 10 strands from the shower and no longer find hair on my clothes and furniture. I will continue to buy this product FOREVER! I like the scalp tingle. I use a generous amount and thoroughly massage my scalp. I leave it on while I wash my body and shave my legs and pits, then rinse well. I highly recommend trying it. I&#x27;m hoping to see regrowth soon. My hair looks thicker as evidenced by my very narrow part. Just love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this since April 2012 for hair loss due to side effect from medication.  This shampoo works!</li>
            <li> wonderful for fine hair</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s an awesome product. I love to feel the the minty burn each time I use it.  Seems like it has also helped me with my dandruff problem. Thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> Gives body to my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product since I have fine, slightly thinning hair and because it had good reviews. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now and have not noticed any difference in my hair. As other reviewers have said the product is very tingley and if you have a sensitive scalp it may actually give a burning sensation, I actually enjoyed the tingley feeling, to me it was invigorationg like washing with tee tree shampoo. It smells clean but has a slight medicinal scent also. I will not order this product again.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling really dry. Beyond that I don&#x27;t notice any difference.  Disappointing and unsatisfied.  Thought it would at least give volume.  Not</li>
            <li> Makes my hair much fuller. Love it!</li>
            <li> Hair doesn&#x27;t even look full out of bath let alone reducing hair fall!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Goldwell Color Glow for years, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be sold any more, so I started reading reviews to see what the replacement. After reading all the great reviews, I was really disappointed with what this shampoo did to my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I use a semi-permanent color. This shampoo washed out the color after just a few washings.&lt;br /&gt;2. It made my hair very soft and fly away. This might be a good thing if you have course hair, but if you have hair that naturally dies those things, the shampoo compounds the problem.&lt;br /&gt;3. Thinning hair. I don&#x27;t think it re grows hair so much as it puffs up the hair you have (see number 2) giving the appearance of more volume, but no actual extra volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to searching for a replacement - this stuff is getting tossed.</li>
            <li> Best Shampoo I every had.</li>
            <li> Love the product - it was sent quickly. Many thanks.</li>
            <li> I think this is making my hair thicker volume wise but I&#x27;m still losing hair quite a bit and it also seems to aggravate my very mild psoriasis...like the volume but wouldn&#x27;t mind losing the itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the shampoo was already opened so I was nervous about using it because I didnt know if it had shampoo in it or if something else had been put in the bottle</li>
            <li> This shampoo did absolutely nothing for me. Gave it 2 months of use, made my hair brittle and noticed more hair in the drain.  There are better alternatives out there.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair was falling out and with this product she found it has stopped falling out and leaves her hair soft.</li>
