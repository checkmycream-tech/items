            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Its an amazing moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What IS nice about this product is that it is softer and comes in a nice jar....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for the whole family to use from head to toe.  </li>
            <li>it was too think even when I was trying to warm it with my hand, I gave it to my mom</li>
            <li>believe me i have used them, i have tried all kinds of lotions,oils even made my own lotions</li>
            <li>This is a good quality butter, which spreads and absorbs easily once you rub it between your palms.  </li>
            <li>I realized from some doctors that Shea Butter is what works best and gets absorbed best on dry skin.</li>
            <li>and she loves it too, have used it on other family members skin, even on irritations it is wonderful knocks the itch out quickly, had I known that Shea Butter was this awesome</li>
            <li>It has an ivory color, and I feel good about the fact that it has certified by ASBI, so must be a genuine shea butter.  </li>
            <li>It has superior moisturizing properties, and since it is unrefined, it also has very special and natural ingredients that are ideal for healthier skin.  </li>
            <li>It was such a great quality and worked great as well.</li>
            <li>It was a refined, very smooth shea butter, with no odor unless I wanted a scent blended in with it.</li>
            <li>I love love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this brand of shea butter for over two years and its simply this best.</li>
            <li>It would become more spreadable.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love the stuff.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews and was impressed enough to order it expecting the rave reviews were overstated.  </li>
            <li>This is such an awesome product.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it on my face at night to heal and protect the skin and use all over my body.</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is also good for skin, so this is a useful mixture.</li>
            <li>What she&#x27;d purchased, and what I also bought, was a product that cost over 4 times more than this.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I can still smell the shea butter on my skin and clothes many hours after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else for elbows, heels, knees, hands, cuticles, etc.  </li>
            <li>I searched the net for the best grade of Shea butter to use for my hair and this brand came up in google.</li>
            <li>Will never be without, but make sure you buy the best grade A or above!</li>
            <li>More greasy than moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I love this Shea Butter and will continue to purchase it when this one is all gone, also bought a family member some of this shea butter</li>
            <li>to high-end, many of them contain shea butter.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I started using this product to keep eczema-covered parts of the skin moist, and the product did an ok job -</li>
            <li>Because it has No Impurities, No Chemicals, No Preservatives and No Fragrance, it can also be safely used on the face.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for daily use as a moisturizer \\&quot;par excellence\\&quot; for the face and the body.  </li>
            <li>The shae tree is appropriately named the Karite Tree, which means the \\&quot;Tree Of Life\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I did not want to put any more chemicals on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I believe this shea butter is one of the reasons I am better.  </li>
            <li>It did get on my clothes, but my skin felt so much better while it was healing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is on our \\&quot;reorder\\&quot; list as we ALL love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It does hydrate your skin well, I mostly put it on my legs, thighs, butt, and elbows.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>:) i have been use it for my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need to put more on.</li>
            <li>I am so satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>I used it for pain from RSD and neuropathy for years to avoid taking too many pain medications.  </li>
            <li>Your skin will love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it and my family loves it.</li>
            <li>It is much better quality though.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>This stuff is rich, and water will just bead up on you when you have it on!  </li>
            <li>Shae Butter contains Vitamin A, the one vitamin that is absolutely necessary for healthy and beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li>Since this doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals or oils in it, my face has been in much better condition and is always smooth.</li>
            <li>smells good and melts in your hands, like real butter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed having this Shea Butter in my supplies, and have used it to make wonderful whipped butters and lotions, it is truly a must have year round, the quality of this brand just cant be beat.</li>
            <li>But easy to spread after i rub with my palm..</li>
            <li>Good packaging, good price (w/Prime shipping) &amp; quality/color/scent just what I would have expected.</li>
            <li>and this strong diarrhea smell came pouring out of the tub.</li>
            <li>was strong</li>
            <li>Unrefined shea butter has a strong smell to it.</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly and leaves your skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>I use just a couple of drops of sweet orange oil that makes the Shea Butter scent appealing to even my spouse and children.    </li>
            <li>, I actually think it has a very pleasant scent considering it does not have any added perfume, it&#x27;s actually a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>This brand has always been smooth and extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>lol has a strong nutty smell but its works magic on dry skin ..</li>
            <li>* Shea butter--a nice, creamy concoction, but not the pure, unadulterated product I want and need.</li>
            <li>It is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; for anything skin related and great for my hair also.  </li>
            <li>I like to leave the greasy feel on my skin, but if I am going out, I lightly wipe off the greasy feel and then apply makeup IF I am wearing it.  </li>
            <li>your fingers, then work it well into your palms before you can smooth it into your skin).  </li>
            <li>It needs to be worked a bit in your hands, then it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>and he is now thankfully pain free.  </li>
            <li>I am all ready ordering more because all my girlfriends that I gave samples to want MORE.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I made sure I had gloves on and and emptied the trash right away.   </li>
            <li>The strong smell also disappears quickly.</li>
            <li>Because of the high cost of the refined kind, I stopped using it.</li>
            <li>So I bought the one with a hint of lavender scent, which helps masks its original \\&quot;fatty\\&quot;</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m in love the smell at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found other shea butter that is produced by fair trade, which is a lot more inexpensive than this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, it arrived in perfect condition, well packaged, glad to have a sturdy tub to hold it in, very light yellow/cream color as I expected, and if you are familiar with raw unrefined shea than you&#x27;d expect it to have the distinct nutty scent, which it did.  </li>
            <li>Maybe pure shea butter is not the most practical skin care product to use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a perfect consistency - hard to the touch when it&#x27;s in it&#x27;s container, gotta dig in &amp; scoop it w/</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read on a couple shea butter websites that unrefined shea butter is better for skin because the refining process takes away much of the health benefits of the butter.</li>
            <li>Very emollient and my skin feels fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I started to make my own homemade all natural lotion and put this shea butter in as one of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like this cream more, but I just don&#x27;t care for it too much....</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t smell sweet either.  </li>
            <li>This brand is natural and not gimincky and therefore cost effective.</li>
            <li>I only wanted it because I was told it is good for eczema.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, this would make for a great massage product.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s extraordinary.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve turned on many friends to shea butter &amp; will definately continue using it &amp; will order this particular one again when needed.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and is of Grade-A-quality as advertised.</li>
            <li>It melts quickly and makes it easier to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the 1st application the size and dark color of the bumps have greatly improved.  </li>
            <li>A shea butter is the best you can get,the stuff you buy in stores is refined and not nearly as good</li>
            <li>with the help of topical steriods, or if your eczema is already in decent control (cracked, bleeding, oozing, peeling, all the above) this is a GREAT thing to add to your own treatment.</li>
            <li>Far better to buy 100% shea butter like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Far better to buy 100% shea butter like this.    </li>
            <li>I rubbed a tiny bit on my lips and this butter&#x27;s been far more effective than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely suggest it if you have any kind of skin problems.</li>
            <li>but nonetheless all natural ingredients, for better and faster absorption, from Nature&#x27;s Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice it stays with you until the next day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Shea Butter for several years and this brand is as good as any I&#x27;ve tried and at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>I mix it with essential oils to add a nice scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard and can be easily applied.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased overall with this pure shea butter.</li>
            <li>why it is white in color, and why it is very easy to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily there are plenty of alternatives out there, and I have found that liquid Vitamin E is actually doing a better job on the eczema.</li>
            <li>Having used both, I&#x27;d say the unrefined butter is a little better for my skin, but that&#x27;s not the main reason I&#x27;m buying the unrefined kind.</li>
            <li>I contacted the company and they confirmed it is a new formulation</li>
            <li>Most women, or at least the ones I&#x27;ve met,  tend to like products that smell nice..</li>
            <li>For shea butter thats unrefined, and pure (100%), qualifies it to be well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Yes, kind of like clay or dirt, not especially unpleasant, but definitely earthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also, has worked well on my stomach, where i got stretch marks from just having my first kiddo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time buying shea butter</li>
            <li>This product has me using and coming back for more.</li>
            <li>I had first bought Shea butter from a Renn Fest vendor, where I could see and use the product before buying.</li>
            <li>Although I am sensitive to perfumes and scents, the slightly smoky smell is pleasant and fades quickly.</li>
            <li>I like it because you can create your own cream or hair mask by mixing it with oils or other products</li>
            <li>I found that rolling a small ball, about the size of a large gumball between my palms to warm it up, then I put it in a waterproof container with a screw on lid and run hot water over it (or pop it in a cup full of hot water).  </li>
            <li>I never would have imagined at 58 yrs old that my skin could be this soft, supple and indeed look more youthful.  </li>
            <li>it makes your skin soft definitely ,but its only good as a night cream ,it takes ages to soak in the skin and its greasy ,my pillow is full of greasy spots now..</li>
            <li>This butter has really good texture that smooth than other brand, and the smell is exactly a nuts smell that I believe that the butter did not cook overly; other brand have exactly the overcook oil smell which I can not bear that smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After my pityriasis stop appear on the body, the body would not itchy anymore, but you have to deal with the last step which is to replace the skin as smooth as the original skin, after I apply this butter, the pachylosis that cause by pityriasis would gradually to become smooth like the original skin,but still need few days to recover the skin.</li>
            <li>If you want a nice smelling product then buy a watered down refined version that has none of the healing properties of this one.  </li>
            <li>Because you are scooping out a somewhat dry product, bits of it can fall on your clothes or to the ground (my dogs love it ...</li>
            <li>Luckily Amazon gave me a complete refund.</li>
            <li>There are many uses for it - chapstick, dry hands, eczema, night cream, makeup remover, mosquito bites, sun tan lotion,</li>
            <li>and I wanted something pure to put on my skin.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a large amount to put on your skin.</li>
            <li>I am returning this most recent purchase and hunting for a new brand.</li>
            <li>I rated this item 3 out of 5 stars because as much as i like the effects, the strong scent prevents me from using it in public.</li>
            <li>I use this product on my hair and its very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>So, saving $22 before taxes, I tried this product instead and was very pleased!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a real greasy feel to it when it melts in your hands.  </li>
            <li>It is grainy, and has a VERY earthy smell.</li>
            <li>The color of the more expensive kind is closer to that of the second jar, the odor is closer to that of the first jar, and the consistency is more squishy and spreadable than both, but similar to the first.</li>
            <li>The color of the more expensive kind is closer to that of the second jar, the odor is closer to that of the first jar, and the consistency is more squishy and spreadable than both, but similar to the first.</li>
            <li>I read hundreds of reviews for Shea Butter before purchasing &amp; took into account packaging, seller reviews, quality &amp; color of the shea butter, and finally decided to go with this one (AAA Shea Butter, 1 LB &#x3D; $25 w/Prime free shipping).  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin moisturized through the whole day</li>
            <li>along with Argan Oil, also from this company, they have faded twice as fast as i&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>This product had a very rancid smell and a sticky texture.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like the texture of this shea butter</li>
            <li>This 100% Unrefined Grade A Shae Butter with the ASBI Seal is a high quality product!  </li>
            <li>me, I prefer to invest natural products that helps to improve the beauty of body from inside to outside.tch the process through youtube, you will know that it is worth, and know how treasure the butter</li>
            <li>I am so so very thankful for this shea butter</li>
            <li>Petroleum Jelly is very greasy compared to this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much one can trust the \\&quot;certified\\&quot; statement.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s greasy for a bit if you put too much on.  </li>
            <li>, people have been stopping hiim and telling him \\&quot;your skin looks really</li>
            <li>The smokey smell really does go away after about 30 mins but the moisture does NOT</li>
            <li>Works very well to soften hands and feet, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>bought one jar of this unrefined shea butter, and liked it enough to buy a second jar.</li>
            <li>I bought one jar of this unrefined shea butter, and liked it enough to buy a second jar.</li>
            <li>My eczema got worse before it got better, but it is now better.  </li>
            <li>It is also very effective when used to help heal rashes, miner wounds, and other dry skin conditions.  </li>
            <li>First, the helpful tip: To thin the paste and make it much more spreadable, I put a dab of the paste onto my left hand, then dripped some jojoba oil over it, then rubbed the stuff between my palms.. much better!</li>
            <li>line, I was dismayed at the number of different products advertised as Shea butter; although I read many reviews, my first order was a product that only *contained</li>
            <li>True, the scent of the raw shea butter is strong and nutty.</li>
            <li>Although the contents of the second jar differ somewhat from the first, I have found the shea butter contained in both jars to be useful.       </li>
            <li>I mix this product with other hair oils because the smell isn&#x27;t my favorite but very healthy for my thick, kinky curly hair.</li>
            <li>I love this shea butter so much, I bought some shea butter from different company in amazon, but still, I choose to come back to this brand and this butter.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for my hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a fountain of youth for my skin, sun spots are fading fast, wrinkles softened, lips plumper and it makes minor abrasions heal so quickly and without scarring.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>A high quality product.  </li>
            <li>She highly recommends this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended. A+++</li>
            <li>I also completely changed my diet to organic, whole foods.  </li>
            <li>Not repellant, just very earthy and natural.</li>
            <li>A few months ago, I decided to try to find a better deal on shea butter, and was browsing here on Amazon, and found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I talked to my doctor recently, and he strongly recommended not using such lotions, because they contain alcohol, which dries skin.</li>

            <li>I recently purchased Shea Butter from Sheabutter Hut and it smelled like cigarette smoke, I knew something wasn&#x27;t right about that.</li>
            <li>I was not aware at the time that unrefined, cheaper butter was available.</li>
            <li>the quality of this shea better is a lot better than the yellow butter, this butter cost more due to the quality, so I only use it on my face and as a spot treatment for other areas of my body  because it is pricey, and I have seen dark spots disappear, and even my skin tone on my face.</li>
            <li>&quot; The same method applies here-- Scoop a little bit and warm it up between your palms with some lotion or oil.</li>
            <li>so I can live with that(I</li>
            <li>I am eating more raw, juicing and have taken out a lot of the processed sugar and flour from my diet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the more expensive kind is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the more expensive kind is worth the money.</li>
            <li>The butter in the second jar is practically solid, more grainy and dry, and I really have to dig my finger into the stuff.</li>
            <li>The butter in the second jar is practically solid, more grainy and dry, and I really have to dig my finger into the stuff.</li>
            <li>consistency of the shea butter in the first jar was squishier than that of the second jar.  </li>
            <li>color of the butter in the first jar was darker than the second, and, the butter in the first jar had a stronger and slightly different smell to it.</li>
            <li>Although the contents of the second jar differ somewhat from the first, I have found the shea butter contained in both jars to be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>color of the butter in the first jar was darker than the second, and, the butter in the first jar had a stronger and slightly different smell to it.</li>
            <li>I tried to ask further questions about getting the original one and distinguishing between them, but received no further answers.</li>
            <li>I only wore it the first week after i bought it.</li>
            <li>I have skin that is not only acne-prone, but also gets dry easily.</li>
            <li>Now that I can buy it by the pound I use it as an all-over moisturizer every morning and keep small quantities handy to use throughout the day, especially after hand-washing.</li>
            <li>As for consistency - you have to take a little bit, rub it between your hands until it melts completely, then it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>She loves that it&#x27;s all natural and makes her skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the typical lotions such as Aveeno and Vaseline Intensive Care and so forth for over 2 decades, and although those products made my skin feel better, and were an improvement over using nothing, my skin was still quite flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the third large 1 lb.</li>
            <li>I used it to make my own body cream using other products and it came out creamy, but was slightly grainy, but that was not a problem for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a product which clearly provided visible improvement to my skin ...</li>
            <li>I ordered this product hoping it would clear up my keratosis pilaris on my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li>The tub is now clear, the shea butter is creamy.</li>
            <li>ULTRA-MOISTURISING HAND THERAPY because that was the only thing that really helped my hand from cracking and bleeding in the winter time.</li>
            <li>to 3 years old.  </li>
            <li>I use the Shea Butter on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>The jojoba oil does have a bit of a noticeable odor though, but again, as far as I can tell, the smell fades.</li>
            <li>Similar to dandruff, but over much of my body.</li>
            <li>Also, those lotions are loaded with chemicals concocted in labs, and I&#x27;d rather use a natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>shea butter doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of the skin flakes</li>
            <li>Also, those lotions are loaded with chemicals concocted in labs, and I&#x27;d rather use a natural product.     </li>
            <li>The shea butter doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of the skin flakes</li>
            <li>It is naturally hypoallergenic.  </li>
            <li>Since the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be dated, there is no way to know if this is because it is old.</li>
            <li>I must say the gift from natural always done well than chemical</li>
            <li>We also mix it with coconut oil to make an all natural sun tan lotion.  </li>
            <li>If you dislike the smell but still want to be able to use the Shea Butter for its benefits you can add a few drops of essential oil to completely conceal the scent (use caution when adding oils that can burn the skin).</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I will buy from amazon instead of my local whole foods store.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>My only downfall is that it&#x27;s very grainy even after emulsifying it in my hands.  </li>
            <li>The unrefined shea butter is darker in color (looks more natural) and feels sort of like clay or a thick paste.</li>
            <li>so you can tell how dry the skin is; then I got pityriasis that made me very very itchy that wanna scratch the pityriasis; and I bought 5 of anti-itchy cream from safeway, those cream can help to control the pityriasis, but those cream can not recover the skin from pityriasis,just can control</li>
            <li>my wet skin and the shea butter just soaks the water right up and into my skin</li>
            <li>Shea Butter is the REAL DEAL: thick, grainy, rich.</li>
            <li>The smell from the second jar is less strong.     </li>
            <li>It feels a bit rich &amp; oily for just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>There were several differences between the contents of the first and second jars.</li>
            <li>There were several differences between the contents of the first and second jars.</li>
            <li>They sold it in small quantities which was okay at the time as I only used it as a night moisturizer for my super-dry</li>
            <li>Although every batch is a little different due to the  shea seeds that we use to make shea butter.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the owner did not offer to remedy the problem on his own, I asked if my \\&quot;bad\\&quot; batch could be replaced.</li>
            <li>I have no doubt that this is high quality and pure, but applying it to the skin is not very easy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write reviews and am not much on grammar, so please understand I really feel this product is worth the effort to let other people know</li>
            <li>I thought it was suppose to smell nutty and pleasant not like a babies dirty diaper.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need no other moisturizer.</li>
            <li>After a major surgery, I rubbed it all over the incision for a month.</li>
            <li>This premium Shae Butter has a mild pale yellow color, and spreads just like soft and creamy bar butter at room temperature.  </li>
            <li>I was trying to find an unrefined shea butter, so it seemed that the reviews for the product are generally good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The stuff I got, though, was of a harder consistency, which I did not care for much, but the quality seemed to be on par with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Take a bit of it, put it on the palm of your hand, and rub it in between your palms until you get it soft enough to spread on your body.</li>
            <li>Take a bit of it, put it on the palm of your hand, and rub it in between your palms until you get it soft enough to spread on your body.</li>
            <li>you can use a tiny bit of this on hair ends if they are split and it will make your hair shiney and soft.</li>
            <li>It sinks straight in.</li>
            <li>me, I prefer to invest natural products that helps to improve the beauty of body from inside to outside.</li>
            <li>I actually had to completely melt the butter before whipping it as semi-liquid didn&#x27;t get rid of the grainy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I am tired of not being able to trust where my products are coming from.  </li>
            <li>The mint oil mixed in does make the shea butter made by the other company a little more soothing, but not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>recently did a little more homework, and bought some other shea butter creams, which are not 100% shea butter</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural, color-free, fragrance-free, preservative-free, and otherwise chemical free; and as the other reviewers have previously stated, the nutty smell goes away shortly after rubbing it into the skin.  </li>
            <li>In amonth, I&#x27;ve used up 3/4&#x27;s of the jar due to using too much in the beginning.  </li>
            <li>It smells very smoky due to the way it is produced.</li>
            <li>The refined white shea butter I bought earlier is far too expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so unless your skin is as bad as mine, you only have to use a tiny amount to get great coverage.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin very nourished &amp; also gets rid of dark spots on the skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Today i just remember, that when the first time i open the jar, the content was not full, there is a hole like the egg size..</li>
            <li>What is also nice is that it is not terrifically hard; it does not take a ton of effort to dig a small amount out to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it did not help with the eczema, but kept the skin moisturized about the same as any other decent moisturizing product (i.e., nothing \\&quot;special\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is hard to apply, but what it does for the skin it is well worth it.</li>

            <li> was strong</li>
            <li> Unrefined shea butter has a strong smell to it.</li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly and leaves your skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> I use just a couple of drops of sweet orange oil that makes the Shea Butter scent appealing to even my spouse and children.    </li>
            <li> , I actually think it has a very pleasant scent considering it does not have any added perfume, it&#x27;s actually a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This brand has always been smooth and extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> lol has a strong nutty smell but its works magic on dry skin ..</li>
            <li> * Shea butter--a nice, creamy concoction, but not the pure, unadulterated product I want and need.</li>
            <li> It is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; for anything skin related and great for my hair also.  </li>
            <li> I like to leave the greasy feel on my skin, but if I am going out, I lightly wipe off the greasy feel and then apply makeup IF I am wearing it.  </li>
            <li> your fingers, then work it well into your palms before you can smooth it into your skin).  </li>
            <li> It needs to be worked a bit in your hands, then it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> and he is now thankfully pain free.  </li>
            <li> I am all ready ordering more because all my girlfriends that I gave samples to want MORE.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I made sure I had gloves on and and emptied the trash right away.   </li>
            <li> The strong smell also disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> Because of the high cost of the refined kind, I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> So I bought the one with a hint of lavender scent, which helps masks its original \\&quot;fatty\\&quot;</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m in love the smell at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found other shea butter that is produced by fair trade, which is a lot more inexpensive than this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did, it arrived in perfect condition, well packaged, glad to have a sturdy tub to hold it in, very light yellow/cream color as I expected, and if you are familiar with raw unrefined shea than you&#x27;d expect it to have the distinct nutty scent, which it did.  </li>
            <li> Maybe pure shea butter is not the most practical skin care product to use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a perfect consistency - hard to the touch when it&#x27;s in it&#x27;s container, gotta dig in &amp; scoop it w/</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read on a couple shea butter websites that unrefined shea butter is better for skin because the refining process takes away much of the health benefits of the butter.</li>
            <li> Very emollient and my skin feels fantastic!</li>
            <li> and I started to make my own homemade all natural lotion and put this shea butter in as one of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like this cream more, but I just don&#x27;t care for it too much....</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t smell sweet either.  </li>
            <li> This brand is natural and not gimincky and therefore cost effective.</li>
            <li> I only wanted it because I was told it is good for eczema.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, this would make for a great massage product.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s extraordinary.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve turned on many friends to shea butter &amp; will definately continue using it &amp; will order this particular one again when needed.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and is of Grade-A-quality as advertised.</li>
            <li> It melts quickly and makes it easier to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the 1st application the size and dark color of the bumps have greatly improved.  </li>
            <li> A shea butter is the best you can get,the stuff you buy in stores is refined and not nearly as good</li>
            <li> with the help of topical steriods, or if your eczema is already in decent control (cracked, bleeding, oozing, peeling, all the above) this is a GREAT thing to add to your own treatment.</li>
            <li> Far better to buy 100% shea butter like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Far better to buy 100% shea butter like this.    </li>
            <li> I rubbed a tiny bit on my lips and this butter&#x27;s been far more effective than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely suggest it if you have any kind of skin problems.</li>
            <li> but nonetheless all natural ingredients, for better and faster absorption, from Nature&#x27;s Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice it stays with you until the next day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shea Butter for several years and this brand is as good as any I&#x27;ve tried and at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> I mix it with essential oils to add a nice scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard and can be easily applied.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased overall with this pure shea butter.</li>
            <li> why it is white in color, and why it is very easy to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily there are plenty of alternatives out there, and I have found that liquid Vitamin E is actually doing a better job on the eczema.</li>
            <li> Having used both, I&#x27;d say the unrefined butter is a little better for my skin, but that&#x27;s not the main reason I&#x27;m buying the unrefined kind.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company and they confirmed it is a new formulation</li>
            <li> Most women, or at least the ones I&#x27;ve met,  tend to like products that smell nice..</li>
            <li> For shea butter thats unrefined, and pure (100%), qualifies it to be well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Yes, kind of like clay or dirt, not especially unpleasant, but definitely earthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also, has worked well on my stomach, where i got stretch marks from just having my first kiddo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time buying shea butter</li>
            <li> This product has me using and coming back for more.</li>
            <li> I had first bought Shea butter from a Renn Fest vendor, where I could see and use the product before buying.</li>
            <li> Although I am sensitive to perfumes and scents, the slightly smoky smell is pleasant and fades quickly.</li>
            <li> I like it because you can create your own cream or hair mask by mixing it with oils or other products</li>
            <li> I found that rolling a small ball, about the size of a large gumball between my palms to warm it up, then I put it in a waterproof container with a screw on lid and run hot water over it (or pop it in a cup full of hot water).  </li>
            <li> I never would have imagined at 58 yrs old that my skin could be this soft, supple and indeed look more youthful.  </li>
            <li> it makes your skin soft definitely ,but its only good as a night cream ,it takes ages to soak in the skin and its greasy ,my pillow is full of greasy spots now..</li>
            <li> This butter has really good texture that smooth than other brand, and the smell is exactly a nuts smell that I believe that the butter did not cook overly; other brand have exactly the overcook oil smell which I can not bear that smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After my pityriasis stop appear on the body, the body would not itchy anymore, but you have to deal with the last step which is to replace the skin as smooth as the original skin, after I apply this butter, the pachylosis that cause by pityriasis would gradually to become smooth like the original skin,but still need few days to recover the skin.</li>
            <li> If you want a nice smelling product then buy a watered down refined version that has none of the healing properties of this one.  </li>
            <li> Because you are scooping out a somewhat dry product, bits of it can fall on your clothes or to the ground (my dogs love it ...</li>
            <li> Luckily Amazon gave me a complete refund.</li>
            <li> There are many uses for it - chapstick, dry hands, eczema, night cream, makeup remover, mosquito bites, sun tan lotion,</li>
            <li> and I wanted something pure to put on my skin.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a large amount to put on your skin.</li>
            <li> I am returning this most recent purchase and hunting for a new brand.</li>
            <li> I rated this item 3 out of 5 stars because as much as i like the effects, the strong scent prevents me from using it in public.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my hair and its very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> So, saving $22 before taxes, I tried this product instead and was very pleased!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a real greasy feel to it when it melts in your hands.  </li>
            <li> It is grainy, and has a VERY earthy smell.</li>
            <li> The color of the more expensive kind is closer to that of the second jar, the odor is closer to that of the first jar, and the consistency is more squishy and spreadable than both, but similar to the first.</li>
            <li> The color of the more expensive kind is closer to that of the second jar, the odor is closer to that of the first jar, and the consistency is more squishy and spreadable than both, but similar to the first.</li>
            <li> I read hundreds of reviews for Shea Butter before purchasing &amp; took into account packaging, seller reviews, quality &amp; color of the shea butter, and finally decided to go with this one (AAA Shea Butter, 1 LB &#x3D; $25 w/Prime free shipping).  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin moisturized through the whole day</li>
            <li> along with Argan Oil, also from this company, they have faded twice as fast as i&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> This product had a very rancid smell and a sticky texture.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the texture of this shea butter</li>
            <li> This 100% Unrefined Grade A Shae Butter with the ASBI Seal is a high quality product!  </li>
            <li> me, I prefer to invest natural products that helps to improve the beauty of body from inside to outside.tch the process through youtube, you will know that it is worth, and know how treasure the butter</li>
            <li> I am so so very thankful for this shea butter</li>
            <li> Petroleum Jelly is very greasy compared to this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much one can trust the \\&quot;certified\\&quot; statement.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s greasy for a bit if you put too much on.  </li>
            <li> , people have been stopping hiim and telling him \\&quot;your skin looks really</li>
            <li> The smokey smell really does go away after about 30 mins but the moisture does NOT</li>
            <li> Works very well to soften hands and feet, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> bought one jar of this unrefined shea butter, and liked it enough to buy a second jar.</li>
            <li> I bought one jar of this unrefined shea butter, and liked it enough to buy a second jar.</li>
            <li> My eczema got worse before it got better, but it is now better.  </li>
            <li> It is also very effective when used to help heal rashes, miner wounds, and other dry skin conditions.  </li>
            <li> First, the helpful tip: To thin the paste and make it much more spreadable, I put a dab of the paste onto my left hand, then dripped some jojoba oil over it, then rubbed the stuff between my palms.. much better!</li>
            <li> line, I was dismayed at the number of different products advertised as Shea butter; although I read many reviews, my first order was a product that only *contained</li>
            <li> True, the scent of the raw shea butter is strong and nutty.</li>
            <li> Although the contents of the second jar differ somewhat from the first, I have found the shea butter contained in both jars to be useful.       </li>
            <li> I mix this product with other hair oils because the smell isn&#x27;t my favorite but very healthy for my thick, kinky curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter so much, I bought some shea butter from different company in amazon, but still, I choose to come back to this brand and this butter.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a fountain of youth for my skin, sun spots are fading fast, wrinkles softened, lips plumper and it makes minor abrasions heal so quickly and without scarring.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> A high quality product.  </li>
            <li> She highly recommends this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended. A+++</li>
            <li> I also completely changed my diet to organic, whole foods.  </li>
            <li> Not repellant, just very earthy and natural.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I decided to try to find a better deal on shea butter, and was browsing here on Amazon, and found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I talked to my doctor recently, and he strongly recommended not using such lotions, because they contain alcohol, which dries skin.</li>

            <li> I recently purchased Shea Butter from Sheabutter Hut and it smelled like cigarette smoke, I knew something wasn&#x27;t right about that.</li>
            <li> I was not aware at the time that unrefined, cheaper butter was available.</li>
            <li> the quality of this shea better is a lot better than the yellow butter, this butter cost more due to the quality, so I only use it on my face and as a spot treatment for other areas of my body  because it is pricey, and I have seen dark spots disappear, and even my skin tone on my face.</li>
            <li> &quot; The same method applies here-- Scoop a little bit and warm it up between your palms with some lotion or oil.</li>
            <li> so I can live with that(I</li>
            <li> I am eating more raw, juicing and have taken out a lot of the processed sugar and flour from my diet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the more expensive kind is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the more expensive kind is worth the money.</li>
            <li> The butter in the second jar is practically solid, more grainy and dry, and I really have to dig my finger into the stuff.</li>
            <li> The butter in the second jar is practically solid, more grainy and dry, and I really have to dig my finger into the stuff.</li>
            <li> consistency of the shea butter in the first jar was squishier than that of the second jar.  </li>
            <li> color of the butter in the first jar was darker than the second, and, the butter in the first jar had a stronger and slightly different smell to it.</li>
            <li> Although the contents of the second jar differ somewhat from the first, I have found the shea butter contained in both jars to be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> color of the butter in the first jar was darker than the second, and, the butter in the first jar had a stronger and slightly different smell to it.</li>
            <li> I tried to ask further questions about getting the original one and distinguishing between them, but received no further answers.</li>
            <li> I only wore it the first week after i bought it.</li>
            <li> I have skin that is not only acne-prone, but also gets dry easily.</li>
            <li> Now that I can buy it by the pound I use it as an all-over moisturizer every morning and keep small quantities handy to use throughout the day, especially after hand-washing.</li>
            <li> As for consistency - you have to take a little bit, rub it between your hands until it melts completely, then it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> She loves that it&#x27;s all natural and makes her skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the typical lotions such as Aveeno and Vaseline Intensive Care and so forth for over 2 decades, and although those products made my skin feel better, and were an improvement over using nothing, my skin was still quite flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the third large 1 lb.</li>
            <li> I used it to make my own body cream using other products and it came out creamy, but was slightly grainy, but that was not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a product which clearly provided visible improvement to my skin ...</li>
            <li> I ordered this product hoping it would clear up my keratosis pilaris on my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> The tub is now clear, the shea butter is creamy.</li>
            <li> ULTRA-MOISTURISING HAND THERAPY because that was the only thing that really helped my hand from cracking and bleeding in the winter time.</li>
            <li> to 3 years old.  </li>
            <li> I use the Shea Butter on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> The jojoba oil does have a bit of a noticeable odor though, but again, as far as I can tell, the smell fades.</li>
            <li> Similar to dandruff, but over much of my body.</li>
            <li> Also, those lotions are loaded with chemicals concocted in labs, and I&#x27;d rather use a natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> shea butter doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of the skin flakes</li>
            <li> Also, those lotions are loaded with chemicals concocted in labs, and I&#x27;d rather use a natural product.     </li>
            <li> The shea butter doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of the skin flakes</li>
            <li> It is naturally hypoallergenic.  </li>
            <li> Since the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be dated, there is no way to know if this is because it is old.</li>
            <li> I must say the gift from natural always done well than chemical</li>
            <li> We also mix it with coconut oil to make an all natural sun tan lotion.  </li>
            <li> If you dislike the smell but still want to be able to use the Shea Butter for its benefits you can add a few drops of essential oil to completely conceal the scent (use caution when adding oils that can burn the skin).</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I will buy from amazon instead of my local whole foods store.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> My only downfall is that it&#x27;s very grainy even after emulsifying it in my hands.  </li>
            <li> The unrefined shea butter is darker in color (looks more natural) and feels sort of like clay or a thick paste.</li>
            <li> so you can tell how dry the skin is; then I got pityriasis that made me very very itchy that wanna scratch the pityriasis; and I bought 5 of anti-itchy cream from safeway, those cream can help to control the pityriasis, but those cream can not recover the skin from pityriasis,just can control</li>
            <li> my wet skin and the shea butter just soaks the water right up and into my skin</li>
            <li> Shea Butter is the REAL DEAL: thick, grainy, rich.</li>
            <li> The smell from the second jar is less strong.     </li>
            <li> It feels a bit rich &amp; oily for just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> There were several differences between the contents of the first and second jars.</li>
            <li> There were several differences between the contents of the first and second jars.</li>
            <li> They sold it in small quantities which was okay at the time as I only used it as a night moisturizer for my super-dry</li>
            <li> Although every batch is a little different due to the  shea seeds that we use to make shea butter.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the owner did not offer to remedy the problem on his own, I asked if my \\&quot;bad\\&quot; batch could be replaced.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that this is high quality and pure, but applying it to the skin is not very easy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews and am not much on grammar, so please understand I really feel this product is worth the effort to let other people know</li>
            <li> I thought it was suppose to smell nutty and pleasant not like a babies dirty diaper.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need no other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After a major surgery, I rubbed it all over the incision for a month.</li>
            <li> This premium Shae Butter has a mild pale yellow color, and spreads just like soft and creamy bar butter at room temperature.  </li>
            <li> I was trying to find an unrefined shea butter, so it seemed that the reviews for the product are generally good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stuff I got, though, was of a harder consistency, which I did not care for much, but the quality seemed to be on par with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Take a bit of it, put it on the palm of your hand, and rub it in between your palms until you get it soft enough to spread on your body.</li>
            <li> Take a bit of it, put it on the palm of your hand, and rub it in between your palms until you get it soft enough to spread on your body.</li>
            <li> you can use a tiny bit of this on hair ends if they are split and it will make your hair shiney and soft.</li>
            <li> It sinks straight in.</li>
            <li> me, I prefer to invest natural products that helps to improve the beauty of body from inside to outside.</li>
            <li> I actually had to completely melt the butter before whipping it as semi-liquid didn&#x27;t get rid of the grainy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I am tired of not being able to trust where my products are coming from.  </li>
            <li> The mint oil mixed in does make the shea butter made by the other company a little more soothing, but not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> recently did a little more homework, and bought some other shea butter creams, which are not 100% shea butter</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural, color-free, fragrance-free, preservative-free, and otherwise chemical free; and as the other reviewers have previously stated, the nutty smell goes away shortly after rubbing it into the skin.  </li>
            <li> In amonth, I&#x27;ve used up 3/4&#x27;s of the jar due to using too much in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> It smells very smoky due to the way it is produced.</li>
            <li> The refined white shea butter I bought earlier is far too expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so unless your skin is as bad as mine, you only have to use a tiny amount to get great coverage.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin very nourished &amp; also gets rid of dark spots on the skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Today i just remember, that when the first time i open the jar, the content was not full, there is a hole like the egg size..</li>
            <li> What is also nice is that it is not terrifically hard; it does not take a ton of effort to dig a small amount out to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it did not help with the eczema, but kept the skin moisturized about the same as any other decent moisturizing product (i.e., nothing \\&quot;special\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is hard to apply, but what it does for the skin it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Plain lotion wears off after such a short time, and in the winter you really need a thicker emolient.</li>
            <li> I had this dry spot on my finger that resembled a callus but was not, I applied Shea Butter on that spot for a few days and it is almost gone, wowwww fast !</li>
            <li> I would of purchased it many months ago, as I get severe eczema on my hands, shea butter is doing wonders for that too, and you know it makes your skin so soft just like baby&#x27;s skin, just as other reviewers or descriptions have promised it does, you won&#x27;t be sorry with your purchase of Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Until the economy went flat</li>
            <li> Peppermint is soothing, and even though I am a guy, I am not especially stoked about the natural shea smell, so I bought a small container of unrefined shea butter (made by a different company) with peppermint mixed in.</li>
            <li> Its characteristic smell, \\&quot;nutty\\&quot;, is not offensive and dissipates after a short while.  </li>
            <li> I think the shea butter may have been mixed with something, but definitely was not pure.</li>
            <li> Once I dig some out, the butter from the second jar isn&#x27;t harder</li>
            <li> Once I dig some out, the butter from the second jar isn&#x27;t harder to spread.     </li>
            <li> , I can still feel the butter on my skin in the evening after a long day.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve had them for a long time</li>
            <li> I live in the very harsh dry climate of AZ, so</li>
            <li> The crows feet around my eyes are diminished and my lips no longer feel dry</li>
            <li> I have severe dry skin and in an attempt to stave off the pain and itchiness the dry winter causes me</li>
            <li> Even for my dry hands, I can feel the difference.</li>
            <li> jar we&#x27;ve purchased, and we found this one to be a bit dry and crumbly.  </li>
            <li> I use it almost daily and especially if I am in dry climate.</li>
            <li> Also ordered the 1oz which I keep by my kitchen sink for my dry hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had very very dry flaky skin for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I bought this to moisturize myself to avoid striations or any other skin problem, but it is very unpractical, hard to put on, it takes a lot to dry</li>
            <li> The smell from the second jar is less</li>
            <li> As you can see, I previously stated that this was the only brand for me.</li>
            <li> This is my second time around purchasing this product and I am not interested in purchasing any other brand.</li>
            <li> The only other negative I&#x27;ve encountered is that because it is solid, you scoop the shea butter in your hand to have it essentially melt.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> It was a little pricey and as a result of that I might  look for something cheaper next time.</li>
            <li> Especially when it&#x27;s a little colder</li>
            <li> Recently I had the same experience as another reviewer, as the content of the container was hard and could not be applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shea smell is still there, although the mint smell does disguise it some.. actually not much..  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of comments of looking \\&quot;radiant\\&quot; and \\&quot;well-rested\\&quot; in the last few weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s IMPOSSIBLE for a first time buyer to purchase true, real, raw shea butter online</li>
            <li> I have used products with Shea butter in it but never pure Shea butter.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Interestingly, while I think this Shea Butter smells slightly nutty and unoffensive, two of my children think it smells bad and my spouse thinks it smells rancid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pulled a star off, however, due to price.  </li>
            <li> other stuff I&#x27;ve ordered comes in bags.  </li>
            <li> read other reviews about the smell before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is normal, or poor quality</li>
            <li> other differences..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is normal, or poor quality control.     </li>
            <li> The other differences..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Lac-Hydrin (per dermatologist rec), cocoa butter among other lotions and nothing&#x27;s worked.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is too greasy as some of the other reviewers said.</li>
            <li> and this works wonders on skin scars, moisturizing and all the other benefits it mentions.</li>
            <li> some people, it might be a little bit expensive, but after you watch the process through youtube, you will know that it is worth, and know how treasure the butter</li>
            <li> I read some of reviews from other brand&#x27;s shea butter, one of reviewer said the butter has some dark nut shell</li>
            <li> The result is totally out of my expectation, it is just only few days than I thought it need to take at least few weeks to recover.</li>
            <li> you know it&#x27;s not easy to deal w/constant dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit anxious, so I used low defrost heat in the microwave just to take the chill off &amp; make it pliable (at everyday room temp in my bathroom</li>
            <li> It really helps with itching and burning, soothes chapped lips and cheeks from cold wind, helps with minor burns and scrapes.</li>
            <li> I have read several negative comments regarding the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> Because it is thick, it may leave a white looking reside which eventually  melts.</li>
            <li> After 10 yrs of trying everything for my heal fissures, shea butter has almost healed them completely in less than 2 months.</li>
            <li> I did notice there is a slight scent but don&#x27;t find it offensive.      </li>
            <li> have noticed a lot less redness on a scar of a surger I had May 2010</li>
            <li> As my skin also is affected by hyperpigmentation my KP bumps are also dark little spots.  </li>
            <li> and the smell was nutty but not bad bad like some reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another reason is why I love this butter, I had pityriasis few weeks ago, you will never imagine how terrible it is, when you suddenly got a lot of it, you will wanna cry!  </li>
            <li> The texture is thick (imagine butter) and it leaves skin greasy and I have to wait a long time before I can put clothes on.</li>
            <li> I end up being too lazy to use this and used other lotions (which contains some shea butter).</li>
            <li> I had pityriasis due to my laziness that I dont usually apply lotion on body after shower, and here is -7 degree..</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that I spent money on this when I&#x27;ve gotten better shea butter for way cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have been steadily buying this for the last 4 years or so and have never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> , i try to apply to my skin, yes its feel sticky lil bit, and the smell just like smoke, and the butter really thick solid hard...</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Meant this size container on my previous review!</li>
            <li> Not a strong smell, but there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, it is not easy to spread around, which reminds me of \\&quot;Lamer cream.\\</li>
            <li> the overly expensive refined shea butter I bought awhile back and the cheaper unrefined butter I am reviewing do help my skin.</li>
            <li> I almost never use the usual lotions anymore.</li>
            <li> Both the overly expensive refined shea butter I bought awhile back and the cheaper unrefined butter I am reviewing</li>
            <li> I almost never use the usual lotions anymore.</li>
            <li> with moisture gloves and socks, i was able to heal the worst of my sores in a matter of days instead of weeks.     </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve had no more breakouts since using it</li>
            <li> So I sent another note and received the following note: \\&quot;Sorry for the delay, when was your product purchased?</li>
            <li> Apparently, different people perceive the smell of Shea Butter differently, and just because you may dislike the odor it doesn&#x27;t mean the Shea Butter is bad.</li>
            <li> Have to push hard to get any out.</li>
            <li> Have to push hard to get any out.</li>
            <li> It was hard as a rock when i purchase it.  </li>
            <li> The butter was too thick and hard to use--actually it is quite hard.</li>
            <li> Now for the negative ...</li>
            <li> The stuff works and this brand seems to have the least odor and contamination.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Alrighty, Here&#x27;s how you use this rather thick triple A shea butter stuff..</li>
            <li> It is thick, it does have a smell to it, it does keep the skin lubricated.  </li>
            <li> And by that I mean it smells like if you had been standing around a smokey campfire in your backyard</li>
            <li> At the point of this writing I&#x27;ve been applying it to my face every time I wash it and my body every time I have a shower for approximately the past month.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the yellow shea butter I got at the store, the smell is not so bad (it eventually goes).</li>
            <li> because 1st, it&#x27;s as hard as a rock!</li>
            <li> not great.  </li>
            <li> , I must say that the manufacturer did not do well with the products which is included unnecessary ingredients inside the product; but anyway this product has done well with the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found this supplier and have ordered from them for approximately 6 or 7 years.  </li>
            <li> Alas, my RennFest vendor had lost his supplier and had none for sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was cold weather when I received it, so in transit the butter was very hard upon arrival.  </li>
            <li> stars instead of 5, because of smell, somewhat difficult to spread, some product inconsistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Four stars instead of 5, because of smell, somewhat difficult to spread, some product inconsistency.    </li>
            <li> It still smells the same, awful!!!  </li>
            <li> To this date, the owner has not responded nor replaced the flawed product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has a faint smokey smell, like the shea butter that I had purchased from another supplier.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I emailed the owner of the company (Curtis Hayes) about the problem and inquired if any changes had been made to their production process and the email I received said, \\&quot;I am very sorry for the problem that you have had with this batch of shea butter, but to answer your question we have not changed anything in our production process; and are still using grade A Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sad that this one has changed.</li>
            <li> Today my scars are nearly impossible to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nuttie and don&#x27;t smell bad to me.</li>
            <li> still give it 3 stars, because I don&#x27;t hate it, and I&#x27;m still using it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was trying to find an unrefined shea butter, so it seemed that the reviews for the product are generally good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very nice quality--of course it has the unrefined shea butter smell.  What is also nice is that it is not terrifically hard; it does not take a ton of effort to dig a small amount out to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pulled a star off, however, due to price.  I&#x27;ve found other shea butter that is produced by fair trade, which is a lot more inexpensive than this product.  The stuff I got, though, was of a harder consistency, which I did not care for much, but the quality seemed to be on par with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What IS nice about this product is that it is softer and comes in a nice jar....other stuff I&#x27;ve ordered comes in bags.  I would order both, probably, because I like to keep the containers that the AAA Shea Butter comes in.</li>
            <li> I love love this product. I use this product on my hair and its very moisturizing. I have been using this brand of shea butter for over two years and its simply this best. For shea butter thats unrefined, and pure (100%), qualifies it to be well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed having this Shea Butter in my supplies, and have used it to make wonderful whipped butters and lotions, it is truly a must have year round, the quality of this brand just cant be beat.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin. I started using Crabtree &amp; Evelyn&#x27;s GARDENERS ULTRA-MOISTURISING HAND THERAPY because that was the only thing that really helped my hand from cracking and bleeding in the winter time. I realized from some doctors that Shea Butter is what works best and gets absorbed best on dry skin. So, saving $22 before taxes, I tried this product instead and was very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read other reviews about the smell before. So I bought the one with a hint of lavender scent, which helps masks its original \\&quot;fatty\\&quot; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is best used at night when going to bed because it could leave your hands feeling a bit greasy. Also, it is not easy to spread around, which reminds me of \\&quot;Lamer cream.\\&quot; The same method applies here-- Scoop a little bit and warm it up between your palms with some lotion or oil. It would become more spreadable. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. Highly recommend it. I like it because you can create your own cream or hair mask by mixing it with oils or other products, the result was really great when I mix it with oils for my hair.</li>
            <li> Now that I have been using unrefined shea butter for a couple of months, I can&#x27;t imagine my household being without it.  It is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; for anything skin related and great for my hair also.  It&#x27;s like a fountain of youth for my skin, sun spots are fading fast, wrinkles softened, lips plumper and it makes minor abrasions heal so quickly and without scarring. My heals had cracks that were so deep that they constantly hurt. After 10 yrs of trying everything for my heal fissures, shea butter has almost healed them completely in less than 2 months. I also like to massage with it because it seems to ease pain.   Love, love, love the stuff.  I am all ready ordering more because all my girlfriends that I gave samples to want MORE.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews and am not much on grammar, so please understand I really feel this product is worth the effort to let other people know I think it&#x27;s extraordinary.  Until the economy went flat I would occasionally use Clinique&#x27;s Body Butter, which I always understood contained Shea Butter.  I loved it.  On a whim, I decided to look for Shea Butters and found this one.  I read the reviews and was impressed enough to order it expecting the rave reviews were overstated.  I don&#x27;t believe they are.  At the point of this writing I&#x27;ve been applying it to my face every time I wash it and my body every time I have a shower for approximately the past month.  I never would have imagined at 58 yrs old that my skin could be this soft, supple and indeed look more youthful.  I live in the very harsh dry climate of AZ, so you know it&#x27;s not easy to deal w/constant dry skin.  My face skin is so translucent that I don&#x27;t feel the need to wear a foundation.  Since I&#x27;ve purchased this, I have not used any moisturizer ... just the Shea butter.  The crows feet around my eyes are diminished and my lips no longer feel dry (yes, I apply it to lips and eyelids).    Now for the negative ... It has a real greasy feel to it when it melts in your hands.  I don&#x27;t mind it, but some might.  I like to leave the greasy feel on my skin, but if I am going out, I lightly wipe off the greasy feel and then apply makeup IF I am wearing it.  I would guess that a partner would not like to cuddle up to you if you&#x27;re entire body was greasy.  On the other hand, this would make for a great massage product.  The only other negative I&#x27;ve encountered is that because it is solid, you scoop the shea butter in your hand to have it essentially melt.  Because you are scooping out a somewhat dry product, bits of it can fall on your clothes or to the ground (my dogs love it ... don&#x27;t leave it around for them as it is all saturated fat).  None of the negatives would deter me from purchasing this again and again.  In amonth, I&#x27;ve used up 3/4&#x27;s of the jar due to using too much in the beginning.  I&#x27;ll be ordering it again soon.      I&#x27;ve never had a product which clearly provided visible improvement to my skin ...</li>
            <li> This is such an awesome product. I recently purchased Shea Butter from Sheabutter Hut and it smelled like cigarette smoke, I knew something wasn&#x27;t right about that. I then ordered it from AAA, OMG I loved this product. It was such a great quality and worked great as well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  It&#x27;s all natural, color-free, fragrance-free, preservative-free, and otherwise chemical free; and as the other reviewers have previously stated, the nutty smell goes away shortly after rubbing it into the skin.  It feels great to have a safe, \\&quot;poison-free\\&quot;  product to use on the skin of my children age 3 mos. to 3 years old.  It&#x27;s perfect for the whole family to use from head to toe.  You&#x27;ll need no other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have severe dry skin and in an attempt to stave off the pain and itchiness the dry winter causes me I wanted to use a purer shea butter than the scented ones I can find in my local stores. This was excellent, it&#x27;s a great price for how much product you receive. It&#x27;s not hard and can be easily applied. and the smell was nutty but not bad bad like some reviewers have stated. I love it and use it on my face at night to heal and protect the skin and use all over my body.</li>
            <li> I use the Shea Butter on my natural hair. I have to let it melt in my hand and then apply it. Because it is thick, it may leave a white looking reside which eventually  melts. To help with this, I also use jojoba or castor oil along with the shea butter. This product is great for naturals.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000GRENPA 100% Unrefined Certified Grade A Shea Butter 4 oz.]]</li>
            <li> First, the helpful tip: To thin the paste and make it much more spreadable, I put a dab of the paste onto my left hand, then dripped some jojoba oil over it, then rubbed the stuff between my palms.. much better! Easier to rub into the skin, and cover a larger area. Jojoba oil is also good for skin, so this is a useful mixture. The jojoba oil does have a bit of a noticeable odor though, but again, as far as I can tell, the smell fades. You might want to try combining the shea butter with the jojoba oil, and see if this works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, information on different kinds of shea butter from a consumer&#x27;s perspective, and how this product compares to others..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had very very dry flaky skin for as long as I can remember. Similar to dandruff, but over much of my body. My skin gets itchy too. I&#x27;ve been using the typical lotions such as Aveeno and Vaseline Intensive Care and so forth for over 2 decades, and although those products made my skin feel better, and were an improvement over using nothing, my skin was still quite flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some years ago, My mom found a shea butter product online, and said I should try some. I&#x27;d never heard of shea butter before, but figured I&#x27;d try it. What she&#x27;d purchased, and what I also bought, was a product that cost over 4 times more than this. It was a refined, very smooth shea butter, with no odor unless I wanted a scent blended in with it. I was not aware at the time that unrefined, cheaper butter was available. Because of the high cost of the refined kind, I stopped using it. A few months ago, I decided to try to find a better deal on shea butter, and was browsing here on Amazon, and found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refined shea butter, what I bought earlier, is processed with chemicals, and that&#x27;s why it has no noticeable smell, why it is white in color, and why it is very easy to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read on a couple shea butter websites that unrefined shea butter is better for skin because the refining process takes away much of the health benefits of the butter. Having used both, I&#x27;d say the unrefined butter is a little better for my skin, but that&#x27;s not the main reason I&#x27;m buying the unrefined kind. The refined white shea butter I bought earlier is far too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unrefined shea butter is VERY different from what I&#x27;d purchased earlier. The unrefined shea butter is darker in color (looks more natural) and feels sort of like clay or a thick paste. It is grainy, and has a VERY earthy smell. Yes, kind of like clay or dirt, not especially unpleasant, but definitely earthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some folks, especially women, might object to the odor. Most women, or at least the ones I&#x27;ve met,  tend to like products that smell nice.. some sort of fruit flavor, or flower, or something that smells like dessert.. chocolate, peppermint, etc. If you prefer skin care products that smell like the scents I&#x27;ve just mentioned, you probably won&#x27;t like the odor of unrefined shea butter. The smell of it does dissipate, but I can&#x27;t tell if the smell fades away entirely, or if I just get used to it. It&#x27;s quite possible the smell does fade entirely, so, those of you who tend to like the nicer smelling lotions and butters might still want to try this product.. or maybe not. Sometimes I can still smell the shea butter on my skin and clothes many hours after I&#x27;ve used it. Not a strong smell, but there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is possible to buy unrefined shea butter with an essential oil mixed in. Peppermint is soothing, and even though I am a guy, I am not especially stoked about the natural shea smell, so I bought a small container of unrefined shea butter (made by a different company) with peppermint mixed in. The shea smell is still there, although the mint smell does disguise it some.. actually not much..  The combination of scents.. the mint and the shea butter.. not great.  The mint oil mixed in does make the shea butter made by the other company a little more soothing, but not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alrighty, Here&#x27;s how you use this rather thick triple A shea butter stuff.. Take a bit of it, put it on the palm of your hand, and rub it in between your palms until you get it soft enough to spread on your body. And use the jojoba oil, if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one jar of this unrefined shea butter, and liked it enough to buy a second jar. There were several differences between the contents of the first and second jars. I don&#x27;t know if this is normal, or poor quality control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the shea butter in the first jar was squishier than that of the second jar.  The butter in the second jar is practically solid, more grainy and dry, and I really have to dig my finger into the stuff. Have to push hard to get any out. It&#x27;s still useable, though. Once I dig some out, the butter from the second jar isn&#x27;t harder to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other differences.. color of the butter in the first jar was darker than the second, and, the butter in the first jar had a stronger and slightly different smell to it. The smell from the second jar is less strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a more expensive container of unrefined shea butter from another vendor, to compare with the two AAA jars. The color of the more expensive kind is closer to that of the second jar, the odor is closer to that of the first jar, and the consistency is more squishy and spreadable than both, but similar to the first. I&#x27;m not sure if the more expensive kind is worth the money. I&#x27;ve been using both it and the contents from the second jar of this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the overly expensive refined shea butter I bought awhile back and the cheaper unrefined butter I am reviewing do help my skin. I almost never use the usual lotions anymore. I talked to my doctor recently, and he strongly recommended not using such lotions, because they contain alcohol, which dries skin. No wonder my flaky skin never got much better! Also, those lotions are loaded with chemicals concocted in labs, and I&#x27;d rather use a natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shea butter doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of the skin flakes but, overall, the condition of my skin has improved since I&#x27;ve used shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest not buying just any product that has the words \\&quot;shea butter\\&quot; on the label though. Many products contain only a small amount of shea butter, and the rest is the usual chemical junk. Far better to buy 100% shea butter like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I going to buy anymore of this brand of 100% unrefined shea butter? I think so. Although the contents of the second jar differ somewhat from the first, I have found the shea butter contained in both jars to be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars instead of 5, because of smell, somewhat difficult to spread, some product inconsistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A helpful product though, and good value for the money.butter stuff.. Take a bit of it, put it on the palm of your hand, and rub it in between your palms until you get it soft enough to spread on your body. And use the jojoba oil, if you like.     I bought one jar of this unrefined shea butter, and liked it enough to buy a second jar. There were several differences between the contents of the first and second jars. I don&#x27;t know if this is normal, or poor quality control.     The consistency of the shea butter in the first jar was squishier than that of the second jar.  The butter in the second jar is practically solid, more grainy and dry, and I really have to dig my finger into the stuff. Have to push hard to get any out. It&#x27;s still useable, though. Once I dig some out, the butter from the second jar isn&#x27;t harder to spread.     The other differences.. color of the butter in the first jar was darker than the second, and, the butter in the first jar had a stronger and slightly different smell to it. The smell from the second jar is less strong.     I bought a more expensive container of unrefined shea butter from another vendor, to compare with the two AAA jars. The color of the more expensive kind is closer to that of the second jar, the odor is closer to that of the first jar, and the consistency is more squishy and spreadable than both, but similar to the first. I&#x27;m not sure if the more expensive kind is worth the money. I&#x27;ve been using both it and the contents from the second jar of this brand.     Both the overly expensive refined shea butter I bought awhile back and the cheaper unrefined butter I am reviewing do help my skin. I almost never use the usual lotions anymore. I talked to my doctor recently, and he strongly recommended not using such lotions, because they contain alcohol, which dries skin. No wonder my flaky skin never got much better! Also, those lotions are loaded with chemicals concocted in labs, and I&#x27;d rather use a natural product.     The shea butter doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of the skin flakes but, overall, the condition of my skin has improved since I&#x27;ve used shea butter.     I would suggest not buying just any product that has the words \\&quot;shea butter\\&quot; on the label though. Many products contain only a small amount of shea butter, and the rest is the usual chemical junk. Far better to buy 100% shea butter like this.    Am I going to buy anymore of this brand of 100% unrefined shea butter? I think so. Although the contents of the second jar differ somewhat from the first, I have found the shea butter contained in both jars to be useful.       Four stars instead of 5, because of smell, somewhat difficult to spread, some product inconsistency.    A helpful product though, and good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I read hundreds of reviews for Shea Butter before purchasing &amp; took into account packaging, seller reviews, quality &amp; color of the shea butter, and finally decided to go with this one (AAA Shea Butter, 1 LB &#x3D; $25 w/Prime free shipping).  I&#x27;m glad I did, it arrived in perfect condition, well packaged, glad to have a sturdy tub to hold it in, very light yellow/cream color as I expected, and if you are familiar with raw unrefined shea than you&#x27;d expect it to have the distinct nutty scent, which it did.  It was cold weather when I received it, so in transit the butter was very hard upon arrival.  I was a bit anxious, so I used low defrost heat in the microwave just to take the chill off &amp; make it pliable (at everyday room temp in my bathroom it&#x27;s a perfect consistency - hard to the touch when it&#x27;s in it&#x27;s container, gotta dig in &amp; scoop it w/your fingers, then work it well into your palms before you can smooth it into your skin).  This stuff is wonderful.  It feels a bit rich &amp; oily for just a few minutes.  Keeps my skin moisturized through the whole day, I can still feel the butter on my skin in the evening after a long day.  Plain lotion wears off after such a short time, and in the winter you really need a thicker emolient. Your skin will thank you!  This stuff is rich, and water will just bead up on you when you have it on!  Works better than anything else for elbows, heels, knees, hands, cuticles, etc.  It&#x27;s great to slather on your feet before bed, then put on a pair of socks before hitting the sack &amp; let your feet just soak in all those moisturizing riches overnight!  I&#x27;ve turned on many friends to shea butter &amp; will definately continue using it &amp; will order this particular one again when needed.  Good packaging, good price (w/Prime shipping) &amp; quality/color/scent just what I would have expected.</li>
            <li> let me start by saying, i have several different types of Eczema (5 or more) and needless to say its been the one thing i&#x27;ve fought a losing battle against for 12 years. however. with the help of topical steriods, or if your eczema is already in decent control (cracked, bleeding, oozing, peeling, all the above) this is a GREAT thing to add to your own treatment. my problem areas are my hands and feet, as you can&#x27;t avoid moving them. with moisture gloves and socks, i was able to heal the worst of my sores in a matter of days instead of weeks.     only downside, its greasy. so unless your skin is as bad as mine, you only have to use a tiny amount to get great coverage. smells good and melts in your hands, like real butter. also, has worked well on my stomach, where i got stretch marks from just having my first kiddo. along with Argan Oil, also from this company, they have faded twice as fast as i&#x27;ve ever seen. added bonus- you can use a tiny bit of this on hair ends if they are split and it will make your hair shiney and soft.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that this is high quality and pure, but applying it to the skin is not very easy. The texture is thick (imagine butter) and it leaves skin greasy and I have to wait a long time before I can put clothes on. I end up being too lazy to use this and used other lotions (which contains some shea butter). Maybe pure shea butter is not the most practical skin care product to use.</li>
            <li> I searched the net for the best grade of Shea butter to use for my hair and this brand came up in google. Based on the reviews, I ordered it and it has met my expectations. Compared to the yellow shea butter I got at the store, the smell is not so bad (it eventually goes). For this reason, I use it on my face as a lotion. I&#x27;m going to try it out for the \\&quot;fluffly\\&quot; shea butter recipe found here: [...] I give it a 4 because I think it should be priced at $20. The total price comes up to $30 with shipping.</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is great!!!!!!!!!    Will never be without, but make sure you buy the best grade A or above!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My son has eczema which always worsens in the winter. This is helping immensely. Even for my dry hands, I can feel the difference. It really helps with itching and burning, soothes chapped lips and cheeks from cold wind, helps with minor burns and scrapes. It&#x27;s a great product. As for consistency - you have to take a little bit, rub it between your hands until it melts completely, then it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This product had a very rancid smell and a sticky texture. I think the shea butter may have been mixed with something, but definitely was not pure. More greasy than moisturizing. Very disappointed that I spent money on this when I&#x27;ve gotten better shea butter for way cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great product. Better than I expected. Very emollient and my skin feels fantastic! Definitely purchase again,</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is the most awesome, when it comes to moisturizing and softening your skin. I had this dry spot on my finger that resembled a callus but was not, I applied Shea Butter on that spot for a few days and it is almost gone, wowwww fast ! I love this Shea Butter and will continue to purchase it when this one is all gone, also bought a family member some of this shea butter and she loves it too, have used it on other family members skin, even on irritations it is wonderful knocks the itch out quickly, had I known that Shea Butter was this awesome I would of purchased it many months ago, as I get severe eczema on my hands, shea butter is doing wonders for that too, and you know it makes your skin so soft just like baby&#x27;s skin, just as other reviewers or descriptions have promised it does, you won&#x27;t be sorry with your purchase of Shea Butter. Would also like to say that some reviewers have mentioned that Shea Butter does not smell very nice, I actually think it has a very pleasant scent considering it does not have any added perfume, it&#x27;s actually a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I do not remember when I bought this Shea Butter, but I was cleaning out a closet toady and found it.  It still smells the same, awful!!!  I dumped in the garbage so I could recycle the container.  I made sure I had gloves on and and emptied the trash right away.   What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product hoping it would clear up my keratosis pilaris on my arms and legs.  As my skin also is affected by hyperpigmentation my KP bumps are also dark little spots.  After the 1st application the size and dark color of the bumps have greatly improved.  Amazing.  I&#x27;ve used Lac-Hydrin (per dermatologist rec), cocoa butter among other lotions and nothing&#x27;s worked. I also have constantly chapped lips no matter what balm I used.  I rubbed a tiny bit on my lips and this butter&#x27;s been far more effective than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  I did notice there is a slight scent but don&#x27;t find it offensive.      If you look at a lot of commercial cosmetic products, from low- to high-end, many of them contain shea butter.  I figured why pay for a bunch of fillers and marketing, and possibly lower grade butter when I can use the best-quality source ingredient.    The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because there was no expiration date on the label--although there was \\&quot;expiration\\&quot; written on it; maybe they forgot to stamp this one?</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the texture of this shea butter it was too think even when I was trying to warm it with my hand, I gave it to my mom and she didn&#x27;t like it either.</li>
            <li> I researched the best shea butter products before making my purchase. I am very pleased overall with this pure shea butter. After a major surgery, I rubbed it all over the incision for a month. Today my scars are nearly impossible to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its an amazing moisturizer as well. Grab a chunk, let it melt with the heat of your hands, then rus it in...excellent!</li>
            <li> This butter feels very, very good on my skin and I absolutely love it.  I have recommended this product to all of my friend and even to the nurses where I work as well.</li>
            <li> I have used products with Shea butter in it but never pure Shea butter. I just received this and I opened up the tub and this strong diarrhea smell came pouring out of the tub. Is this the way Shea butter is suppose to smell because it is the sickest smell I have ever smelled in my life. I put some on my hands and the smell is deep in my pores. I thought it was suppose to smell nutty and pleasant not like a babies dirty diaper. Maybe it&#x27;s rancid??</li>
            <li> We are repeat customers for this Shea Butter.  It works wonders on our hands and especially our feet.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this shea butter for a week now and i&#x27;m in love the smell at first was strong but now i don&#x27;t even notice it. my acne scars are starting to fade and i&#x27;ve had them for a long time and i&#x27;ve had no more breakouts since using it but you need to give it time to work it&#x27;s really great for after shaving, ladies it keeps those shaving bumps at bay i put it my wet skin and the shea butter just soaks the water right up and into my skin and it&#x27;s certified by the american shea butter institute as grade A.do your research grade A shea butter is the best you can get,the stuff you buy in stores is refined and not nearly as good believe me i have used them, i have tried all kinds of lotions,oils even made my own lotions nothing was as good as this shea butter, put the shea butter in the bathroom while showering the heat will soften it up. i will be buying this shea butter again and again etc.............</li>
            <li> I started using this product to keep eczema-covered parts of the skin moist, and the product did an ok job - it did not help with the eczema, but kept the skin moisturized about the same as any other decent moisturizing product (i.e., nothing \\&quot;special\\&quot;). Recently I had the same experience as another reviewer, as the content of the container was hard and could not be applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the owner of the company (Curtis Hayes) about the problem and inquired if any changes had been made to their production process and the email I received said, \\&quot;I am very sorry for the problem that you have had with this batch of shea butter, but to answer your question we have not changed anything in our production process; and are still using grade A Shea Butter. Although every batch is a little different due to the  shea seeds that we use to make shea butter.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the owner did not offer to remedy the problem on his own, I asked if my \\&quot;bad\\&quot; batch could be replaced. I received the following response: \\&quot;That will not be a problem just send it back.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed up asking where to send the \\&quot;bad\\&quot; batch product, how to get a pre-paid label, and when to expect the replacement item, and I did not receive any response. So I sent another note and received the following note: \\&quot;Sorry for the delay, when was your product purchased? We need the date.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I sent the requested information, and as you might have guessed, there was no response. I sent another note - no response. To this date, the owner has not responded nor replaced the flawed product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I cannot trust the owner, I cannot trust the product. And trust is an essential component in doing business - I cannot trust the ingredients that are supposed to be in an item if the owner has not proven to be trustworthy in my eyes. Luckily there are plenty of alternatives out there, and I have found that liquid Vitamin E is actually doing a better job on the eczema.</li>
            <li> This 100% Unrefined Grade A Shae Butter with the ASBI Seal is a high quality product!  It has superior moisturizing properties, and since it is unrefined, it also has very special and natural ingredients that are ideal for healthier skin.  Shae Butter contains Vitamin A, the one vitamin that is absolutely necessary for healthy and beautiful skin.  This premium Shae Butter has a mild pale yellow color, and spreads just like soft and creamy bar butter at room temperature.  Its characteristic smell, \\&quot;nutty\\&quot;, is not offensive and dissipates after a short while.  Because it has No Impurities, No Chemicals, No Preservatives and No Fragrance, it can also be safely used on the face.  It is naturally hypoallergenic.  I bought this product for myself, my husband and for my elderly parents.  It is perfect for daily use as a moisturizer \\&quot;par excellence\\&quot; for the face and the body.  It is also very effective when used to help heal rashes, miner wounds, and other dry skin conditions.  The shae tree is appropriately named the Karite Tree, which means the \\&quot;Tree Of Life\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The only Shea Butter I use</li>
            <li> I tried a different Shea Butter recently, and it was grainy. This brand has always been smooth and extremely easy to use. I will never buy another brand again. I have been steadily buying this for the last 4 years or so and have never been disappointed.  EDITED NOV 2016: I just ordered my winter supply. The product has now changed. They are not shipping unrefined shea butter. The tub is now clear, the shea butter is creamy. It still says Premium Grade A Shea Butter, and maybe it is rated that way, but it is not unrefined. It does not sit on my skin and protect it. It sinks straight in. I contacted the company and they confirmed it is a new formulation and they are attempting to expand their brand. I tried to ask further questions about getting the original one and distinguishing between them, but received no further answers. I am returning this most recent purchase and hunting for a new brand. I&#x27;m very sad that this one has changed. As you can see, I previously stated that this was the only brand for me.</li>
            <li> It was hard as a rock when i purchase it.  Luckily Amazon gave me a complete refund.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It&#x27;s my first time buying shea butter and I was very pleased. It was a little pricey and as a result of that I might  look for something cheaper next time. I used it to make my own body cream using other products and it came out creamy, but was slightly grainy, but that was not a problem for me. I would recommend this product to anyone who is not price conscious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the cheaper version that I plan on trying out, after my home made body cream is finished are not satisfactory to me, I will pay the price for this product.</li>
            <li> I use this product exclusively for my feet after showering and under socks.  My husband uses it for the backs of his hands.  This is the third large 1 lb. jar we&#x27;ve purchased, and we found this one to be a bit dry and crumbly.  Since the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be dated, there is no way to know if this is because it is old.</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter so much, I bought some shea butter from different company in amazon, but still, I choose to come back to this brand and this butter. This butter has really good texture that smooth than other brand, and the smell is exactly a nuts smell that I believe that the butter did not cook overly; other brand have exactly the overcook oil smell which I can not bear that smell. (if you want to know the process of shea butter, you can youtube it.) I read some of reviews from other brand&#x27;s shea butter, one of reviewer said the butter has some dark nut shell, I must say that the manufacturer did not do well with the products which is included unnecessary ingredients inside the product; but anyway this product has done well with the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason is why I love this butter, I had pityriasis few weeks ago, you will never imagine how terrible it is, when you suddenly got a lot of it, you will wanna cry!  I had pityriasis due to my laziness that I dont usually apply lotion on body after shower, and here is -7 degree.. so you can tell how dry the skin is; then I got pityriasis that made me very very itchy that wanna scratch the pityriasis; and I bought 5 of anti-itchy cream from safeway, those cream can help to control the pityriasis, but those cream can not recover the skin from pityriasis,just can control it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my pityriasis stop appear on the body, the body would not itchy anymore, but you have to deal with the last step which is to replace the skin as smooth as the original skin, after I apply this butter, the pachylosis that cause by pityriasis would gradually to become smooth like the original skin,but still need few days to recover the skin. The result is totally out of my expectation, it is just only few days than I thought it need to take at least few weeks to recover. I must say the gift from natural always done well than chemical things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To some people, it might be a little bit expensive, but after you watch the process through youtube, you will know that it is worth, and know how treasure the butter is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I prefer to invest natural products that helps to improve the beauty of body from inside to outside.tch the process through youtube, you will know that it is worth, and know how treasure the butter is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I prefer to invest natural products that helps to improve the beauty of body from inside to outside.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shea butter for a year.  I started using it because I have eczema and I wanted something pure to put on my skin.  I did not want to put any more chemicals on my skin.  I had checked into cheaper shea butters but felt I could not trust the source of them.  Since this was certified shea butter, that helped me know it had been tested.  I am tired of not being able to trust where my products are coming from.  Can I trust the certification of this product?  I hope that I can. It was the only thing I put on my eczema and I started to make my own homemade all natural lotion and put this shea butter in as one of the ingredients.  Those are the two things I put on my eczema.  I also completely changed my diet to organic, whole foods.  I am eating more raw, juicing and have taken out a lot of the processed sugar and flour from my diet.  My eczema got worse before it got better, but it is now better.  I believe this shea butter is one of the reasons I am better.  It helped to soothe my inflamed, red, itchy skin.  It is thick, it does have a smell to it, it does keep the skin lubricated.  It did get on my clothes, but my skin felt so much better while it was healing.  I am so so very thankful for this shea butter and I always have a tub on hand.  We also mix it with coconut oil to make an all natural sun tan lotion.  There are many uses for it - chapstick, dry hands, eczema, night cream, makeup remover, mosquito bites, sun tan lotion, on and on it goes.</li>
            <li> Unrefined shea butter has a strong smell to it. It smells very smoky due to the way it is produced. I don&#x27;t think this product is too greasy as some of the other reviewers said. You don&#x27;t need a large amount to put on your skin. It soaks in quickly and leaves your skin very smooth. Petroleum Jelly is very greasy compared to this product. The strong smell also disappears quickly. I don&#x27;t know how much one can trust the \\&quot;certified\\&quot; statement. By whom was this product certified? There is no seal or mark on the product to support this claim.</li>
            <li> i have using this as  mosturizer for a while and ran out of it so order this and share w/ my daughters... great stuff</li>
            <li> I use this on my face twice a day and it works great. I have skin that is not only acne-prone, but also gets dry easily. Since this doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals or oils in it, my face has been in much better condition and is always smooth. I would definitely suggest it if you have any kind of skin problems.</li>
            <li> A high quality product.  It was perfect for our lotion bars that were made this year.  Will buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this to moisturize myself to avoid striations or any other skin problem, but it is very unpractical, hard to put on, it takes a lot to dry so you have to wait a lot to put your clothes on. I only wore it the first week after i bought it.</li>
            <li> I have read several negative comments regarding the smell of this product. Interestingly, while I think this Shea Butter smells slightly nutty and unoffensive, two of my children think it smells bad and my spouse thinks it smells rancid. A friend of mine thinks it has a pleasant nutty fragrance. Apparently, different people perceive the smell of Shea Butter differently, and just because you may dislike the odor it doesn&#x27;t mean the Shea Butter is bad. If you dislike the smell but still want to be able to use the Shea Butter for its benefits you can add a few drops of essential oil to completely conceal the scent (use caution when adding oils that can burn the skin). I use just a couple of drops of sweet orange oil that makes the Shea Butter scent appealing to even my spouse and children.    The product arrived quickly and is of Grade-A-quality as advertised. I will buy this brand of Shea Butter again when I run out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s IMPOSSIBLE for a first time buyer to purchase true, real, raw shea butter online I think.  Well, I USED to think that until I found AAA Shea Butter Premium Grade A Unrefined Shea Butter, Net WT. 1LB (16oz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it has a smokey smell.  And by that I mean it smells like if you had been standing around a smokey campfire in your backyard and it got on your clothes, skin, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s greasy for a bit if you put too much on.  I found that rolling a small ball, about the size of a large gumball between my palms to warm it up, then I put it in a waterproof container with a screw on lid and run hot water over it (or pop it in a cup full of hot water).  It melts quickly and makes it easier to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a lot less redness on a scar of a surger I had May 2010 and my son has been using it on his acne scars, people have been stopping hiim and telling him \\&quot;your skin looks really great!!!\\&quot;  My husband uses it to fade age spots on his head (he is bald) and I use it to moisturize our biracial daughters kinky/dry/coarse hair and on my face.  I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of comments of looking \\&quot;radiant\\&quot; and \\&quot;well-rested\\&quot; in the last few weeks so I can live with that(I don&#x27;t wear makeup, I try to stay out of the sun, I don&#x27;t smoke or drink, I do get plenty of sleep, take care of my skin, etc. so hearing those comments are a very nice thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is on our \\&quot;reorder\\&quot; list as we ALL love it.  The smokey smell really does go away after about 30 mins but the moisture does NOT and I love that!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this shea butter, this is the only lotion she uses. She loves that it&#x27;s all natural and makes her skin very soft. She highly recommends this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It leaves my skin so hydrated and soft. It needs to be worked a bit in your hands, then it goes on smooth. I bought lavender oil to mix in because some reviews said there was a smell, but I notice no smell. I use it almost daily and especially if I am in dry climate. I haven&#x27;t found a product that works as well or long-lasting as this.</li>
            <li> I bought this shea butter a while ago, after reading all the good reviews, and knowing that shea butter is great for your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like this cream more, but I just don&#x27;t care for it too much.... because 1st, it&#x27;s as hard as a rock! Especially when it&#x27;s a little colder&lt;br /&gt;2nd, it feels soooooooooooo greasy, it&#x27;s the most greasy cream I have ever used! And thus, it takes FOREVER to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still give it 3 stars, because I don&#x27;t hate it, and I&#x27;m still using it. It does hydrate your skin well, I mostly put it on my legs, thighs, butt, and elbows. And plus, when I ocaasionally put it on my face, it hydrates my face too! And doesn&#x27;t give me any problems, like pimple breakouts or anything bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently did a little more homework, and bought some other shea butter creams, which are not 100% shea butter but nonetheless all natural ingredients, for better and faster absorption, from Nature&#x27;s Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> the quality of this shea better is a lot better than the yellow butter, this butter cost more due to the quality, so I only use it on my face and as a spot treatment for other areas of my body  because it is pricey, and I have seen dark spots disappear, and even my skin tone on my face.</li>
            <li> I got today my shea butter, i check the package before i open that, no expiration date.. Is Any body else out there have the same problem with me ?, i try to apply to my skin, yes its feel sticky lil bit, and the smell just like smoke, and the butter really thick solid hard... But easy to spread after i rub with my palm.. I wll update for the satisfaction how its work for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today i just remember, that when the first time i open the jar, the content was not full, there is a hole like the egg size.. Wondering why..?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way the butter moisturising my skin a lot.. But still i have a lot eczema on my arm..</li>
            <li> Gotta have this shea butter!! oh YEA!! i got this back in jan.. (I think) but anyway, I still have some left. I use it mainly for my hair but I use it on my skin too. It makes my hair feel so soft. I will buy from amazon instead of my local whole foods store.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It keeps my skin very nourished &amp; also gets rid of dark spots on the skin.  I find that this also gets rid of cuts &amp; bruises in no time.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is hard to apply, but what it does for the skin it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t smell sweet either.  If you want a nice smelling product then buy a watered down refined version that has none of the healing properties of this one.  My wife bought this for preventing stretch marks during pregancy and it works.</li>
            <li> Wow. This product has me using and coming back for more. Did a lot of research on this and this works wonders on skin scars, moisturizing and all the other benefits it mentions. Highly recommended. A+++</li>
            <li> I mix this product with other hair oils because the smell isn&#x27;t my favorite but very healthy for my thick, kinky curly hair.</li>
            <li> So far so good. :) i have been use it for my pregnancy. It&#x27;s nice it stays with you until the next day so you don&#x27;t need to put more on. I do like the smell it&#x27;s nuttie and don&#x27;t smell bad to me.</li>
            <li> True, the scent of the raw shea butter is strong and nutty. Not repellant, just very earthy and natural. However I do not wear it outside in public, but rather overnight slathered under socks and gloves. Works very well to soften hands and feet, very moisturizing. I rated this item 3 out of 5 stars because as much as i like the effects, the strong scent prevents me from using it in public. (I also do not use it at night when sleeping next to my boyfriend!)</li>
            <li> The butter was too thick and hard to use--actually it is quite hard.</li>
            <li> A TV program gave us the basic idea to try Shea butter for cracked heels (which I am continuously fighting).  The stuff works and this brand seems to have the least odor and contamination.  Also seems to work on soothing itchy spots.  Seems to be a good product that I keep buying.</li>
            <li> I have used 100% Unrefined Shea Butter since 2002.  You must wash your hands before putting them in the jar and after, things can transfer.  I found this supplier and have ordered from them for approximately 6 or 7 years.  I am so satisfied with this product.  I know what 100% unrefined shea butter looks and smells like.  This is it.  I used it for pain from RSD and neuropathy for years to avoid taking too many pain medications.  My husband recently was told he has arthritis in his hip.  He has had physical therapy and has taken numerous different pain pills.  I told him to apply some shea butter and he is now thankfully pain free.  He uses it upon waking and before bed every day.  It is excellent for skin moisturizing.  It goes on like butter but smell and oil go away in about 15 to 20 minutes.  Your skin will love it.  I use it on my hair sometimes too.  I irritated my gum and put shea butter around the outside of my mouth and the pain was gone before I realized it.  I have also used it to stop a sore throat.  My kids and grandkids are sold on Shea Butter now too.  We keep a jar in each bathroom.  I love it and my family loves it. Now, I get it from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shea Butter for several years and this brand is as good as any I&#x27;ve tried and at a much lower price. Will continue to use and will order this brand again.</li>
            <li> it makes your skin soft definitely ,but its only good as a night cream ,it takes ages to soak in the skin and its greasy ,my pillow is full of greasy spots now..lol has a strong nutty smell but its works magic on dry skin ..Doesn&#x27;t work on acnes or wrinkles at all..</li>
            <li> Meant this size container on my previous review! Also ordered the 1oz which I keep by my kitchen sink for my dry hands. LOVE this butter!</li>
            <li> This product has a faint smokey smell, like the shea butter that I had purchased from another supplier.  It is much better quality though.  This is a good quality butter, which spreads and absorbs easily once you rub it between your palms.  It has an ivory color, and I feel good about the fact that it has certified by ASBI, so must be a genuine shea butter.  Gave it three stars because there is no expiration date on the jar.</li>
            <li> This is an *excellent* product. Wonderful for my skin, and cost effective if you buy the 16 oz size. I love it!</li>
            <li> I use this on everything...my face, my hair, my hands, my lips. It&#x27;s fantastic! I mix it with essential oils to add a nice scent. Try peppermint for a hand cream or lavender for a night face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is my second time around purchasing this product and I am not interested in purchasing any other brand. This brand is natural and not gimincky and therefore cost effective.</li>
            <li> I used this product for months for eczema and it didn&#x27;t work for me. I will not buy again for this reason. I only wanted it because I was told it is good for eczema.</li>
            <li> I had first bought Shea butter from a Renn Fest vendor, where I could see and use the product before buying. They sold it in small quantities which was okay at the time as I only used it as a night moisturizer for my super-dry hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year severe stress triggered eczema that left my hands cracked and bleeding. During the 6-week wait to see a dermatologist, Shea butter was the ONLY thing I could use that did not hurt and burn. By the time of my appointment, the skin was no longer cracked and bleeding. That was when I decided Shea butter needed a bigger role in my life. Alas, my RennFest vendor had lost his supplier and had none for sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On line, I was dismayed at the number of different products advertised as Shea butter; although I read many reviews, my first order was a product that only *contained* Shea butter--a nice, creamy concoction, but not the pure, unadulterated product I want and need. On the second try, I saw the leading review of AAA Shea Butter and it persuaded me to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AAA Shea Butter is the REAL DEAL: thick, grainy, rich. It is what I had been used to and found so helpful with my eczema. Now that I can buy it by the pound I use it as an all-over moisturizer every morning and keep small quantities handy to use throughout the day, especially after hand-washing. Although I am sensitive to perfumes and scents, the slightly smoky smell is pleasant and fades quickly. N.B.: Shea butter liquifies as it warms up. If you carry this in your purse, backpack, or car, as I do, be sure your container does not leak!</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality Shea Butter.  My only downfall is that it&#x27;s very grainy even after emulsifying it in my hands.  I actually had to completely melt the butter before whipping it as semi-liquid didn&#x27;t get rid of the grainy feeling.  I never had to do such a thing with shea butters I&#x27;ve purchased in the past...from different vendors.</li>
