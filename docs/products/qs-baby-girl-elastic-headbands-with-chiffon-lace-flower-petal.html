            <li>EXCELLENT SELLE, FAST SHIPPING A+++++++</li>
            <li>They are nice and I would recommend them to my friends for their babies .</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t thrilled once I got them though.</li>
            <li>they wore nice.</li>
            <li>It was extremely kind and generous of them to do that.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had liked these</li>
            <li>Such a great buy and amazing quality!!!</li>
            <li>THE PRODUCT IS NICELY MADE</li>
            <li>- COME UP WITH YOUR OWN IDEAS .</li>
            <li>This looks so fancy and are nice quality as well.</li>
            <li>So many cute headbands for a great price.</li>
            <li>I realize they are all packaged up and need time to kind of relax into place, but it wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li>even the quality was nice.</li>
            <li>They arrived quick and are just as beautiful as they look in the picture....</li>
            <li>They look very nice in the picture but in person they look/feel cheap and are tacky.</li>
            <li>Do not look cheap, look very nice.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these for a beautiful accent to your baby&#x27;s look!</li>
            <li>Also, it smells very strong.</li>
            <li>They are the perfect size for my 4 month old!</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for something cute for pictures, don&#x27;t make my mistake and spend some more money on a quality headband!</li>
            <li>Perfect for my 9 month old.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the six year old though.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend!</li>
            <li>Good for the baby, and most of all I love it for my daughter, so lovely :)</li>
            <li>Quick with deliverly and packing was good.</li>
            <li>They are large and gawdy, so while they make great props, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wearing them out.</li>
            <li>Very cute and price is right!</li>
            <li>It took a while for them to arrive, but they did arrive within the time period that they set, so that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I love love love them.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more soon.</li>
            <li>I love mixing and matching bows with my daughters outfits</li>
            <li>Adorable, just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and the flowers.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I will purchase more from this seller.</li>
            <li>Bought for my baby, and they were huge on her as a newborn, but now at 9 months old, they&#x27;re just about perfect, if I could get her to leave them on!</li>
            <li>Fit a 4 month old and 6 perfectly.  </li>
            <li>They look adorable.  </li>
            <li>But they are cute</li>
            <li>love it and baby loves it</li>
            <li>did you get those lovely headbands?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>a bit lopsided (part of what makes them cute).</li>
            <li>and she will be able to wear them for awhile.</li>
            <li>The flower is okay</li>
            <li>So glad to have these.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The picture makes them look more Victorian and fancy and they just look really goofy.</li>
            <li>These headbands were just adorable.</li>
            <li>We have used them on pets too and they are adorable.</li>
            <li>I think they would be better for babies if we had more pastels.</li>
            <li>I purchased about 60 headbands and bows, but I think these are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>They are so precious.  </li>
            <li>The headband size fits my newborn granddaughter, but will grow with her for many years because they are stretchy.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>I read reviews that mentioned an odor and thought I&#x27;d take a chance, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>My wife and daughter love them.</li>
            <li>I purchased these adorable headbands for a friend&#x27;s newborn baby girl.  </li>
            <li>I was extremely satisfied with your customer service.  </li>
            <li>Its more than I xpected.  </li>
            <li>Its okay.</li>
            <li>These were OK, but just not my style.</li>
            <li>I love these bows.</li>
            <li>but they do look quite lovely.  </li>
            <li>my daughter love them..</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>They fit my 6 month old daughter perfectly and worked better than I had hoped for her 6 month photo shoot.</li>
            <li>I love every color on my granddaughter</li>
            <li>Colors were nice however and the size band fit well.</li>
            <li>Not as expected...but ok</li>
            <li>I love that I have one for every outfit.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with them.</li>

            <li>They are absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li>They are adorable headbands .</li>
            <li>i gave them to a friend for her grand daugther</li>
            <li>, i was glad she approvede.</li>
            <li>They look so elegant though.</li>
            <li>I love these headbands I&#x27;ve got so many complimentsand</li>
            <li>I bought these as presents for my cute nieces.</li>
            <li>i love</li>
            <li>Quality was okay</li>
            <li>So lovely lovet lovet presentation</li>
            <li>but they did love them.  </li>
            <li>, I think they would be safe.</li>
            <li>and they look really cute on her.</li>
            <li>Very nicely made, soft &amp; comfortable with gorgeous colors.</li>
            <li>specially because my baby girL didnt get fuzzy they where really comfortable!!  </li>
            <li>as pretty and beautiful as expected and more, size is amazing, color is exact to whats written and it looks awesome on my precious baby .</li>
            <li>Pretty,  lots of good colors.</li>
            <li>An excellent set of headbands, but a long time to arrive.  </li>
            <li>Too big for my newborn (my baby&#x27;s head is averag), but fine around 3/4 months and works great on 2 year olds!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get these bows!</li>
            <li>Great product for the price they look great not cheap looking at all, I recommend it, 4 stars because it took 30 days to get it.</li>
            <li>So worth the $10...or more!</li>
            <li>I really liked the headbands they were not too small and all the colors were great my daughter in law loved them</li>
            <li>However, they have worked great for my older models AND my 3 girls enjoy them as well.</li>
            <li>These are so cute - the flower is huge, so they almost make baby look</li>
            <li>lovely and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very cute and such a good price.</li>
            <li>but even my 9 year old can wear them Which is also great..</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that I was able to get these cute headbands for such a great price.</li>
            <li>The headbands look great on a 3-month old, fit her well, and my sister sent me some adorable pictures of her wearing them.</li>
            <li>She probably will be able to fit them when she&#x27;s 3months or 6months</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a perfect size and will fit her for a long time.</li>
            <li>These are super cute and came in many colors.</li>
            <li>They are very pretty, but the string of pearls breaks very easily.</li>
            <li>but other then that they are perfect.</li>
            <li>Pearls fall off to easy</li>
            <li>and they are fine.</li>
            <li>They run slightly bigger so many not for a newborn but perfect for an older baby</li>
            <li>but my super glue is better than theirs.  </li>
            <li>Super buy!</li>
            <li>They looked super cute on for 2 minutes while we took pictures.</li>
            <li>These are super cute.</li>
            <li>When I held them up to my nose, wow, very strong!  </li>
            <li>Love the bright Yellow !!</li>
            <li>These are huge.</li>
            <li>Nice product, reasonably priced</li>
            <li>She is comfortable wearing it and does not take it off the head.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Very affordable and nice quality.</li>
            <li>They are absolutely adorable and WELL WORTH your money.</li>
            <li>However, if you are getting them for a newborn, they are not going to fit.</li>
            <li>i received one in every colors and they are comfortable on my daughter head.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, they kindly told me to just keep it as a gift.  </li>
            <li>and then they fit..</li>
            <li>I was worried that the pearls would look like cheap plastic pearls</li>
            <li>Really cute, and colorful and festive.</li>
            <li>Smells like chemicals and looks cheap.</li>
            <li>The material  looks cheap and some of the flower came  defected.</li>
            <li>so instead of that if there was one green it would be great.all in one I can say nice and cute and good quality elastic products.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>Headbands are very colorful for babies to wear.</li>
            <li>They are stunning but rather large!</li>
            <li>and although I originally I didn&#x27;t get the product, the seller fixed&lt;br</li>
            <li>truly unique apiece and flattering</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get them</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not quite as pretty as the picture and thus the four stars but for the price they were okay.</li>
            <li>Other than that, they are cute for a good price.</li>
            <li>They make any dressup occasion really special.  </li>
            <li>They are very bright, vibrant, and soft and so pretty.</li>
            <li>so good and clean individual packets  and</li>
            <li>These are cute and fit on older children, as well.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments, and I&#x27;m happy to tell them to jump on Amazon and grab some for their little ones!</li>
            <li>, Only gave 4 stars because I would have loved it if I got the peach colored one shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>If you are using them just for pictures, or you could cut off the pearls pretty easily without damaging the headband</li>
            <li>i bought these for my new grand baby and my other grand daughters like wearing them to, it great thanks.</li>
            <li>but nothing a quick pining can&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li>I must have expected more, I honestly just don&#x27;t like these bows at all.</li>
            <li>the pearls were supposed to be glued on because there are huge hot glue globs all over.</li>
            <li>The headbands were very cute and came in enough colors to match everything.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and very stretchy!</li>
            <li>The are very pretty</li>
            <li>Very pretty headbands like the quality and he colors.</li>
            <li>Very pretty bows.</li>
            <li>Too large for toddler but easy to fix.</li>
            <li>I love my new baby headbands.</li>
            <li>These headbands are extremely cute on my new granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>I love these, because they are cute, cheap and they stay in place without crushing by little one&#x27;s rather large head.</li>
            <li>It took some time for me to get the item after I ordered, however when I received them it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I think this is worth the money esp with the price.</li>
            <li>It sure is adorable, he only thing is that the bandsare too big for a baby , this is more for a todler.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>look kind of big on my babies</li>
            <li>It was quite worth it.</li>
            <li>My daughter looks beutiful with these i waited about a month but worth it</li>
            <li>My baby has gotten many compliments on her headbands she must have a larger head because at 3 months they did fit.  </li>
            <li>My daughter probably won&#x27;t be able to wear them until she is like a year old.</li>
            <li>A rose flower with two small rows of pearl beads and a bow; it is elegant, classy, and cute.</li>
            <li>but it will be very easy to glue back on.</li>
            <li>However they are very large, and probably meant for babies 9-12 months.</li>
            <li>The headbands have a strong chemical smell but outside of that they are beautiful and not cheap looking</li>
            <li>These are perfect for parents who like a simple setup, but want to add a little color to the set.</li>
            <li>SUPER FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li>The headbands were absolutely lovely, even my oldest grand daughter is wearing them, they are so pretty and not cheap</li>
            <li>They look very very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>So big i doest fit on my 6 month old baby girl and the guality was very cheap</li>
            <li>Like other posts mention, they are not tight which is great</li>
            <li>I too noticed a strong chemical smell when I opened the package of each individual headband, but I still thought they were very pretty</li>
            <li>They are simple and elegant.</li>
            <li>soooo cute.i esp love the blue one</li>
            <li>There was hot glue all over</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>The elastic is also nice and wide so it doesn&#x27;t cut into baby&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors.</li>
            <li>These headbands are so pretty.  </li>
            <li>fit my 2 year old.  </li>
            <li>The perfect hair accessory, not too flashy but a piece that will (and has) been noticed.</li>
            <li>When I opened my package I seen them and they wear exactly what I was looking.</li>
            <li>They wear exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I photograph a lot of newborns and love simple accessories.</li>
            <li>I purchased these to further embellish and add more fabric flowers.</li>
            <li>We have several colors to go with many outfits.</li>
            <li>They are exactly how they look in the picture</li>
            <li>They arrived ahead of time, more than 1 month earlier.</li>
            <li>Exactly as the picture.</li>
            <li>but some of pearls need to be reinforced with hot glue before I use them.</li>
            <li>That was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>AND THE BAND IS NOT TOO TIGHT OR LOOSE; IT&#x27;S JUST FITS PERFECT!</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s a tad bit lower quality, okay as long as the price was right.</li>
            <li>but Im glad they are kinda large because she can continue to wear them in the future</li>
            <li>Other than that they are nice.</li>
            <li>its nice individually wrap and so soft the texture.</li>
            <li>The Pearls look awkward,gonna take extra work to make them look cute, they look much cuter in the picture shown</li>
            <li>pretty, fast shipping</li>
            <li>and I know we will be able to wear these for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Also all the fabric pedals are bent on most of them and stick straight up instead of lying flat like it should</li>
            <li>The are so cute and both of my girls will actually wear them (which is normally a challenge).</li>
            <li>I smelled a strong chemical odor before opening the individual packaging.  </li>
            <li>I bought them while I was still pregnant hoping to use them for my baby girl, but I&#x27;m going to have to wait a while because 2 months old and still too large ans gaudy.</li>
            <li>Too large for infants</li>
            <li>Will definitely recommend to anyone who wants pretty comfortable headbands.</li>
            <li>regard to the odor that others have commented on, it&#x27;s true that you can initially smell the hot glue odor, but I found that it dissipated pretty well just from letting them air out.</li>
            <li>Beads were loose, but most of all, the bands  were too large for an infant, which is depicted in the pictures.  </li>
            <li>The headbands are nice but a bit heavy and on the large side.</li>
            <li>I bought them for my 11mos old and it fits her perfectly, nothing uncomfortable and they are almost in every color</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and theres so much these would match with.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>I Received my order really fast</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I really like these, and my photo clients like them.</li>
            <li>I received so much compliments for my daughter wearing those.</li>
            <li>It seems to much for a baby.</li>
            <li>I really do</li>
            <li>If you are purchasing them based on the picture shown do not buy them, you will be very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>DO YOU THINK THE MOM WANTS THEIR BABY ALL OVER CHINA TO SELL HEADBANDS .</li>
            <li>everyone always compliments my LO&#x27;s headbands and wants to know where I buy them.</li>
            <li>Love them..arrived quicker then expected..</li>
            <li>Too big of a band,  doesn&#x27;t fit or stay on</li>
            <li>and  really bring out the outfit</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the design as much</li>
            <li>And i dont mean that in a good way.</li>
            <li>I think as she grows older they will look better, but to big and bulky for a 3mo old.</li>
            <li>The band has fit my daughter since I purchased these when she was 2 months old, but due to the large size of the flower, they looked pretty goofy until recently at 6 months.</li>
            <li>for such a price they are worth buying!</li>
            <li>I really like the colors but was hoping to get coral like shown in the main picture.</li>
            <li>They have been hard to keep on, now that my daughter has hair, but very cute</li>
            <li>Will probably save them for when she is older.  </li>
            <li>I just wish that the band was a liitle smaller so that they woukd fit my 3 mth old.</li>
            <li>These are really cute and come in several different colors.  </li>
            <li>one more suggestion as there were two pink shades- light and dark</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend</li>
            <li>I recommend highly for your baby girl or toddler.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the purchase of these hair bows.  </li>
            <li>These are large on my two year old.</li>
            <li>Package arrived on time and the bows are adorable, however 2 of the little bows have fallen off two of them already and a strand of pearls off another before my daughter got to wear it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait for baby girl to arive to put these on her little head :)</li>
            <li>I have been surprised how fast I get my stuff.</li>
            <li>I normally buy stuff from China all the time.  </li>
            <li>Much too big for a baby - they look funny on her face.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that will just due and are on a budget, I guess it would be fine.  </li>
            <li>Flower was larger than expected so won&#x27;t be able to use until she gets older.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how they fit since my baby isn&#x27;t due for another month</li>
            <li>Little bigger than I thought but nice</li>
            <li>I just hand washed them with a mild handsoap and let them air dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the pearls on these, and the rose in the middle is so squished from the flimsy packaging.</li>
            <li>I love the fabric and the little details of those bands!</li>
            <li>Very soft feel.  </li>
            <li>I bought them for my eight-month-old granddaughter, but the decorations are large enough for an older child also.</li>
            <li>It fits bigger kids as well, so it is not tight (just right size) for her.</li>
            <li>and they were so cheap, When you see them, you would have expected to pay that much for only one, but you get 8, in every color you&#x27;ll ever need to make her look like a Princess.</li>
            <li>We have some other headbands that have a much thinner elastic strap and those leave a distinct line on my baby&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and the flowers are only hot glued to the band</li>
            <li>I especially like the pretty azure blue, light purple, and pink ones.</li>
            <li>The headbands I received were exactly as pictured; however, I received black, white, red, yellow, light pink, bright pink, teal and lavender.</li>
            <li>These are not so big, not small for a kid , and looks very beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the way they are but a little too big.</li>
            <li>they are cute for 6-9 month old babies, a little too big for a newborn or 3 month old.</li>
            <li>except there were not green or gray one.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s sent directly from China, so who knows what the heck it is.  </li>
            <li>- I bought this for my 1 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>Bought these for my granddaughter that&#x27;s 3 month old and</li>
            <li>I ordered these for my 9 months old daughter, and recieved these within a week.</li>
            <li>I have a 2 year old and a 3 month old and they barley</li>
            <li>That was completely unexpected.  </li>
            <li>Came directly from China.</li>
            <li>the material is perfect.fits by 5 month old</li>
            <li>A little bigger than I expected, but very cute.</li>
            <li>So may not be so safe for very small babies.</li>
            <li>These headbands are soft and fit an infants small head.  </li>
            <li>These look elegant for pictures but are way to heavy to wear for around for long.</li>
            <li>Very pretty but the half the beads had fallen off by the time I got them and the rest fell off after wearing 1 time.</li>
            <li>they look very expensive great value for price</li>
            <li>The hair bows were exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>but they look like they will fit a newborn or at least a 3 month old.</li>
            <li>My daughter is small for her age (10 months) but they were still loose fitting.</li>
            <li>If she starts pulling at it, I take it off, but they seem comfortable enough since she usually just ignores them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus they are way to big for my 3 month old.</li>
            <li>I did get some bold colors as well including red, black and yellow.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer the other ones.</li>
            <li>They are cute, but some of them are poorly made and I&#x27;m going to have to glue the beads back in place.</li>
            <li>there a little big for my Infant right now</li>
            <li>These headbands are very cute, but you will have to make the band smaller to fit a baby..not hard to do, just inconvenient.</li>
            <li>For my infant&#x27;s size(7 months at time), they were a little too large for her head even being a stretchy headband.</li>
            <li>Colors include: red, white, yellow, sky blue, light pink, white and dark pink.</li>

            <li> EXCELLENT SELLE, FAST SHIPPING A+++++++</li>
            <li> They are nice and I would recommend them to my friends for their babies .</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t thrilled once I got them though.</li>
            <li> they wore nice.</li>
            <li> It was extremely kind and generous of them to do that.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had liked these</li>
            <li> Such a great buy and amazing quality!!!</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS NICELY MADE</li>
            <li> - COME UP WITH YOUR OWN IDEAS .</li>
            <li> This looks so fancy and are nice quality as well.</li>
            <li> So many cute headbands for a great price.</li>
            <li> I realize they are all packaged up and need time to kind of relax into place, but it wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> even the quality was nice.</li>
            <li> They arrived quick and are just as beautiful as they look in the picture....</li>
            <li> They look very nice in the picture but in person they look/feel cheap and are tacky.</li>
            <li> Do not look cheap, look very nice.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these for a beautiful accent to your baby&#x27;s look!</li>
            <li> Also, it smells very strong.</li>
            <li> They are the perfect size for my 4 month old!</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for something cute for pictures, don&#x27;t make my mistake and spend some more money on a quality headband!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 9 month old.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the six year old though.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> Good for the baby, and most of all I love it for my daughter, so lovely :)</li>
            <li> Quick with deliverly and packing was good.</li>
            <li> They are large and gawdy, so while they make great props, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wearing them out.</li>
            <li> Very cute and price is right!</li>
            <li> It took a while for them to arrive, but they did arrive within the time period that they set, so that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I love love love them.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more soon.</li>
            <li> I love mixing and matching bows with my daughters outfits</li>
            <li> Adorable, just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and the flowers.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I will purchase more from this seller.</li>
            <li> Bought for my baby, and they were huge on her as a newborn, but now at 9 months old, they&#x27;re just about perfect, if I could get her to leave them on!</li>
            <li> Fit a 4 month old and 6 perfectly.  </li>
            <li> They look adorable.  </li>
            <li> But they are cute</li>
            <li> love it and baby loves it</li>
            <li> did you get those lovely headbands?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> a bit lopsided (part of what makes them cute).</li>
            <li> and she will be able to wear them for awhile.</li>
            <li> The flower is okay</li>
            <li> So glad to have these.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The picture makes them look more Victorian and fancy and they just look really goofy.</li>
            <li> These headbands were just adorable.</li>
            <li> We have used them on pets too and they are adorable.</li>
            <li> I think they would be better for babies if we had more pastels.</li>
            <li> I purchased about 60 headbands and bows, but I think these are my favorite.  </li>
            <li> They are so precious.  </li>
            <li> The headband size fits my newborn granddaughter, but will grow with her for many years because they are stretchy.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> I read reviews that mentioned an odor and thought I&#x27;d take a chance, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter love them.</li>
            <li> I purchased these adorable headbands for a friend&#x27;s newborn baby girl.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely satisfied with your customer service.  </li>
            <li> Its more than I xpected.  </li>
            <li> Its okay.</li>
            <li> These were OK, but just not my style.</li>
            <li> I love these bows.</li>
            <li> but they do look quite lovely.  </li>
            <li> my daughter love them..</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> They fit my 6 month old daughter perfectly and worked better than I had hoped for her 6 month photo shoot.</li>
            <li> I love every color on my granddaughter</li>
            <li> Colors were nice however and the size band fit well.</li>
            <li> Not as expected...but ok</li>

            <li> They are adorable headbands .</li>
            <li> i gave them to a friend for her grand daugther</li>
            <li> , i was glad she approvede.</li>
            <li> They look so elegant though.</li>
            <li> I love these headbands I&#x27;ve got so many complimentsand</li>
            <li> I bought these as presents for my cute nieces.</li>
            <li> i love</li>
            <li> Quality was okay</li>
            <li> So lovely lovet lovet presentation</li>
            <li> but they did love them.  </li>
            <li> , I think they would be safe.</li>
            <li> and they look really cute on her.</li>
            <li> Very nicely made, soft &amp; comfortable with gorgeous colors.</li>
            <li> specially because my baby girL didnt get fuzzy they where really comfortable!!  </li>
            <li> as pretty and beautiful as expected and more, size is amazing, color is exact to whats written and it looks awesome on my precious baby .</li>
            <li> Pretty,  lots of good colors.</li>
            <li> An excellent set of headbands, but a long time to arrive.  </li>
            <li> Too big for my newborn (my baby&#x27;s head is averag), but fine around 3/4 months and works great on 2 year olds!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these bows!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price they look great not cheap looking at all, I recommend it, 4 stars because it took 30 days to get it.</li>
            <li> So worth the $10...or more!</li>
            <li> I really liked the headbands they were not too small and all the colors were great my daughter in law loved them</li>
            <li> However, they have worked great for my older models AND my 3 girls enjoy them as well.</li>
            <li> These are so cute - the flower is huge, so they almost make baby look</li>
            <li> lovely and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very cute and such a good price.</li>
            <li> but even my 9 year old can wear them Which is also great..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I was able to get these cute headbands for such a great price.</li>
            <li> The headbands look great on a 3-month old, fit her well, and my sister sent me some adorable pictures of her wearing them.</li>
            <li> She probably will be able to fit them when she&#x27;s 3months or 6months</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a perfect size and will fit her for a long time.</li>
            <li> These are super cute and came in many colors.</li>
            <li> They are very pretty, but the string of pearls breaks very easily.</li>
            <li> but other then that they are perfect.</li>
            <li> Pearls fall off to easy</li>
            <li> and they are fine.</li>
            <li> They run slightly bigger so many not for a newborn but perfect for an older baby</li>
            <li> but my super glue is better than theirs.  </li>
            <li> Super buy!</li>
            <li> They looked super cute on for 2 minutes while we took pictures.</li>
            <li> These are super cute.</li>
            <li> When I held them up to my nose, wow, very strong!  </li>
            <li> Love the bright Yellow !!</li>
            <li> These are huge.</li>
            <li> Nice product, reasonably priced</li>
            <li> She is comfortable wearing it and does not take it off the head.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Very affordable and nice quality.</li>
            <li> They are absolutely adorable and WELL WORTH your money.</li>
            <li> However, if you are getting them for a newborn, they are not going to fit.</li>
            <li> i received one in every colors and they are comfortable on my daughter head.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, they kindly told me to just keep it as a gift.  </li>
            <li> and then they fit..</li>
            <li> I was worried that the pearls would look like cheap plastic pearls</li>
            <li> Really cute, and colorful and festive.</li>
            <li> Smells like chemicals and looks cheap.</li>
            <li> The material  looks cheap and some of the flower came  defected.</li>
            <li> so instead of that if there was one green it would be great.all in one I can say nice and cute and good quality elastic products.</li>
            <li> highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> Headbands are very colorful for babies to wear.</li>
            <li> They are stunning but rather large!</li>
            <li> and although I originally I didn&#x27;t get the product, the seller fixed&lt;br</li>
            <li> truly unique apiece and flattering</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get them</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not quite as pretty as the picture and thus the four stars but for the price they were okay.</li>
            <li> Other than that, they are cute for a good price.</li>
            <li> They make any dressup occasion really special.  </li>
            <li> They are very bright, vibrant, and soft and so pretty.</li>
            <li> so good and clean individual packets  and</li>
            <li> These are cute and fit on older children, as well.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments, and I&#x27;m happy to tell them to jump on Amazon and grab some for their little ones!</li>
            <li> , Only gave 4 stars because I would have loved it if I got the peach colored one shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> If you are using them just for pictures, or you could cut off the pearls pretty easily without damaging the headband</li>
            <li> i bought these for my new grand baby and my other grand daughters like wearing them to, it great thanks.</li>
            <li> but nothing a quick pining can&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> I must have expected more, I honestly just don&#x27;t like these bows at all.</li>
            <li> the pearls were supposed to be glued on because there are huge hot glue globs all over.</li>
            <li> The headbands were very cute and came in enough colors to match everything.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and very stretchy!</li>
            <li> The are very pretty</li>
            <li> Very pretty headbands like the quality and he colors.</li>
            <li> Very pretty bows.</li>
            <li> Too large for toddler but easy to fix.</li>
            <li> I love my new baby headbands.</li>
            <li> These headbands are extremely cute on my new granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> I love these, because they are cute, cheap and they stay in place without crushing by little one&#x27;s rather large head.</li>
            <li> It took some time for me to get the item after I ordered, however when I received them it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I think this is worth the money esp with the price.</li>
            <li> It sure is adorable, he only thing is that the bandsare too big for a baby , this is more for a todler.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> look kind of big on my babies</li>
            <li> It was quite worth it.</li>
            <li> My daughter looks beutiful with these i waited about a month but worth it</li>
            <li> My baby has gotten many compliments on her headbands she must have a larger head because at 3 months they did fit.  </li>
            <li> My daughter probably won&#x27;t be able to wear them until she is like a year old.</li>
            <li> A rose flower with two small rows of pearl beads and a bow; it is elegant, classy, and cute.</li>
            <li> but it will be very easy to glue back on.</li>
            <li> However they are very large, and probably meant for babies 9-12 months.</li>
            <li> The headbands have a strong chemical smell but outside of that they are beautiful and not cheap looking</li>
            <li> These are perfect for parents who like a simple setup, but want to add a little color to the set.</li>
            <li> SUPER FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> The headbands were absolutely lovely, even my oldest grand daughter is wearing them, they are so pretty and not cheap</li>
            <li> They look very very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> So big i doest fit on my 6 month old baby girl and the guality was very cheap</li>
            <li> Like other posts mention, they are not tight which is great</li>
            <li> I too noticed a strong chemical smell when I opened the package of each individual headband, but I still thought they were very pretty</li>
            <li> They are simple and elegant.</li>
            <li> soooo cute.i esp love the blue one</li>
            <li> There was hot glue all over</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> The elastic is also nice and wide so it doesn&#x27;t cut into baby&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors.</li>
            <li> These headbands are so pretty.  </li>
            <li> fit my 2 year old.  </li>
            <li> The perfect hair accessory, not too flashy but a piece that will (and has) been noticed.</li>
            <li> When I opened my package I seen them and they wear exactly what I was looking.</li>
            <li> They wear exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I photograph a lot of newborns and love simple accessories.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to further embellish and add more fabric flowers.</li>
            <li> We have several colors to go with many outfits.</li>
            <li> They are exactly how they look in the picture</li>
            <li> They arrived ahead of time, more than 1 month earlier.</li>
            <li> Exactly as the picture.</li>
            <li> but some of pearls need to be reinforced with hot glue before I use them.</li>
            <li> That was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> AND THE BAND IS NOT TOO TIGHT OR LOOSE; IT&#x27;S JUST FITS PERFECT!</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s a tad bit lower quality, okay as long as the price was right.</li>
            <li> but Im glad they are kinda large because she can continue to wear them in the future</li>
            <li> Other than that they are nice.</li>
            <li> its nice individually wrap and so soft the texture.</li>
            <li> The Pearls look awkward,gonna take extra work to make them look cute, they look much cuter in the picture shown</li>
            <li> pretty, fast shipping</li>
            <li> and I know we will be able to wear these for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Also all the fabric pedals are bent on most of them and stick straight up instead of lying flat like it should</li>
            <li> The are so cute and both of my girls will actually wear them (which is normally a challenge).</li>
            <li> I smelled a strong chemical odor before opening the individual packaging.  </li>
            <li> I bought them while I was still pregnant hoping to use them for my baby girl, but I&#x27;m going to have to wait a while because 2 months old and still too large ans gaudy.</li>
            <li> Too large for infants</li>
            <li> Will definitely recommend to anyone who wants pretty comfortable headbands.</li>
            <li> regard to the odor that others have commented on, it&#x27;s true that you can initially smell the hot glue odor, but I found that it dissipated pretty well just from letting them air out.</li>
            <li> Beads were loose, but most of all, the bands  were too large for an infant, which is depicted in the pictures.  </li>
            <li> The headbands are nice but a bit heavy and on the large side.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my 11mos old and it fits her perfectly, nothing uncomfortable and they are almost in every color</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and theres so much these would match with.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> I Received my order really fast</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I really like these, and my photo clients like them.</li>
            <li> I received so much compliments for my daughter wearing those.</li>
            <li> It seems to much for a baby.</li>
            <li> I really do</li>
            <li> If you are purchasing them based on the picture shown do not buy them, you will be very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> DO YOU THINK THE MOM WANTS THEIR BABY ALL OVER CHINA TO SELL HEADBANDS .</li>
            <li> everyone always compliments my LO&#x27;s headbands and wants to know where I buy them.</li>
            <li> Love them..arrived quicker then expected..</li>
            <li> Too big of a band,  doesn&#x27;t fit or stay on</li>
            <li> and  really bring out the outfit</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the design as much</li>
            <li> And i dont mean that in a good way.</li>
            <li> I think as she grows older they will look better, but to big and bulky for a 3mo old.</li>
            <li> The band has fit my daughter since I purchased these when she was 2 months old, but due to the large size of the flower, they looked pretty goofy until recently at 6 months.</li>
            <li> for such a price they are worth buying!</li>
            <li> I really like the colors but was hoping to get coral like shown in the main picture.</li>
            <li> They have been hard to keep on, now that my daughter has hair, but very cute</li>
            <li> Will probably save them for when she is older.  </li>
            <li> I just wish that the band was a liitle smaller so that they woukd fit my 3 mth old.</li>
            <li> These are really cute and come in several different colors.  </li>
            <li> one more suggestion as there were two pink shades- light and dark</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend</li>
            <li> I recommend highly for your baby girl or toddler.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the purchase of these hair bows.  </li>
            <li> These are large on my two year old.</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time and the bows are adorable, however 2 of the little bows have fallen off two of them already and a strand of pearls off another before my daughter got to wear it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for baby girl to arive to put these on her little head :)</li>
            <li> I have been surprised how fast I get my stuff.</li>
            <li> I normally buy stuff from China all the time.  </li>
            <li> Much too big for a baby - they look funny on her face.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that will just due and are on a budget, I guess it would be fine.  </li>
            <li> Flower was larger than expected so won&#x27;t be able to use until she gets older.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how they fit since my baby isn&#x27;t due for another month</li>
            <li> Little bigger than I thought but nice</li>
            <li> I just hand washed them with a mild handsoap and let them air dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the pearls on these, and the rose in the middle is so squished from the flimsy packaging.</li>
            <li> I love the fabric and the little details of those bands!</li>
            <li> Very soft feel.  </li>
            <li> I bought them for my eight-month-old granddaughter, but the decorations are large enough for an older child also.</li>
            <li> It fits bigger kids as well, so it is not tight (just right size) for her.</li>
            <li> and they were so cheap, When you see them, you would have expected to pay that much for only one, but you get 8, in every color you&#x27;ll ever need to make her look like a Princess.</li>
            <li> We have some other headbands that have a much thinner elastic strap and those leave a distinct line on my baby&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and the flowers are only hot glued to the band</li>
            <li> I especially like the pretty azure blue, light purple, and pink ones.</li>
            <li> The headbands I received were exactly as pictured; however, I received black, white, red, yellow, light pink, bright pink, teal and lavender.</li>
            <li> These are not so big, not small for a kid , and looks very beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the way they are but a little too big.</li>
            <li> they are cute for 6-9 month old babies, a little too big for a newborn or 3 month old.</li>
            <li> except there were not green or gray one.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s sent directly from China, so who knows what the heck it is.  </li>
            <li> - I bought this for my 1 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my granddaughter that&#x27;s 3 month old and</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my 9 months old daughter, and recieved these within a week.</li>
            <li> I have a 2 year old and a 3 month old and they barley</li>
            <li> That was completely unexpected.  </li>
            <li> Came directly from China.</li>
            <li> the material is perfect.fits by 5 month old</li>
            <li> A little bigger than I expected, but very cute.</li>
            <li> So may not be so safe for very small babies.</li>
            <li> These headbands are soft and fit an infants small head.  </li>
            <li> These look elegant for pictures but are way to heavy to wear for around for long.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but the half the beads had fallen off by the time I got them and the rest fell off after wearing 1 time.</li>
            <li> they look very expensive great value for price</li>
            <li> The hair bows were exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> but they look like they will fit a newborn or at least a 3 month old.</li>
            <li> My daughter is small for her age (10 months) but they were still loose fitting.</li>
            <li> If she starts pulling at it, I take it off, but they seem comfortable enough since she usually just ignores them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus they are way to big for my 3 month old.</li>
            <li> I did get some bold colors as well including red, black and yellow.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer the other ones.</li>
            <li> They are cute, but some of them are poorly made and I&#x27;m going to have to glue the beads back in place.</li>
            <li> there a little big for my Infant right now</li>
            <li> These headbands are very cute, but you will have to make the band smaller to fit a baby..not hard to do, just inconvenient.</li>
            <li> For my infant&#x27;s size(7 months at time), they were a little too large for her head even being a stretchy headband.</li>
            <li> Colors include: red, white, yellow, sky blue, light pink, white and dark pink.</li>
            <li> received each of the colors in the photo - dark pink, light pink, blue, black, red, white, yellow, and lavender.</li>
            <li> They are the cutest little headbands and even have a small piece of comfort cloth under the flower so that it doesn&#x27;t hurt your little babies head :)</li>
            <li> They were very professional and apologized that the product did not fit.  </li>
            <li> The quality is good, but they look a little bit cheesy and do not stay in place well because the band is so narrow.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what all of the negative reviews are about.</li>
            <li> They arrived 2 weeks earlier than expected</li>
            <li> does not leave marks on my babys head also, and she can wear it for a long time cus</li>
            <li> I ordered these and was advised of the long wait.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they would be very expensive in a retail store.</li>
            <li> And when you have in infant who may reach up and grab at it on their head, the fact that it comes apart so easily was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I order this for my little baby girl who is 1 and half year old</li>
            <li> The material is very thin but not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Not too tight or too big.</li>
            <li> A little big on my newborns head</li>
            <li> We have a choice of eight different colors to match our little girl&#x27;s prettiest dresses,  The beads make the headbands even dressier.  </li>
            <li> Smelled a little when I opened  it but was gone the next day</li>
            <li> Bands are a little big for a newborn</li>
            <li> but the flower is a little bit big.</li>
            <li> One was a little big</li>
            <li> The only thing that bothered me a little is that they have a string of pearls on them which seems like it would be a choking hazard.  </li>
            <li> There are pastels in the photo, and we received black, white, red, and a few other rather bold/bright colors.</li>
            <li> Not really usable as is.</li>
            <li> Head bands have a rhinestone in the center and a string of pearls on them</li>
            <li> I am going to adjust a couple of them so that she can wear them for her naked baby pictures, and save the rest when she grows into them, but I mean, overall I give the product and the seller both an A++++!</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my baby who is due on the 22 of this month.</li>
            <li> It was cute but it gives my baby&#x27;s forehead a mark from the felt paper fold:(</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m extremely picky.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that I had to trim a few loose threads</li>
            <li> totally not worth the price.</li>
            <li> On one headband the ribbon was sewed on upside down</li>
            <li> Keep coming down to eye.</li>
            <li> IM BRINGING YOU DOWN .  </li>
            <li> The bow kept sliding down.  </li>
            <li> For us they were a total waste of money!!</li>
            <li> These were nicer than I expected!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for my little girl to wear them.</li>
            <li> If it smells a little I&#x27;ll wash it.  </li>
            <li> In pictures of my daughter, my cousin thought I had little hats for her</li>
            <li> Also, I do ensure before each use that the pearls are still secured well, since I wouldn&#x27;t want those to end up in the little one&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li> The flowers are so bit that they fall over her little face.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my little niece as a gift.</li>
            <li> It just seemed poorly made, like the flower wanted to fall apart and the beading wasn&#x27;t holding in very well, and the little thin petal-like parts wouldn&#x27;t stay down.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was a bit larger than I had expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bulky and the button flower is too rough thick with clue</li>
            <li> The material is uneven-</li>
            <li> It saved me the hassle and trouble of returning the product.  </li>
            <li> YOU HAVE BROKEN THE LAW NOT ONLY WITH ME</li>
            <li> so a few of the flowers had to be re-glued after my daughter pulled them off a few times.</li>
            <li> so I just put in a few stiches which you could not tell and now at 5 months I took the stiches out</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I wasted money on this item and now I still don&#x27;t have a gift for her.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re somehow cute but veryyy very poorly made, bad quality and  not quite elastic for babies heads.</li>
            <li> The thin strap is too small to hold the weight of the heavy material and pearls.</li>
            <li> but you could hardly tell.</li>
            <li> but one was broken a little</li>
            <li> but honestly I do not.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with these.</li>
            <li> I have to tie a small knot in them behind her ear</li>
            <li> but that was unfortunately let down when received them.</li>
            <li> Not happy once I received them.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have expected the cheapness of these headbands for the price, but I was very unhappy with them</li>
            <li> Money  wasted. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I bought these, because they&#x27;re expensive...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s uncomfortable for the baby&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Not good for babies. ..!!!</li>
            <li> AND YOU HAVE ILLEGALLY CROPPED OUT THE PHOTOGRAPHERS NAME AND HAVE BLURRED OUT MY RHINESTONE ON MY BOW</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my order, but unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t as I was expecting based on the picture here on the page.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.</li>
            <li> The items were disappointing when they arrived.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order because of the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> However, the headbands  that I received did not have any bad smell to them.</li>
            <li> They are soo ugly that I cannot even put on my baby to take a picture...</li>
            <li> The beads fall off and the glue doesn&#x27;t hold very bad quality</li>
            <li> and it looks horrible.</li>
            <li> These laces look terrible...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great price. Fast shipping. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Nice product, reasonably priced</li>
            <li> I liked it. except there were not green or gray one.</li>
            <li> Very big for a newborn&#x27;s head in both band size and appearance.</li>
            <li> The headbands were very cute and came in enough colors to match everything. On one headband the ribbon was sewed on upside down but you could hardly tell. Very cute for baby pictures!!!</li>
            <li> These headbands are very cute, but you will have to make the band smaller to fit a baby..not hard to do, just inconvenient.</li>
            <li> There is NO way I can put this on my baby!  I smelled a strong chemical odor before opening the individual packaging.  When I held them up to my nose, wow, very strong!  And I got a headache almost immediately after.  I can&#x27;t imagine putting this on my baby, are you kidding me?  And it&#x27;s sent directly from China, so who knows what the heck it is.  No thank you.  I threw them all away.</li>
            <li> The beads fall off and the glue doesn&#x27;t hold very bad quality</li>
            <li> It took a while for them to arrive, but they did arrive within the time period that they set, so that&#x27;s okay I guess. They are cute, but not the best quality. I like that they don&#x27;t stretch out after using.</li>
            <li> I love my new baby headbands. They arrived 2 weeks earlier than expected and they look just like the photograph. I love love love them. I will be purchasing more soon. thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> These headbands are soft and fit an infants small head.  The string of plastic pearls adds a dressy touch to outfits.  I would definitely recommend purchasing these headbands.</li>
            <li> I sent these to my daughter for my baby granddaughter. She loves them! She always has whichever color is needed to wear to compliment any outfit! Comfortable and very stretchy!</li>
            <li> It took some time for me to get the item after I ordered, however when I received them it was well worth the wait. They look very very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt; - I bought this for my 1 yr old daughter. It fits bigger kids as well, so it is not tight (just right size) for her. She is comfortable wearing it and does not take it off the head.&lt;br /&gt;- These are not so big, not small for a kid , and looks very beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- It has some beads on it. So may not be so safe for very small babies.</li>
            <li> i lOve them!! specially because my baby girL didnt get fuzzy they where really comfortable!!  she gets to match every alfit that she wears! ^_^</li>
            <li> Each one is prettier than the last. Bright and beautiful and although I originally I didn&#x27;t get the product, the seller fixed&lt;br /&gt;that and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The quality is good, but they look a little bit cheesy and do not stay in place well because the band is so narrow. I prefer the wider band. The are very pretty and you get a lot of colors for the price.</li>
            <li> I just received these in the mail. They are soooo cute! I love mixing and matching bows with my daughters outfits and theres so much these would match with.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy these on here, but see just ONE going for $7-8 on Etsy.  I&#x27;ve gotten use out of these and even ended up using for her 6 month photo shoot.  They&#x27;re a perfect size and will fit her for a long time.</li>
            <li> Adorable, just what I was looking for. Very affordable and nice quality. I can&#x27;t wait for my little girl to wear them.</li>
            <li> its nice individually wrap and so soft the texture. Good for the baby, and most of all I love it for my daughter, so lovely :)</li>
            <li> This order came within 2 weeks from China. I love the colors and the flowers. They are simple and elegant. Colors include: red, white, yellow, sky blue, light pink, white and dark pink. I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> i bought these for my new grand baby and my other grand daughters like wearing them to, it great thanks.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful and go so well with all the outfits I use! I originally bought them for newborn photography but, and as I was a little worried about, these were just a little too big for that. However, they have worked great for my older models AND my 3 girls enjoy them as well.</li>
            <li> I normally buy stuff from China all the time.  If it smells a little I&#x27;ll wash it.  If it&#x27;s a tad bit lower quality, okay as long as the price was right. This time was different.  The fabric was frayed.  The pearls were detached.  The elastic was flimsy.  Be prepared to take out your glue gun.</li>
            <li> as pretty and beautiful as expected and more, size is amazing, color is exact to whats written and it looks awesome on my precious baby . truly unique apiece and flattering</li>
            <li> I love it I think this is worth the money esp with the price. does not leave marks on my babys head also, and she can wear it for a long time cus it is THAT flexible! soooo cute.i esp love the blue one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting for these headbands for weeks. I was so excited to get them and they arrived yesterday and I was so upset! The pearls were all hanging off the flowers so I had to go back and re-glue them back on. There was hot glue all over and you can see were the pearls were supposed to be glued on because there are huge hot glue globs all over. And the flower, doesn&#x27;t even look like a flower. It looks like a ball of fabric on a headband. Not like the picture AT ALL! I am so upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waist your time or money on these.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with these. They came all scrunched together and still look wrinkled after leaving them out of the package.</li>
            <li> These headbands are extremely cute on my new granddaughter.  The selection of colors is terrific too.  Very pleased!!  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my Daugther. They are stunning but rather large! My daughter is small for her age (10 months) but they were still loose fitting. Love the bright Yellow !! I have to tie a small knot in them behind her ear but other then that they are perfect. Quick with deliverly and packing was good. I will purchase more from this seller.</li>
            <li> I love these, because they are cute, cheap and they stay in place without crushing by little one&#x27;s rather large head.</li>
            <li> Bought for my baby, and they were huge on her as a newborn, but now at 9 months old, they&#x27;re just about perfect, if I could get her to leave them on! Love them!</li>
            <li> Fit a 4 month old and 6 perfectly.  They look adorable.  Very soft feel.  Cutest head bands I found. Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> It sure is adorable, he only thing is that the bandsare too big for a baby , this is more for a todler.  But they are cute</li>
            <li> Very cute bows. They have been hard to keep on, now that my daughter has hair, but very cute and I would definitely order them for a friend!</li>
            <li> gorgeous my daughter gets so many complements.</li>
            <li> I really liked the headbands they were not too small and all the colors were great my daughter in law loved them</li>
            <li> They are the cutest little headbands and even have a small piece of comfort cloth under the flower so that it doesn&#x27;t hurt your little babies head :)</li>
            <li> I thought these would be pretty, but they are absolutely beautiful! Well worth the money. I&#x27;m sure they would be very expensive in a retail store.</li>
            <li> love it and baby loves it great buy goes with many of her outfits loved the variety of colors and the price was great!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re somehow cute but veryyy very poorly made, bad quality and  not quite elastic for babies heads. I&#x27;m sorry I bought these, because they&#x27;re expensive... totally not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Too large for infants</li>
            <li> They arrived quick and are just as beautiful as they look in the picture....for such a price they are worth buying! I bought them for my 11mos old and it fits her perfectly, nothing uncomfortable and they are almost in every color so I have a matching headband for almost every dress!!</li>
            <li> My 8 months baby looking more beautiful by using matching band with dress. The product is very good as per the price.</li>
            <li> All day, everywhere we go, I hear &amp;#34;Where did you get those lovely headbands?&amp;#34; Whether its running errands, buying groceries, Dr visits, etc...everyone is amazed at how gorgeous these headbands are- and they were so cheap, When you see them, you would have expected to pay that much for only one, but you get 8, in every color you&#x27;ll ever need to make her look like a Princess.</li>
            <li> These were all individually packed and when I photograph baby girls the mothers see me taking them out of the package and let them take the hair band with them home.  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> These are large on my two year old. I bought it for my newborn. Other than that, they are cute for a good price.</li>
            <li> These are so cute - the flower is huge, so they almost make baby look a bit lopsided (part of what makes them cute). In pictures of my daughter, my cousin thought I had little hats for her, that&#x27;s how big it is. The band has fit my daughter since I purchased these when she was 2 months old, but due to the large size of the flower, they looked pretty goofy until recently at 6 months. The elastic is also nice and wide so it doesn&#x27;t cut into baby&#x27;s head. We have some other headbands that have a much thinner elastic strap and those leave a distinct line on my baby&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regard to the odor that others have commented on, it&#x27;s true that you can initially smell the hot glue odor, but I found that it dissipated pretty well just from letting them air out. Also, I do ensure before each use that the pearls are still secured well, since I wouldn&#x27;t want those to end up in the little one&#x27;s mouth. If she starts pulling at it, I take it off, but they seem comfortable enough since she usually just ignores them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received each of the colors in the photo - dark pink, light pink, blue, black, red, white, yellow, and lavender.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just like the picture. A little big on my newborns head but nothing a quick pining can&#x27;t fix and she will be able to wear them for awhile.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my granddaughter that&#x27;s 3 month old and the head band piece is to big.  The flowers are so bit that they fall over her little face.  Will probably save them for when she is older.  Pretty colors.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my baby who is due on the 22 of this month. They are absolutely adorable and WELL WORTH your money. However, if you are getting them for a newborn, they are not going to fit. They run big. I am going to adjust a couple of them so that she can wear them for her naked baby pictures, and save the rest when she grows into them, but I mean, overall I give the product and the seller both an A++++! Also, my estimated date of delivery was January 23- February 9! SUPER FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> The headbands have a strong chemical smell but outside of that they are beautiful and not cheap looking I can&#x27;t say how they fit since my baby isn&#x27;t due for another month but they look like they will fit a newborn or at least a 3 month old.</li>
            <li> Very well made. Not too tight or too big. The color variety was perfect. Highly recommend these for a beautiful accent to your baby&#x27;s look!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bulky and the button flower is too rough thick with clue it&#x27;s uncomfortable for the baby&#x27;s head. The flower is okay</li>
            <li> These headbands are so pretty.  They make any dressup occasion really special.  We have a choice of eight different colors to match our little girl&#x27;s prettiest dresses,  The beads make the headbands even dressier.  So glad to have these.</li>
            <li> The headbands are nice but a bit heavy and on the large side. Also concerned about the beading if they should come lose causing a choking hazard.</li>
            <li> they are nice I just wish that the band was a liitle smaller so that they woukd fit my 3 mth old. I will just have to wait for her to grow into them.</li>
            <li> Cute and fit great! Smelled a little when I opened  it but was gone the next day</li>
            <li> I love these headbands!  They are gorgeous.  I bought them for my eight-month-old granddaughter, but the decorations are large enough for an older child also.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my 9 months old daughter, and recieved these within a week. Very nicely packed, very good quality , they fit so well and look amazingly beautiful.</li>
            <li> lovely and comfortable. looks great on my daughters. Will definitely recommend to anyone who wants pretty comfortable headbands. Love it.</li>
            <li> This headband is gorgeous. The material is very thin but not bad at all. They are all put together perfectly  &amp; I have had a lot of awesome compliments. Packaging was a plus.</li>
            <li> They did not look like the picture at all. And i dont mean that in a good way. The picture makes them look more Victorian and fancy and they just look really goofy.</li>
            <li> i Love the headbands!!!!!! i received one in every colors and they are comfortable on my daughter head. i get complements all the time, but they did have this chemical smell when i 1st opened the package but its gone now... i highly recommend</li>
            <li> I Received my order really fast and although the headbands did have an odor to them I just hand washed them with a mild handsoap and let them air dry and they are fine. I will need to alter the size for my baby girl for now but Im glad they are kinda large because she can continue to wear them in the future, Only gave 4 stars because I would have loved it if I got the peach colored one shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> They are big.  I have a 2 year old and a 3 month old and they barley fit my 2 year old.  They run big and are shipped from China.  Two fell apart before I got them out of the bag but my super glue is better than theirs.  Not the best buy.</li>
            <li> I order this for my little baby girl who is 1 and half year old and I received them yesterday.Fast shipping I can say and It has good quality and looks gr8 on my baby girl.would recommend the product to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just one more suggestion as there were two pink shades- light and dark so instead of that if there was one green it would be great.all in one I can say nice and cute and good quality elastic products.</li>
            <li> Beautiful headbands!! So worth the $10...or more! They are the perfect size for my 4 month old! Great quality! Can&#x27;t wait to show them off!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SELLE, FAST SHIPPING A+++++++</li>
            <li> Not good for babies. ..!!! Keep coming down to eye.</li>
            <li> Headbands are very colorful for babies to wear. They are nice and I would recommend them to my friends for their babies .</li>
            <li> Giving these 3 stars only because of the size. They are very bright, vibrant, and soft and so pretty. However they are very large, and probably meant for babies 9-12 months. I bought them while I was still pregnant hoping to use them for my baby girl, but I&#x27;m going to have to wait a while because 2 months old and still too large ans gaudy.</li>
            <li> Even nicer than I expect .  Luv them</li>
            <li> Very cute and such a good price.</li>
            <li> The items were disappointing when they arrived.  The packaging smashed the items.  Beads were loose, but most of all, the bands  were too large for an infant, which is depicted in the pictures.  Not really usable as is.</li>
            <li> These headbands were just adorable. Very nicely made, soft &amp; comfortable with gorgeous colors. I recommend highly for your baby girl or toddler.</li>
            <li> Love the variety of colors! Bands are a little big for a newborn but I just knotted it and it worked and she&#x27;ll wear them as she grows. Lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> Very cute headbands but look kind of big on my babies head. I think as she grows older they will look better, but to big and bulky for a 3mo old.</li>
            <li> Lovely...I will order them again</li>
            <li> I have used these more than any of her bows! I strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product and seller!</li>
            <li> pretty, fast shipping</li>
            <li> These headbands are simply my favorite headbands; I bought them for my daughter but the elastic band allows me the ability to wear them as well, which I appreciate because I think the design is beautiful. A rose flower with two small rows of pearl beads and a bow; it is elegant, classy, and cute. The perfect hair accessory, not too flashy but a piece that will (and has) been noticed. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very cute and price is right! Material is good quality and fits perfect. Get compliments all the time! Love them!</li>
            <li> I really like these, and my photo clients like them. they are cute for 6-9 month old babies, a little too big for a newborn or 3 month old. We have used them on pets too and they are adorable. The only thing I noticed though, was that the colors advertised here were not what we received. There are pastels in the photo, and we received black, white, red, and a few other rather bold/bright colors. Only 2 of them were pastels. I think they would be better for babies if we had more pastels.</li>
            <li> I purchased about 60 headbands and bows, but I think these are my favorite.  They are so precious.  The headband size fits my newborn granddaughter, but will grow with her for many years because they are stretchy.  I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> The headbands I received were exactly as pictured; however, I received black, white, red, yellow, light pink, bright pink, teal and lavender. I really like the colors but was hoping to get coral like shown in the main picture. I read reviews that mentioned an odor and thought I&#x27;d take a chance, and I&#x27;m glad I did. Mine had no odor to them at all (I did hand wash them before use anyhow just because you never know what they may have had contact with). Like other posts mention, they are not tight which is great so she can get more use out of them! I&#x27;m very happy with them! Just wish I had one in coral</li>
            <li> So big i doest fit on my 6 month old baby girl and the guality was very cheap</li>
            <li> I guess I should have expected the cheapness of these headbands for the price, but I was very unhappy with them and I would not use them in a picture.  The fabric is thin and frayed, and the pearl accents are extremely cheap.  If you&#x27;re looking for something that will just due and are on a budget, I guess it would be fine.  But if you&#x27;re looking for something cute for pictures, don&#x27;t make my mistake and spend some more money on a quality headband!</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter love them. Beautiful and assorted colors</li>
            <li> NOT TO HAPPY YOU STOLE MY IMAGE AND THEN PHOTOSHOP MY LOGO OFF THE IMAGE. I DID NOT GIVE PERMISSION FOR THIS IMAGES TO BE USED FOR ADVERTISING...PERIOD!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these bows! Wasn&#x27;t thrilled once I got them though. The material is uneven- the &amp;#34;pearls&amp;#34; hang and are lose. For us they were a total waste of money!! We don&#x27;t use them. They just look tacky</li>
            <li> they wore nice. but one was broken a little</li>
            <li> The Headbands are so cute, just perfect for baby. Looks like retro style hat. Very good looks on baby. good quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased these adorable headbands for a friend&#x27;s newborn baby girl.  Unfortunately, it was a bit larger than I had expected.  So I proceeded to return the product.  Customer service got back to me immediately. They were very professional and apologized that the product did not fit.  Much to my surprise, they kindly told me to just keep it as a gift.  That was completely unexpected.  It was extremely kind and generous of them to do that.  It saved me the hassle and trouble of returning the product.  I was extremely satisfied with your customer service.  I would definitely buy from KnowDeals again in the future.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I ordered these and was advised of the long wait. It was quite worth it. These are super cute and came in many colors.</li>
            <li> Pearls fall off to easy</li>
            <li> When I opened my package I seen them and they wear exactly what I was looking. They wear exactly as described.</li>
            <li> They are very pretty, but the string of pearls breaks very easily.</li>
            <li> Pretty,  lots of good colors.</li>
            <li> Its more than I xpected.  its amaizing and beautiful.  My  daughter looks beautiful whem I put it on her she gets lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> I received so much compliments for my daughter wearing those.</li>
            <li> I ordered these headbands for my not-yet-born baby..I can&#x27;t wait to see them on her &amp;#60;3..I love the fabric and the little details of those bands! I&#x27;m trying to resist using them before my baby arrives :P</li>
            <li> It seems to much for a baby. I don&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li> Looks just like picture.</li>
            <li> Little bigger than I thought but nice</li>
            <li> Quality is good, beautiful colors and the right price.</li>
            <li> I wish I had liked these I really do but honestly I do not. They look very nice in the picture but in person they look/feel cheap and are tacky. I am so dissapointed!! Plus they are way to big for my 3 month old. If you are purchasing them based on the picture shown do not buy them, you will be very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Its okay. Not happy once I received them.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I got all of these beautiful hair pieces for that price! Such a great buy and amazing quality!!!</li>
            <li> I photograph a lot of newborns and love simple accessories. These are perfect for parents who like a simple setup, but want to add a little color to the set. They are large and gawdy, so while they make great props, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wearing them out.</li>
            <li> Some of the pearls are chipped and the flower came off of one, not that impressed.</li>
            <li> Very pretty headbands like the quality and he colors. Would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> These were OK, but just not my style. I sold them to another woman and she loved them.</li>
            <li> I love these bows. Quality is as one would expect with the price. I would buy again &amp; recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to go with outfits I was giving at a baby shower.  They haven&#x27;t been used yet so I can&#x27;t comment on how well they work but they do look quite lovely.  They&#x27;re not quite as pretty as the picture and thus the four stars but for the price they were okay.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but the half the beads had fallen off by the time I got them and the rest fell off after wearing 1 time.</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time and the bows are adorable, however 2 of the little bows have fallen off two of them already and a strand of pearls off another before my daughter got to wear it. Also all the fabric pedals are bent on most of them and stick straight up instead of lying flat like it should and it looks horrible.I would not order these again.</li>
            <li> I must have expected more, I honestly just don&#x27;t like these bows at all. They are bigger than I thought and some were even coming apart when I received them. They came in good time, I&#x27;m not bashing the company just the product.</li>
            <li> PERFECT HEAD BANDS FOR MY 2 GIRLS!!  THE PRODUCT IS NICELY MADE AND THE BAND IS NOT TOO TIGHT OR LOOSE; IT&#x27;S JUST FITS PERFECT! THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> You stole my photo and headband from my etsy store and to claim it as yours ? I AM FURIOUS .  [...]  THIS IS MY PHOTO AND YOU HAVE ILLEGALLY CROPPED OUT THE PHOTOGRAPHERS NAME AND HAVE BLURRED OUT MY RHINESTONE ON MY BOW - COME UP WITH YOUR OWN IDEAS . YOU HAVE BROKEN THE LAW NOT ONLY WITH ME BUT WITH THE PHOTOGRAPHER AND DO YOU THINK THE MOM WANTS THEIR BABY ALL OVER CHINA TO SELL HEADBANDS . IM BRINGING YOU DOWN .  ALSO CONTACTING AMAZON .</li>
            <li> I purchased these to further embellish and add more fabric flowers. They are perfect for this project.&lt;br /&gt;Pricing was okay, but shipping cost force me to charge more for my end product.</li>
            <li> everyone always compliments my LO&#x27;s headbands and wants to know where I buy them. This looks so fancy and are nice quality as well. We have several colors to go with many outfits.</li>
            <li> Love them..arrived quicker then expected.. my daughter love them.. there a little big for my Infant right now but I just tied the bottom of them and then they fit.. but even my 9 year old can wear them Which is also great.. they are simply beautiful</li>
            <li> I love these. They look so good on my daughter. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the way they are but a little too big.</li>
            <li> Super buy! So many cute headbands for a great price. The colors are so bright. I bought these for newborn photo props.</li>
            <li> An excellent set of headbands, but a long time to arrive.  Came directly from China.</li>
            <li> Just got these in the mail and they look AWESOME!  I can&#x27;t wait for baby girl to arive to put these on her little head :)</li>
            <li> These bows are even more beautiful than described in the post.  They are exactly how they look in the picture and I know we will be able to wear these for a long time.  I was very impressed and would recommend these to anyone!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah</li>
            <li> I absolutely *LOVE* these headbands! They fit my 6 month old daughter perfectly and worked better than I had hoped for her 6 month photo shoot. We&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments, and I&#x27;m happy to tell them to jump on Amazon and grab some for their little ones!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re beautiful and good quality.&lt;br /&gt;my grand daughter looks beautiful wearing them. She has one for every occasion.&lt;br /&gt;It was as good deal.</li>
            <li> Too big of a band,  doesn&#x27;t fit or stay on</li>
            <li> these are BEAUTIFUL!!!!  they look very expensive great value for price highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> I was sooo looking forward to getting these but that was unfortunately let down when received them. For my infant&#x27;s size(7 months at time), they were a little too large for her head even being a stretchy headband. It just seemed poorly made, like the flower wanted to fall apart and the beading wasn&#x27;t holding in very well, and the little thin petal-like parts wouldn&#x27;t stay down. I realize they are all packaged up and need time to kind of relax into place, but it wasn&#x27;t working. And when you have in infant who may reach up and grab at it on their head, the fact that it comes apart so easily was disappointing. Maybe it&#x27;s just my order, but unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t as I was expecting based on the picture here on the page. Sorry. She doesn&#x27;t wear them. Money  wasted. :(</li>
            <li> Very pretty bows. I was worried that the pearls would look like cheap plastic pearls but when they arrived I was very pleased with the quality of the bow for the value.</li>
            <li> It was cute but it gives my baby&#x27;s forehead a mark from the felt paper fold:(</li>
            <li> I love every color on my granddaughter</li>
            <li> These laces look terrible... They are soo ugly that I cannot even put on my baby to take a picture... Also, it smells very strong.</li>
            <li> Much too big for a baby - they look funny on her face. Colors were nice however and the size band fit well.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what all of the negative reviews are about. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t listen to them! They are amazingly beautiful!! Perfect for my 9 month old. And I&#x27;m extremely picky.</li>
            <li> The hair bows were exactly what I expected. I have been surprised how fast I get my stuff. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Not as expected...but ok</li>
            <li> The Pearls look awkward,gonna take extra work to make them look cute, they look much cuter in the picture shown</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorite purchases! I can&#x27;t believe that I was able to get these cute headbands for such a great price. The are so cute and both of my girls will actually wear them (which is normally a challenge). I have had one that the pearls came off on but it will be very easy to glue back on. I love that I have one for every outfit.</li>
            <li> Beautiful  headbands!  They look absolutely fantastic on my precious grandbaby!!!</li>
            <li> These look elegant for pictures but are way to heavy to wear for around for long. The thin strap is too small to hold the weight of the heavy material and pearls. The bow kept sliding down.  They looked super cute on for 2 minutes while we took pictures. I am pleased with them.</li>
            <li> I Love it! Nice product, good price for the quantities but the flower is a little bit big. My daughter is so cute with it.</li>
            <li> These are just ad beautiful in person ad they r in the picture. My grandZughtet will love then. Will be ordering more for gifts.</li>
            <li> Low priced. Good quality</li>
            <li> I got my order from Lucky7always seller. The headbands were shipped from China. They arrived ahead of time, more than 1 month earlier. I was hesitant to order because of the bad reviews. However, the headbands  that I received did not have any bad smell to them. The headbands are good quality. I especially like the pretty azure blue, light purple, and pink ones. I did get some bold colors as well including red, black and yellow.  I bought this for my little niece as a gift. The headbands look great on a 3-month old, fit her well, and my sister sent me some adorable pictures of her wearing them.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the purchase of these hair bows.  They are absolutely adorable. Great price, and fantastic quality. They are simply great!</li>
            <li> So perfect. Do plan on ordering another set. Do not look cheap, look very nice. Too large for toddler but easy to fix. Perfect for the six year old though.</li>
            <li> They are adorable headbands . They run slightly bigger so many not for a newborn but perfect for an older baby</li>
            <li> I bought these along with another set of 10 Chiffion Flower Head Bands. I much prefer the other ones. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the pearls on these, and the rose in the middle is so squished from the flimsy packaging. I probably won&#x27;t be using these.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter was already beautiful, and these hair ornaments just drew more attention her way.  Really cute, and colorful and festive.</li>
            <li> Too big for my newborn (my baby&#x27;s head is averag), but fine around 3/4 months and works great on 2 year olds!</li>
            <li> Is really pretty,  I bought it for mi niece in Panama and it fits perfectly and her mom loves it.</li>
            <li> i gave them to a friend for her grand daugther and she loved them and posted the baby on facebook, i was glad she approvede.</li>
            <li> My daughter looks beutiful with these i waited about a month but worth it even the quality was nice. Exactly as the picture. And excellent for the price cheap and great quality!</li>
            <li> Loved these. My only complaint was that I had to trim a few loose threads and the flowers are only hot glued to the band so a few of the flowers had to be re-glued after my daughter pulled them off a few times. They look so elegant though.</li>
            <li> I too noticed a strong chemical smell when I opened the package of each individual headband, but I still thought they were very pretty and so I just sprayed some Lysol on them, hand washed them, and left them outside to air out and problem was solved. My baby has gotten many compliments on her headbands she must have a larger head because at 3 months they did fit.  One was a little big so I just put in a few stiches which you could not tell and now at 5 months I took the stiches out and they fit perfect. In my opinion they are just like in the picture and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.</li>
            <li> I love these headbands I&#x27;ve got so many complimentsand and  really bring out the outfit so I recommend them to everyone</li>
            <li> I bought these as presents for my cute nieces. Very nice and beautiful to match their outfits. A lot of good compliments .</li>
            <li> Smells like chemicals and looks cheap. I am embarrassed to bring to my sisters baby shower as a gift. I can&#x27;t believe I wasted money on this item and now I still don&#x27;t have a gift for her.</li>
            <li> i love them.they are perfect!the price is great and the material is perfect.fits by 5 month old good.dosnt leave a mark around her head either</li>
            <li> Beautiful, seem to be well made, havent used them yet as our princess isnt here yet, but cant wait to use them :-)</li>
            <li> The headbands were absolutely lovely, even my oldest grand daughter is wearing them, they are so pretty and not cheap looking either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerly Pamela Woodward</li>
            <li> Flower was larger than expected so won&#x27;t be able to use until she gets older. Quality was okay but some of pearls need to be reinforced with hot glue before I use them.</li>
            <li> These are adorable and my daughter keeps them on!!</li>
            <li> Head bands have a rhinestone in the center and a string of pearls on them you can&#x27;t tell that from the picture my daughter hasn&#x27;t wore them yet there to big. She probably will be able to fit them when she&#x27;s 3months or 6months</li>
            <li> Great product for the price they look great not cheap looking at all, I recommend it, 4 stars because it took 30 days to get it.</li>
            <li> So lovely lovet lovet presentation so good and clean individual packets  and my friends like and they goint to buy some of these ones 👍😀😀</li>
            <li> get lots of compliments when baby girl wears one of these! lots of colors to go with several outfits!  dresses up any outfit</li>
            <li> These are really cute and come in several different colors.  I got them for someone else so I can&#x27;t say how they hold up but they did love them.  The only thing that bothered me a little is that they have a string of pearls on them which seems like it would be a choking hazard.  If you are using them just for pictures, or you could cut off the pearls pretty easily without damaging the headband, I think they would be safe.</li>
            <li> each headband is beautiful. to have. I am very happy bought them. That was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The material  looks cheap and some of the flower came  defected.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the design as much but they&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my baby girl and they look really cute on her. They r just a bit big.</li>
            <li> These are huge. My daughter probably won&#x27;t be able to wear them until she is like a year old. They are cute, but some of them are poorly made and I&#x27;m going to have to glue the beads back in place. Other than that they are nice.</li>
            <li> We have received many compliments when my daughter wears them!</li>
            <li> These are super cute. We get lots of compliments when she&#x27;s wearing them.</li>
            <li> gave as a gift, she loved them</li>
            <li> A little bigger than I expected, but very cute.</li>
            <li> These were nicer than I expected!!</li>
            <li> These are cute and fit on older children, as well.</li>
