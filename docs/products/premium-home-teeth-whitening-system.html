            <li>Use the LED for best results.</li>
            <li>for the product itself -- WONDERFUL!  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent kit.</li>
            <li>They work great</li>
            <li>You will still get great results.  </li>
            <li>I was exceptionally vigilant not to eat or drink anything that could stain my teeth for the duration of the 11 days I used the product.</li>
            <li>Very light coat and avoid gums.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t keep the trays in my mouth for more than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off swigging with gasoline that using this</li>
            <li>and it had a cute carrying case to keep everything in.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t keep the trays in my mouth for more than 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Still; you can minimize gum contact by making sure you don&#x27;t overfill the trays.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I think the results a pretty good and product life use will be 2yrs</li>
            <li>Trays are good enough and the peroxide is potent!</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re free</li>
            <li>but if you have really healthy gums that don&#x27;t bleed no matter how much you floss or pick; then you might find as I did that this stuff is more like a bubbly tickle.  </li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this product to family and friends :)!!</li>

            <li>I was so excited to use this product when it came in the mail</li>
            <li>It will not seem like you are applying much, if any at all, but the product is so strong that&#x27;s all it takes.  </li>
            <li>I bought this on a Groupon for $29.99 and its well worth it.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>The people complaining about the burning on their gums aren&#x27;t doing if right.</li>
            <li>I barely put any whitening gel at all in the trays since it was going to be the first time using it, but as soon as I was putting the top tray in my mouth it burnt my gums and gave me a blister.</li>
            <li>I purchased a similar company&#x27;s product from living social about 3 years ago to whiten teeth before wedding, that worked amazingly!</li>
            <li>more yellow</li>
            <li>/&gt;Place gel on q-tip first and rub on teeth surfaces.</li>
            <li>I purposely only whitened the first 6 teeth top and bottom the first time</li>
            <li>and after some research, it would seem that it doesn&#x27;t really have much of an affect on the end result or in how quickly one will reach their desired results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Occasionally, I do get a little on my gum line and it tingles and feels like little rubber bands snapping away at my gum; but not painful for me at all - more akin to that good feeling</li>
            <li>I would reccommend getting two kits if your teeth are more yellow than normal.  </li>
            <li>I had to avoid certain areas while brushing.</li>
            <li>After using the product for one hour each day (no blue light), my teeth started to look *</li>
            <li>I much prefer the swabs.  </li>
            <li>I bought this through a Groupon for $25 plus free lifetime refills (the refills of which is the only part of the deal I&#x27;m on the fence about...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even use a lot of gel since this was the first time using this new product.</li>
            <li>I figured it was normal and didnt think much of it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this off of groupon and the second I put the tray with the whitening gel in on my top teeth it started to burn and turn my gums white and blister!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve NEVER had gum issues and after wearing the trays for about 20 seconds, I had a big fat white blister on my top gum.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend not using this.</li>
            <li>I thought it was normal</li>
            <li>People complain so much about a Cheap Product that professionally will cost you from $200 to $600 bucks at the dentist just because it doesnt change your teeth from yellow to white in a couple applications.</li>
            <li>used the blue light one; but my lips got dried out and cracked (there was also a whole lot of drooling going on ;))</li>
            <li>can only whiten to a certain point.</li>
            <li>My understanding is that certain discolorations cannot be bleached externally, so you may be wasting your money by trying.)  </li>
            <li>My understanding is that certain discolorations cannot be bleached externally, so you may be wasting your money by trying.)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll wait a few months and try Crest whitestrips to see if I can regain the whiteness I used to enjoy.</li>
            <li>The company selling this product should have a class action law suit filed against them.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wash my gums off fast enough.</li>
            <li>The molding that comes with it dips in hot water to mold to your teeth but is still a bit loose.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also read some questionable comments about Dazzling White&#x27;s billing process, so I&#x27;m a bit weary about giving them my credit card number</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even lightning my one stubborn tooth that has some minor internal staining -- it continues to get lighter as I continue on with my treatments and is catching up steadily with my other teeth which have slowed down in their whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure for some people it would be painful and may cause tissue damage (which I think is the primary issue with getting this stuff on your gums)</li>
            <li>So when I thought I could use another round of whitening I was excited to see what I thought was the same product on living social again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just stick to my crest white strips and professional whitening.</li>
            <li>My teeth weren&#x27;t all that yellow to begin with, but I hadn&#x27;t whitened my teeth for about 10 years and wanted to brighten my smile just a little.</li>
            <li>The first day I tried bleaching my teeth, it seemed to burn a little</li>
            <li>The first day I tried using the at home system, it seemed to burn a little.  </li>
            <li>I have used ten times and the gel level has barely moved.</li>

            <li> I had custom trays made long ago but wanted to try these anyway.</li>
            <li> And it usually takes a couple of weeks to get completely whitened.</li>
            <li> Good thing that much money wasn&#x27;t wasted on this horrible product.</li>
            <li> I used to pay high money for bleeching my teeth, NO MORE!.</li>
            <li> If you have one oddly colored tooth that seems stained on the inside, definitely have your dentist determine the cause.  </li>

            <li> Worst mouth pain I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> A few days later those areas died and sloughed off!!!  </li>
            <li> alright, minus the shipping fee which seems a bit overpriced.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hanging on to it in case I decide to give it another try but not really sold on its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use the blue gel too, whitening is harsh on the teeth.</li>
            <li> I notice the initial burn goes away after a few minutes if you can stand it that long, but the blisters will bother you for a few days.</li>
            <li> You only need a very little amount added to the tray; your teeth will displace the gel and the gel itself seems to expand and bubble up a bit as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, When I shaped the trays they are still a little loose.</li>
            <li> Probably not, just turn down the heat and don&#x27;t put it so close to the flames.</li>
            <li> they said I could have used \\&quot;each tray requires less than .5 mL\\&quot;.....</li>
            <li> but I was a little over zealous with the gel</li>
            <li> The second day of the treatment was 10x worse.  </li>
            <li> I took out the mouth pieces after a few minutes because I could no longer take the pain.</li>
            <li> My teeth are not straight so you can tell the teeth that tend to be crowded behind the others are less whitened</li>
            <li> Just trying to save a little money and ruined my gums!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not supposed to coat it on your teeth, just a small dot for each tooth.</li>
            <li> Worst case I got some more peroxide.  </li>
            <li> I will say that though confusing instructions and a bit of a gum burning sensation after one application my teeth are noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> However, after putting some common sense into equation I figured out an alternative that does not burn and will extend the use of your product</li>
            <li> They turned white and went completely numb.</li>
            <li> does that mean you will never grill a steak again?</li>
            <li> Shame on this company for selling such a terrible product, I will be contacting living social for an immediate refund and to raise awareness to the terribleness of this product.</li>
            <li> If your looking for subtle results this is the ticket.</li>
            <li> (Not for the shaky hand type folks).</li>
            <li> The gel burned my gums so badly that they turned white.</li>

            <li> Luckily I only had the product in my mouth for 10 minutes; the stinging I was experiencing on my gums was so painful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost a week later and its still painful to brush.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it was Groupon and the price was right, but the product is just terrible.</li>
            <li> Agree with burn victims, that sounds weird...  </li>
            <li> I saw noticeable results on session #3; my &#x27;difficult tooth&#x27; started whitening around session #4 or 5.  </li>
            <li> It is dangerous.</li>
            <li> If your teeth are that bad from years and years of abuse then spend the $500 to fix it.</li>
            <li> So before you post a bad review, know what you&#x27;re talking about.</li>
            <li> The gel foams in the mouth and makes me sick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very shocked by this result.</li>
            <li> This whitening system is horrible...</li>
            <li> Horrible, and extremely painful!!</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>

            <li> This whitening system is horrible...The directions say \\&quot;could cause gum irritation.\\&quot;...  It should say \\&quot;WILL cause burn sores and irritation on gums\\&quot;.  I used this product ONLY once and still dealing, a week later, with the burn sores on my gums.  Luckily I only had the product in my mouth for 10 minutes; the stinging I was experiencing on my gums was so painful.  Within 10 mins. this product had turned parts of my gums white and the rest red and inflamed.  I only used .2 mL in each tray, not even the about they said I could have used \\&quot;each tray requires less than .5 mL\\&quot;.....</li>
            <li> I bought this on a Groupon for $29.99 and its well worth it. I will say that though confusing instructions and a bit of a gum burning sensation after one application my teeth are noticeably whiter. Use the LED for best results.

            <li> I bought this item through a groupon. My teeth weren&#x27;t all that yellow to begin with, but I hadn&#x27;t whitened my teeth for about 10 years and wanted to brighten my smile just a little. After using the product for one hour each day (no blue light), my teeth started to look *more yellow*. I do not drink coffee, tea, stayed away from all fruits except apples, and I do not smoke. I was exceptionally vigilant not to eat or drink anything that could stain my teeth for the duration of the 11 days I used the product. I&#x27;m very shocked by this result. I&#x27;ll wait a few months and try Crest whitestrips to see if I can regain the whiteness I used to enjoy.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this kit using Groupon. I would not buy it again. The gel foams in the mouth and makes me sick. I simply cannot use it. I much prefer the swabs.  They work great</li>
            <li> The people complaining about the burning on their gums aren&#x27;t doing if right. You&#x27;re not supposed to coat it on your teeth, just a small dot for each tooth. And it usually takes a couple of weeks to get completely whitened. You may even have stains on the inside of your teeth that cannot be removed this way. So before you post a bad review, know what you&#x27;re talking about.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star. I bought this off of groupon and the second I put the tray with the whitening gel in on my top teeth it started to burn and turn my gums white and blister! I didn&#x27;t even use a lot of gel since this was the first time using this new product. Good thing that much money wasn&#x27;t wasted on this horrible product. I highly recommend not using this. I&#x27;ll just stick to my crest white strips and professional whitening. Just trying to save a little money and ruined my gums! Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> The first day I tried bleaching my teeth, it seemed to burn a little but I couldn&#x27;t keep the trays in my mouth for more than 10 seconds. The gel burned my gums so badly that they turned white. I could actually hear my gum being fried. I have never had sensitivity or gum issues before and I hope after using this product, it won&#x27;t start now.</li>
            <li> Simply put *** DO NOT USE***  The company selling this product should have a class action law suit filed against them.  I use it ONE time and it caused a chemical burn on my gums!  It literally turned them white in some areas and bled in others. A few days later those areas died and sloughed off!!!  My gums have yet to grow back.  You&#x27;re better off swigging with gasoline that using this ****!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for about a week and I can notice a difference in the shade of whiteness of my teeth. HOWEVER, I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s worth the pain it&#x27;s causing on my gums. It&#x27;s creating a blister on my gums wherever the gel touches and hurts to brush my teeth. I am following the directions to a tee and am not using a lot of gel whatsoever. I notice the initial burn goes away after a few minutes if you can stand it that long, but the blisters will bother you for a few days.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this product when it came in the mail and it had a cute carrying case to keep everything in. However, When I shaped the trays they are still a little loose. I barely put any whitening gel at all in the trays since it was going to be the first time using it, but as soon as I was putting the top tray in my mouth it burnt my gums and gave me a blister. I took it out immediately and will not continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I echo everything that has been said here re: gum blistering. I&#x27;ve NEVER had gum issues and after wearing the trays for about 20 seconds, I had a big fat white blister on my top gum. It looks like my front teeth are connected! I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it was Groupon and the price was right, but the product is just terrible. Spend your money on Crest Whitestrips instead.</li>
            <li> This company should not be allowed to sell this product!  The first day I tried using the at home system, it seemed to burn a little.  I thought it was normal so I suffered through the pain.  Later that night I went to brush my teeth and my gums were so sore.  I had to avoid certain areas while brushing. I figured it was normal and didnt think much of it.  The second day of the treatment was 10x worse.  I couldn&#x27;t keep the trays in my mouth for more than 20 seconds.  The gel burned my gums so badly that they turned white.  I could actually hear my skin sizzling off.  The roof of my mouth was also severely burned.  It&#x27;s been almost a week later and its still painful to brush.  I have never had sensitivity issues or gum issues before. Hope this is helpful</li>
            <li> I wish I could&#x27;ve put a zero star. This product was burning my gums within seconds. I took out the mouth pieces after a few minutes because I could no longer take the pain.</li>
            <li> Dont expect to go from yellow to white.  However for inexpensive kit it works well and you will see a shade of difference.  My teeth are not straight so you can tell the teeth that tend to be crowded behind the others are less whitened so you know it is working.  The molding that comes with it dips in hot water to mold to your teeth but is still a bit loose.  However, for the price it works well.  It comes with desensitizer because after you are almost through with the whitening you may start feeling a \\&quot;burning\\&quot; sensation.  I would reccommend getting two kits if your teeth are more yellow than normal.  Also remember some people teeth can only whiten to a certain point.</li>
            <li> Agree with burn victims, that sounds weird...  However, after putting some common sense into equation I figured out an alternative that does not burn and will extend the use of your product 10-fold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Place gel on q-tip first and rub on teeth surfaces. Very light coat and avoid gums. (Not for the shaky hand type folks). It will not seem like you are applying much, if any at all, but the product is so strong that&#x27;s all it takes.  30 minutes, no burn, white teeth, and I have used ten times and the gel level has barely moved. I think the results a pretty good and product life use will be 2yrs plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you burn/overcook your steaks on the grill does that mean you will never grill a steak again? Probably not, just turn down the heat and don&#x27;t put it so close to the flames. You will still get great results.  Same concept with the gel folks.</li>
            <li> I purposely only whitened the first 6 teeth top and bottom the first time and I see results already. It burned the second time but I was a little over zealous with the gel</li>
            <li> I bought this through a Groupon for $25 plus free lifetime refills (the refills of which is the only part of the deal I&#x27;m on the fence about... they&#x27;re free alright, minus the shipping fee which seems a bit overpriced.  I&#x27;ve also read some questionable comments about Dazzling White&#x27;s billing process, so I&#x27;m a bit weary about giving them my credit card number directly.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself -- WONDERFUL!  It&#x27;s even lightning my one stubborn tooth that has some minor internal staining -- it continues to get lighter as I continue on with my treatments and is catching up steadily with my other teeth which have slowed down in their whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally, I do get a little on my gum line and it tingles and feels like little rubber bands snapping away at my gum; but not painful for me at all - more akin to that good feeling you get when you pick at your gums with a toothpick.  I&#x27;m sure for some people it would be painful and may cause tissue damage (which I think is the primary issue with getting this stuff on your gums) but if you have really healthy gums that don&#x27;t bleed no matter how much you floss or pick; then you might find as I did that this stuff is more like a bubbly tickle.  Still; you can minimize gum contact by making sure you don&#x27;t overfill the trays.  You only need a very little amount added to the tray; your teeth will displace the gel and the gel itself seems to expand and bubble up a bit as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the blue light one; but my lips got dried out and cracked (there was also a whole lot of drooling going on ;)) and after some research, it would seem that it doesn&#x27;t really have much of an affect on the end result or in how quickly one will reach their desired results.  I&#x27;m hanging on to it in case I decide to give it another try but not really sold on its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line; this works!  I saw noticeable results on session #3; my &#x27;difficult tooth&#x27; started whitening around session #4 or 5.  (FYI - my difficult tooth has internalized staining primarily from defects in my enamel on that one tooth; not from medication or root damage.  If you have one oddly colored tooth that seems stained on the inside, definitely have your dentist determine the cause.  My understanding is that certain discolorations cannot be bleached externally, so you may be wasting your money by trying.)  Would definitely recommend this product to family and friends :)!!y difficult tooth has internalized staining primarily from defects in my enamel on that one tooth; not from medication or root damage.

            <li> DO NOT BUY!! I purchased a similar company&#x27;s product from living social about 3 years ago to whiten teeth before wedding, that worked amazingly! So when I thought I could use another round of whitening I was excited to see what I thought was the same product on living social again. IT WASNT. This product should not be allowed on the market at all. It is dangerous. I have chemical burns all over my mouth from a total of 5 minutes use (since I couldn&#x27;t keep it in any longer). Horrible, and extremely painful!! Shame on this company for selling such a terrible product, I will be contacting living social for an immediate refund and to raise awareness to the terribleness of this product.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent kit. Trays are good enough and the peroxide is potent! I had custom trays made long ago but wanted to try these anyway. Worst case I got some more peroxide.  Use the blue gel too, whitening is harsh on the teeth. As for the burn gripes, beauty hurts I guess! It&#x27;s a trade off.</li>
            <li> Has anyone had the tip come off the gel (in the case) and you lose all the liquid? This has happened twice and the mfg will not return my emails.</li>
            <li> BEWARE. I literally thought I had poured acid in my mouth. I couldn&#x27;t wash my gums off fast enough. I could hear this sizzling noise and it was my gums. They turned white and went completely numb. Worst mouth pain I&#x27;ve ever experienced. It doesn&#x27;t deserve one star but amazon makes you rate it. Awful!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I used to pay high money for bleeching my teeth, NO MORE!. Now, every 6 months I use this product at home and my teeth as as while as the moon . I wil recommend this product to eveyrone who would like to have white sparking teeth.</li>
