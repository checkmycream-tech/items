            <li>Organic argan oil is one of the best items you can purchase for yourself, it offers so many benefits.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s obviously very lightly fragranced.  </li>

            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>Please continue to offer this product; I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>It dispenses more than I need when using on my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since bought more</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find a better price.  </li>
            <li>I love this product it gives my hair shine and makes it feel healthy again.</li>
            <li>Glad it was $1 -</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s not terrible either, but not my favorite),</li>
            <li>I think the aragan oil is great for my hair and skin, but the pump allows for too much to come out at one time and the lid does not close onto the container.  </li>
            <li>I could not believe how amazing the Argan oil leaves my skin as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as wonderful as the documentary I watched on TV.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many brands of argan oil and this is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>My hair, skin and nails look healthy and shiny and I have made a lot of body oils, butters and lotions using this oil.  </li>
            <li>Some oils are so oily they cause acne on the face not this oil love how this Argan oil moisturizes my hair</li>
            <li>makes it look healthy.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this oil.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin and was worried that it might make the oily areas more greasy but it didnt.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I use it for literally everything from my cuticles to my cracked heels.</li>
            <li>I love argan oil products.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer, my nails look better, and my feet look nicer.</li>
            <li>I think it is an ok product to use if you don&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many Argan oil products and have been a longtime fan of it&#x27;s benefits.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to eliminate three skin care products since i started using this Argan Oil--day cream, night cream and eye cream.  </li>
            <li>Used on my face at night for extra moisturizing too and it was perfect!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really kept the condition of her hair very nice.</li>
            <li>The Vizeri Beauty Pure Argan Oil is a remarkable improvement.  </li>
            <li>Great product and highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome and has so many purposes I used some on a dry patch where I tend to have eczema issues and</li>
            <li>I especially love it on my dry, cracked feet and the tips of my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt great after using it, and my skin was very soft as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is 100% pure USDA organic oil and that alone makes it good to use on the skin.</li>
            <li>Enjoy is way better.</li>
            <li>The oil soaks into the skin very quickly, disappearing within a minute or two.</li>
            <li>It keeps my processed hair strong and, prevents split ends.</li>
            <li>Although I can&#x27;t use this product in my hair (not the fault of the product but of my fine hair), I do use it on my feet.  </li>
            <li>I have really fine hair</li>
            <li>I love  it very much!</li>
            <li>My wife considered purchasing 100% pure organic Argan oil from several sources, but chose the Vizeri Beauty brand because it presented the best value.</li>
            <li>It does not make my face oil or breakout which is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s organic - a HUGE plus for me... and made my hair</li>
            <li>I would just squirt one pump into my palms and rub them together, then I&#x27;d smooth it into the ends of my hair after showering.</li>
            <li>This is a light oil that I&#x27;ve been using on my hair and nails now for about a month.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>I will say that the initial smell isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>I am seriously happy with this product and do recommend it to every who need to bring moisture back to the hair and skin</li>
            <li>Have only used it on my nails, but see great improvement already.  </li>
            <li>and I primarily use it on my face.  </li>
            <li>It is doing wonders on both so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>More importantly, the argan oil does not negatively impact her coloring and hair treatments, so she is also pleased about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first Argan product and I find this oil very light</li>
            <li>Overally, pretty pleased that I did get use out of it.</li>
            <li>I am so excited about this oil.</li>
            <li>It has proved to be, not only a very good value, but also a very high quality product that lives up to its claims of purity and effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I definitely plan to purchase more, my hair is loving it.</li>
            <li>It is also great on dry hair, disappearing immediately.  </li>
            <li>This treatment oil is great - really hydrates my dry ends and makes them look even, moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li>It is pure so using more than a drop will make your hair greasy.</li>
            <li>100% Pure Argan Oil has so many uses in beauty and every day care.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic and pure.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s USDA organic, and the quality of the product really shows through in the results it gives.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look very shiny and glossy in a healthy way.</li>
            <li>I really recommend you get some of this to keep around because there&#x27;s so many uses for it</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this and really loved this product.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the most amazing oils I have ever used I would recommend to anyone with dry</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell at first</li>
            <li>Honestly, just one pump is fine - any more than that and the hair can get weighed down.</li>
            <li>My wife is using it as belly cream for pregnant belly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I will be ordering some more here very shortly with the winter drying weather coming up.</li>
            <li>High quality product to keep your Hair/Nails healthy.</li>
            <li>thanks!!</li>
            <li>Very versatile!!</li>
            <li>This product could last you and worth it for sure!</li>
            <li>These products are amazing - simply put.</li>
            <li>So far I love my Vizeri Beauty Moroccan Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li>It works better than any hair and skin products and is all natural.</li>
            <li>I can say I am very pleased with the oil, I am a guy with long unkempt hair and use it on my beard also.</li>
            <li>I love doing a oil treatment on my hair because it makes it so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>This was a useful product for skin and haircare.</li>
            <li>Too much makes your hair greasy, but finding the right amt tames flyaways and helps keep my hair smooth all day.</li>
            <li>The smell goes away pretty quickly so my hair just smells like my shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using 100% pure argan oil, I use it primarily to seal in moisture in my hair after cleansing and conditioning, as well as to protect my ends.   </li>
            <li>I put it on right before I put on my socks in the morning, and I use it again right before bed.  </li>
            <li>I also use it on my skin and nails, soaks right in without feeling greasy and makes a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely long hair (near knee-length) and have had difficulty finding products to keep my hair in great shape.</li>
            <li>What is really surprising is that dark spots on my face and hands have faded dramatically.  </li>
            <li>I especially love using just a tiny bit on my hair to add shine and tame</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t take very much .</li>
            <li>This Argan oil is also very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>The oil itself works very well for me, and I also appreciated the in-depth brochure they emailed me with my original purchase.</li>
            <li>This so far is making a huge improvement in her hair.</li>
            <li>OK I guess but not much different from Jojoba oil or emu oil.  </li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve used argon oil</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>This oil has literally become my favorite and only oil.</li>
            <li>but after that first glitch the smell is gone.</li>
            <li>and I only paid a dollar for it, wished I would&#x27;ve bought more than just one.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using Argan Oil an</li>
            <li>like your product and will buy more next time.</li>
            <li>Also use to help keep hair soft and smooth through the day.</li>
            <li>I am an avid user of Josie Maran 100% Argan Oil and there is no smell whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I tried this on my hair first.</li>
            <li>Truly pleased, bought several for daughters.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I only wish I could buy it for super cheap and still get the quality</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve only used it on my hair, but I freaking love it!</li>
            <li>It feels natural and clean.    </li>
            <li>I really think the Argan oil has made my skin smoother and more even-toned, after only a couple of weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I love argan oil; however, I will probably purchase a bottle with a dropper next time so that I can control how much I use.</li>
            <li>My only suggestion for improvement would  be to the packaging and not the product; it would be nice to have more control over how much oil is dispensed as I find that I&#x27;d like somewhere close to around half the amount that comes out per pump.</li>
            <li>With just a few drops a day ,and using this for only a week I have already noticed my skin is more hydrated, this is a great all over facial moisturizer .It</li>
            <li>I tried it again with just 1 pump and it makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>Its absolutely pure Argan oil, thus has the pure smell to it.</li>
            <li>Used as a skin conditioner and moisturizer, Vizeri 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil has exceeded my wife&#x27;s expectations.</li>
            <li>We will certainly buy again from Vizeri Beauty and have not hesitated to recommend the product to friends.</li>
            <li>would certainly buy your product again.</li>
            <li>, I decided to give a strong recommendation to anyone who wants to look younger.  </li>
            <li>The oil feels wonderful works very well on dry skin and dull hair.</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s helped my dry, cracked heels (I haven&#x27;t found anything else that has made any sort of difference)!  </li>
            <li>The Argan oil was absorbed quickly and the improvement that I noticed immediately really seemed to last all day.  </li>
            <li>While, I cannot put oil anywhere NEAR my hair, I love to use it for my skin, as I&#x27;ve seeminly acquired DRY skin as I&#x27;ve aged, this stuff is amazing for me.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve already seen a huge improvement in my skin&#x27;s overall health.</li>
            <li>I found it be very hydrating on my ends</li>
            <li>This had made my hair softer, and much easier to maintain.</li>
            <li>I would have much preferred a dropper or nothing at all.  </li>
            <li>This made my hair really greasy</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference.</li>
            <li>It seems like the owner of this product is very knowledgable from the comments he writes in the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really works well to soften my beard.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this on my belly for stretch marks and it has really improved the texture and look of my skin.</li>
            <li>This product does not really have a smell to it which is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Works very well to soften and manage curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice a smell, so</li>
            <li>I really use it on my hair</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li>I very much appreciated the infos in your message.</li>
            <li>there isnt really a scent to it, cause</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for a couple of weeks and my hair feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I used on my hair and it made my white,dry hair very manageable.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced Argan Oil....</li>
            <li>I have waist length hair that I have traditionally had to use multiple products to make look nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using only argon oil for the past week and my hair is beautiful, shiny, and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>It left my hair luxuriously soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I also started using it on my dry cuticles and it made them feel normal and healthy again too.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge improvement on my color treated hair, especially in how my wavy hair as become more curly (defined and not frizzy) due to how hydrated my hair has become.</li>
            <li>My nails stay long and strong as added bonus</li>
            <li>I may try to use this and see if I can aide my dry scalp and just try to use it when I don&#x27;t have anywhere really special to go !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Virgin Argan oil by Vizeri for a few days now and so far have been very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the good stuff -- I have super long hair, past my waist, and I find that three squirts is plenty for my hair.  </li>
            <li>So far, however, I like this product very much</li>
            <li>I love first of all that it has no strong scent that its organic and it works on hair skin and nails.</li>
            <li>I am happy I had the opportunity to give it a try, I have always used natural product on my face only i.e coconut oil, shea butter, olive oil, sesame seed oil, grape seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of using this item I can tell the difference in my skin, not only was it soft and smooth</li>
            <li>Primarily, I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair in areas that are somewhat dry and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>I should have known better since my previous Argan Oil purchases all came in amber glass bottles not to mention the price difference.</li>
            <li>I find your product fantastic for my dry hair.</li>
            <li>It does contain tree nuts so if you are allergic, don&#x27;t purchase this particular product.</li>
            <li>did a quick Google Search to determine if maybe this is how the oil smells on a regular basis: no it is not.</li>
            <li>The smell of this particular oil kinda reminds me of a nail polish remover smell.  </li>
            <li>That was my main fear, that the oil would make my makeup fade or slip away.  </li>
            <li>It also makes my hair feel very soft and while my hair is normally very frizzy the Argan oil has helped lessen that.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both the product and company.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it and highly recommend the Vizeri Beauty.</li>
            <li>my hair is really soft and it holds curls much longer without having to put a mass amount of hairspray in...</li>
            <li>wow this stuff smells really rancid.</li>
            <li>I also add a few drops to my favorite shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>initially looked greasy when I  put on ,but absorbed quite rapidly into my skin and kept it moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love this Argan oil because it really helps tame my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It is by far better than my previous cream.</li>
            <li>I am a relatively new convert to argan oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the world of argan oil.</li>
            <li>She adds this to her hair post shower and it makes for very soft and shiny and flowing hair.</li>
            <li>my hair is so soft!  </li>
            <li>My hands are soft and have virtually completely healed!</li>
            <li>I apply a drop through the lower half of my hair and it&#x27;s soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure not to use too much or it can get a bit oily but only needing a little will make it last longer.</li>
            <li>Made my face really soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and hydrated without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li>the skin feels so soft and silky now.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use this product, not only for my hair, but for my cuticles, rough areas such as elbows and heels.</li>
            <li>i have to hide it from my daughter because she loves it as well because it leaves a natural shine to the hair not heavy on the hair either.</li>
            <li>hair is long and damaged from years of dryer and hot iron useage ,and I have been looking for  something to make it look healthier</li>
            <li>, my hair is looking much healthier and actually has some shine to it now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy</li>
            <li>It smells like any oil should smell, and is probably an indicator that it is organic and natural.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural benefits.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slowly but surely growing on me.</li>
            <li>I began using it on the scar and found it amazingly effective in reducing the looks of the scar: less redness, less noticeable, comforting to massage it -- &#x27;I would recommend it as doing what it claims😀</li>
            <li>I put a little too much in my hair the first time I used</li>
            <li>This high quality virgin argan oil does wonder for my wife&#x27;s skin and especially her hair.</li>
            <li>I also didnt feel the need to use the plethora of hair products that i normally use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it on my hair but made the mistake of using 3-4 pumps like i regularly do with my other hair oil with silicones which cause my hair to be super greasy.</li>
            <li>Have only been using it for a few days and have already noticed a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>Very greasy on hair and my hair is dry -</li>
            <li>I really believe that we should only put on our skin that which we would only put in our bodies.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft - only use it on the ends however.</li>
            <li>Used as a hot oil treatment to add moisture back in wet hair.</li>
            <li>This is a TRUE Argan oil that has not been refined excessively removing all</li>
            <li>However, the oil absorbs quickly, making a great base for make-up, and there have been no breakouts!</li>
            <li>Not sure what this should cost, but the price I paid definitely makes it worth 5 stars!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not dry, coarse and brittle like it used to be with all the dyeing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 70 years old, so my skin naturally is on the dry and slightly wrinkled side, but after applying it to the back of my hand, it looked like the hand of a 40 year old.  </li>
            <li>It makes a big difference on my dry skin and not to mention how soft and shiny it makes my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like putting oil and different types of products in my hair because either they leave my hair an Oily Mess or just don&#x27;t add any shine and just leave it frizzy.</li>
            <li>may be using too much on my hair, but I&#x27;ve found that it does leave my hair a little on the oily side</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Glad it was $1 -</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s not terrible either, but not my favorite),</li>
            <li> I think the aragan oil is great for my hair and skin, but the pump allows for too much to come out at one time and the lid does not close onto the container.  </li>
            <li> I could not believe how amazing the Argan oil leaves my skin as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as wonderful as the documentary I watched on TV.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many brands of argan oil and this is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li> My hair, skin and nails look healthy and shiny and I have made a lot of body oils, butters and lotions using this oil.  </li>
            <li> Some oils are so oily they cause acne on the face not this oil love how this Argan oil moisturizes my hair</li>
            <li> makes it look healthy.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin and was worried that it might make the oily areas more greasy but it didnt.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I use it for literally everything from my cuticles to my cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I love argan oil products.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer, my nails look better, and my feet look nicer.</li>
            <li> I think it is an ok product to use if you don&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many Argan oil products and have been a longtime fan of it&#x27;s benefits.  </li>
            <li> I have been able to eliminate three skin care products since i started using this Argan Oil--day cream, night cream and eye cream.  </li>
            <li> Used on my face at night for extra moisturizing too and it was perfect!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really kept the condition of her hair very nice.</li>
            <li> The Vizeri Beauty Pure Argan Oil is a remarkable improvement.  </li>
            <li> Great product and highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and has so many purposes I used some on a dry patch where I tend to have eczema issues and</li>
            <li> I especially love it on my dry, cracked feet and the tips of my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt great after using it, and my skin was very soft as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is 100% pure USDA organic oil and that alone makes it good to use on the skin.</li>
            <li> Enjoy is way better.</li>
            <li> The oil soaks into the skin very quickly, disappearing within a minute or two.</li>
            <li> It keeps my processed hair strong and, prevents split ends.</li>
            <li> Although I can&#x27;t use this product in my hair (not the fault of the product but of my fine hair), I do use it on my feet.  </li>
            <li> I have really fine hair</li>
            <li> I love  it very much!</li>
            <li> My wife considered purchasing 100% pure organic Argan oil from several sources, but chose the Vizeri Beauty brand because it presented the best value.</li>
            <li> It does not make my face oil or breakout which is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s organic - a HUGE plus for me... and made my hair</li>
            <li> I would just squirt one pump into my palms and rub them together, then I&#x27;d smooth it into the ends of my hair after showering.</li>
            <li> This is a light oil that I&#x27;ve been using on my hair and nails now for about a month.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> I will say that the initial smell isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li> I am seriously happy with this product and do recommend it to every who need to bring moisture back to the hair and skin</li>
            <li> Have only used it on my nails, but see great improvement already.  </li>
            <li> and I primarily use it on my face.  </li>
            <li> It is doing wonders on both so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> More importantly, the argan oil does not negatively impact her coloring and hair treatments, so she is also pleased about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first Argan product and I find this oil very light</li>
            <li> Overally, pretty pleased that I did get use out of it.</li>
            <li> I am so excited about this oil.</li>
            <li> It has proved to be, not only a very good value, but also a very high quality product that lives up to its claims of purity and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I definitely plan to purchase more, my hair is loving it.</li>
            <li> It is also great on dry hair, disappearing immediately.  </li>
            <li> This treatment oil is great - really hydrates my dry ends and makes them look even, moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li> It is pure so using more than a drop will make your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> 100% Pure Argan Oil has so many uses in beauty and every day care.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s organic and pure.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s USDA organic, and the quality of the product really shows through in the results it gives.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look very shiny and glossy in a healthy way.</li>
            <li> I really recommend you get some of this to keep around because there&#x27;s so many uses for it</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this and really loved this product.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the most amazing oils I have ever used I would recommend to anyone with dry</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell at first</li>
            <li> Honestly, just one pump is fine - any more than that and the hair can get weighed down.</li>
            <li> My wife is using it as belly cream for pregnant belly.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure I will be ordering some more here very shortly with the winter drying weather coming up.</li>
            <li> High quality product to keep your Hair/Nails healthy.</li>
            <li> thanks!!</li>
            <li> Very versatile!!</li>
            <li> This product could last you and worth it for sure!</li>
            <li> These products are amazing - simply put.</li>
            <li> So far I love my Vizeri Beauty Moroccan Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> It works better than any hair and skin products and is all natural.</li>
            <li> I can say I am very pleased with the oil, I am a guy with long unkempt hair and use it on my beard also.</li>
            <li> I love doing a oil treatment on my hair because it makes it so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> This was a useful product for skin and haircare.</li>
            <li> Too much makes your hair greasy, but finding the right amt tames flyaways and helps keep my hair smooth all day.</li>
            <li> The smell goes away pretty quickly so my hair just smells like my shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using 100% pure argan oil, I use it primarily to seal in moisture in my hair after cleansing and conditioning, as well as to protect my ends.   </li>
            <li> I put it on right before I put on my socks in the morning, and I use it again right before bed.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my skin and nails, soaks right in without feeling greasy and makes a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely long hair (near knee-length) and have had difficulty finding products to keep my hair in great shape.</li>
            <li> What is really surprising is that dark spots on my face and hands have faded dramatically.  </li>
            <li> I especially love using just a tiny bit on my hair to add shine and tame</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t take very much .</li>
            <li> This Argan oil is also very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> The oil itself works very well for me, and I also appreciated the in-depth brochure they emailed me with my original purchase.</li>
            <li> This so far is making a huge improvement in her hair.</li>
            <li> OK I guess but not much different from Jojoba oil or emu oil.  </li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used argon oil</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This oil has literally become my favorite and only oil.</li>
            <li> but after that first glitch the smell is gone.</li>
            <li> and I only paid a dollar for it, wished I would&#x27;ve bought more than just one.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Argan Oil an</li>
            <li> like your product and will buy more next time.</li>
            <li> Also use to help keep hair soft and smooth through the day.</li>
            <li> I am an avid user of Josie Maran 100% Argan Oil and there is no smell whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my hair first.</li>
            <li> Truly pleased, bought several for daughters.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I only wish I could buy it for super cheap and still get the quality</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve only used it on my hair, but I freaking love it!</li>
            <li> It feels natural and clean.    </li>
            <li> I really think the Argan oil has made my skin smoother and more even-toned, after only a couple of weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I love argan oil; however, I will probably purchase a bottle with a dropper next time so that I can control how much I use.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion for improvement would  be to the packaging and not the product; it would be nice to have more control over how much oil is dispensed as I find that I&#x27;d like somewhere close to around half the amount that comes out per pump.</li>
            <li> With just a few drops a day ,and using this for only a week I have already noticed my skin is more hydrated, this is a great all over facial moisturizer .It</li>
            <li> I tried it again with just 1 pump and it makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> Its absolutely pure Argan oil, thus has the pure smell to it.</li>
            <li> Used as a skin conditioner and moisturizer, Vizeri 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil has exceeded my wife&#x27;s expectations.</li>
            <li> We will certainly buy again from Vizeri Beauty and have not hesitated to recommend the product to friends.</li>
            <li> would certainly buy your product again.</li>
            <li> , I decided to give a strong recommendation to anyone who wants to look younger.  </li>
            <li> The oil feels wonderful works very well on dry skin and dull hair.</li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s helped my dry, cracked heels (I haven&#x27;t found anything else that has made any sort of difference)!  </li>
            <li> The Argan oil was absorbed quickly and the improvement that I noticed immediately really seemed to last all day.  </li>
            <li> While, I cannot put oil anywhere NEAR my hair, I love to use it for my skin, as I&#x27;ve seeminly acquired DRY skin as I&#x27;ve aged, this stuff is amazing for me.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already seen a huge improvement in my skin&#x27;s overall health.</li>
            <li> I found it be very hydrating on my ends</li>
            <li> This had made my hair softer, and much easier to maintain.</li>
            <li> I would have much preferred a dropper or nothing at all.  </li>
            <li> This made my hair really greasy</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> It seems like the owner of this product is very knowledgable from the comments he writes in the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really works well to soften my beard.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this on my belly for stretch marks and it has really improved the texture and look of my skin.</li>
            <li> This product does not really have a smell to it which is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Works very well to soften and manage curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice a smell, so</li>
            <li> I really use it on my hair</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> I very much appreciated the infos in your message.</li>
            <li> there isnt really a scent to it, cause</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a couple of weeks and my hair feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I used on my hair and it made my white,dry hair very manageable.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced Argan Oil....</li>
            <li> I have waist length hair that I have traditionally had to use multiple products to make look nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using only argon oil for the past week and my hair is beautiful, shiny, and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> It left my hair luxuriously soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I also started using it on my dry cuticles and it made them feel normal and healthy again too.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge improvement on my color treated hair, especially in how my wavy hair as become more curly (defined and not frizzy) due to how hydrated my hair has become.</li>
            <li> My nails stay long and strong as added bonus</li>
            <li> I may try to use this and see if I can aide my dry scalp and just try to use it when I don&#x27;t have anywhere really special to go !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Virgin Argan oil by Vizeri for a few days now and so far have been very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the good stuff -- I have super long hair, past my waist, and I find that three squirts is plenty for my hair.  </li>
            <li> So far, however, I like this product very much</li>
            <li> I love first of all that it has no strong scent that its organic and it works on hair skin and nails.</li>
            <li> I am happy I had the opportunity to give it a try, I have always used natural product on my face only i.e coconut oil, shea butter, olive oil, sesame seed oil, grape seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of using this item I can tell the difference in my skin, not only was it soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Primarily, I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair in areas that are somewhat dry and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> I should have known better since my previous Argan Oil purchases all came in amber glass bottles not to mention the price difference.</li>
            <li> I find your product fantastic for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> It does contain tree nuts so if you are allergic, don&#x27;t purchase this particular product.</li>
            <li> did a quick Google Search to determine if maybe this is how the oil smells on a regular basis: no it is not.</li>
            <li> The smell of this particular oil kinda reminds me of a nail polish remover smell.  </li>
            <li> That was my main fear, that the oil would make my makeup fade or slip away.  </li>
            <li> It also makes my hair feel very soft and while my hair is normally very frizzy the Argan oil has helped lessen that.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend both the product and company.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it and highly recommend the Vizeri Beauty.</li>
            <li> my hair is really soft and it holds curls much longer without having to put a mass amount of hairspray in...</li>
            <li> wow this stuff smells really rancid.</li>
            <li> I also add a few drops to my favorite shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> initially looked greasy when I  put on ,but absorbed quite rapidly into my skin and kept it moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love this Argan oil because it really helps tame my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It is by far better than my previous cream.</li>
            <li> I am a relatively new convert to argan oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of argan oil.</li>
            <li> She adds this to her hair post shower and it makes for very soft and shiny and flowing hair.</li>
            <li> my hair is so soft!  </li>
            <li> My hands are soft and have virtually completely healed!</li>
            <li> I apply a drop through the lower half of my hair and it&#x27;s soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure not to use too much or it can get a bit oily but only needing a little will make it last longer.</li>
            <li> Made my face really soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and hydrated without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> the skin feels so soft and silky now.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use this product, not only for my hair, but for my cuticles, rough areas such as elbows and heels.</li>
            <li> i have to hide it from my daughter because she loves it as well because it leaves a natural shine to the hair not heavy on the hair either.</li>
            <li> hair is long and damaged from years of dryer and hot iron useage ,and I have been looking for  something to make it look healthier</li>
            <li> , my hair is looking much healthier and actually has some shine to it now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy</li>
            <li> It smells like any oil should smell, and is probably an indicator that it is organic and natural.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural benefits.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slowly but surely growing on me.</li>
            <li> I began using it on the scar and found it amazingly effective in reducing the looks of the scar: less redness, less noticeable, comforting to massage it -- &#x27;I would recommend it as doing what it claims😀</li>
            <li> I put a little too much in my hair the first time I used</li>
            <li> This high quality virgin argan oil does wonder for my wife&#x27;s skin and especially her hair.</li>
            <li> I also didnt feel the need to use the plethora of hair products that i normally use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on my hair but made the mistake of using 3-4 pumps like i regularly do with my other hair oil with silicones which cause my hair to be super greasy.</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for a few days and have already noticed a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Very greasy on hair and my hair is dry -</li>
            <li> I really believe that we should only put on our skin that which we would only put in our bodies.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft - only use it on the ends however.</li>
            <li> Used as a hot oil treatment to add moisture back in wet hair.</li>
            <li> This is a TRUE Argan oil that has not been refined excessively removing all</li>
            <li> However, the oil absorbs quickly, making a great base for make-up, and there have been no breakouts!</li>
            <li> Not sure what this should cost, but the price I paid definitely makes it worth 5 stars!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not dry, coarse and brittle like it used to be with all the dyeing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70 years old, so my skin naturally is on the dry and slightly wrinkled side, but after applying it to the back of my hand, it looked like the hand of a 40 year old.  </li>
            <li> It makes a big difference on my dry skin and not to mention how soft and shiny it makes my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like putting oil and different types of products in my hair because either they leave my hair an Oily Mess or just don&#x27;t add any shine and just leave it frizzy.</li>
            <li> may be using too much on my hair, but I&#x27;ve found that it does leave my hair a little on the oily side</li>
            <li> really need a product to use because while I have slightly oily hair, I also have a WILDLY dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> B. I showed my mom how to mix it in with a variety of her other skin and hair care products and the smell completely went away.</li>
            <li> A little really goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I got this originally on a very low cost trial deal, but since I discovered that it is the only thing that actually helps my dry scalp in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have damaged, color treated hair that tends to be on the dry side anyway, so I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking to bring some life back to over-stressed hair.</li>
            <li> I only use a couple drops so the product lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I had been using one of the well-known brands of face cream for several months, and was pretty disappointed in how it performed, so when I ran across an article about Argan oil, I figured it was worth a try-and it was!</li>
            <li> The bottle has a pump that dispenses very small amount of oil, this is important as a little argan oil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> have dry, damaged hair from using a flat iron almost every day.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a hard to control how much you pump out each time.  </li>
            <li> I use this in the ends of my long hair.  </li>
            <li> will warn you that pure Argan oil has a scent and may at first be unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Not oily like other similar products.</li>
            <li> a bit dry...  </li>
            <li> I had previously ordered from Essential Depot was fake.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say whether or not I&#x27;m seeing an improvement in my skin but will update after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Since you don&#x27;t need very much of the product at one time the pump makes it difficult to get a small amount and too much makes the hair overly oily and weighed down.</li>
            <li> It left my hair a little oily</li>
            <li> One little bottle and loads of uses, definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not really needed it for anything else</li>
            <li> and I try to be careful of what I put into my hair.</li>
            <li> I put one pump in my palm, rub my hands together, apply the oil to my face and neck, and rub the remainder on the ends of my wet hair before applying my blow drying product.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks later I fell down some stairs and broke my hip which resulted in surgery and an eight inch scar.</li>
            <li> A little bit, goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have lupus and am not able to get my hair back to the way it was before the treatments...however after using for only a few weeks My hair was noticeably healthier!</li>
            <li> Her hair is to her waist, and she gets  compliments daily lately.</li>
            <li> Commercialized Argan oil has additives and fragrance, including other chemicals that are not a true representation of Argan beauty benefits.</li>
            <li> and it seemed to help tone down frizziness.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my hair without it weighing it down or feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing like the previous argan oil I&#x27;ve purchased in the past, only a small amount is needed and the benefits are felt almost instantaniously.</li>
            <li> That is in less than a month&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li> I puts it on my daughter hair as well because her hair is always look dull and dry but not with this oil.</li>
            <li> If my nails or cuticles were looking rough, i&#x27;d go in a few times a day with a small squirt and just massage it in to help strengthen them.</li>
            <li> My hair texture is exceptionally thick and dry.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops in my shampoo, to moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li> Been using this on my face before bedtime for a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve added a few drops of this Argan Oil to my hand lotion, face cream and hair styling cream.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday</li>
            <li> I put it in after I shampoo and let it sit in my hair for a few minutes in the shower.</li>
            <li> The ends that were dry and broken off are not so brittle anymore,and it has tamed down my frizzes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this to my face every morning and night for the past week and a half</li>
            <li> A little (and I mean very little!) goes a long way with this!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend argan oil for anyone that suffers from dry skin.</li>
            <li> , it is actually pretty bad but give it about 5 minutes and the smell should disappear.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit nutty but actually not that bad and after a few uses i find I actually like the scent.</li>
            <li> Wrong, Definitely not!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all to do with it, I tried to download the uses guide which was unsuccessful.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was a bit afraid that it might feel oily on my skin, and possibly cause some breakouts, because even at age 60, my skin is prone to them.</li>
            <li> Does that mean we can eat argan oil?</li>
            <li> I am using the oil on psoriasis on my legs also and definitely see the awful red marks getting lighter and the itching has stopped!  </li>
            <li> It calms my frizzy mess and smooths and calms my angry sun kissed skin.</li>
            <li> I use this daily on the tips of my hair as I have horrible dead ends.</li>
            <li> It has no scent and is obviously fake as the bottle has been openned.</li>
            <li> Really skeptical that this is 100% Argan Oil or maybe I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> some have mentioned - it isn&#x27;t as bad as some people make it to be.</li>
            <li> A. Mine didn&#x27;t smell as bad as some ladies and</li>
            <li> The smell was so bad I had to throw it out :(</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed ppl.</li>
            <li> Tossed it after one use....that bad!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed in your purchase!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Tossed after 1 use cause it smells disgusting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was an excellent product! I found it be very hydrating on my ends and it seemed to help tone down frizziness. It also didn&#x27;t take very much . I would just squirt one pump into my palms and rub them together, then I&#x27;d smooth it into the ends of my hair after showering. I&#x27;d then rub the backs of my nails and cuticles with the remainder of product that was on my hands. If my nails or cuticles were looking rough, i&#x27;d go in a few times a day with a small squirt and just massage it in to help strengthen them.</li>
            <li> I love  it very much!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for hair and nails. It keeps my processed hair strong and, prevents split ends. My nails stay long and strong as added bonus</li>
            <li> I do like the Argon Oil.  Primarily, I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair in areas that are somewhat dry and unmanageable.  I&#x27;ve not really needed it for anything else and my hair was the reason I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I use this in additon to the Vizeri shampoo and conditioner. These products are amazing - simply put. You will not be disappointed in your purchase!</li>
            <li> OK I guess but not much different from Jojoba oil or emu oil.  Very greasy on hair and my hair is dry -</li>
            <li> I had been using one of the well-known brands of face cream for several months, and was pretty disappointed in how it performed, so when I ran across an article about Argan oil, I figured it was worth a try-and it was! It is by far better than my previous cream. I chose the Vizeri brand because of the good reviews and the price. I have to say I was a bit afraid that it might feel oily on my skin, and possibly cause some breakouts, because even at age 60, my skin is prone to them. However, the oil absorbs quickly, making a great base for make-up, and there have been no breakouts! I really think the Argan oil has made my skin smoother and more even-toned, after only a couple of weeks of use. I plan to use Vizeri Argan oil forever!</li>
            <li> I received this on time.  I used this product on my face, hands and lips.  Made my face really soft and supple.  My cuticles never looked better.  Fantastic stuff!!</li>
            <li> I liked the way it makes my hair smooth and shiny.  However it tended to leave my hair looking oily at times.</li>
            <li> I love your product. I have extremely long hair (near knee-length) and have had difficulty finding products to keep my hair in great shape. This had made my hair softer, and much easier to maintain. I recently had my daughter use some. She has over processed hair. This so far is making a huge improvement in her hair. I hope that your product continues to work for us!</li>
            <li> We are pleased to use this along with the Argan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner combo. It works!</li>
            <li> Best Argan oil I have tried so far!</li>
            <li> This is a light oil that I&#x27;ve been using on my hair and nails now for about a month.  Unlike some heavier oils, this does not just sit there on your nails.  After about 10 minutes it seems to absorb into the nail.  If you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;re constantly washing your hands or washing dishes, to keep them supple, you will need to reapply and massage it into your nails a couple times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be using too much on my hair, but I&#x27;ve found that it does leave my hair a little on the oily side so I use it as a hair mask for about an hour or two just before washing my hair - or you can apply it, cover your hair and leave it on overnight before washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pump and it&#x27;s a hard to control how much you pump out each time.  I would have much preferred a dropper or nothing at all.  I love argan oil; however, I will probably purchase a bottle with a dropper next time so that I can control how much I use.</li>
            <li> This treatment oil is great - really hydrates my dry ends and makes them look even, moisturized and healthy. A little (and I mean very little!) goes a long way with this! Honestly, just one pump is fine - any more than that and the hair can get weighed down. I have damaged, color treated hair that tends to be on the dry side anyway, so I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking to bring some life back to over-stressed hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft - only use it on the ends however. It is pure so using more than a drop will make your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Use on hair Anzac e good/ for. Skin</li>
            <li> This is not argan oil. It has no scent and is obviously fake as the bottle has been openned. Do not buy!!!</li>
            <li> VISERI PREMIUM 100%PURE ARGON OIL is suprisingly wonderful. I only wish I could buy it for super cheap and still get the quality oh, also I would be happier if it were across the street!  All kidding aside, my friend and I are going to be buying this continually in our future. We use it on our faces and our hair. She looks 10yrs younger after 2 weeks. Her hair is to her waist, and she gets  compliments daily lately. I  am also very happy with my results. I am using the oil on psoriasis on my legs also and definitely see the awful red marks getting lighter and the itching has stopped!  My friend is my caregiver of 3 yrs. We are both in our  60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Tossed after 1 use cause it smells disgusting. Not recommended. Ugh. There was a coupon for $1 so I figured, why not? Wrong, Definitely not! I should have known better since my previous Argan Oil purchases all came in amber glass bottles not to mention the price difference.</li>
            <li> So far I love my Vizeri Beauty Moroccan Argan Oil.  I use it both in my hair and on my face at night as a cosmetic moisturizer.  I have noticed a huge improvement on my color treated hair, especially in how my wavy hair as become more curly (defined and not frizzy) due to how hydrated my hair has become. I will not only be ordering from this company again but I would recommend this product to anyone.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love this product&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many things to help with my skin, hair, nails and many things do not work. this product works! I love it! I have lupus and am not able to get my hair back to the way it was before the treatments...however after using for only a few weeks My hair was noticeably healthier!</li>
            <li> I love this Argan oil because it really helps tame my naturally curly hair.  I only use a couple drops so the product lasts a long time.  I have also started using it on my skin as a moisturizer and my skin loves it!!!  It works better than any hair and skin products and is all natural.</li>
            <li> 100% Pure Argan Oil has so many uses in beauty and every day care. I prefer to use mine on my face, hands and neck area. It leaves my skin soft and hydrated without clogging my pores. I also add a few drops to my favorite shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will warn you that pure Argan oil has a scent and may at first be unpleasant. Please remember this is an organic product with no chemicals or additives for fragrance. Commercialized Argan oil has additives and fragrance, including other chemicals that are not a true representation of Argan beauty benefits.</li>
            <li> The Argon oil for Hair Skin and nails is wonderful. I absolutely love this product. I put a few drops in my shampoo, to moisturize my hair. I use it on my skin and on my nails. My hair has never been more healthy. I will be buying more of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Virgin Argan oil by Vizeri for a few days now and so far have been very pleased with the results.  This is my first time using 100% pure argan oil, I use it primarily to seal in moisture in my hair after cleansing and conditioning, as well as to protect my ends.   It&#x27;s nothing like the previous argan oil I&#x27;ve purchased in the past, only a small amount is needed and the benefits are felt almost instantaniously. I definitely plan to purchase more, my hair is loving it.</li>
            <li> I love using Argon oil in my hair, as I process my hair with color and&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a bit dry...  I like putting on my scalp and massaging it in, and I also&lt;br /&gt;like taking the oil out to the ends of my hair to soften up the dryness a bit...&lt;br /&gt;It also works so well for applying to after I have styled it for a wonderful&lt;br /&gt;shine!</li>
            <li> Best argan oil.  Use it on face, hair and nails.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works amazingly well. great for skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I used thus on my face and body and it lasted all day and gave me a lovely glow...I even tried it as a moisturizer for bed on my face what a difference. ..I tried some my scalp and it wasn&#x27;t too greasy so I&#x27;m sure I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Works great for my hair- highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of argan oil and this was one of the best! My hair felt great after using it, and my skin was very soft as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for argan oil I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used argon oil and I love it! I have waist length hair that I have traditionally had to use multiple products to make look nice. I&#x27;ve been using only argon oil for the past week and my hair is beautiful, shiny, and not frizzy. I love this stuff and wish I started using it sooner.</li>
            <li> Been using this on my face before bedtime for a few days. It does not make my face oil or breakout which is a huge plus for me. I&#x27;ve also used it on my hair but made the mistake of using 3-4 pumps like i regularly do with my other hair oil with silicones which cause my hair to be super greasy. I tried it again with just 1 pump and it makes my hair super soft. A little really goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I am a relatively new convert to argan oil. This is 100% pure USDA organic oil and that alone makes it good to use on the skin. It does contain tree nuts so if you are allergic, don&#x27;t purchase this particular product. I really believe that we should only put on our skin that which we would only put in our bodies. Does that mean we can eat argan oil? Actually, yes. Vizeri Beauty sells this oil as a beauty treatment, however, so I would use it only for that, and I do. Great product.</li>
            <li> This made my hair really greasy but I found that it was great for my nails and skin! I was hoping to use it for my hair, which is why I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars. Overally, pretty pleased that I did get use out of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 3 weeks now and love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, damaged hair from using a flat iron almost every day. I apply a drop through the lower half of my hair and it&#x27;s soft and smooth. I mix a drop in some foot cream and apply this nightly - wish I had this before flip flop season. It has helped improve the skin on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this smell some have mentioned - it isn&#x27;t as bad as some people make it to be. Now it&#x27;s in no way pleasant, it is actually pretty bad but give it about 5 minutes and the smell should disappear.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for 3days and have only used it on my skin. I love it. I can already see a difference in my skin. It is already more supple and hydrated.  Please continue to offer this product; I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this occasionally on and off. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference. There is a smell but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I think it depends on your sensitivity to smell also. It seems like the owner of this product is very knowledgable from the comments he writes in the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still need to read the eBooks that were given to me. I&#x27;ll update this review if I ever do read them.</li>
            <li> Really works well to soften my beard.  I was getting split ends in my beard as it got longer, those went away.  Helps to ease combing, tangles, and improves overall looks.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  I have used it on my hair without it weighing it down or feeling greasy.  I have also used it on my skin and nails as well.  The only thing I would change is the pump.  It dispenses more than I need when using on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my belly for stretch marks and it has really improved the texture and look of my skin.</li>
            <li> Its absolutely pure Argan oil, thus has the pure smell to it. The oil feels wonderful works very well on dry skin and dull hair. I would have loved it more if it had a soothing fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> My wife considered purchasing 100% pure organic Argan oil from several sources, but chose the Vizeri Beauty brand because it presented the best value. It has proved to be, not only a very good value, but also a very high quality product that lives up to its claims of purity and effectiveness. Used as a skin conditioner and moisturizer, Vizeri 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil has exceeded my wife&#x27;s expectations. We will certainly buy again from Vizeri Beauty and have not hesitated to recommend the product to friends.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  I&#x27;ve added a few drops of this Argan Oil to my hand lotion, face cream and hair styling cream.  In each case I noticed an immediate improvement to each of these products.  The Argan oil was absorbed quickly and the improvement that I noticed immediately really seemed to last all day.  This Argan oil is also very reasonably priced.  I will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for a few days and have already noticed a huge difference in my hair. Its shiny and my dandruff is almost gone. I no longer use conditioner just the argan oil. Also started using it on my face and I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t need my regular moisturizor anymore.</li>
            <li> I use this in the ends of my long hair.  Keeps the ends looking hydrated and shiny.</li>
            <li> I got this originally on a very low cost trial deal, but since I discovered that it is the only thing that actually helps my dry scalp in the winter. I&#x27;ve since bought more (technically, it was a Christmas gift from my Amazon wish list, but I would have bought it if my brother hadn&#x27;t). The oil itself works very well for me, and I also appreciated the in-depth brochure they emailed me with my original purchase. I highly recommend both the product and company.</li>
            <li> Is a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;The product has to inform good friends</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and has so many purposes I used some on a dry patch where I tend to have eczema issues and the skin feels so soft and silky now. This can also be used to help restore moisture as well as used in the hair.</li>
            <li> When I received this product, the oil smells of manure, and despair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was *disgusting.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a quick Google Search to determine if maybe this is how the oil smells on a regular basis: no it is not. Rancid smelling oil is impure and should be avoided. This isn&#x27;t going to be used anywhere on my body or anywhere except maybe for lubing fans. No way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want my money back.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product about couple of weeks for our Hair. Things are looking good. The product is easy to apply on Hair, keep the wavy hair nice, shiny, humid, and healthy. I would recommend this product to my friends and family!  High quality product to keep your Hair/Nails healthy.</li>
            <li> Great Argan Oil.  Can&#x27;t find a better price.  The best part is there is no dropper. to break or spill over,  it is powered by a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;organic too!</li>
            <li> I love this product it gives my hair shine and makes it feel healthy again. I also didnt feel the need to use the plethora of hair products that i normally use on a daily basis. I also started using it on my dry cuticles and it made them feel normal and healthy again too. This is an all purpose product for the body . I recommend this to anyone who needs healthier nails hair or skin.All</li>
            <li> My mom heard that Argan Oil was good for wrinkles (she is 88) so when I ordered hers, I ordered one for myself ( I am 67). A few weeks later I fell down some stairs and broke my hip which resulted in surgery and an eight inch scar. I began using it on the scar and found it amazingly effective in reducing the looks of the scar: less redness, less noticeable, comforting to massage it -- &#x27;I would recommend it as doing what it claims😀</li>
            <li> The smell was so bad I had to throw it out :( Glad it was $1 - otherwise I would want my money back.</li>
            <li> What can I say? I really do love this Argan Oil!!! I use it in my hair and on my skin. It calms my frizzy mess and smooths and calms my angry sun kissed skin. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS ARGAN OIL!!! It&#x27;s organic - a HUGE plus for me... and made my hair the smoothest it&#x27;s ever been. I am so excited about this oil. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face yet, but I did use it on my cuticles, and it seemed to perform well there as well. I will say that the initial smell isn&#x27;t great (it&#x27;s not terrible either, but not my favorite), but after I rinsed my hair, my hair smelled really nice. Overall, this one is a must-have for me.</li>
            <li> Does not smell good like I was hoping. I&#x27;m not sure what all to do with it, I tried to download the uses guide which was unsuccessful.</li>
            <li> I think the aragan oil is great for my hair and skin, but the pump allows for too much to come out at one time and the lid does not close onto the container.  Since you don&#x27;t need very much of the product at one time the pump makes it difficult to get a small amount and too much makes the hair overly oily and weighed down.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most amazing oils I have ever used I would recommend to anyone with dry</li>
            <li> I could not believe how amazing the Argan oil leaves my skin as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  It&#x27;s as wonderful as the documentary I watched on TV.  I would order this oil forever.  I&#x27;m 70 years old, so my skin naturally is on the dry and slightly wrinkled side, but after applying it to the back of my hand, it looked like the hand of a 40 year old.  I have never written a review on a product before, but had so many good things to say about this miraculous oil, I decided to give a strong recommendation to anyone who wants to look younger.  A. Woods</li>
            <li> Got this on sale, and the wife loves it! The timing was perfect, because she was planning on buying some the day it came in the mail. Not sure what this should cost, but the price I paid definitely makes it worth 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I bought this at a great deal and could not be happier with my purchase! This product does not really have a smell to it which is fantastic! Even though it is an oil it is not greasy at all. It makes a big difference on my dry skin and not to mention how soft and shiny it makes my hair. I use this daily on the tips of my hair as I have horrible dead ends. The argon oil helps to bring the moisture back in! I am seriously happy with this product and do recommend it to every who need to bring moisture back to the hair and skin</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands of argan oil and this is one of my favorites.  The packaging is beautiful, the bottle is attractive and the dispenser works great.  My hair, skin and nails look healthy and shiny and I have made a lot of body oils, butters and lotions using this oil.  Organic argan oil is one of the best items you can purchase for yourself, it offers so many benefits.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this Argan Oil. I have used it on my nails, cuticles and especially my hair and it works great! The seller is wonderful and sends you links how uses for Argan oil. Thank you so much! I highly recommend this seller. I would say he definitely aims to please his customers</li>
            <li> This oil has literally become my favorite and only oil. I&#x27;m in the process of transitioning and I try to be careful of what I put into my hair. I don&#x27;t really like putting oil and different types of products in my hair because either they leave my hair an Oily Mess or just don&#x27;t add any shine and just leave it frizzy. This oil leaves my hair hydrated and looking beautiful in the end. It has a strong smell at first but after that first glitch the smell is gone. I puts it on my daughter hair as well because her hair is always look dull and dry but not with this oil. This stuff is amazing!! I got mine when there was a deal and I only paid a dollar for it, wished I would&#x27;ve bought more than just one. You will not be disappointed ppl.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is a must have, multiuse product. I especially love using just a tiny bit on my hair to add shine and tame frizz/split ends. I love that it&#x27;s USDA organic, and the quality of the product really shows through in the results it gives.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil on my hair and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. It makes my hair look very shiny and glossy in a healthy way. It also makes my hair feel very soft and while my hair is normally very frizzy the Argan oil has helped lessen that. You have to make sure not to use too much or it can get a bit oily but only needing a little will make it last longer. I look forward to trying it out on my cuticles as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of argan oil. It&#x27;s slowly but surely growing on me. I love that I can use this product, not only for my hair, but for my cuticles, rough areas such as elbows and heels. I like the pump and the ease of use of the bottle. Nice product.</li>
            <li> Works very well to soften and manage curly hair.  I detected no odor at all.  My only suggestion for improvement would  be to the packaging and not the product; it would be nice to have more control over how much oil is dispensed as I find that I&#x27;d like somewhere close to around half the amount that comes out per pump.</li>
            <li> This high quality virgin argan oil does wonder for my wife&#x27;s skin and especially her hair. A little bit, goes a long way. She adds this to her hair post shower and it makes for very soft and shiny and flowing hair. I am impressed with the results she has gotten and she is now a big believer in argan oil. More importantly, the argan oil does not negatively impact her coloring and hair treatments, so she is also pleased about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product for my wife as she wanted to try some argan oil products. I am impressed with the results she has gotten and she is now a big believer in argan oil. She loves the way her hair looks after using this oil</li>
            <li> works well to keep hair silky smoothe</li>
            <li> Although I can&#x27;t use this product in my hair (not the fault of the product but of my fine hair), I do use it on my feet.  I love how it&#x27;s helped my dry, cracked heels (I haven&#x27;t found anything else that has made any sort of difference)!  For that reason alone, I will keep using this oil. I put it on right before I put on my socks in the morning, and I use it again right before bed.  I don&#x27;t really notice a smell, so it&#x27;s obviously very lightly fragranced.  I&#x27;m glad I tried this oil!!</li>
            <li> Like this oil a lot. Have only used it on my nails, but see great improvement already.  The deal on amazon was great, hopefully will go to that price again!</li>
            <li> I love first of all that it has no strong scent that its organic and it works on hair skin and nails. I really use it on my hair i have to hide it from my daughter because she loves it as well because it leaves a natural shine to the hair not heavy on the hair either. Some oils are so oily they cause acne on the face not this oil love how this Argan oil moisturizes my hair makes it look healthy.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Argan Oil an I am happy I had the opportunity to give it a try, I have always used natural product on my face only i.e coconut oil, shea butter, olive oil, sesame seed oil, grape seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of using this item I can tell the difference in my skin, not only was it soft and smooth it was also noticeable brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this product. I&#x27;ve been applying this to my face every morning and night for the past week and a half and I&#x27;ve already seen a huge improvement in my skin&#x27;s overall health. I would definitely recommend argan oil for anyone that suffers from dry skin.</li>
            <li> Enjoy is way better. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Gives shine and doesn&#x27;t look greasy.  I put a little too much in my hair the first time I used and you can&#x27;t even tell.  Not oily like other similar products.</li>
            <li> I can say I am very pleased with the oil, I am a guy with long unkempt hair and use it on my beard also. so i got the oil for multiple reasons. It is doing wonders on both so far so good. Hair and beard are looking and feeling healthier already. The smell is a bit nutty but actually not that bad and after a few uses i find I actually like the scent. Not to mention the customer service was great and I felt like the company actually cared about me.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and I love it. My split ends are gone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil with my essential oils as a face moisturizer.  Works wonders on my acne prone skin!  I love that it&#x27;s organic and pure.  I&#x27;ve also used it on my hair in the ends  and it does wonders for your hair!</li>
            <li> my mom loves it and she will buy another one later after she use the bottle I got</li>
            <li> My hair texture is exceptionally thick and dry.  The Vizeri Beauty Pure Argan Oil is a remarkable improvement.  I will continue to use it and highly recommend the Vizeri Beauty. Very nice product. I like everything about it....great hair conditioner, nice packaging and dispenser.... thanks!!</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  Moisturizes my hair and does not leave it greasy at all.  Best Argan oil I have tried so far (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot).</li>
            <li> This oil is great. It leaves my hair very shiny. Will continue to keep using. Would recommend this to friends</li>
            <li> I very much appreciated the infos in your message.I knew as soon as I opened the bottle that the argan oil I had previously ordered from Essential Depot was fake.&lt;br /&gt;I like your product and will buy more next time.</li>
            <li> I find your product fantastic for my dry hair. No complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly buy your product again.</li>
            <li> Generous quantity and it has that nutty scent that lets you know it&#x27;s the good stuff -- I have super long hair, past my waist, and I find that three squirts is plenty for my hair.  I like to put it on over night then shampoo in the morning.  my hair is so soft!  The smell goes away pretty quickly so my hair just smells like my shampoo. I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this. Good size, worked and smelled great. Will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve only used it on my hair, but I freaking love it! I have really fine hair so I was worried about my hair getting oily.  IT doesn&#x27;t at all!! I use it about every 3 days,its been about 2 weeks.  my hair is really soft and it holds curls much longer without having to put a mass amount of hairspray in... I put it in after I shampoo and let it sit in my hair for a few minutes in the shower. I like that there isnt really a scent to it, cause Ive already got a scent I like with my shampoo lol.</li>
            <li> With just a few drops a day ,and using this for only a week I have already noticed my skin is more hydrated, this is a great all over facial moisturizer .It initially looked greasy when I  put on ,but absorbed quite rapidly into my skin and kept it moisturized.I have combination skin and was worried that it might make the oily areas more greasy but it didnt. Its also been great for my hair .My hair is long and damaged from years of dryer and hot iron useage ,and I have been looking for  something to make it look healthier I read that argan oil was great for the hair and have been applying it to the ends after every wash, my hair is looking much healthier and actually has some shine to it now.The ends that were dry and broken off are not so brittle anymore,and it has tamed down my frizzes.I love this product</li>
            <li> I loved this product. It has my hair feeling amazing. I have only been using this product for a couple of weeks and my hair feels silky smooth. It just takes a couple of pumps in your shampoo. This product could last you and worth it for sure!</li>
            <li> Very versatile!! This product has so many differed  uses!!! I like that they send an email along with the product so that you know exactly what it works great for!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of the people that received the product for cheaper to try it out, but I&#x27;m not leaving this review because of that.  I gave mine to my mother, who hasn&#x27;t ever tried argan oil, as I have.  A. Mine didn&#x27;t smell as bad as some ladies and B. I showed my mom how to mix it in with a variety of her other skin and hair care products and the smell completely went away. I love argan oil, and I liked that this was a &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; form so I could choose what to do with it, i.e. use it alone or mix it. I especially love it on my dry, cracked feet and the tips of my hair.  I passed that on to my mom, and she loves it too!</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and I am satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> Argan oil is so amazing.  I&#x27;ve just recently discovered this aHmazing product! While, I cannot put oil anywhere NEAR my hair, I love to use it for my skin, as I&#x27;ve seeminly acquired DRY skin as I&#x27;ve aged, this stuff is amazing for me.  I also Like to use it as a &amp;#34;cuticle oil&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m preparing my fingernails for polish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for skin conditions like eczema as well.  The smell of this particular oil kinda reminds me of a nail polish remover smell.  However, it&#x27;s not overpowering at ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really need a product to use because while I have slightly oily hair, I also have a WILDLY dry scalp.  I may try to use this and see if I can aide my dry scalp and just try to use it when I don&#x27;t have anywhere really special to go !</li>
            <li> Awesome oil. Used as a hot oil treatment to add moisture back in wet hair. Also use to help keep hair soft and smooth through the day. Too much makes your hair greasy, but finding the right amt tames flyaways and helps keep my hair smooth all day.</li>
            <li> My wife is using it as belly cream for pregnant belly. So far so good. It feels natural and clean.    Updated: Some people commented about the smell of this oil...We prefer the oil to be fragrance-free / chemical-free!</li>
            <li> wow this stuff smells really rancid. I am an avid user of Josie Maran 100% Argan Oil and there is no smell whatsoever. Really skeptical that this is 100% Argan Oil or maybe I got a bad batch. Tossed it after one use....that bad!</li>
            <li> I love my brush.ot works great..i would recommend it to friends and family</li>
            <li> Not the best smell but it works great on my ends as a pre-shower treatment or an after shower treatment.</li>
            <li> Everywhere you turn, it seems like you see the word Argan Oil, its being added to everything and I can see why. I love this stuff, I use it for literally everything from my cuticles to my cracked heels. I love doing a oil treatment on my hair because it makes it so shiny and soft. I&#x27;ve even used it on my cats and dogs fur. I recently started massaging it into my scars that I&#x27;ve had for years and thought that were here to stay but they have actually lightened and are almost gone. My daughter likes to dye her hair different colors each week it seems so after we do this I coat her hair with the Argan Oil, put a plastic shower cap on and have her sit under a dryer for a deep heat oil treatment and it&#x27;s really kept the condition of her hair very nice.It&#x27;s not dry, coarse and brittle like it used to be with all the dyeing.I really recommend you get some of this to keep around because there&#x27;s so many uses for it and I&#x27;m sure I will be ordering some more here very shortly with the winter drying weather coming up.</li>
            <li> I love argan oil products. I tried this on my hair first. It left my hair a little oily so I added it to my shampoo and conditioner. My hair feels wonderful now. I use it daily on my body. My skin is softer, my nails look better, and my feet look nicer.</li>
            <li> This is my first Argan product and I find this oil very light and I primarily use it on my face.  It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy which is a plus plus in my book. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say whether or not I&#x27;m seeing an improvement in my skin but will update after a few weeks.  So far, however, I like this product very much</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!! It does wonders for my hair and skin and is non greasy!</li>
            <li> It was a nice moisturizing oil and I used it for my hair. It is a very good product if you are ok with a bit funky smell. It smells like any oil should smell, and is probably an indicator that it is organic and natural. I think it is an ok product to use if you don&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
            <li> Smell is somewhat off-putting but once you get used to it it&#x27;s quite amazing.  My hands are soft and have virtually completely healed!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this and really loved this product.  I&#x27;ve tried many Argan oil products and have been a longtime fan of it&#x27;s benefits.  I appreciate the organic practices associated with this product.  It&#x27;s consistency is nice and the smell is pleasant.  This is a TRUE Argan oil that has not been refined excessively removing all it&#x27;s natural benefits.  Great product and highly recommended.  I also loved the handy and informative e-booklet that I received with this purchase about Argan oil, harvesting practices and usage.</li>
            <li> This was a useful product for skin and haircare.</li>
            <li> I received the argan oil on the promised date. The packaging is nice and sturdy to avoid any leakage. The bottle has a pump that dispenses very small amount of oil, this is important as a little argan oil goes a long way. The smell is nutty and I prefer to mix it with some carrier oils. It left my hair luxuriously soft and healthy. My wife is planning to use it for her skin too especially now that winter is around the corner. One little bottle and loads of uses, definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Truly pleased, bought several for daughters. I used on my hair and it made my white,dry hair very manageable. Love the oil!</li>
            <li> I saw this for 10 dollars and know is 14 I going to buy this item if is 10 dollars</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced Argan Oil.... I took a risk and tried it. Impressed! It works great to add sheen and smooth out fly away hairs. I also use it on my skin and nails, soaks right in without feeling greasy and makes a noticeable difference.  Thank you, Vizeri! Great product.</li>
            <li> I can not praise this enough.  I have been able to eliminate three skin care products since i started using this Argan Oil--day cream, night cream and eye cream.  My skin is smooth and soft.  What is really surprising is that dark spots on my face and hands have faded dramatically.  That is in less than a month&#x27;s use.  The oil soaks into the skin very quickly, disappearing within a minute or two. Makeup products glide on and stay put throughout the day.  That was my main fear, that the oil would make my makeup fade or slip away.  It does NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my hair.  I put one pump in my palm, rub my hands together, apply the oil to my face and neck, and rub the remainder on the ends of my wet hair before applying my blow drying product.  It is also great on dry hair, disappearing immediately.  It leaves my hair shining and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!!!!  This Argan Oil is a jewel.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing BUT alittle goes along way. Used on my face at night for extra moisturizing too and it was perfect! Would buy again!!!!</li>
