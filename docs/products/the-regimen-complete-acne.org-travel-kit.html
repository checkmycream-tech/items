            <li>This product works best on acne and it will start giving result in a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy</li>
            <li>cleanser is great.</li>
            <li>I thought this product was very great and effective, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>And honestly it works!</li>
            <li>This product is soo good.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li>Nice product and great travel size.  </li>
            <li>This item arrived at my home so fast and the product itself is just great!  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>so hope it gets better</li>
            <li>I tried many products but did not work.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like right-after-one-day effect, but more like take effects after two weeks.</li>
            <li>This time, I ordered this travel kit size (because I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work either).  </li>
            <li>I bought this travel kit to try the product,,, i love it</li>
            <li>It was more than my expectation.</li>
            <li>We wanted to test Dan&#x27;s products first and they are superior to anything in the store.</li>
            <li>I do have fairly oily--but very sensitive!--skin with blackheads in some areas and</li>
            <li>If u keep on using this product for a month, you will be acne free.</li>
            <li>This product line is by far superior.</li>
            <li>you use this, I wish you as much success as it has brought me!</li>
            <li>They not only do not work for me but also ruin every towel/shirt/pillowcase I own because of the benzoyl peroxide and sylic acid!  </li>
            <li>My face seems to get clean</li>
            <li>Its better than paying more for the complete kit.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the moisturizer is anything special</li>
            <li>It really does works!!</li>
            <li>Very nick and helpful pack!!</li>
            <li>I rarely use any face creams because of the oily/sensitive nature of my skin.</li>
            <li>I think this is at least equally good and a better value in the large</li>
            <li>face was pimple-free within the first 3 days of using the product.  </li>
            <li>I am probably not using as large a quantity of each product as the Acne.org \\&quot;regimin\\&quot; would demand, but I&#x27;m also not treating my whole</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been working very well</li>
            <li>Acne.org products seem to be working very well for me.</li>
            <li>no longer touch my face much.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li>after using it several weeks, i do feel it shrink my pores and make my skin looks smooth.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the moisturizer that comes with the kit, it stings for some reason.</li>
            <li>Use clean white t-shirts instead.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these products for 3 weeks now and my skin are getting better with less acne.&lt;br /&gt;Worth</li>
            <li>In the 5 weeks since I have been using the travel kit, I have only had maybe 2 pimples, that went away quickly.  </li>
            <li>wonder if, by doing the pillowcase changes and being gentler are the main part of the cure and if any acne product would work if I did these things.  </li>
            <li>I have mild to at times moderate acne.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t enjoy it, but I am already seeing an improvement and no new pimples since I started its use, so I&#x27;m tolerating the discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so excited about seeing what it can do in the long run.</li>
            <li>You, yourself must do certain things in order for your acne to clear up.  </li>
            <li>Well I have used up all of the little bottles and my skin did not get any better.  </li>
            <li>Upon  visiting the Acne.org website, I was so excited to try something other people were actually saying worked better than proactive (which not only did the proactive not work for me</li>
            <li>but it  has made my skin 10x worse after using for 1 year, however it did work in the beginning for like the first 2 wks) but also had its own website.  </li>
            <li>I am 30 years old and this so should not be happening!</li>
            <li>If anyone actually finds a product out there that works and really gives you clear skin, please let me know!!  </li>
            <li>However, as of right now my face is REALLY, REALLY dry from the treatment, I understand that it&#x27;s part of the process</li>
            <li>It is clear and practically odorless.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to even break the clear face spell to wear makeup when I went out, but I did and then did the kit routine again after, and still no acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They really worked, his acne was much improved and since using this product he&#x27;s only had occasional pimples.</li>
            <li>I only touch my face to wash it gently with the cleanser in this kit, and after to put on the treatment and to put on the moisturizer as needed.  </li>
            <li>I have an oily T-zone and a sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far it works</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many over-the-counter facial products and a few from my doctor that caused me to break out in a rash.</li>
            <li>but love that my acne is slowly going away</li>
            <li>I do see some improvement, but I have to give it a little more time because i still have minor break outs.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t dry up my skin so much.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive use only the cleanser and any moist!</li>
            <li>my skin is clear now except for the black spots which i dont know if this product will clear.</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had acne for SOOO long</li>
            <li> The Treatment is benzoyl peroxide which will dry you out a bit.</li>
            <li> I still have a lot of the treatment left and half the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Enough to last for at least a couple of weeks.</li>

            <li> My daughter had tried Proactive as well as a variety of other regiments.</li>
            <li> then i started using it every other day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using it occasionally on the drier parts of my face (crows&#x27; feet zone) but never after applying the BP, since I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll accidentally drag that stuff near my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but this really sucks since I&#x27;m running low on moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The closest OTC product I could compare it to is Cetaphil cleanser for oily skin, which was previously my \\&quot;best\\&quot; choice.</li>
            <li> I bought this little bottle for a trial basis.</li>
            <li> I went with the small (2 oz) size because in the past I&#x27;ve wasted too much money on expensive products that give me a rash.</li>

            <li> It took a few weeks for my skin to adjust to the BR.</li>

            <li> I used it everyday till the acne disappeared</li>
            <li> Benzoil Peroxide is 2.5%, it feels a little icky (itchy/burning sensation), but I think that&#x27;s what it is supposed to feel like.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t like the dryness :/</li>
            <li> And for the people that are not sure just try the travel kit and see for your self.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s been working very well I&#x27;m so happy cause I been struggling wit my face for so long now. only been doing the regiman for 3weeks so hope it gets better just don&#x27;t like the dryness :/ but love that my acne is slowly going away</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m now officially in my \\&quot;mid 30&#x27;s\\&quot;, but I still have an unpleasant tendency toward a line of acne along my jawline.

I might even get a big bottle of the moisturizer, though I find it impossible to imagine using up even 8 oz of face cream.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Followed the instructions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; and used up all the product in the bottles and there still was no change. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> My son has struggled a bit with acne and has used these products for several years now.  He&#x27;s now 18 and still using them.  They really worked, his acne was much improved and since using this product he&#x27;s only had occasional pimples.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with my acne for several years. I tried many products but did not work. I just used this set for two weeks, and all my acne disappeared! Now I have stopped using this product for about two months, and my acne never comes back! I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this I would tell anyone about it my brother has bad ance so I am going to  let him try and I will see the result</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit as recommended by online reviewers for the treatment to get rid of/minimize the blackheads on the nose. And it is working. I use it just on the nose after applying the toner all over my face, and before applying the moisturizer. I can see the blackheads on my nose are smaller now. It&#x27;s not like right-after-one-day effect, but more like take effects after two weeks.</li>
            <li> You, yourself must do certain things in order for your acne to clear up.  It can&#x27;t be ALL about the medicine.  That said, I think this product works.  I had to make a few simple changes about what I was doing but they were simple:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) be gentler with your skin  2) change your pillow case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had acne for SOOO long and it seemed like nothing worked.  I tried everything.  But in trying all sorts of harsh treatments my face many times it got worse.  This time, I ordered this travel kit size (because I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work either).  While I was reading the reviews someone mentioned the pillowcases.  I&#x27;m at idiot for not thinking of this sooner. If I have acne and I sleep on the same pillowcase for a week, then I am grinding my face all night on my bacteria covered pillowcase!  The reviewer even suggested a cheap way to do this rather than buy expensive pillow cases. Use clean white t-shirts instead.  I bought a pack of 7 and now use them in place of my pillow case.  I change it every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer touch my face much.  No picking or squeezing!  I only touch my face to wash it gently with the cleanser in this kit, and after to put on the treatment and to put on the moisturizer as needed.  I was hesitant to even break the clear face spell to wear makeup when I went out, but I did and then did the kit routine again after, and still no acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face was pimple-free within the first 3 days of using the product.  In the 5 weeks since I have been using the travel kit, I have only had maybe 2 pimples, that went away quickly.  I just ordered my second kit, so for around $15 a kit will last about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if, by doing the pillowcase changes and being gentler are the main part of the cure and if any acne product would work if I did these things.  I don&#x27;t know.  But I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this, I wish you as much success as it has brought me!</li>
            <li> Upon  visiting the Acne.org website, I was so excited to try something other people were actually saying worked better than proactive (which not only did the proactive not work for me but it  has made my skin 10x worse after using for 1 year, however it did work in the beginning for like the first 2 wks) but also had its own website.  Well I have used up all of the little bottles and my skin did not get any better.  I am so tired of buying products that swear they will clear up acne when really it&#x27;s all just marketing and advertising.  I have tried them all.  They not only do not work for me but also ruin every towel/shirt/pillowcase I own because of the benzoyl peroxide and sylic acid!  If anyone actually finds a product out there that works and really gives you clear skin, please let me know!!  I am 30 years old and this so should not be happening!</li>
            <li> I bought this travel kit to try the product,,, i love it and I did bought the 8oz products and will continue use the regimen. thank you acne.org</li>
            <li> I like this facial treatment. I bought the travel size kit to see how my skin would react to it before buying the larger bottles. I repurchased the face wash since I went through it the fastest. The Treatment is benzoyl peroxide which will dry you out a bit. It took a few weeks for my skin to adjust to the BR. I still have a lot of the treatment left and half the moisturizer. I have mild to at times moderate acne. I really don&#x27;t need a lot.I don&#x27;t think the moisturizer is anything special but it doesn&#x27;t break me out either. I may reorder the moisturizer after I&#x27;ve finished this.</li>
            <li> This is the best product line in the market for Acne.  My daughter had tried Proactive as well as a variety of other regiments. This product line is by far superior.</li>
            <li> This item arrived at my home so fast and the product itself is just great!  Within two weeks my daughter saw a big difference!</li>
            <li> I do see some improvement, but I have to give it a little more time because i still have minor break outs.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was very great and effective, I would recommend it. Two thumbs up!! It really does works!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any severe acne issues. but my pores are big and have some acne scars. after using it several weeks, i do feel it shrink my pores and make my skin looks smooth. even some of my friends notice the difference</li>
            <li> This product is soo good. I always had acne but they suddenly became worse my skin is clear now except for the black spots which i dont know if this product will clear. It dries up the acne within 2 to 3 days you should start seeing a difference. I used it everyday till the acne disappeared then i started using it every other day so it doesn&#x27;t dry up my skin so much. It was more than my expectation. I bought this little bottle for a trial basis. I have an oily T-zone and a sensitive skin but it worked wonders. I would definitely recommend this product. I am gonna buy the bigger bottles with the jojoba oil for moisturizing. I am so excited about seeing what it can do in the long run. Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> We wanted to test Dan&#x27;s products first and they are superior to anything in the store. The husband loves the non-scent, the non-color, and the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of all the products. He got the jojoba oil for shaving and stuff too and digs that as well. We have since purchased the larger sizes.</li>
            <li> Well I got this in the mail about 3 days ago. And honestly it works! I know its too soon but before I got this in the mail I had a hug pimple on my cheek that wouldn&#x27;t go away. 3 days later it had shrunk about 90%. However, as of right now my face is REALLY, REALLY dry from the treatment, I understand that it&#x27;s part of the process but this really sucks since I&#x27;m running low on moisturizer. I really don&#x27;t like the moisturizer that comes with the kit, it stings for some reason. So far it works I hope it continues to work. And for the people that are not sure just try the travel kit and see for your self. Its better than paying more for the complete kit.</li>
            <li> Very nick and helpful pack!! I strongly recommend this product! If you have sensitive use only the cleanser and any moist! for me works great!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for 3 weeks now and my skin are getting better with less acne.&lt;br /&gt;Worth buying products!!</li>
            <li> This product works best on acne and it will start giving result in a week. If u keep on using this product for a month, you will be acne free.</li>
            <li> Nice product and great travel size.  Enough to last for at least a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Its been about two months and my skin has gotten worse and I have been doing the regimen SPOT ON!</li>
