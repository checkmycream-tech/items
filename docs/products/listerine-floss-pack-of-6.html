            <li>This is the best floss ever</li>

            <li>This is a great product.</li>

            <li>Also the price cut from around $4.50 to $3.00 is a great plus.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to have it.</li>
            <li>Feel this floss does a great job and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li>Great dental floss for teeth with the wider spaces</li>
            <li>I am so happy I found this floss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a happy camper and my dentist is happy too.</li>
            <li>Is very strong floss and has a great flavor, the best floss I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>My husband bought the mint version without the added cinnamon, and it tastes great, refreshing even!  </li>
            <li>Good, does what it says.</li>
            <li>I loved that stuff.</li>
            <li>I loved the Reach version, just wish this one had fluoride in it.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for your teeth.</li>
            <li>My dentist seems to think I&#x27;m doing a good job flossing too, and this is the floss I use.</li>
            <li>but it does a fairly good job of flossing.</li>
            <li>Good woven floss, which was ruined by adding cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Good floss for those with bridgework or tender gums...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why a manufacturer replaces a perfectly good product with something inferior, but that appears to be what has been done here.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m just happy to be able to buy and use them.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this on Amazon!</li>
            <li>My favorite floss!</li>
            <li>I am so glad to find it!</li>
            <li>Have a nice taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they are great and my mouth and gums love the minty fresh tingling!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best floss on the market for getting into the nooks and crannies that I have in abundance!  </li>
            <li>Good minty clean taste.</li>
            <li>Look at the fine print!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
            <li>This is my husbands favorite dental floss.  </li>
            <li>I started using this floss, and now I love it also.</li>
            <li>Love this floss.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this floss anywhere so was glad to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li>Nicer feel than the waxy ribbon of most flosses.</li>
            <li>Love this floss.</li>
            <li>Removes more of the stuff between teeth than waxed or tape floss.</li>
            <li>She suggested I use the woven floss because it grabs more of the plaque.</li>
            <li>Love the woven floss which I use to get in Reach.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite floss</li>
            <li>Tastes great and really removes the crud from between you teeth.  </li>
            <li>It has been my favorite floss</li>
            <li>The flavor and texture of the floss will encourage you to floss more:-)</li>
            <li>Much better than waxed floss</li>
            <li>(okay, I didn&#x27;t literally run to it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this floss.</li>
            <li>Love the way my mouth feels after use.</li>
            <li>I gave my kids each one and they love it too.</li>
            <li>This floss works just okay.  </li>
            <li>I agree with the many dissatisfied reviews with the rebranding.  </li>
            <li>Because it has this greater area it cleans out more plaque.</li>
            <li>It works great and gets in between my very closely spaced teeth.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more cinnamon-sweet than burning unlike what some people here are describing.</li>
            <li>I used to buy the ones with floride, but can&#x27;t find them any more.</li>
            <li>so they work and are better than non-woven floss</li>
            <li>Flavor is just OK, I would prefer unflavored.</li>
            <li>when I found them, I got a six pack! :)</li>
            <li>the woven string makes it very easy and comfortable to floss with and doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums.</li>
            <li>Gentle on our gums, pleasant flavor and stays intact to do the job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft on the gums and GREAT for cleaning between teeth.(good taste, too).  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>It seems to catch more while still being comfortable on the gums.</li>
            <li>comfortable and better cleaning vs</li>
            <li>I used the soft, flexible ribbon type they offer and it was great.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a woven floss that also has a pleasant taste, pass on this particular version.  </li>
            <li>I prefer cinnamon flavor over other flavors, so this product is perfect, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love how well this floss works, and how clean my mouth feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a woven floss that cleans below the gum line easily and without pain or struggle, you&#x27;ve found it.  </li>
            <li>Makes flossing easy and almost a pleasure.</li>
            <li>I read some comments that the cinnamon flavor is too strong, but I don&#x27;t have any problem with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not the nice minty taste we&#x27;ve known and loved.</li>
            <li>I loved the older version of this product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t agree with the comments that are saying the cinnamon taste is so strong as to burn lips.</li>
            <li>The flavor is not that sweet and lovely minty thing.  </li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>Does a fine job removing any particle there may be.</li>
            <li>Then I just about panicked when they said it wasn&#x27;t available anymore.</li>
            <li>Just enough texture to the woven floss to give your teeth a great cleaning.</li>
            <li>It works and is comfortable.</li>
            <li>Smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>Listerine is a fabulous mouth wash</li>
            <li>A good alternative if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>I loved the old version and have used it for years.  </li>
            <li>My dentist has advised me to use the Gentle Gum Care floss for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>I loved when they were made by the other brand because I liked the flavor.  </li>
            <li>The cloth helps grab food products really well, so there is a nice feeling of well-done job and clean mouth.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>This product is flavored with mint/cinnamon not fluoride like the original.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the original product that contained fluoride.</li>
            <li>This floss is soft, gentle, yet very effective.</li>
            <li>Best floss I have used, dentist could hardly find anything to scrape after 6 months.</li>
            <li>Not the other gentle gum care with fluoride, but 1000% better than the plastic flosses out there!!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is gently woven, so it is able to slide in and out without pulling on my teeth.</li>
            <li>It is definitely my favorite floss (never thought I&#x27;d say I have a favorite floss), but paying $10 each was just a bit much (or a lot too much).</li>
            <li>When Johnson &amp; Johnson changed their labeling from &amp;#34;Reach Gentle Gum Care&amp;#34; to the Listerine labeling, it threw many people off.  </li>
            <li>As with most people reviewing here, I was looking for the Reach gentle care woven floss that I&#x27;d gotten so used to</li>
            <li>Works the same, good alternative to REACH.</li>
            <li>The very friendly customer service rep said they did a rebranding, and now it&#x27;s called J&amp;J Listerine Gentle Gum Care.</li>
            <li>Putting the Listerine name on it is fine, but bring back the original flavor and more importantly, the flouride.</li>
            <li>so I go through it twice as quickly as I used to.</li>
            <li>So, for a quick 3&amp;#34; piece to get a stubborn piece of your dinner out, it will require some twirling or holding taut to keep the strands from falling apart.  </li>
            <li>Lucky me,  I ordered a six pack.</li>
            <li>I enjoy these and first tried samples at my dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>Luckily the new re branded version is the same great quality product.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the gums, but a bit too strongly flavored</li>
            <li>The old product was superb, why mess with perfection.</li>
            <li>Six nice large packages of soft woven floss.</li>
            <li>Wow, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the Listerine flavor</li>
            <li>Replaces the former REACH Woven Dental floss nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the cinnamint flavor..</li>
            <li>Anyway, buy it, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>so you need to use more than regular floss (you need to use a clean section of floss at each tooth or it will shred and get stuck between your teeth).</li>
            <li>It just means it&#x27;s not the right tool for every job.</li>
            <li>You gotta floss, do it right.  </li>
            <li>Looks think but slides right between my teeth without injuring my gums.</li>
            <li>I like the woven floss so much better than the thin kind!</li>
            <li>The woven floss has a higher surface area than most other flosses, so works better.</li>
            <li>Still, I think it is a small price to pay for the great health benefits.</li>
            <li>I would like to see the flouride added back, but the flavor is good, and the woven style removes the plaque so much better than any other floss I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Great to have this product back in a slightly different incarnation.  </li>
            <li>My favorite part of this floss is its &amp;#34;taste.&amp;#34; Not overwhelmingly strong, but very fresh and clean.   </li>
            <li>very gentle on gums.  </li>
            <li>It is great if your gums are sensitive to other floss that can slice your gums.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super gentle on the gums, and I feel like the thicker rope-like material helps grab particles and clean between teeth better than other floss.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, and is hard to find in neighborhood drug stores.</li>
            <li>And the individual threads catch more of what they need to, because they create a ridged surface area.</li>
            <li>If your are allergic be aware.</li>
            <li>I first got on</li>
            <li>I suspect Johnson and Johnson did this because Reach was not as recognizable a brand name as Listerine.</li>
            <li>I will be back for more.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of floss.)</li>
            <li>It does a much better job of removing plaque than the regular waxed or unwaxed floss.</li>
            <li>I was pretty upset when Johnson and Johnson discontinued their woven floss with fluoride...</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This is the first woven floss I&#x27;ve ever tried and now I&#x27;m a believer.  </li>
            <li>the woven floss bandwagon years ago after finding it seemed to do a better job of cleaning than the flat, tape-style floss.</li>
            <li>It has a pretty strong mint flavor, so get it only if you like that.</li>
            <li>I assume this costs a bit more than other floss, and the comfort is well worth it for us.</li>
            <li>There was some confusion over J&amp;J changing the name from Reach, but other than that this is good floss for people with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>It will get plaque, but doesn&#x27;t feel as effective as regular floss with more of a texture to the floss (which is to be expected since that is what irritates sensitive gums).</li>
            <li>You need something mildly abrasive, and this soft, woven floss serves the purpose.  </li>
            <li>Although the floss looks similar, it has a strong minty taste and leaves my gums and lips tingling/burning after flossing.  </li>
            <li>but honestly I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a transition from the previous version.</li>
            <li>So I need to be really vigilant or my gums are going to swell.</li>
            <li>It seems to be the replacement for Gentle Care floss.</li>
            <li>This Listerine floss is the rebranded Reach Gentle Gum Care</li>
            <li>The flavor is not even as intense as some chewing gums out there.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also got a bit stronger taste, but not by much.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Wish I could use it because it cleans very well.</li>
            <li>This floss is so gentle.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the notes that this used to be under the JnJ Reach umbrella, as I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to use than waxed floss.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mint flavor is subtle but pleasant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a bit of a bite from the cinnamon, but the price is right and it works just as well as the old stuff.</li>
            <li>I just want a strong piece of woven floss to hold together long enough to clean between my teeth.</li>
            <li>I have been using the original Reach Gum Care for several years now since I discovered it in dental school.</li>
            <li>I admit it does have a different taste as the original, but after a couple of weeks I became quite fond of it.</li>
            <li>new version is a lot more economical (15 vs 26 for a pack of 6 - 50yds) for what is essentially the same product.</li>
            <li>I have to floss multiple times to feel clean, which I did not have to do with the Reach</li>
            <li>This is the new version and like it so much.  </li>
            <li>Sure there is a slight aftertaste</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Listerine Gentle Gum Care&amp;#34; is nowhere near what the &amp;#34;REACH&amp;#34; Gentle Gum Care floss was.  </li>
            <li>and now they make this particular gloss.  </li>
            <li>For tight teeth, Glide products are better.</li>
            <li>I started using this floss because my dentist highly recommended it.  </li>
            <li>The Reach product was far superior, stretchier, woven in a slicker, less likely to shred way.</li>
            <li>Instead, I will very carefully use a woven floss in the right areas, instead of this one, making sure to keep the tape flat.</li>
            <li>I miss the older variety before they changed the name and the formula to make it new and catchy..</li>
            <li>After using this for a month straight my gums stopped bleeding completely.</li>
            <li>For those of us with teeth that are very close together, the old Gum Care was the solution for getting fluoride between those teeth where a brush cannot reach.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like plastic floss and was pleasantly surprised how well this fabric floss works.</li>
            <li>This is the only floss I like to use because the floss string is a little thicker than other brands giving you a nice close floss easily.</li>
            <li>This new Listerine product is going in the trash.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle on the gum, won&#x27;t go back relaxed floss ever.</li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive gums, this is the floss for you.</li>
            <li>Perhaps they have very sensitive tastes...</li>
            <li>, it seems to fray more easily, not sure why.</li>
            <li>A very similar product to be sold as Cleanpaste by Reach at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>But the floss appears to be exactly the same.</li>
            <li>have somewhat sensitive gums that can bleed when flossing with normal floss.</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;m pretty uptight about teeth care, I used Glide for back teeth and this listerine for all others.</li>
            <li>Since it isn&#x27;t slick, but woven it has a greater surface area.  </li>
            <li>exactly as advertised and thank heaven--thick enough.</li>
            <li>again, woven floss has saved my gums and my thanks to Listerine for picking up the Reach brand--it&#x27;s not quite the same but does have multiple soft threads woven together to provide a MUCH better cleaning than the other</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly after using this stuff for 6 months, I have a hard time using anything else because this one cleans between my teeth better than anything.</li>
            <li>The only difference I can tell is that this new one doesn&#x27;t have fluoride listed as an ingredient (which I don&#x27;t think matters for this particular product...</li>
            <li>The reason for my poor review is that I was hoping for the older version which was hundred times better than this new version.</li>
            <li>As another poster (faral) pointed out, this is simply the Reach Gentle Gum Care floss re-branded.</li>
            <li>For sensitive gums, that hurts.</li>
            <li>The old product gets 5 stars.</li>
            <li>The only difference really is the flavoring - cinnamon by default on the woven version.</li>
            <li>The first is it folds over, which creates the same problem as regular floss.</li>
            <li>The price was much better than in the stores (and it is hard for me to find locally in stores)</li>
            <li>For me, that means less pain - well worth the couple bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the twisted floss because it helps to remove more debris from between my teeth.</li>
            <li>I had early perio issues and regular and proper use with this woven floss has resolved this issue completely!</li>
            <li>I will miss the old variety, but there are not a lot of options for woven floss, so likely I will continue to use it until it irritates my gums with the cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Please bring back the old version.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seems like it&#x27;s still pretty pricey on Amazon for now ($43 for 6 at the time of this review), but I&#x27;m hoping that price will go down once it hits the Amazon retailer&#x27;s shelves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a hot mess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a twisted thread with very strong mint flavor.</li>
            <li>I just ordered this &amp;#34;Listerine&amp;#34; product for the first time; other reviewers stated it is identical to the J&amp;J Reach Gentle Gum Care I have been using for a few years.  </li>
            <li>6 month supply of the best ever dental floss for those who hate to floss, for less than 20 bucks.</li>

            <li> The best in my book.</li>
            <li> Perfect alternative to REACH woven mint floss</li>
            <li> the dental floss is wonderful to use.  </li>
            <li> The best floss, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Awesome stuff.  </li>
            <li> Have tender gums and this is perfect.  </li>
            <li> This is wonderful floss.  </li>
            <li> Delicious, minty floss.</li>
            <li> Best floss on the market.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful floss!</li>
            <li> It is still the best floss out there.</li>
            <li> In fact, &amp;#34;Gentle Gum Care&amp;#34; floss is probably the best floss you can buy in the US.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product.</li>
            <li> best floss out there at any price</li>
            <li> This is the best floss ever</li>
            <li> the price was great, the floss for me is the best at removing stuff between teeth and does not slip thru my fingers.  </li>
            <li> Does a great job.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I am happy.</li>
            <li> Great service.</li>
            <li> Also the price cut from around $4.50 to $3.00 is a great plus.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy to have it.</li>
            <li> Feel this floss does a great job and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Great dental floss for teeth with the wider spaces</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found this floss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a happy camper and my dentist is happy too.</li>
            <li> Is very strong floss and has a great flavor, the best floss I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> My husband bought the mint version without the added cinnamon, and it tastes great, refreshing even!  </li>
            <li> Good, does what it says.</li>
            <li> I loved that stuff.</li>
            <li> I loved the Reach version, just wish this one had fluoride in it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for your teeth.</li>
            <li> My dentist seems to think I&#x27;m doing a good job flossing too, and this is the floss I use.</li>
            <li> but it does a fairly good job of flossing.</li>
            <li> Good woven floss, which was ruined by adding cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Good floss for those with bridgework or tender gums...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why a manufacturer replaces a perfectly good product with something inferior, but that appears to be what has been done here.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m just happy to be able to buy and use them.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this on Amazon!</li>
            <li> My favorite floss!</li>
            <li> I am so glad to find it!</li>
            <li> Have a nice taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they are great and my mouth and gums love the minty fresh tingling!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best floss on the market for getting into the nooks and crannies that I have in abundance!  </li>
            <li> Good minty clean taste.</li>
            <li> Look at the fine print!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
            <li> This is my husbands favorite dental floss.  </li>
            <li> I started using this floss, and now I love it also.</li>
            <li> Love this floss.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this floss anywhere so was glad to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li> Nicer feel than the waxy ribbon of most flosses.</li>
            <li> Love this floss.</li>
            <li> Removes more of the stuff between teeth than waxed or tape floss.</li>
            <li> She suggested I use the woven floss because it grabs more of the plaque.</li>
            <li> Love the woven floss which I use to get in Reach.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite floss</li>
            <li> Tastes great and really removes the crud from between you teeth.  </li>
            <li> It has been my favorite floss</li>
            <li> The flavor and texture of the floss will encourage you to floss more:-)</li>
            <li> Much better than waxed floss</li>
            <li> (okay, I didn&#x27;t literally run to it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this floss.</li>
            <li> Love the way my mouth feels after use.</li>
            <li> I gave my kids each one and they love it too.</li>
            <li> This floss works just okay.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the many dissatisfied reviews with the rebranding.  </li>
            <li> Because it has this greater area it cleans out more plaque.</li>
            <li> It works great and gets in between my very closely spaced teeth.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more cinnamon-sweet than burning unlike what some people here are describing.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the ones with floride, but can&#x27;t find them any more.</li>
            <li> so they work and are better than non-woven floss</li>
            <li> Flavor is just OK, I would prefer unflavored.</li>
            <li> when I found them, I got a six pack! :)</li>
            <li> the woven string makes it very easy and comfortable to floss with and doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums.</li>
            <li> Gentle on our gums, pleasant flavor and stays intact to do the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft on the gums and GREAT for cleaning between teeth.(good taste, too).  </li>
            <li> Great for sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> It seems to catch more while still being comfortable on the gums.</li>
            <li> comfortable and better cleaning vs</li>
            <li> I used the soft, flexible ribbon type they offer and it was great.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a woven floss that also has a pleasant taste, pass on this particular version.  </li>
            <li> I prefer cinnamon flavor over other flavors, so this product is perfect, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love how well this floss works, and how clean my mouth feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a woven floss that cleans below the gum line easily and without pain or struggle, you&#x27;ve found it.  </li>
            <li> Makes flossing easy and almost a pleasure.</li>
            <li> I read some comments that the cinnamon flavor is too strong, but I don&#x27;t have any problem with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not the nice minty taste we&#x27;ve known and loved.</li>
            <li> I loved the older version of this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t agree with the comments that are saying the cinnamon taste is so strong as to burn lips.</li>
            <li> The flavor is not that sweet and lovely minty thing.  </li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> Does a fine job removing any particle there may be.</li>
            <li> Then I just about panicked when they said it wasn&#x27;t available anymore.</li>
            <li> Just enough texture to the woven floss to give your teeth a great cleaning.</li>
            <li> It works and is comfortable.</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> Listerine is a fabulous mouth wash</li>
            <li> A good alternative if you have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I loved the old version and have used it for years.  </li>
            <li> My dentist has advised me to use the Gentle Gum Care floss for many, many years.  </li>
            <li> I loved when they were made by the other brand because I liked the flavor.  </li>
            <li> The cloth helps grab food products really well, so there is a nice feeling of well-done job and clean mouth.</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> This product is flavored with mint/cinnamon not fluoride like the original.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the original product that contained fluoride.</li>
            <li> This floss is soft, gentle, yet very effective.</li>
            <li> Best floss I have used, dentist could hardly find anything to scrape after 6 months.</li>
            <li> Not the other gentle gum care with fluoride, but 1000% better than the plastic flosses out there!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is gently woven, so it is able to slide in and out without pulling on my teeth.</li>
            <li> It is definitely my favorite floss (never thought I&#x27;d say I have a favorite floss), but paying $10 each was just a bit much (or a lot too much).</li>
            <li> When Johnson &amp; Johnson changed their labeling from &amp;#34;Reach Gentle Gum Care&amp;#34; to the Listerine labeling, it threw many people off.  </li>
            <li> As with most people reviewing here, I was looking for the Reach gentle care woven floss that I&#x27;d gotten so used to</li>
            <li> Works the same, good alternative to REACH.</li>
            <li> The very friendly customer service rep said they did a rebranding, and now it&#x27;s called J&amp;J Listerine Gentle Gum Care.</li>
            <li> Putting the Listerine name on it is fine, but bring back the original flavor and more importantly, the flouride.</li>
            <li> so I go through it twice as quickly as I used to.</li>
            <li> So, for a quick 3&amp;#34; piece to get a stubborn piece of your dinner out, it will require some twirling or holding taut to keep the strands from falling apart.  </li>
            <li> Lucky me,  I ordered a six pack.</li>
            <li> I enjoy these and first tried samples at my dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> Luckily the new re branded version is the same great quality product.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the gums, but a bit too strongly flavored</li>
            <li> The old product was superb, why mess with perfection.</li>
            <li> Six nice large packages of soft woven floss.</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the Listerine flavor</li>
            <li> Replaces the former REACH Woven Dental floss nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the cinnamint flavor..</li>
            <li> Anyway, buy it, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> so you need to use more than regular floss (you need to use a clean section of floss at each tooth or it will shred and get stuck between your teeth).</li>
            <li> It just means it&#x27;s not the right tool for every job.</li>
            <li> You gotta floss, do it right.  </li>
            <li> Looks think but slides right between my teeth without injuring my gums.</li>
            <li> I like the woven floss so much better than the thin kind!</li>
            <li> The woven floss has a higher surface area than most other flosses, so works better.</li>
            <li> Still, I think it is a small price to pay for the great health benefits.</li>
            <li> I would like to see the flouride added back, but the flavor is good, and the woven style removes the plaque so much better than any other floss I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Great to have this product back in a slightly different incarnation.  </li>
            <li> My favorite part of this floss is its &amp;#34;taste.&amp;#34; Not overwhelmingly strong, but very fresh and clean.   </li>
            <li> very gentle on gums.  </li>
            <li> It is great if your gums are sensitive to other floss that can slice your gums.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super gentle on the gums, and I feel like the thicker rope-like material helps grab particles and clean between teeth better than other floss.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, and is hard to find in neighborhood drug stores.</li>
            <li> And the individual threads catch more of what they need to, because they create a ridged surface area.</li>
            <li> If your are allergic be aware.</li>
            <li> I first got on</li>
            <li> I suspect Johnson and Johnson did this because Reach was not as recognizable a brand name as Listerine.</li>
            <li> I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of floss.)</li>
            <li> It does a much better job of removing plaque than the regular waxed or unwaxed floss.</li>
            <li> I was pretty upset when Johnson and Johnson discontinued their woven floss with fluoride...</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This is the first woven floss I&#x27;ve ever tried and now I&#x27;m a believer.  </li>
            <li> the woven floss bandwagon years ago after finding it seemed to do a better job of cleaning than the flat, tape-style floss.</li>
            <li> It has a pretty strong mint flavor, so get it only if you like that.</li>
            <li> I assume this costs a bit more than other floss, and the comfort is well worth it for us.</li>
            <li> There was some confusion over J&amp;J changing the name from Reach, but other than that this is good floss for people with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> It will get plaque, but doesn&#x27;t feel as effective as regular floss with more of a texture to the floss (which is to be expected since that is what irritates sensitive gums).</li>
            <li> You need something mildly abrasive, and this soft, woven floss serves the purpose.  </li>
            <li> Although the floss looks similar, it has a strong minty taste and leaves my gums and lips tingling/burning after flossing.  </li>
            <li> but honestly I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a transition from the previous version.</li>
            <li> So I need to be really vigilant or my gums are going to swell.</li>
            <li> It seems to be the replacement for Gentle Care floss.</li>
            <li> This Listerine floss is the rebranded Reach Gentle Gum Care</li>
            <li> The flavor is not even as intense as some chewing gums out there.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also got a bit stronger taste, but not by much.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Wish I could use it because it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> This floss is so gentle.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the notes that this used to be under the JnJ Reach umbrella, as I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li> It is so much easier to use than waxed floss.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mint flavor is subtle but pleasant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a bit of a bite from the cinnamon, but the price is right and it works just as well as the old stuff.</li>
            <li> I just want a strong piece of woven floss to hold together long enough to clean between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been using the original Reach Gum Care for several years now since I discovered it in dental school.</li>
            <li> I admit it does have a different taste as the original, but after a couple of weeks I became quite fond of it.</li>
            <li> new version is a lot more economical (15 vs 26 for a pack of 6 - 50yds) for what is essentially the same product.</li>
            <li> I have to floss multiple times to feel clean, which I did not have to do with the Reach</li>
            <li> This is the new version and like it so much.  </li>
            <li> Sure there is a slight aftertaste</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Listerine Gentle Gum Care&amp;#34; is nowhere near what the &amp;#34;REACH&amp;#34; Gentle Gum Care floss was.  </li>
            <li> and now they make this particular gloss.  </li>
            <li> For tight teeth, Glide products are better.</li>
            <li> I started using this floss because my dentist highly recommended it.  </li>
            <li> The Reach product was far superior, stretchier, woven in a slicker, less likely to shred way.</li>
            <li> Instead, I will very carefully use a woven floss in the right areas, instead of this one, making sure to keep the tape flat.</li>
            <li> I miss the older variety before they changed the name and the formula to make it new and catchy..</li>
            <li> After using this for a month straight my gums stopped bleeding completely.</li>
            <li> For those of us with teeth that are very close together, the old Gum Care was the solution for getting fluoride between those teeth where a brush cannot reach.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like plastic floss and was pleasantly surprised how well this fabric floss works.</li>
            <li> This is the only floss I like to use because the floss string is a little thicker than other brands giving you a nice close floss easily.</li>
            <li> This new Listerine product is going in the trash.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle on the gum, won&#x27;t go back relaxed floss ever.</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive gums, this is the floss for you.</li>
            <li> Perhaps they have very sensitive tastes...</li>
            <li> , it seems to fray more easily, not sure why.</li>
            <li> A very similar product to be sold as Cleanpaste by Reach at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> But the floss appears to be exactly the same.</li>
            <li> have somewhat sensitive gums that can bleed when flossing with normal floss.</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m pretty uptight about teeth care, I used Glide for back teeth and this listerine for all others.</li>
            <li> Since it isn&#x27;t slick, but woven it has a greater surface area.  </li>
            <li> exactly as advertised and thank heaven--thick enough.</li>
            <li> again, woven floss has saved my gums and my thanks to Listerine for picking up the Reach brand--it&#x27;s not quite the same but does have multiple soft threads woven together to provide a MUCH better cleaning than the other</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly after using this stuff for 6 months, I have a hard time using anything else because this one cleans between my teeth better than anything.</li>
            <li> The only difference I can tell is that this new one doesn&#x27;t have fluoride listed as an ingredient (which I don&#x27;t think matters for this particular product...</li>
            <li> The reason for my poor review is that I was hoping for the older version which was hundred times better than this new version.</li>
            <li> As another poster (faral) pointed out, this is simply the Reach Gentle Gum Care floss re-branded.</li>
            <li> For sensitive gums, that hurts.</li>
            <li> The old product gets 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The only difference really is the flavoring - cinnamon by default on the woven version.</li>
            <li> The first is it folds over, which creates the same problem as regular floss.</li>
            <li> The price was much better than in the stores (and it is hard for me to find locally in stores)</li>
            <li> For me, that means less pain - well worth the couple bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the twisted floss because it helps to remove more debris from between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I had early perio issues and regular and proper use with this woven floss has resolved this issue completely!</li>
            <li> I will miss the old variety, but there are not a lot of options for woven floss, so likely I will continue to use it until it irritates my gums with the cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Please bring back the old version.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems like it&#x27;s still pretty pricey on Amazon for now ($43 for 6 at the time of this review), but I&#x27;m hoping that price will go down once it hits the Amazon retailer&#x27;s shelves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hot mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a twisted thread with very strong mint flavor.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this &amp;#34;Listerine&amp;#34; product for the first time; other reviewers stated it is identical to the J&amp;J Reach Gentle Gum Care I have been using for a few years.  </li>
            <li> 6 month supply of the best ever dental floss for those who hate to floss, for less than 20 bucks.</li>
            <li> I ordered many, since I have sometimes in the past found it hard to find.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the product it replaces; a disappointment!</li>
            <li> The first few of these were equal to the floss sold under the Johnson &amp; Johnson &amp;#34;REACH&amp;#34; brand, but the last few purchases have been floss that was shredded when I took it off the spool.  </li>
            <li> and it had become harder and more expensive to find it</li>
            <li> my new favorite floss, though it can be a little difficult with tight teeth</li>
            <li> It is not often that I get passionate about floss.  </li>
            <li> This absolutely NOT the same as the Reach woven dental floss it purportedly replaces.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are pretty tight, so I tend to have a hard time flossing between all of them with regular floss.</li>
            <li> --Reach fixed them in a few weeks--I was able to completely dump the gum doctors who just wanted to slice open my gums and redo them--a very painful operation I actually had done ONCE!  </li>
            <li> The second is that it doesn&#x27;t remove the buildup as well as other</li>
            <li> I am an everyday flosser and this floss is the most uncomfortable floss I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a couple of loosely entwined pieces of flimsy floss.</li>
            <li> ran down to my local drug store</li>
            <li> - there is no substitute in my opinion, the tape floss just does not clean as well - and if you are the same way, then give this a try.</li>
            <li> but it is hard to find or out of stock frequently when I do find someone that has it.  </li>
            <li> I like using woven floss and it is getting harder and harder to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> If you were using the previous (now discontinued) mint version of this floss, except for the flavor, this seems the same to me as the previous branding.</li>
            <li> You will need other floss to get this stringy, fuzzy rope out of your teeth</li>
            <li> I have no problems with it burning my mouth as a couple of other reviewers said.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I can&#x27;t see any differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was prepared for a strong taste and lingering burn reading all the reviews, but it wasn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> It can shred a little bit like yarn</li>
            <li> As a floss, its &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; attributes -- being two twisted strands, one a cotton-type thread and the other a thin floss -- it really does lessen pain/bleeding for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> These are so hard to find in the local stores.</li>
            <li> I have never used floss that offered such a negative experience...until now.  </li>
            <li> He agrees that the type I purchased is not worth using, and called it the anti-floss...  Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well for really tight areas but due to its texture, it cleans well.  </li>
            <li> Less spendy than some alternatives.</li>
            <li> Noticeable but slight cinnamon taste.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly stronger mint flavor than the Reach brand did, and I do not notice the cinnamon flavor at all.</li>
            <li> The floss works as well as the previous Reach product</li>
            <li> The previous floss I was using was discontinued and this floss is just like it.  </li>
            <li> Since &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; woven floss went out of business last year, I have not been able to get woven floss and my gums were deteriorating badly (I had spent years with Glide and other single filament floss products and my gums were really bad</li>
            <li> I am desperately searching for some other brand of woven/ropey floss because I really need it, but I will not use this.  </li>
            <li> It unravels and it a mess.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have tight teeth, than this would be my one-product recommendation.</li>
            <li> This stuff is tightly woven and gets your teeth much cleaner, with less gum cutting and bleeding, and less floss tearing.  </li>
            <li> This floss feels thinner, is not as stretchy, does not clean as well, and shreds.  </li>
            <li> but this woven floss is identical (minus the fluoride) and appears to do just as well on my teeth!!!</li>
            <li> Not as heavy weight as I would like,</li>
            <li> However, the cinnamon flavor is harsh.</li>
            <li> I am not, but I am not a huge fan of it.</li>
            <li> According to two highly professional dentists, those slick, waxed flosses are almost useless.</li>
            <li> Mint flavor seems to be a little stronger, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> had been fretting for a while because of the crazy high prices (and in-availability) of the J&amp;J Reach Gum Care Woven Floss.</li>
            <li> And if I use a floss that&#x27;s abrasive, flossing gets pretty throbbingly painful.</li>
            <li> It is not too slick, like some brands.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible idea, as many people are allergic to cinnamon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they keep rebranding and changing the woven floss.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it actually scrapes crud off the sides of my teeth instead of merely pulling out food that got stuck in there.</li>
            <li> Taste not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Reach suggests this product as a replacement for their now discontinued Reach Gentle Gum Care (being sold for outrageous prices by 3rd party suppliers on Amazon &amp; Ebay).  </li>
            <li> hard to find woven floss, which is all my hygienist recommends</li>
            <li> Thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that this is just a &amp;#34;bad batch&amp;#34;, because who would actually approve a product that tastes this bad?  </li>
            <li> They are tough to find so</li>
            <li> but I am addicted to the woven floss</li>
            <li> I believe this happened because the string on this floss is thicker and my gums got used to it, where as the thin string floss tends to cut into my gums no matter what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was heart broken to find that is was discontinued.</li>
            <li> And it contains cinnamon, which had me confused, because it still says mint flavored, but also says contains cinnamon.</li>
            <li> For those teeth, I find this product to be inadequate because the cloth can have trouble getting between teeth and can shred if I force it -- which is annoying.</li>
            <li> , you have a bunch of very thin strands that compress when you thread them between your gums.</li>
            <li> The flavor of this is awful and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The woven floss will shred when cutting it.  </li>
            <li> I really hate the floss that some companies have started making thin plastic strips.</li>
            <li> Oh and I don&#x27;t think the taste of the Listerine is that bad</li>
            <li> This item is bad.</li>
            <li> flossing just became something unpleasant that I have to do every day : (</li>
            <li> Did not realize this floss had a cinnamon taste, as I hate cinnamon.</li>
            <li> have been a real disappointment.  </li>
            <li> The shredding is the worst part.  </li>
            <li> It tastes horrible.  </li>
            <li> Just awful.  </li>

            <li> Same as the now unavailable version that used fluoride instead of Listerine. I had early perio issues and regular and proper use with this woven floss has resolved this issue completely! I would have given it five stars except that compared to the fluoride-treated predecessor, it seems to fray more easily, not sure why. To avoid this issue I end up using separate lengths for the upper and lower teeth so I go through it twice as quickly as I used to. Still, I think it is a small price to pay for the great health benefits. Oh and I don&#x27;t think the taste of the Listerine is that bad and it does not taste like the amber-colored liquid Listerine. Still, this sort of thing is always a matter of individual taste but I did not think the taste was an issue.</li>
            <li> Good, does what it says. Thick.</li>
            <li> I have gingivitis. So I need to be really vigilant or my gums are going to swell. And if I use a floss that&#x27;s abrasive, flossing gets pretty throbbingly painful. I&#x27;ve tried about a dozen different flosses and this is the one I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I used this product when it was called Reach Gum Care. Then I just about panicked when they said it wasn&#x27;t available anymore. This product is a rebrand of the Reach product, without the claim they add fluoride&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a regular waxed floss, it would hurt because you&#x27;re cramming a 1mm hardened string between gums prone to swelling. It&#x27;s like punching a bruise. Taped floss helps, but it has two issues for me. The first is it folds over, which creates the same problem as regular floss. The second is that it doesn&#x27;t remove the buildup as well as other floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With woven floss, you have a bunch of very thin strands that compress when you thread them between your gums. And the individual threads catch more of what they need to, because they create a ridged surface area. For me, that means less pain - well worth the couple bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One weakness, if you&#x27;ve eaten a steak, it has a tougher time cleaning and creates a lot of pressure when you try. Instead, I will very carefully use a woven floss in the right areas, instead of this one, making sure to keep the tape flat. This doesn&#x27;t detract from a 5-star review. It just means it&#x27;s not the right tool for every job.</li>
            <li> I bought one pack at my local grocery store to try it before buying the multipack. Wow, I&#x27;m glad I did. The flavor of this is awful and lasts a long time. It seems like they are trying to imitate the harshness of listerine. Yuck. I won&#x27;t be buying more. I wish they would go back to the Reach mint. I loved that stuff.</li>
            <li> Item contains cinnamon but is not stated in description. If your are allergic be aware.</li>
            <li> This is the best floss recommended by my dental hygienist. It is not too slick, like some brands. Just enough texture to the woven floss to give your teeth a great cleaning. The best in my book. I ordered many, since I have sometimes in the past found it hard to find.</li>
            <li> The additional cinnamon make this taste like Listerine.  YUCK!  flossing just became something unpleasant that I have to do every day : (</li>
            <li> I loved the Reach version, just wish this one had fluoride in it.</li>
            <li> Does a great job. A very similar product to be sold as Cleanpaste by Reach at a much higher price. I read a helpful review on Amazon that put me onto this floss.</li>
            <li> Great to have this product back in a slightly different incarnation.  The flavor is not that sweet and lovely minty thing.  It&#x27;s got a bit of a bite from the cinnamon, but the price is right and it works just as well as the old stuff.</li>
            <li> hard to find woven floss, which is all my hygienist recommends</li>
            <li> This is my husbands favorite dental floss.  Could not find it anymore in stores. I started using this floss, and now I love it also.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive gums.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> As another poster (faral) pointed out, this is simply the Reach Gentle Gum Care floss re-branded. I first got on the woven floss bandwagon years ago after finding it seemed to do a better job of cleaning than the flat, tape-style floss. After my dentist recommended it, that sold me forever on woven floss. I suspect Johnson and Johnson did this because Reach was not as recognizable a brand name as Listerine. But the floss appears to be exactly the same. I&#x27;ve noticed some posters complain about the flavor, but I&#x27;m not buying this stuff because I want it to whet my appetite. I just want a strong piece of woven floss to hold together long enough to clean between my teeth. I got the mint flavor, and the only difference I can detect is the Reach mint seems a bit milder.</li>
            <li> This floss is soft, gentle, yet very effective. It seems to be the replacement for Gentle Care floss.</li>
            <li> A good alternative if you have sensitive gums. Less spendy than some alternatives.</li>
            <li> Perfect alternative to REACH woven mint floss</li>
            <li> I loved when they were made by the other brand because I liked the flavor.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the Listerine flavor but I am addicted to the woven floss so I&#x27;m just happy to be able to buy and use them.</li>
            <li> These are so hard to find in the local stores. I really like the twisted floss because it helps to remove more debris from between my teeth.</li>
            <li> This does have cinnamon in it. I bought the one that said it didn&#x27;t. This is a terrible idea, as many people are allergic to cinnamon. I am not, but I am not a huge fan of it. I miss the older variety before they changed the name and the formula to make it new and catchy.. I will miss the old variety, but there are not a lot of options for woven floss, so likely I will continue to use it until it irritates my gums with the cinnamon.</li>
            <li> This is the only floss I like to use because the floss string is a little thicker than other brands giving you a nice close floss easily. It&#x27;s mint flavor is subtle but pleasant. This Listerine floss is the rebranded Reach Gentle Gum Care floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have somewhat sensitive gums that can bleed when flossing with normal floss. After using this for a month straight my gums stopped bleeding completely. I believe this happened because the string on this floss is thicker and my gums got used to it, where as the thin string floss tends to cut into my gums no matter what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly after using this stuff for 6 months, I have a hard time using anything else because this one cleans between my teeth better than anything.</li>
            <li> Since &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; woven floss went out of business last year, I have not been able to get woven floss and my gums were deteriorating badly (I had spent years with Glide and other single filament floss products and my gums were really bad--Reach fixed them in a few weeks--I was able to completely dump the gum doctors who just wanted to slice open my gums and redo them--a very painful operation I actually had done ONCE!  never again!).  I am still unable to find this in the drug stores but was able to get it here at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, woven floss has saved my gums and my thanks to Listerine for picking up the Reach brand--it&#x27;s not quite the same but does have multiple soft threads woven together to provide a MUCH better cleaning than the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Gibson&lt;br /&gt;DeLand Florida</li>
            <li> It was cinammon flavored, not mint.</li>
            <li> I like the woven floss so much better than the thin kind! So glad I found this on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Replaces the former REACH Woven Dental floss nicely.</li>
            <li> the dental floss is wonderful to use.  the woven string makes it very easy and comfortable to floss with and doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums.</li>
            <li> supposed to be the replacement for Reach woven</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s just dental floss, but it&#x27;s not all the same.  This stuff is tightly woven and gets your teeth much cleaner, with less gum cutting and bleeding, and less floss tearing.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the cinnamint flavor..why not just &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34;?...but this isn&#x27;t a big deal.  You gotta floss, do it right.  This stuff is great, and is hard to find in neighborhood drug stores.</li>
            <li> NOT as advertised!  Yes, the package says MINT, like the listing showed.  But the listing does NOT show &amp;#34;contains cinnamon&amp;#34;,&lt;br /&gt;as the package shows.  If I had known that, I would not have ordered this product.</li>
            <li> Love this floss. It seems to catch more while still being comfortable on the gums.</li>
            <li> The best floss, in my opinion.  Can no longer find in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they keep rebranding and changing the woven floss.  Yes, it is now cinnamon but honestly I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a transition from the previous version.</li>
            <li> It does the job of any floss out there. The reason for my poor review is that I was hoping for the older version which was hundred times better than this new version. The cinnamon taste (although I am a big fan of cinnamon) is quite off putting and the multiple threads that compose the floss disintegrates amid the flossing process. It&#x27;s a hot mess.</li>
            <li> I would like to see the flouride added back, but the flavor is good, and the woven style removes the plaque so much better than any other floss I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this floss anywhere so was glad to find it on amazon. It is great if your gums are sensitive to other floss that can slice your gums. It can shred a little bit like yarn so you need to use more than regular floss (you need to use a clean section of floss at each tooth or it will shred and get stuck between your teeth).</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff.  Nicer feel than the waxy ribbon of most flosses.</li>
            <li> It is not often that I get passionate about floss.  I have a weakness and it is called woven floss.  I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the gum, won&#x27;t go back relaxed floss ever.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the gums, but a bit too strongly flavored</li>
            <li> Best floss I have used, dentist could hardly find anything to scrape after 6 months.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. (I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of floss.) It has a pretty strong mint flavor, so get it only if you like that. (I do.) The cloth helps grab food products really well, so there is a nice feeling of well-done job and clean mouth. My dental hygenist uses this product. She seems to know what she is doing. I do have crowded teeth, particularly in back (molars, etc). For those teeth, I find this product to be inadequate because the cloth can have trouble getting between teeth and can shred if I force it -- which is annoying. For tight teeth, Glide products are better. But I don&#x27;t think they remove food quite as well. Its a trade off. Because I&#x27;m pretty uptight about teeth care, I used Glide for back teeth and this listerine for all others. If you don&#x27;t have tight teeth, than this would be my one-product recommendation.</li>
            <li> You will need other floss to get this stringy, fuzzy rope out of your teeth</li>
            <li> Love this floss. It&#x27;s super gentle on the gums, and I feel like the thicker rope-like material helps grab particles and clean between teeth better than other floss. I read some comments that the cinnamon flavor is too strong, but I don&#x27;t have any problem with it. The flavor is not even as intense as some chewing gums out there. I prefer cinnamon flavor over other flavors, so this product is perfect, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> 6 month supply of the best ever dental floss for those who hate to floss, for less than 20 bucks. Shipped on time. Worth it!</li>
            <li> I like using woven floss and it is getting harder and harder to find in the stores.  This is a good product for your teeth.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hygienist. The woven floss has a higher surface area than most other flosses, so works better. Noticeable but slight cinnamon taste.</li>
            <li> This floss is the shiznit. I feel like it actually scrapes crud off the sides of my teeth instead of merely pulling out food that got stuck in there. My dentist seems to think I&#x27;m doing a good job flossing too, and this is the floss I use. There used to be some with fluoride, and I wish I could still find that stuff, but this is the same except without flouride. Anyway, buy it, it&#x27;s worth every penny. Not to mention, it&#x27;s super-cheap compared to paying for a filling (or two).</li>
            <li> My favorite floss! Removes more of the stuff between teeth than waxed or tape floss.</li>
            <li> Not the other gentle gum care with fluoride, but 1000% better than the plastic flosses out there!!!</li>
            <li> This Listerine floss is different from the one I bought at Target, which worked well. I didn&#x27;t like this &amp;#34;woven floss&amp;#34; bec. pieces got stuck in between the teeth ! thought this was similar to the one I already have. And I cannot return it bec, I&#x27;ve opened it already and use one piece !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this floss for about 6 months since my last dental check up. Six months ago, my dentist said that I had a lot of plaque and my gums were inflamed. I had been flossing regularly to no avail. She suggested I use the woven floss because it grabs more of the plaque. After my last check up she said my gums were healthier than last time! I am happy.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy weight as I would like, but it does a fairly good job of flossing.</li>
            <li> The only floss you will ever need.</li>
            <li> There was some confusion over J&amp;J changing the name from Reach, but other than that this is good floss for people with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Love the woven floss which I use to get in Reach.  This is the new version and like it so much.  Have tender gums and this is perfect.  Great service.</li>
            <li> comfortable and better cleaning vs glide type - recommended to me by dental hygienist, been using ever since with noticeable improvement</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended.  I love it.</li>
            <li> See above. Good woven floss, which was ruined by adding cinnamon. Look at the fine print! For sensitive gums, that hurts.</li>
            <li> How do you review dental floss? It works and is comfortable. What else can you say?</li>
            <li> This is wonderful floss.  It is just like the woven mint floss J&amp;J has produced.  I&#x27;m not buying anything different from now on.  This is my favorite.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite floss but it is hard to find or out of stock frequently when I do find someone that has it.  the price was great, the floss for me is the best at removing stuff between teeth and does not slip thru my fingers.  it arrived when they said it would.</li>
            <li> Delicious, minty floss. Once you get used to this style not being waxed they are great and my mouth and gums love the minty fresh tingling!</li>
            <li> This absolutely NOT the same as the Reach woven dental floss it purportedly replaces.  The Reach product was far superior, stretchier, woven in a slicker, less likely to shred way.</li>
            <li> Best floss on the market.  Tastes great and really removes the crud from between you teeth.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Wonderful floss! My teeth are pretty tight, so I tend to have a hard time flossing between all of them with regular floss. This stuff is gently woven, so it is able to slide in and out without pulling on my teeth. The taste is somewhat minty, but not overpowering. I really like it.</li>
            <li> Good minty clean taste.</li>
            <li> Anyone with gum problems should use this.</li>
            <li> i will never use another floss!</li>
            <li> I have been using the original Reach Gum Care for several years now since I discovered it in dental school. It has been my favorite floss and I was heart broken to find that is was discontinued. Luckily the new re branded version is the same great quality product. I admit it does have a different taste as the original, but after a couple of weeks I became quite fond of it. Also the price cut from around $4.50 to $3.00 is a great plus. It is still the best floss out there.</li>
            <li> Is very strong floss and has a great flavor, the best floss I&#x27;ve ever tried. The flavor and texture of the floss will encourage you to floss more:-)</li>
            <li> Not as good as the product it replaces; a disappointment!</li>
            <li> Much better than waxed floss</li>
            <li> Reach suggests this product as a replacement for their now discontinued Reach Gentle Gum Care (being sold for outrageous prices by 3rd party suppliers on Amazon &amp; Ebay).  I loved the old version and have used it for years.  This new Listerine product is going in the trash.  Although the floss looks similar, it has a strong minty taste and leaves my gums and lips tingling/burning after flossing.  I am an everyday flosser and this floss is the most uncomfortable floss I have ever tried.  Please bring back the old version.</li>
            <li> Good floss for those with bridgework or tender gums... given as a sample by our dentist for that reason.</li>
            <li> Did not realize this floss had a cinnamon taste, as I hate cinnamon. Amazon did not list anywhere that it was cinnamon when i purhcased this item.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this &amp;#34;Listerine&amp;#34; product for the first time; other reviewers stated it is identical to the J&amp;J Reach Gentle Gum Care I have been using for a few years.  In fact, &amp;#34;Gentle Gum Care&amp;#34; floss is probably the best floss you can buy in the US.  The top-of-the-line floss, 3M&#x27;s &amp;#34;Floss RX,&amp;#34; cost over $10 a month and was discontinued.  The flossing concept is simple: you want to remove tiny bacterial colonies just forming between your teeth.  You need something mildly abrasive, and this soft, woven floss serves the purpose.  According to two highly professional dentists, those slick, waxed flosses are almost useless.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It does a much better job of removing plaque than the regular waxed or unwaxed floss. It has a slightly stronger mint flavor than the Reach brand did, and I do not notice the cinnamon flavor at all. I have no problems with it burning my mouth as a couple of other reviewers said.</li>
            <li> This is the same thing as J&amp;J Reach Gum Care Woven floss, but recently rebranded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been fretting for a while because of the crazy high prices (and in-availability) of the J&amp;J Reach Gum Care Woven Floss. It is definitely my favorite floss (never thought I&#x27;d say I have a favorite floss), but paying $10 each was just a bit much (or a lot too much). So today I called J&amp;J customer service to ask if the woven floss has been discontinued. The very friendly customer service rep said they did a rebranding, and now it&#x27;s called J&amp;J Listerine Gentle Gum Care. They just started shipping the rebranded stuff on 9/1/2014, so word hadn&#x27;t spread yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran down to my local drug store (okay, I didn&#x27;t literally run to it. I went to class...and then swung by on my way home) and picked some up. It looks and feels the same. The only difference I can tell is that this new one doesn&#x27;t have fluoride listed as an ingredient (which I don&#x27;t think matters for this particular product...get your fluoride from toothepaste). And it contains cinnamon, which had me confused, because it still says mint flavored, but also says contains cinnamon. It smells like listerine, even though the packaging says no mouth wash. It&#x27;s also got a bit stronger taste, but not by much. Other than that, I can&#x27;t see any differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like it&#x27;s still pretty pricey on Amazon for now ($43 for 6 at the time of this review), but I&#x27;m hoping that price will go down once it hits the Amazon retailer&#x27;s shelves. Oh, and it&#x27;s on sale this week (week of 9/1/2014) at a drug store ($3 each). Starts with a C, ends with an S, and has 3 letters.</li>
            <li> best floss out there at any price</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this floss. It&#x27;s a twisted thread with very strong mint flavor. Love the way my mouth feels after use. I really hate the floss that some companies have started making thin plastic strips. I gave my kids each one and they love it too. Definitely will continue buying this.</li>
            <li> This floss works just okay.  It&#x27;s not the same as when it was sold with the Reach name.  This floss feels thinner, is not as stretchy, does not clean as well, and shreds.  The shredding is the worst part.  I have to floss multiple times to feel clean, which I did not have to do with the Reach version.&lt;br /&gt; It is gentle.&lt;br /&gt;The price was competitive.&lt;br /&gt;I would not order again.</li>
            <li> I started using this floss because my dentist highly recommended it.  I really like it.  If you were using the previous (now discontinued) mint version of this floss, except for the flavor, this seems the same to me as the previous branding.</li>
            <li> my new favorite floss, though it can be a little difficult with tight teeth</li>
            <li> Love how well this floss works, and how clean my mouth feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> My favorite part of this floss is its &amp;#34;taste.&amp;#34; Not overwhelmingly strong, but very fresh and clean.   As a floss, its &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; attributes -- being two twisted strands, one a cotton-type thread and the other a thin floss -- it really does lessen pain/bleeding for sensitive gums. I found that I had to keep twirling it to keep the twist...twisted. So, for a quick 3&amp;#34; piece to get a stubborn piece of your dinner out, it will require some twirling or holding taut to keep the strands from falling apart.  If you have very sensitive gums, this is the floss for you. If not, I find that it isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grabby&amp;#34; enough with plaque. It will get plaque, but doesn&#x27;t feel as effective as regular floss with more of a texture to the floss (which is to be expected since that is what irritates sensitive gums).</li>
            <li> I agree with the many dissatisfied reviews with the rebranding.  The old product was superb, why mess with perfection. Putting the Listerine name on it is fine, but bring back the original flavor and more importantly, the flouride. For those of us with teeth that are very close together, the old Gum Care was the solution for getting fluoride between those teeth where a brush cannot reach.  The old product gets 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The floss works as well as the previous Reach product and I&#x27;m happy to have it. However, the cinnamon flavor is harsh. It&#x27;s definitely not the nice minty taste we&#x27;ve known and loved.</li>
            <li> I would give this zero stars.  I loved the older version of this product and I have already contacted the manufacturer to ask that they bring it back.  This tastes like Listerine, which I have always detested.  It also hurts my mouth, my lips, even parts of my face because I am a thorough flosser.  I am desperately searching for some other brand of woven/ropey floss because I really need it, but I will not use this.  I can&#x27;t have stinging/burning pain every day from flossing.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like plastic floss and was pleasantly surprised how well this fabric floss works.</li>
            <li> Can not use this floss. It gets stuck between my teeth. Wish I could use it because it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this brand and Reach.  Works fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dental hygienist and I have been using this floss for years.  It doesn&#x27;t work well for really tight areas but due to its texture, it cleans well.  When Johnson &amp; Johnson changed their labeling from &amp;#34;Reach Gentle Gum Care&amp;#34; to the Listerine labeling, it threw many people off.  They thought that it had been discontinued.  I wish they would show a piece of the actual floss so you could see it through the packaging.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to us by our dental hygienist. Have a nice taste.&lt;br /&gt;Would have to get used to the &amp;#34;woven&amp;#34; vs &amp;#34;waxed&amp;#34;. Feel this floss does a great job and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> This product is flavored with mint/cinnamon not fluoride like the original.  If you want to contact Johnson &amp; Johnson go to this web page to make yourself heard at the corporate level:&lt;br /&gt;https://www.ccc-consumercarecenter.com/universal-contact-us/us-jnj-ucu/www.jnj.com</li>
            <li> Great dental floss for teeth with the wider spaces</li>
            <li> The woven floss will shred when cutting it.  It unravels and it a mess.  Don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best floss ever</li>
            <li> Since it isn&#x27;t slick, but woven it has a greater surface area.  Because it has this greater area it cleans out more plaque.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a woven floss that cleans below the gum line easily and without pain or struggle, you&#x27;ve found it.  If you&#x27;re looking for a woven floss that also has a pleasant taste, pass on this particular version.  It tastes horrible.  Just awful.  I have never used floss that offered such a negative experience...until now.  I&#x27;m hoping that this is just a &amp;#34;bad batch&amp;#34;, because who would actually approve a product that tastes this bad?  My husband bought the mint version without the added cinnamon, and it tastes great, refreshing even!  He agrees that the type I purchased is not worth using, and called it the anti-floss...  Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> This floss is so gentle. Makes flossing easy and almost a pleasure. Looks think but slides right between my teeth without injuring my gums. Does a fine job removing any particle there may be.</li>
            <li> I wish it was thicker</li>
            <li> My peridontist recommends this dental floss. It works great and gets in between my very closely spaced teeth. The price was much better than in the stores (and it is hard for me to find locally in stores)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t agree with the comments that are saying the cinnamon taste is so strong as to burn lips. As with most people reviewing here, I was looking for the Reach gentle care woven floss that I&#x27;d gotten so used to and it had become harder and more expensive to find it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new version is a lot more economical (15 vs 26 for a pack of 6 - 50yds) for what is essentially the same product. The only difference really is the flavoring - cinnamon by default on the woven version. I was prepared for a strong taste and lingering burn reading all the reviews, but it wasn&#x27;t bad at all. Sure there is a slight aftertaste but it&#x27;s more cinnamon-sweet than burning unlike what some people here are describing. Perhaps they have very sensitive tastes... but I was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot give up woven floss - there is no substitute in my opinion, the tape floss just does not clean as well - and if you are the same way, then give this a try. Don&#x27;t knock it till you try it is all I can say.</li>
            <li> The previous floss I was using was discontinued and this floss is just like it.  I am so happy I found this floss.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> It was overpriced, but it seems to be in short supply, and the waxed floss just doesn&#x27;t appeal to me.</li>
            <li> You can find it at Walmart for $2.49 each. Works the same, good alternative to REACH. Taste not overwhelming. Go figure.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best floss on the market for getting into the nooks and crannies that I have in abundance!  Thanks for the notes that this used to be under the JnJ Reach umbrella, as I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li> Searched everwhere for the woven floss. I used to buy the ones with floride, but can&#x27;t find them any more. These are the same as what I used to get, just without the floride. so they work and are better than non-woven floss</li>
            <li> very gentle on gums.  will use this for years to come...</li>
            <li> I was pretty upset when Johnson and Johnson discontinued their woven floss with fluoride... but this woven floss is identical (minus the fluoride) and appears to do just as well on my teeth!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this in store anymore. I like the string texture for cleaning between teeth. Flavor is just OK, I would prefer unflavored.</li>
            <li> UPDATE six months later.  The first few of these were equal to the floss sold under the Johnson &amp; Johnson &amp;#34;REACH&amp;#34; brand, but the last few purchases have been floss that was shredded when I took it off the spool.  I don&#x27;t know why a manufacturer replaces a perfectly good product with something inferior, but that appears to be what has been done here.  The &amp;#34;Listerine Gentle Gum Care&amp;#34; is nowhere near what the &amp;#34;REACH&amp;#34; Gentle Gum Care floss was.  I have to use a pick to get pieces of the damn woven floss out from between my teeth!  Now I will look around to find something else as the last 3 Listerine woven floss packages have been a real disappointment.  I thought I found a replacement for my Reach woven floss that Johnson &amp; Johnson discontinued, but no longer</li>
            <li> This is the first woven floss I&#x27;ve ever tried and now I&#x27;m a believer.  It is so much easier to use than waxed floss.</li>
            <li> I prefer the original product that contained fluoride.</li>
            <li> Gentle on our gums, pleasant flavor and stays intact to do the job. I assume this costs a bit more than other floss, and the comfort is well worth it for us.</li>
            <li> I used the soft, flexible ribbon type they offer and it was great. This item is bad. It&#x27;s a couple of loosely entwined pieces of flimsy floss. I guess that&#x27;s why it is considered &amp;#34;gentle. Tears and pieces of it get stuck between teeth. Lucky me,  I ordered a six pack.</li>
            <li> I enjoy these and first tried samples at my dentist&#x27;s office.  They are tough to find so when I found them, I got a six pack! :)</li>
            <li> Six nice large packages of soft woven floss. Mint flavor seems to be a little stronger, but not overwhelming. This is the floss that was sold as REACH. I am so glad to find it!</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised and thank heaven--thick enough. dont know why i cant buy these in a store..thank God for Amazon!</li>
            <li> My dentist has advised me to use the Gentle Gum Care floss for many, many years.  It&#x27;s very soft on the gums and GREAT for cleaning between teeth.(good taste, too).  Listerine is a fabulous mouth wash and now they make this particular gloss.  I&#x27;m a happy camper and my dentist is happy too.</li>
