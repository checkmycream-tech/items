            <li>I fist started using it after doing some research on You Tube and this product had excellent reviews.</li>

            <li>Its amazing..</li>
            <li>It worked out nicely.</li>
            <li>By far the best product I have used in a while-</li>
            <li>was okay.  </li>
            <li>But I will continue use :)</li>
            <li>There are many so-called beauty products sitting in my bathroom cabinet that never did what they promised.  </li>
            <li>No, my eyebrows don&#x27;t look like they did when I was 20, but they are considerably better than they were before using this product.</li>
            <li>This product is OK.</li>
            <li>YOU LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I love Billion Dollar Brows products, but the Boost didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I think the most important thing is patience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products and this is the best to help grow brows in.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and would buy more!</li>
            <li>Found much better success with LiBrow or Revitabrow.</li>
            <li>This item REALLY does help your brows grow!!!</li>
            <li>I am waiting for it to work, so excited, it takes time</li>
            <li>I have VERY fair skin and blonde facial hair.</li>
            <li>Ardell lash and brow regrowth serum works way better and only costs about $7, also Sonia kashuk lash and brow enhancer works well and is ing $10 both available at target.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s much more &amp;#34;user friendly&amp;#34; as the applicator is much better designed for brow application than some of the other products.</li>
            <li>I receive it very fast</li>
            <li>it really works!</li>
            <li>I tried this product on a whim, but after a month I noticed fuller brows (mine are pretty skimpy and blond).</li>
            <li>but do they really grow my brows</li>
            <li>I always order this boost and it alwasy works very well.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very well packaged.</li>
            <li>It take time to see improvement but it does work and the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely NOTHING for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>BBB boost really helped them grow in</li>
            <li>Its wonderful.. not more drawing on my brows and hoping I dont look in the mirror and have a half one..</li>
            <li>I cant Live without this product!</li>
            <li>WOW, this really works, I was stressed and tweezed my eyebrows way too much  </li>
            <li>I enjoy this brow boost and even though I didn&#x27;t get a full brow line - I saw a small difference.</li>
            <li>Actually, nothing I&#x27;ve ever ordered from Amazon has been worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I started using this and was amazed to see new hair growing in a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>which will be soon because of all the new hair.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice any new growth</li>
            <li>and it really does take about a month to notice a difference, but after several months you will really notice it.</li>
            <li>What works is, being conscious of wanting my eyebrows to fill in and regrow at margins for thicker brows, I&#x27;m not plucking my eyebrows!</li>
            <li>Thank you BBB for a product that actually works exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li>After decades of tweezing my eyebrows were little more than tiny lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li>I tossed my tweezers and will go get my eyebrows waxed professionally,</li>
            <li>I will not waste my money reordering it.</li>
            <li>This is my fourth purchase because, with consistent use, it actually works.  </li>
            <li>so i went back to Billion Dollar Brows and within a couple of weeks started to see new growth and thickening of the eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I am in my mid 20&#x27;s and made the mistake of over plucking my eyebrows at a young age, brow boost brought my eyebrows back to life</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks, and i see a little improvement in my eyebrows... not really dramatic yet,</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks, and i see a little improvement in my eyebrows... not really dramatic yet,</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few months and have not noticed any new growth.  </li>
            <li> The only thing this product has done for me is dry out my eyebrows and make them peel.</li>
            <li> Been using this religiously for a month and see no new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend it if like me you have had thinning &amp; hard to grow brows.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a little too early to tell yet.</li>
            <li> At least it wasn&#x27;t very pricy.  </li>
            <li> and I could see visible results after a few short weeks.</li>
            <li> In just a few weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference and plan to not be without this product going forward.</li>
            <li> used it for over a month and absolutely no results.  </li>
            <li> Plain old castor oil seems to work a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very blonde and had been getting my eyebrows threaded very thin for years and had very little hope of ever having full eyebrows again.</li>
            <li> It was dried up or empty.</li>
            <li> AND SHE HONESTLY MESS THEM UP</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey</li>
            <li> not significantly for the price though.</li>
            <li> This product is a joke and a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve noticed a difference using this everyday for about 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> not easy to use if you don&#x27;t have any brows at all</li>
            <li> A bit pricey for that small of amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it works.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to get the product and try it.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt really work :(</li>
            <li> AS WELL HARDLY</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very small tube.</li>
            <li> Wish it would have worked, but sorry to say it has not filled in my eyebrows at all.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 7-8 months ago and started noticing a difference within a couple of weeks, I would even apply some to my eyelashes and they too started to thicken up and get crazy long!!!!</li>
            <li> I over plucked my eyebrows 15 years ago and have had thin ones ever since.  </li>
            <li> *, sorry.</li>
            <li> All it took was just a couple of bad waxing jobs and years of incorrect plucking to make my already sparse,hard to see eyebrows even worse.</li>
            <li> Try this and you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Am using it as a brow groomer so not too disappointed by this purchase, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>

            <li> WOW, this really works, I was stressed and tweezed my eyebrows way too much  ----- I started using this and was amazed to see new hair growing in a couple of days.  I tossed my tweezers and will go get my eyebrows waxed professionally, which will be soon because of all the new hair.</li>
            <li> By far the best product I have used in a while- it really works! I am in my mid 20&#x27;s and made the mistake of over plucking my eyebrows at a young age, brow boost brought my eyebrows back to life and I could see visible results after a few short weeks. I&#x27;ll definitely continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I have thinning brows and have been using this product for years now. I do feel they strengthen my brows but do they really grow my brows I dont know since my brows seem to get bald patches and then the hair grows back and then they get bald patches again. I think the most important thing is patience.</li>
            <li> didint work for me i got ripped off no differance in my brows at all dont buy this save ur money ...</li>
            <li> I tried this product on a whim, but after a month I noticed fuller brows (mine are pretty skimpy and blond). I also noticed my bottom lashes seem fuller as I use it on my lashes at night as well. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Save your money, it doesn&#x27;t work.  Actually, nothing I&#x27;ve ever ordered from Amazon has been worth the money.  Ardell lash and brow regrowth serum works way better and only costs about $7, also Sonia kashuk lash and brow enhancer works well and is ing $10 both available at target.  Billion dollar brows is billion dollar bulls***, sorry.</li>
            <li> was okay.  Didn&#x27;t notice any new growth</li>
            <li> 3rd time purchasing this item and would totally recommend!</li>
            <li> Not too impressed with this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and have not noticed a difference. I think I&#x27;ll stick with using the rogaine for my brows, works much better!</li>
            <li> I always order this boost and it alwasy works very well.  I receive it very fast and it&#x27;s very well packaged.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a little too early to tell yet. I see some growth and will continue to use !</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It take time to see improvement but it does work and the delivery was fast. I will definitely continue to use this product</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are still the same.  Wish it would have worked, but sorry to say it has not filled in my eyebrows at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and this is the best to help grow brows in. In just a few weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference and plan to not be without this product going forward. Also, it&#x27;s much more &amp;#34;user friendly&amp;#34; as the applicator is much better designed for brow application than some of the other products. Try this and you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> At least it wasn&#x27;t very pricy.  Am using it as a brow groomer so not too disappointed by this purchase, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> This item REALLY does help your brows grow!!! If you stick with it you will see a difference in two weeks!</li>
            <li> This product is a joke and a waste of money.  It did absolutely NOTHING for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This works, but you have to use it morning and then again at night and it really does take about a month to notice a difference, but after several months you will really notice it.</li>
            <li> not easy to use if you don&#x27;t have any brows at all</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I fist started using it after doing some research on You Tube and this product had excellent reviews. I have VERY fair skin and blonde facial hair. All it took was just a couple of bad waxing jobs and years of incorrect plucking to make my already sparse,hard to see eyebrows even worse. I started using this product about 7-8 months ago and started noticing a difference within a couple of weeks, I would even apply some to my eyelashes and they too started to thicken up and get crazy long!!!! It is a little pricey so i strayed at one time and tried Ardell, but i will not make that mistake again, i did not see any results with it so i went back to Billion Dollar Brows and within a couple of weeks started to see new growth and thickening of the eyebrows. I am so happy to have found something that can help correct the incorrect actions of those of us that didn&#x27;t know any better...Thank You Billion Dollar Brows!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is not .17 ounces, it is actually .14. A bit pricey for that small of amount. I have used and not seen any results.</li>
            <li> Really works. I have a medical condition that makes my hair fall out, this obviously can&#x27;t stop it but does help the hair grow back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks, and i see a little improvement in my eyebrows... not really dramatic yet, but I guess that&#x27;s because its only been 3 weeks. But I will continue use :)</li>
            <li> After several weeks of diligent use, this product did nothing at all for my brows.  Save your money, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> There are many so-called beauty products sitting in my bathroom cabinet that never did what they promised.  Brow Boost is not one of them.  This is my fourth purchase because, with consistent use, it actually works.  No, my eyebrows don&#x27;t look like they did when I was 20, but they are considerably better than they were before using this product.</li>
            <li> After 30 days - I see no results. Therefore, I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> After decades of tweezing my eyebrows were little more than tiny lines on my forehead. BBB boost really helped them grow in so i now have thicker, fuller brows after only 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> This product is OK. I&#x27;m not sure it works. What works is, being conscious of wanting my eyebrows to fill in and regrow at margins for thicker brows, I&#x27;m not plucking my eyebrows! However, I&#x27;m still applying this product since I&#x27;ve paid for it and because it acts like a pomade for brows. I don&#x27;t think I would spend the money to repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> It actually is working</li>
            <li> The only thing this product has done for me is dry out my eyebrows and make them peel. I didnt notice any difference in the fullness or length.</li>
            <li> Been using this religiously for a month and see no new hair growth.  Not that happy with my purchase! Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> It worked out nicely. I had practically no eyebrows and now I have some. I really like this product and would buy more!</li>
            <li> I am waiting for it to work, so excited, it takes time so I&#x27;ll re-post when I have results, can&#x27;t wait.</li>
            <li> AFTER MY SISTER DID MY BROWS SO AWESOME PERFECT A FRIEND IN ARIZONA SAID SHE CAN DO IT THIS ALSO LIKE WHAT MY SISTER DONE, WELL THAT WAS 40 YRS AGO AND SHE HONESTLY MESS THEM UP AS WELL HARDLY ANY BROWS, WELL I FOUND THIS PRODUCT YEARS BACK AND WELL MY EYE BROWS HAVE BEEN GROWING BACK AND IT IS A AWESOME HELPER I DO NOT USE IT EVERY DAY, YET WHEN I DO USE IT THANK YOU LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks, applying it twice a day, and I already see regrowth and thickening. I&#x27;m very blonde and had been getting my eyebrows threaded very thin for years and had very little hope of ever having full eyebrows again. I&#x27;m happy that its product has been working for me.</li>
            <li> used it for over a month and absolutely no results.  May take longer, but I was hoping for some sign of regrowth!</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few months and have not noticed any new growth.  Probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I used this product failthfully twice per day for two months. No change whatsoever. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I cant Live without this product! I have has thyroid issues for 50 years and never had eyebrows since a teen, I decided to give BBB a try, OMG can I say that after 2 Months I have to trim my eyebrow, Its amazing..My brows are usually blonde however the grow in is brown.. Its wonderful.. not more drawing on my brows and hoping I dont look in the mirror and have a half one.. Thank you BBB for a product that actually works exactly as stated.  I LOVE IT , I just wish the price was a bit lower 19.95 so I can afford it each month</li>
            <li> Doesnt really work :(</li>
            <li> The packaging was unsealed and the brow boost looked like it had been used. It was dried up or empty.</li>
            <li> kinda works. not significantly for the price though. Might as well buy a simple target brand for same effects.</li>
            <li> I love Billion Dollar Brows products, but the Boost didn&#x27;t work for me. Plain old castor oil seems to work a little.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to get the product and try it.  It may work for some, but I am to the end of the tube, and still do not see any difference whatsoever.  I will not waste my money reordering it.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve noticed a difference using this everyday for about 2-3 weeks. It&#x27;s working! It&#x27;s a very small tube. Not a lot in there though. I over plucked my eyebrows 15 years ago and have had thin ones ever since.  I hope I can get more growth too!</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. Found much better success with LiBrow or Revitabrow. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Billion dollar brows for about 31/2 weeks every night...I have been seeing results already. I would certainly recommend it if like me you have had thinning &amp; hard to grow brows.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything at all</li>
            <li> I enjoy this brow boost and even though I didn&#x27;t get a full brow line - I saw a small difference.</li>
            <li> Save your money, this didn&#x27;t do anything. Smells good though.</li>
