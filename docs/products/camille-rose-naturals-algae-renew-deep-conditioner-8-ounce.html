            <li>This is a very good deep conditioner that I&#x27;ve found works best for me as an overnight treatment.  </li>
            <li>This product has wonderful ingrediants, but I must be allergic to something in it, because after I rinsed, my scalp had intense itching!  </li>

            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, and I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is retaining a lot of length because it is so moisturized.</li>
            <li>This product is so amazing.</li>
            <li>But I think companies should be honest in the description of their products.</li>
            <li>Like all of the Camille Rose Naturals products, the fragrance is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it was before so much better.  </li>
            <li>The reason I don&#x27;t LOVE it, is because I still feel like adding a bit more moisture after rinsing out the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>she is god sent and inspiring</li>
            <li>thank Jesus its magic</li>
            <li>Simply because it is amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li>I love the curlmaker though</li>
            <li>and the hair still feels smooth like butter without any oily residue!</li>
            <li>I really like the ingredients in this conditioner and it smells great too.</li>
            <li>I agree with many that it is pricey</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is that when I apply it, I don&#x27;t have to use any detangle as this helps to detangle my hair as well.</li>
            <li>Love this line of products</li>

            <li>Looking to try more things from this line.</li>
            <li>Favorite product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for over 8 months love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, PLEASE MAKE A FRAGRANCE FREE VERSION!</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I use It after I wash put my gel on top and then seal with organic argan oil or Avacado oil</li>
            <li>&amp; leaves my hair feeling very soft and soooo easy to detangle!!!</li>
            <li>Great product leaves my hair soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>I washed it out and just felt like my hair was soo soft very pleased!</li>
            <li>Dissapointed because it wasn&#x27;t cheap, and my hair seems to love her hair milk.  </li>
            <li>The new product is good</li>
            <li>Preteen deciding to go nature can use this on their hair its that easy whether u sit under a dryer or put a shower cap on its works just as it pure honest and crafts-menship and expertise in a jar.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this conditioner after the first use!</li>
            <li>Great deep conditioner!  </li>
            <li>Great deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>My 4a/b hair felt silky smooth upon rinsing.  </li>
            <li>The absolute best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>the ingredients list is at the most impressive to say the least</li>
            <li>This came in the mail super quick and that was a plus!</li>
            <li>The price is worth it !</li>
            <li>Even though its a bit pricey, its worth it!</li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve used thus far for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>Never tried the old formula so I can&#x27;t compare, but I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Makes my heart extremely soft for days and my curls look amazing.  </li>
            <li>a popular natural hair blogger</li>
            <li>But overall it was a good product and it helped my hair</li>
            <li>Hair was super hydrated afterwards</li>
            <li>Most of these products geared towards highly textured hair feel like nipple balm and callouses</li>
            <li>but this is the balance that help me keep a year worth of growth with addition  of what it gave me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Camille Rose Naturals&#x27; Algae Renew Deep Conditioner once so far--and I am already sold.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s one of the better deep conditioners available.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Great deep conditioner for natural hair and transitioners.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy.  </li>
            <li>but I leave it in my short natural hair and it works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a better alternative to many other conditioning products out there.</li>
            <li>It sank right into my hair.  </li>
            <li>It shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering again very soon!</li>
            <li>I did give it four stars because it is a bit oily at first BUT once rinsed out that goes away</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been able to purchase it from Curlmart or Target during one of their sales and plan to buy one jar per year and add it to my rotation of deep conditioners.</li>
            <li>Love this deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth, silky and soft after using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to shop around for another DC</li>
            <li>I originally purchased the Curl maker and this Deep Algae conditioner by Camille Rose at the same time.</li>
            <li>It works better than other conditioners I&#x27;ve used for my super kinky hair (4B).</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft, moisturized, and feels like butter!</li>
            <li>this stuff of doesn&#x27;t even have long healthy hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super soft and keeps it that way.</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>and I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Now it really looks and feels like a mud mask.</li>
            <li>I will use the whole bottle</li>
            <li>Love their almond jail butter</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know to thank her or tell her to get real and call target to ask about their return</li>
            <li>I got a really cute pink reusable bag with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Here is the real list: Deionized Water, Aloe Vera Juice, Butyrospermum Parki ( Shea Butter), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut Oil), Bethenthimon Methosulfate, Caryl Alcohol, Dipropylene Glycol (btms) , Theobroma, Cacao (Coco) Butter, Mangifera Indica (Mango), Seed Butter, Cannablis Sativa ( Hemp), Seed Oil, DI Pentrnal Mel (Manukla Honey), Vegistable Oil, Bitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Oenothera Biennis ( Evening Primrose)</li>
            <li>As another reviewer posted, there is very little &#x27;Algae&#x27; in this product, but it still conditions amazingly well.</li>
            <li>My new staple for life!</li>
            <li>It has a great scent, and it really conditions and moisturizes my thick, curly, long, hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>100% all natural ingredients and does the job better than any other product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It is nice and thick but after I rinse it out my hair isn&#x27;t as moisturized as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li>My hair is super thick and kinky and it didn&#x27;t do anything special</li>
            <li>the product came packed and sealed, very professional plus I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this for a while now</li>
            <li>My natural hair felt like silk!</li>
            <li>but, man, does it leave my hair soft!  </li>
            <li>Given the size of the jar, I&#x27;ve been able to use it multiple ways: as a pre-poo detangler, with &amp; without heat and overnight and still have enough left for at least 2 more uses.  </li>
            <li>This product left my hair soft and very moizturized!</li>
            <li>I will stick to ross, marshalls, target, iherb.com, skin1.com, discountbeautycenter.com, and my local indian market for oils and products for my hair since I can get salon quality and bulk size containers of natural/mostly natural hair/skin items for mostly $10 or less ($15 at most).</li>
            <li>Rinse my hair out with cold water and my hair feels GREAT</li>
            <li>I have protein sensitive hair</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have needed to shell out nearly $20 on a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so over the marketing and hype that surrounds natural hair.</li>
            <li>I does leave my hair shiny and soft</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft after using it and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>My natural hair feels so soft and hydrated after using this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is completely transformed by this product.</li>
            <li>Oil, Phenoxyethanol and Capeylyn Glycol, Blue Green Algae, Dimethyl Sulfone (Msm), Biotin, Tocopheryl Acetate ( Vitamin E), Mentha Piperita ( Peppermint Oil), and Love...</li>
            <li>The texture is extremely thick and creamy, but it distributes surprisingly easy through the hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Deionized water, aloe vera juice, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, cocos nucifera (coconut oil), behentrimonium methosulfate and cetyl alcohol ( BTMS), theobroma cacao (cocoa butter), mangifera indica (mango) seed butter, cannabis sativa (hemp) seed oil, DI panthenol, mel (manuka honey), vegetable glycerin, camellia sinensis (green tea) extract, simmondsia chinensia (jojoba) seed oil, rosa canina (rose hip ) fruit oil, bitis vinfera (grape seed) oil, oenothera biennis (evening primrose) oil,phenoxyethanol and caprylyl glycol (optiphen nd),blue green algae, dimethyl sulfone (msm), biotin, tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E), mentha piperita (peppermint)</li>
            <li>But after my hair was dry my hair felt soft, it help my natural hair obtain moisture and made my natural curls have bounce and body.</li>
            <li>It left my hair shiny &amp; soft</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and gives it a deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>I have medium curly frizzy dry hair naturally...</li>
            <li>People are paying bloggers/ vloggers who aren&#x27;t always honest about being endorsed to promote a lot of these crappy over priced products on the shelves owned by black women with short hair selling dreams of long hair to other black women with short hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a little on the pricey side and wasn&#x27;t really a fan of the smell.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t know to thank her or tell her to get real and call target to ask about their return</li>
            <li> I got a really cute pink reusable bag with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Here is the real list: Deionized Water, Aloe Vera Juice, Butyrospermum Parki ( Shea Butter), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut Oil), Bethenthimon Methosulfate, Caryl Alcohol, Dipropylene Glycol (btms) , Theobroma, Cacao (Coco) Butter, Mangifera Indica (Mango), Seed Butter, Cannablis Sativa ( Hemp), Seed Oil, DI Pentrnal Mel (Manukla Honey), Vegistable Oil, Bitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Oenothera Biennis ( Evening Primrose)</li>
            <li> As another reviewer posted, there is very little &#x27;Algae&#x27; in this product, but it still conditions amazingly well.</li>
            <li> My new staple for life!</li>
            <li> It has a great scent, and it really conditions and moisturizes my thick, curly, long, hair.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> 100% all natural ingredients and does the job better than any other product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It is nice and thick but after I rinse it out my hair isn&#x27;t as moisturized as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li> My hair is super thick and kinky and it didn&#x27;t do anything special</li>
            <li> the product came packed and sealed, very professional plus I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this for a while now</li>
            <li> My natural hair felt like silk!</li>
            <li> but, man, does it leave my hair soft!  </li>
            <li> Given the size of the jar, I&#x27;ve been able to use it multiple ways: as a pre-poo detangler, with &amp; without heat and overnight and still have enough left for at least 2 more uses.  </li>
            <li> This product left my hair soft and very moizturized!</li>
            <li> I will stick to ross, marshalls, target, iherb.com, skin1.com, discountbeautycenter.com, and my local indian market for oils and products for my hair since I can get salon quality and bulk size containers of natural/mostly natural hair/skin items for mostly $10 or less ($15 at most).</li>

            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have needed to shell out nearly $20 on a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so over the marketing and hype that surrounds natural hair.</li>
            <li> I does leave my hair shiny and soft</li>

            <li> People are paying bloggers/ vloggers who aren&#x27;t always honest about being endorsed to promote a lot of these crappy over priced products on the shelves owned by black women with short hair selling dreams of long hair to other black women with short hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little on the pricey side and wasn&#x27;t really a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s just as good that won&#x27;t make me feel sick and get a headache.</li>
            <li> meh, it was okay but not great, not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who&#x27;s responsible for verifying the accuracy of the information that&#x27;s put on this website, but I&#x27;ve learned before buying ANY beauty products not to trust what it says on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Made my hair less frizzy and its soft.</li>
            <li> the description, they have you believe that blue algae is second on the list of ingredients, when in fact it is much, much further down.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time</li>
            <li> as you can see the Blue Gree Algae is way down the list than the one advertised above.</li>
            <li> So I feel its a good product because of all the natural ingrediants, but my firsr-use results, were horrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thick product that I was able to work easily into my hair and strangely, although it smells like a Yorks Peppermint Patty on application, by the next morning my hair smells like stale cookies (weird).  </li>
            <li> (My hair is waste length and 4a/4b mixture with some 3c only at the crown)</li>
            <li> I rated this product a 4 stare because I didn&#x27;t like the way my hair felt when I rinsed it from my hair , it didn&#x27;t give me the softness I thought it would give while my hair was wet.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know who exactly is manufacturing this, but this crap is not the made in the kitchen straight from the cupboard</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see myself buying any other conditioner after this</li>
            <li> and she didn&#x27;t charge and arm leg and hair for her product which can&#x27;t be said for a lot other products.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is not packaged by anyone other than a facility.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is thick and it coats my strands like a deep conditioner</li>
            <li> and I had to use half the jar just to get my hair coated.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey, but my hair is moisturized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this entire line.</li>
            <li> I sectioned my hair, applied, put into small buns, applied a plastic cap and say under the drier for about 20 min.</li>
            <li> This algae mask was like brick hard shea butter and car freshener.</li>
            <li> Thick creamy consistency.  </li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has a very thick consistency</li>
            <li> these fake grass root companies are trying to let on.</li>
            <li> The ingredient list is wrong and misleading.</li>
            <li> but she has taken the time to make combination thats assure me she did this with all her heart you&#x27;ll be crazy not to give this a try  </li>
            <li> I had to wash my hair again to get rid of the crazy itching.  </li>
            <li> and i tried all nature hair product from very expensive to the cheapest</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The absolute best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair drinks this stuff up. I find that I get the best results when I either DC over night or sit under a heated dryer for 30 minutes. Either way, the results are amazing! My hair is super soft, moisturized, and feels like butter! I can&#x27;t see myself buying any other conditioner after this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very thick so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Bought this hair mask off of the glowing reviews on Hey Fran Hey! a popular natural hair blogger and I really like this conditioner. The reason I don&#x27;t LOVE it, is because I still feel like adding a bit more moisture after rinsing out the conditioner. I leave it in for about 30 minutes and then rinse with luke warm-cool water. It works better than other conditioners I&#x27;ve used for my super kinky hair (4B).</li>
            <li> Excellent on my hair!  Great deep conditioner!  If you are looking for something that is creamy and good for strengthening the hair then this is it!  I will be ordering again very soon!</li>
            <li> I love this it&#x27;s a holy gail I have all the type 4 coils in my hair and this is what a deep treatment is to do for our hair the ingredients list is at the most impressive to say the least but this give my hair the perfect balance of moisture and protein I have protein sensitive hair but this is the balance that help me keep a year worth of growth with addition  of what it gave me i am so blessed someone made a product as this she is god sent and inspiring i always buy a jar as soon as i get paid and i tried all nature hair product from very expensive to the cheapest but she has taken the time to make combination thats assure me she did this with all her heart you&#x27;ll be crazy not to give this a try  and she didn&#x27;t charge and arm leg and hair for her product which can&#x27;t be said for a lot other products.  Preteen deciding to go nature can use this on their hair its that easy whether u sit under a dryer or put a shower cap on its works just as it pure honest and crafts-menship and expertise in a jar. thank Jesus its magic</li>
            <li> Great deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product has wonderful ingrediants, but I must be allergic to something in it, because after I rinsed, my scalp had intense itching!  Dissapointed because it wasn&#x27;t cheap, and my hair seems to love her hair milk.  I had to wash my hair again to get rid of the crazy itching.  Maybe I used too much, or left some on my scalp, (I rinsed thorougly though!) So I feel its a good product because of all the natural ingrediants, but my firsr-use results, were horrible.</li>
            <li> Simply because it is amazing!!!!! It smells amazing!!!! &amp; leaves my hair feeling very soft and soooo easy to detangle!!! So happy I discovered this product! My new staple for life!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used thus far for deep conditioning. The best.</li>
            <li> This product use to be different.  They changed the recipe a lot.  I liked the way it was before so much better.  It was white and creamy.  Now it really looks and feels like a mud mask. The new product is good and I do see a difference in my hair but not like before.  The conditioner does not have a good slip on my hair.  I have to brush it in and massage to get it all over my head.  I will use the whole bottle but then I am off to find another deep conditioning product.</li>
            <li> Great product leaves my hair soft and manageable! I would buy it again. Smells like chocolate</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;clay&amp;#34; literally was like mud in my hair. I like slip in my deep conditioner and this is diametrically opposite!  My hair was clumped and I had to use a moisturizing conditioner after. Maybe you&#x27;re suppose to. Don&#x27;t want that step! Love their almond jail butter cause it makes everyone&#x27;s hair in my family silky. This did not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Camille Rose Naturals&#x27; Algae Renew Deep Conditioner once so far--and I am already sold. This conditioner is thick and it coats my strands like a deep conditioner should. My hair was springy and bouncy after one treatment. Like all of the Camille Rose Naturals products, the fragrance is light and pleasant. I think I&#x27;ve found my go-to deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I contacted the owner who advised me to get a hair steamer to get the product to actually work. I didn&#x27;t know to thank her or tell her to get real and call target to ask about their return policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time I bought a machine to hydrate my hair I wouldn&#x27;t have needed to shell out nearly $20 on a conditioner.  This algae mask was like brick hard shea butter and car freshener. It sat on my hair and felt like I was rubbing a drugstore cocoa butter stick on my hands. It smelled like peppermint balls and car incense.  Don&#x27;t know who exactly is manufacturing this, but this crap is not the made in the kitchen straight from the cupboard wholesome goodness these fake grass root companies are trying to let on. This stuff is not packaged by anyone other than a facility. I&#x27;m so over the marketing and hype that surrounds natural hair. People are paying bloggers/ vloggers who aren&#x27;t always honest about being endorsed to promote a lot of these crappy over priced products on the shelves owned by black women with short hair selling dreams of long hair to other black women with short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The owner  this stuff of doesn&#x27;t even have long healthy hair. I will stick to ross, marshalls, target, iherb.com, skin1.com, discountbeautycenter.com, and my local indian market for oils and products for my hair since I can get salon quality and bulk size containers of natural/mostly natural hair/skin items for mostly $10 or less ($15 at most). Most of these products geared towards highly textured hair feel like nipple balm and callouses cream anyway. (My hair is waste length and 4a/4b mixture with some 3c only at the crown)</li>
            <li> This came in the mail super quick and that was a plus! the product came packed and sealed, very professional plus I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this for a while now and I love it!</li>
            <li> I rated this product a 4 stare because I didn&#x27;t like the way my hair felt when I rinsed it from my hair , it didn&#x27;t give me the softness I thought it would give while my hair was wet. But after my hair was dry my hair felt soft, it help my natural hair obtain moisture and made my natural curls have bounce and body. I would recommend this product to others</li>
            <li> meh, it was okay but not great, not worth the price.  I love the curlmaker though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice on my hair and I think it&#x27;s one of the better deep conditioners available. The texture is extremely thick and creamy, but it distributes surprisingly easy through the hair. I personally don&#x27;t need to comb it through, but my hair is only about 6&amp;#34; in length. I have 4A/4B/4C hair. As another reviewer posted, there is very little &#x27;Algae&#x27; in this product, but it still conditions amazingly well. I did not used a hooded dryer or steamer, so my results are just from leaving the conditioner in my hair with a plastic shower cap for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but my hair is moisturized. I&#x27;m sticking to organic honey and plain pure yogurt</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this conditioner after the first use! 100% all natural ingredients and does the job better than any other product I have ever used. My natural hair felt like silk! I even conditioned some weave I had with it and it came out feeling amazing! I did give it four stars because it is a bit oily at first BUT once rinsed out that goes away and the hair still feels smooth like butter without any oily residue!</li>
            <li> I really like the ingredients in this conditioner and it smells great too. I does leave my hair shiny and soft, I would definitely purchase more often if the product was not so expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a very good deep conditioner that I&#x27;ve found works best for me as an overnight treatment.  It left my hair shiny &amp; soft ~ my curls were practically singing after I rinsed it out.  Given the size of the jar, I&#x27;ve been able to use it multiple ways: as a pre-poo detangler, with &amp; without heat and overnight and still have enough left for at least 2 more uses.  It&#x27;s a very thick product that I was able to work easily into my hair and strangely, although it smells like a Yorks Peppermint Patty on application, by the next morning my hair smells like stale cookies (weird).  I agree with many that it is pricey but I&#x27;ve been able to purchase it from Curlmart or Target during one of their sales and plan to buy one jar per year and add it to my rotation of deep conditioners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who&#x27;s responsible for verifying the accuracy of the information that&#x27;s put on this website, but I&#x27;ve learned before buying ANY beauty products not to trust what it says on Amazon. For those of you who want to know, here is the actual ingredients list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deionized water, aloe vera juice, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, cocos nucifera (coconut oil), behentrimonium methosulfate and cetyl alcohol ( BTMS), theobroma cacao (cocoa butter), mangifera indica (mango) seed butter, cannabis sativa (hemp) seed oil, DI panthenol, mel (manuka honey), vegetable glycerin, camellia sinensis (green tea) extract, simmondsia chinensia (jojoba) seed oil, rosa canina (rose hip ) fruit oil, bitis vinfera (grape seed) oil, oenothera biennis (evening primrose) oil,phenoxyethanol and caprylyl glycol (optiphen nd),blue green algae, dimethyl sulfone (msm), biotin, tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E), mentha piperita (peppermint) oil, scent and LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the description, they have you believe that blue algae is second on the list of ingredients, when in fact it is much, much further down. I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad product. It&#x27;s a better alternative to many other conditioning products out there. But I think companies should be honest in the description of their products. I don&#x27;t like being misled.</li>
            <li> Love this deep conditioner. My hair is smooth, silky and soft after using it. Definitely recommend. Will be ordering more of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Never tried the old formula so I can&#x27;t compare, but I love this stuff!  It&#x27;s the ugliest, weirdest looking conditioner I&#x27;ve ever seen, but, man, does it leave my hair soft!  It sank right into my hair.  I left it on over 20 minutes with a heat cap.  My 4a/b hair felt silky smooth upon rinsing.  Smells good, too!</li>
            <li> I love this product. My hair feels so soft after using it and it&#x27;s all natural. My favorite part is that when I apply it, I don&#x27;t have to use any detangle as this helps to detangle my hair as well. It lasts a long time but once I run out I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing it again. Love this line of products</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells different but it will have your hair softer than ever before! It has alot of slip on it I detangled my hair as I put it in my hair. I washed it out and just felt like my hair was soo soft very pleased! The price is worth it ! I got a really cute pink reusable bag with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. It keeps my hair soft and moisturized. Im glad you can buy it in the stores now.</li>
            <li> This Product is AMAZING!! My curls came to life. This product left my hair soft and very moizturized! Worth every penny. It shipped very fast. Was pleased with product and delievery. Looking to try more things from this line.</li>
            <li> It was just alright.  My hair is super thick and kinky and it didn&#x27;t do anything special and I had to use half the jar just to get my hair coated.  Next time I&#x27;ll have to add some oils or something to it to improve it&#x27;s conditioning properties.  I don&#x27;t have to purchase this again.  It is nice and thick but after I rinse it out my hair isn&#x27;t as moisturized as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li> This deep condition masks makes your hair feel like butter. The smell is amazing, and I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is retaining a lot of length because it is so moisturized.</li>
            <li> Thick creamy consistency.  Smells earthy.  It is pricey therefore I use sparingly.  Very moisturizing.  Will definitely order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LMR - Georgia</li>
            <li> This product brought my hair from the grave. I use it with a steamer and it felt like another person head of hair. Favorite product. I&#x27;ve been using this for over 8 months love it</li>
            <li> I apply this after cowashing or shampooing and leave it on for an hour under the dryer with a shower cap on. Rinse my hair out with cold water and my hair feels GREAT but I don&#x27;t like having to resist puking when using this product. I&#x27;m willing to shop around for another DC that&#x27;s just as good that won&#x27;t make me feel sick and get a headache. It&#x27;s a shame, PLEASE MAKE A FRAGRANCE FREE VERSION!</li>
            <li> Great hair product and smells wonderful. Used this for 20 min with a heat cap. Made my hair less frizzy and its soft. I have medium curly frizzy dry hair naturally... Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This product is so amazing. My natural hair feels so soft and hydrated after using this product. I will certainly purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Great deep conditioner for natural hair and transitioners. It&#x27;s has a very thick consistency but it&#x27;s a little on the pricey side and wasn&#x27;t really a fan of the smell. But overall it was a good product and it helped my hair</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.  It has a great scent, and it really conditions and moisturizes my thick, curly, long, hair.  I can even do wash and goes with this product and my curls look great.  I&#x27;m addicted to this entire line.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! Makes my heart extremely soft for days and my curls look amazing.  I use It after I wash put my gel on top and then seal with organic argan oil or Avacado oil and I diffuse. My curls look just the best ever.&lt;br /&gt;(3B,3C mix) Worth the buy.  It smells like chocolate lip gloss or something which I don&#x27;t like but a lot of people do.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good and works just as good</li>
            <li> This is some good stuff. Makes my hair soft and gives it a deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Hair was super hydrated afterwards</li>
            <li> It was just alright,  but I will probably not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the Curl maker and this Deep Algae conditioner by Camille Rose at the same time. I tried the curl maker and didn&#x27;t like it. However, this deep conditioner lived up to its standards! It softened my hair just like it said it would. To top it off, the smell was pleasantly wonderful! This deep conditioner will definitely be incorporated into my regular hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> i had been looking for a deep conditioner for 7 moths now and ive finally found it. It makes my hair super soft and keeps it that way. Even though its a bit pricey, its worth it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!! I will never use another deep conditioner. It&#x27;s smooth and creamy and smells delightful (kind of like mint cookies). I sectioned my hair, applied, put into small buns, applied a plastic cap and say under the drier for about 20 min. AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> The ingredient list is wrong and misleading. Here is the real list: Deionized Water, Aloe Vera Juice, Butyrospermum Parki ( Shea Butter), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut Oil), Bethenthimon Methosulfate, Caryl Alcohol, Dipropylene Glycol (btms) , Theobroma, Cacao (Coco) Butter, Mangifera Indica (Mango), Seed Butter, Cannablis Sativa ( Hemp), Seed Oil, DI Pentrnal Mel (Manukla Honey), Vegistable Oil, Bitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Oenothera Biennis ( Evening Primrose) Oil, Phenoxyethanol and Capeylyn Glycol, Blue Green Algae, Dimethyl Sulfone (Msm), Biotin, Tocopheryl Acetate ( Vitamin E), Mentha Piperita ( Peppermint Oil), and Love...as you can see the Blue Gree Algae is way down the list than the one advertised above. There is also Dipropylene Glycol is on this list, but not on others. That doesn&#x27;t make me happy. Don&#x27;t mislead me</li>
            <li> My hair is completely transformed by this product. It works. I believe the directions advise rinsing it out but I leave it in my short natural hair and it works great.</li>
