            <li>smells really good.  </li>

            <li>Thank you Carapex, keep up the good work.</li>

            <li>Love the shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>My hair love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is amazing</li>
            <li>It did not moisturize my hair like I would have liked, but it worked well for my husband.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that I took a chance on this product.</li>
            <li>What I also like about this Shampoo is that it contains natural ingredients including my favorite, Hemp!!!</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair curl up more</li>
            <li>I should have returned this product since it made my scalp flake more.  </li>
            <li>The matching conditioner was equally fabulous!</li>
            <li>but it is much better than when I use over the counter shampoos.</li>
            <li>Thank you for your great product it is a real savior.</li>
            <li>Glad I picked this product.</li>
            <li>Love It</li>
            <li>Anyhow, since using this product I haven&#x27;t really notice any improvements on my hair loss but it does clean my scalp very nicely without irritation as I do have sensitive scalp and it has a very pleasant smell that lingers on throughout the day, even after a sweaty workout.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive (these people must be super honest)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SLS free, and has a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>I like to have strong rooted hair and</li>
            <li>instead i got something that could be industrial &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; like head and shoulders, a strong detergent shampoo.  </li>
            <li>first thing I liked about it was the price.</li>
            <li>After rinising you can feel your hair being super soft and feeling great.</li>
            <li>I might actually be able to skip a day washing my hair for the first time ever in my life!</li>
            <li>The Shampoo itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li>: I received the shampoo and conditioner free in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li>+ a product that actually does as advertised &#x3D; Great Product with Value.  </li>
            <li>Third thing I liked, the smell!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more when I run out! :)</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair literally squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item and several others to try for the issue and this one was by far the best.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo smells nice and gets my hair clean, and does not irritate my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>It smells great, obviously not geared toward a specific gender, it smells clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>it smells good, has all natural ingredients and has really helped me with my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>have to add that at first, I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It rinsed out easily and left my hair and scalp feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling soft, full and clean!</li>
            <li>The second thing I liked was the bottle.</li>
            <li>when i read hemp and omega blend, i was envisioning something more &#x27;natural&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Some didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair, others worked with varying success.</li>
            <li>This shampoo seems fine, although I can&#x27;t comment on anything but the smell so far.  </li>
            <li>I definitely reccomend if you are someone that needs a good conditioning shampoo and conditioner but wants to stay natural and not pay the salon price!</li>
            <li>next day it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li>I went from being able to wash my hair only 3 times a week to having to wash it every day.</li>
            <li>I am almost done with my first bottle.</li>
            <li>It has helped a lot for the itch and my very oily scalp though!</li>
            <li>Some times had to wash twice a day depending on what i washed it with the first time.</li>
            <li>first requested this as a skeptic, because I&#x27;d never used a hemp-based product before.</li>
            <li>Good cleansing without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Awesome Shampoo, mad my hair smooth, very please</li>
            <li>Makes your hair squeaky clean and so shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel clean and soft but also makes it have some body too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week now, but I have noticed that hair that I have is softer and more moisturized and doesn&#x27;t get as greasy as fast like it used to.</li>
            <li>I was not required to leave a positive review.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t get much, but you really don&#x27;t need much in the first place.</li>
            <li>I still have a very itchy scalp .</li>
            <li>Really deeps cleans hair and stops itching without all the chemical rinses out without residue I have real ong hair</li>
            <li>A couple of months ago, my once normal hair/scalp became really flaky and oily!</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo....</li>
            <li>He really loves it also.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going back to another shampoo, my hair has a natural brightness to it and simply feels good.</li>
            <li>I received the shampoo and conditioner in the mail last week and was excited to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>As for the upsides, it smells pretty good, I used abou a quarter size of the shampoo for my hair and left in for a few mins rubbing it in.</li>
            <li>, it makes my hair really really clean, and I actually think it&#x27;s filling in thicker!?</li>
            <li>, it really feels fresh to my hair, free of heavy chemicals.</li>
            <li>( I&#x27;ll be sure to get the bigger one next time, I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>so I will have a steady supply of this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this shampoo if you have oily/flaky hair.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Not only did my scalp feel soothed for the first time in years, my hair is shiny and bouncy and silky-soft!</li>
            <li>He goes to school looking normal again.</li>
            <li>I think I might have had mild psoriasis on my scalp my whole life and never really known it.</li>
            <li>My new routine is to rub Head and Shoulders on my scalp, let it sit for a minute or two, rinse, and then lather my scalp and hair with this hemp shampoo.</li>
            <li>If I live to 105, I am all set.</li>
            <li>Have to use more  than other similar shampoos for thorough cleansing.</li>
            <li>Of course, it&#x27;ll depend on your hair texture, but I am now able to go back to shampooing every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Feel like there is some ingredients that don&#x27;t need to be in their a natural product that it claims to be, furthermore even though i like the smell</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I was looking for a natural shampoo to help with \\&quot;itchy scalp and hair loss\\&quot; as stated.</li>
            <li>We discovered that my husband is sensitive to Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS), it&#x27;s a foaming agent.</li>
            <li>my hair is soft and silky after washing it with this shampoo,it also stopped my dandruff.</li>
            <li>was looking for natural.  </li>
            <li>I am currently struggling with hair loss and have yet to find something that really works for me.</li>
            <li>Stay far away from the conditioner if you don&#x27;t like the smell of fish.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>even though my hair is abundantly thick, this product seems to make my hair want to shed more than it naturally does.</li>
            <li>After several months of use, his dandruff has almost completely gone away!</li>
            <li>The formula is thick enough for my hair (probably because its short) and it works well with different kinds of conditioners without diminishing its own benefits.</li>
            <li>A little small, but super pretty!</li>
            <li>That would probably be my primary complaint; I have no problems brushing it at all</li>
            <li>Last thing I wanted to buy was something that directly got rid of the dandruff</li>
            <li>The shampoo itself is a blueish-green gel, which lathers only a little, which is good because lots of lather means lots of irritating sulfates.</li>
            <li>I inentionally bought this shampoo to get rid of my dandruff, not directly but overtime by restoring the natural balance of my hair.</li>
            <li>Usually I can tell right away if it&#x27;s going to start getting itchy.</li>
            <li>But I wanted to try a different type of product for my hair, which is pretty dry and as of late has been very brittle.</li>
            <li>It has made a small improvement for my dandruff, but I really don&#x27;t think anything will ever eliminate dandruff, after all it&#x27;s simply skin shedding, which is natural.</li>

            <li> The formula is thick enough for my hair (probably because its short) and it works well with different kinds of conditioners without diminishing its own benefits.</li>
            <li> A little small, but super pretty!</li>
            <li> That would probably be my primary complaint; I have no problems brushing it at all</li>
            <li> Last thing I wanted to buy was something that directly got rid of the dandruff</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself is a blueish-green gel, which lathers only a little, which is good because lots of lather means lots of irritating sulfates.</li>
            <li> I inentionally bought this shampoo to get rid of my dandruff, not directly but overtime by restoring the natural balance of my hair.</li>
            <li> Usually I can tell right away if it&#x27;s going to start getting itchy.</li>
            <li> But I wanted to try a different type of product for my hair, which is pretty dry and as of late has been very brittle.</li>
            <li> It has made a small improvement for my dandruff, but I really don&#x27;t think anything will ever eliminate dandruff, after all it&#x27;s simply skin shedding, which is natural.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, thick and full but I lose a lot of hair throughout the day</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s natural to lose some hair, I was losing lots due to being on the HGC diet.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling too stripped after washing with it, the scent doesn&#x27;t last for too long, and I have seen a difference in my hair since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> So I just got finished using this product in my overly greasy/ dry scalp that has been flaking on me for the last month or so.</li>
            <li> All other shampoos I&#x27;ve used have left me with tons of flaky white residue and burning</li>
            <li> My hair has been falling out a lot lately and it really annoys me.</li>
            <li> , I want it gone completely not to be stuck with a product forever.  </li>
            <li> The first day I used the shampoo with the companion conditioner, I walked around for two hours trying to place where a horrible fishy smell was coming from until I realized it was wafting off my own head.  </li>
            <li> We had changed his toothpaste to an SLS free one, and his painful canker sores completely disappeared, and have stayed away for months!</li>
            <li> but I will say that the other essential oils that it is made with help with the scent.</li>
            <li> Paying that kind of money for shampoo and conditioner I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It was a total waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaints</li>
            <li> I tried it once by itself and once with my regular conditioner, and if you have dead ends</li>
            <li> i had a very dry scalp due to hair loss and other shampoos</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t enough product and it&#x27;s hard to slather into my long hair.</li>
            <li> started using this shampoo based on the good reviews, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed!</li>
            <li> Low and behold, it dried, and my scalp did not itch!</li>
            <li> No more oily gross hair for my kid.</li>
            <li> All the other shampoos don&#x27;t even come close.</li>
            <li> I wondered if SLS in the different dandruff shampoos he had tried was actually making his itchy scalp and dandruff worse.</li>
            <li> But anyway, this cleansed my hair down to the roots, which have been feeling a little thicker since I started using it, and in general my hair has started to feel a bit softer than usual.</li>
            <li> My son is going through the teenage hormone years and has been having real trouble with oily hair.</li>
            <li> It needed the moisture a lot, so if your hair has a finer texture or is thick all over, your results may be different than mine.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has slowed it down hair loss substantially.</li>
            <li> in mind everyone has different and weird bodies so not everything works the same for everyone.</li>
            <li> the shampoo may cause them to tangle a little.</li>
            <li> but when I get to the ends it gets a little tangled.</li>
            <li> I waited until it dried to determine if it helped with the irritation.</li>
            <li> For my first time trying a hemp-based product, this wasn&#x27;t too bad at all.</li>
            <li> (the smell was making me sick) with the same shampoo and different conditioner and the smell</li>
            <li> I have very limp hair and bought this.</li>
            <li> I have seen a serious reduction in oil and flakes over the past month.</li>
            <li> I am not balding or at least I don&#x27;t think...</li>
            <li> I hope they stay in business for at least 40 years</li>
            <li> No more ordering!!</li>
            <li> This is just how it worked with my hair, which is a bit coarser and thicker at the root, but thin and brittle towards the ends.</li>
            <li> I have 6 friggin shampoos lined up in the shower, non of them have done anything for my dandruff, some actually make it worst, h&amp;s works</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s bad though</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Good cleansing without harsh chemicals. Have to use more  than other similar shampoos for thorough cleansing.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells nice and gets my hair clean, and does not irritate my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> Cleanses well but needs a conditioner with it.</li>
            <li> Feel like there is some ingredients that don&#x27;t need to be in their a natural product that it claims to be, furthermore even though i like the smell and it makes my hair curl up more, i can immediately feel my scalp loosen its grip on my hair which isn&#x27;t good. I like to have strong rooted hair and even though my hair is abundantly thick, this product seems to make my hair want to shed more than it naturally does. Ive used about 10-12 times, but i wont anymore. The product just wasn&#x27;t satisfactory to me.</li>
            <li> I still have a very itchy scalp . Paying that kind of money for shampoo and conditioner I am disappointed.  Can you suggest something else?</li>
            <li> Good product. It dries my hair a bit but next day it&#x27;s much better. helps creating volume and shine in my hair.</li>
            <li> Really deeps cleans hair and stops itching without all the chemical rinses out without residue I have real ong hair and it works great good price and good shipping will buy again</li>
            <li> A couple of months ago, my once normal hair/scalp became really flaky and oily! I went from being able to wash my hair only 3 times a week to having to wash it every day. Obviously, I was not happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this shampoo based on the good reviews, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed! I have seen a serious reduction in oil and flakes over the past month. My new routine is to rub Head and Shoulders on my scalp, let it sit for a minute or two, rinse, and then lather my scalp and hair with this hemp shampoo. Of course, it&#x27;ll depend on your hair texture, but I am now able to go back to shampooing every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to add that at first, I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of this shampoo. I was struggling to get a good lather going and my hair felt squeaky. However, a week into using it, my hair got used to it and I was pumped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this shampoo if you have oily/flaky hair. It&#x27;s also great that it&#x27;s sulfate free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have color-treated hair, and this shampoo seems to be color-safe.</li>
            <li> smells really good.  However, that is a matter of taste and yours might not reflect mine.  It&#x27;s also really good to your scalp.  I use it daily and I never suffer the dryness I&#x27;ve suffered at the hands of lesser shampoos before I knew what hemp oil was all about.</li>
            <li> I decided to try out this shampoo for my constantly itchy/flaky scalp. I think I might have had mild psoriasis on my scalp my whole life and never really known it. All other shampoos I&#x27;ve used have left me with tons of flaky white residue and burning/itching sensations.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I liked about it was the price. The second thing I liked was the bottle. A little small, but super pretty! ( I&#x27;ll be sure to get the bigger one next time, I have a lot of hair. This was good for test-run.) Third thing I liked, the smell! It smells great, obviously not geared toward a specific gender, it smells clean and refreshing. The shampoo itself is a blueish-green gel, which lathers only a little, which is good because lots of lather means lots of irritating sulfates. It lathers just enough. It rinsed out easily and left my hair and scalp feeling very clean. I didn&#x27;t use any conditioner, and honestly I didn&#x27;t need to! I waited until it dried to determine if it helped with the irritation. Usually I can tell right away if it&#x27;s going to start getting itchy. Low and behold, it dried, and my scalp did not itch! Not only did my scalp feel soothed for the first time in years, my hair is shiny and bouncy and silky-soft! I&#x27;m hooked. Coming back for the bigger bottle when I run out.  Big ups for BcBud!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair squeaky clean and so shiny and soft.  Love it..and appreciate the great service!  I would recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> I am almost done with my first bottle. I purchased this because I was looking for a natural shampoo to help with \\&quot;itchy scalp and hair loss\\&quot; as stated. My hair has been falling out a lot lately and it really annoys me. I am not balding or at least I don&#x27;t think... My hair is long, thick and full but I lose a lot of hair throughout the day and I notice it a lot when I shower. Anyhow, since using this product I haven&#x27;t really notice any improvements on my hair loss but it does clean my scalp very nicely without irritation as I do have sensitive scalp and it has a very pleasant smell that lingers on throughout the day, even after a sweaty workout. What I also like about this Shampoo is that it contains natural ingredients including my favorite, Hemp!!! The only downfall is the cost. It is actually a tiny bottle and probably lasted me 2 months. I will probably reorder whenever I can afford it.</li>
            <li> We discovered that my husband is sensitive to Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS), it&#x27;s a foaming agent. We had changed his toothpaste to an SLS free one, and his painful canker sores completely disappeared, and have stayed away for months! I wondered if SLS in the different dandruff shampoos he had tried was actually making his itchy scalp and dandruff worse. That&#x27;s how I happened upon bcBud. It&#x27;s SLS free, and has a nice clean smell. After several months of use, his dandruff has almost completely gone away! His scalp no longer itches. We highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I should have returned this product since it made my scalp flake more.  It was a total waste of my money.  No more ordering!!</li>
            <li> It did not moisturize my hair like I would have liked, but it worked well for my husband.</li>
            <li> The Shampoo itself is fantastic. I wish the bottle was bigger though.</li>
            <li> my hair is soft and silky after washing it with this shampoo,it also stopped my dandruff.This is the only shampoo i will use from now on</li>
            <li> This is a terrific shampoo. It leaves my hair literally squeaky clean. It has a pleasant scent. Paired with the conditioner, it works wonderfully on my hair. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received the shampoo and conditioner free in exchange for a review. All opinions are my own. I was not required to leave a positive review.</li>
            <li> One of the best shampoos I have ever used!  I have fine hair and it was just perfect. The matching conditioner was equally fabulous!</li>
            <li> Awesome Shampoo, mad my hair smooth, very please</li>
            <li> washes well but i need to follow up w conditioner.</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance, but the shampoo dries out my color treated hair even with use of the conditioner.  And strangely enough, it makes my scalp get crusty.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo....it smells good, has all natural ingredients and has really helped me with my itchy scalp. It makes my hair feel clean and soft but also makes it have some body too. Try it you will like it</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t use it.  when i read hemp and omega blend, i was envisioning something more &#x27;natural&#x27;.  instead i got something that could be industrial &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; like head and shoulders, a strong detergent shampoo.  was looking for natural.  got industrial.</li>
            <li> Smells good! My son is still experiencing a lot of flakes and itch but it is much better than when I use over the counter shampoos.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t enough product and it&#x27;s hard to slather into my long hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff for oily hair! I might actually be able to skip a day washing my hair for the first time ever in my life!</li>
            <li> My son is going through the teenage hormone years and has been having real trouble with oily hair. I purchased this item and several others to try for the issue and this one was by far the best.  He really loves it also. No more oily gross hair for my kid. He goes to school looking normal again. Thank you for your great product it is a real savior.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various shampoo&#x27;s for the oily hair + itchy scalp.  Some didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair, others worked with varying success. I was skeptical about buying this product because it talked about the botanical, natural b.s., and it was one of the cheapest (cheap means they left out something). I am thrilled that I took a chance on this product. My scalp doesn&#x27;t itchy and my head doesn&#x27;t feel like I dipped my head in the oil pan after about 18 hours. Inexpensive (these people must be super honest) + a product that actually does as advertised &#x3D; Great Product with Value.  I hope they stay in business for at least 40 years so I will have a steady supply of this product. If I live to 105, I am all set. Thank you Carapex, keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> I had picked this for my wife. Problem on hair went away like itchiness and scar. Glad I picked this product. Thank you</li>
            <li> Great product and good price.</li>
            <li> I have very limp hair and bought this. My hair is getting thicker. All the other shampoos don&#x27;t even come close. This is the shampoo I will buy from now on.</li>
            <li> I have 6 friggin shampoos lined up in the shower, non of them have done anything for my dandruff, some actually make it worst, h&amp;s works but I get an allergic reaction on my skin from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bcbud has been the best I&#x27;ve had since, ever! It does feel like a very regular shampoo, like what you would find at a hotel. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s bad though, it really feels fresh to my hair, free of heavy chemicals. It has made a small improvement for my dandruff, but I really don&#x27;t think anything will ever eliminate dandruff, after all it&#x27;s simply skin shedding, which is natural. It has helped a lot for the itch and my very oily scalp though! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going back to another shampoo, my hair has a natural brightness to it and simply feels good. I&#x27;m definitely getting the bigger version of this when it runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind everyone has different and weird bodies so not everything works the same for everyone.</li>
            <li> I am currently struggling with hair loss and have yet to find something that really works for me. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week now, but I have noticed that hair that I have is softer and more moisturized and doesn&#x27;t get as greasy as fast like it used to. I definitely reccomend if you are someone that needs a good conditioning shampoo and conditioner but wants to stay natural and not pay the salon price! I will definitely be buying more when I run out! :)</li>
            <li> I received the shampoo and conditioner in the mail last week and was excited to give it a try.  The first day I used the shampoo with the companion conditioner, I walked around for two hours trying to place where a horrible fishy smell was coming from until I realized it was wafting off my own head.  I returned home to rewash my hair (the smell was making me sick) with the same shampoo and different conditioner and the smell went away.  This shampoo seems fine, although I can&#x27;t comment on anything but the smell so far.  Stay far away from the conditioner if you don&#x27;t like the smell of fish.</li>
            <li> So I just got finished using this product in my overly greasy/ dry scalp that has been flaking on me for the last month or so. I inentionally bought this shampoo to get rid of my dandruff, not directly but overtime by restoring the natural balance of my hair. Last thing I wanted to buy was something that directly got rid of the dandruff but I needed to use for the rest of my life, I want it gone completely not to be stuck with a product forever.  I will update with a months use and see if it does work for the intended purpose. As for the upsides, it smells pretty good, I used abou a quarter size of the shampoo for my hair and left in for a few mins rubbing it in. After rinising you can feel your hair being super soft and feeling great. Price to proportion ratio you don&#x27;t get much, but you really don&#x27;t need much in the first place. Overall with no sulfate and no abuse to animals when making, this is a shampoo you should support.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing i had a very dry scalp due to hair loss and other shampoos</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft, full and clean! Although it&#x27;s natural to lose some hair, I was losing lots due to being on the HGC diet. This shampoo has slowed it down hair loss substantially. Love the shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> My hair love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> It is great I am very happy with this shampoo I can go for two days without washing my hair now. Instead of every day. Some times had to wash twice a day depending on what i washed it with the first time. It leaves my hair soft and shinny. Love It</li>
            <li> one of the best out there.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaints, it makes my hair really really clean, and I actually think it&#x27;s filling in thicker!?</li>
            <li> *I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first requested this as a skeptic, because I&#x27;d never used a hemp-based product before. But I wanted to try a different type of product for my hair, which is pretty dry and as of late has been very brittle. I&#x27;ve been hearing good things about hemp so I requested the conditioner but was sent the shampoo by accident. I personally am not the biggest fan of the smell but I will say that the other essential oils that it is made with help with the scent. I tried it once by itself and once with my regular conditioner, and if you have dead ends the shampoo may cause them to tangle a little. That would probably be my primary complaint; I have no problems brushing it at all but when I get to the ends it gets a little tangled. When I used it with my regular conditioner, not only did my conditioner eliminate the smell, but it also helped with the tangling. But anyway, this cleansed my hair down to the roots, which have been feeling a little thicker since I started using it, and in general my hair has started to feel a bit softer than usual. The formula is thick enough for my hair (probably because its short) and it works well with different kinds of conditioners without diminishing its own benefits. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling too stripped after washing with it, the scent doesn&#x27;t last for too long, and I have seen a difference in my hair since I&#x27;ve been using it. For my first time trying a hemp-based product, this wasn&#x27;t too bad at all. I like it. This is just how it worked with my hair, which is a bit coarser and thicker at the root, but thin and brittle towards the ends. It needed the moisture a lot, so if your hair has a finer texture or is thick all over, your results may be different than mine.</li>
