            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>are one-tenth as effective as ROC Resurfacing Disks!  </li>
            <li>and I am getting remarkable results.</li>
            <li>Coming across this product was a happy accident for me - bought them by accident but decided to give them a try and LOVED them.</li>
            <li>What a nice cleanser!</li>
            <li>After using Roc products, I feel now that the price point is excellent, as these products are comparable or BETTER than some department store items I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>so I am thrilled!)  </li>
            <li>Not too drying, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant as well.  </li>
            <li>This is one skin care product i strongly recommend--it is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Plus my Dermatologist who I see every 3 months for precancerous lesions says it is a good product to use.</li>
            <li>This is a good  product for me.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll have a shiny (in a good way) glow when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I have noticed some difference in my face (which I already take good care of) but</li>
            <li>Oh man this stuff is good.</li>
            <li>It gets ALL of my eye makeup off, which can be a good bit.</li>
            <li>My skin type is fair to medium.  </li>
            <li>and she said its good.</li>
            <li>I am cheap and cut them in fourths, which works great!</li>
            <li>I use this product in the morning - it&#x27;s a good way to start the day.</li>
            <li>It is a good night moisturizer and that is how I have used it.  </li>
            <li>would use it again as I found it to be a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>They suds up really good</li>
            <li>The pads (there are 28 of them) are thicker than I was expecting - this is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Often times, the store will be out of this or that, so I like to order a good supply from Amazon</li>
            <li>They smell good, no residue, no peeling, no irritation.</li>
            <li>In my opinion,it&#x27;s as good as ANR.</li>
            <li>So I think this is a good value if you&#x27;re going to try one.</li>
            <li>and you can tell that they do a good job exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45 and looking for products to keep my skin looking good.</li>
            <li>my skin always look good using this.  </li>
            <li>It has been rainy here, so I am trying to be fair, but</li>
            <li>Great combination from Roc that is actually effective . .</li>
            <li>6 weeks for good results</li>
            <li>Either you have good genetics or a good plastic surgeon.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>It may be a good product, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t remove all of my eye makeup but good for my skin.  </li>
            <li>It has been good for my skin, clearing and smoothing some below the surface cystic acne and bumps.</li>
            <li>A toner afterward is good but not required.</li>
            <li>skin feels clean after using and removes make great!  </li>
            <li>They are mild on the skin and delightful to use.</li>
            <li>Love the convenience, the aroma and the great job of sloughing and cleansing my face.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Great product :)</li>
            <li>After 1 week use, I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Roc is very famous in reducing wrinkles.</li>
            <li>love it, works great.  </li>
            <li>This product is great and for the price an even greater investment.</li>

            <li>Love these disks!  </li>
            <li>These are great scrubs pads, however, quite strong.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and do a great job of cleansing the skin.  </li>
            <li>These are amazing resurfacing disks.</li>
            <li>They are amazing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell how well it is doing on preventing break-outs, but the texture of my face feels amazing.</li>
            <li>The smooth side does a great job of removing my eye make-up and the textured side exfoliates the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>AMAZING.</li>
            <li>but the difference in my skin after the pads alone is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Great cleansing, removes all your make up, makes your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>These are amazing.</li>
            <li>My hands are now being resufaced also, and the difference is amazing in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li>leaves a nice feel.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect product that really works.</li>
            <li>Leave a nice sensation  of cleanness.</li>
            <li>I did liked these disks before</li>
            <li>They are magical they work sooo good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had good skin but never have I received so many compliments on my skin as I have since I began using the Roc products.</li>
            <li>They smell absolutely wonderful, they are both gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice.</li>
            <li>The cleansing pads feel nice on the skin of the face.</li>
            <li>A nice cleansing disk.</li>
            <li>Kind of defeats the purpose.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product, the 3 stars are for me not being able to use it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product for a good cleansing disk to use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind</li>
            <li>I just finished using one jar of these disks and although there weren&#x27;t any drastic improvements in my skin, it was still a nice and thorough exfoliator.</li>
            <li>Like ROC it is a good product and most of us like it.  </li>
            <li>Convenient, affordable, effective cleansing pads.  </li>
            <li>I always covered my face but liked the color on my chest.</li>
            <li>They do work really nice without being abrasive.  </li>
            <li>I finished off with another ROC product and together they gave me a really nice, moist, finished results.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product and I really like it and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>I use these pads every day and my face feels and looks so nice.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I have aging skin so in order to get the best results from skin products the top layer needs to be fresh and these do the job.</li>
            <li>These lather up real good and are quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and smell fairly pleasant.</li>
            <li>Beautiful fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The scent smells really good and isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>but I get rashes very easy.</li>
            <li>how excited I am that I found this product or how effective it is!  </li>
            <li>Love, love!</li>
            <li>I am S&amp;S on these items and haven&#x27;t had a delivery for three months, but when I am able to get them I love them!</li>
            <li>This price is even more amazing.</li>
            <li>My face would breakout just wasnt a good fit for my skin</li>
            <li>These pads are perfect, they exfoliate while cleaning, leaving the skin soooo soft and silky.</li>
            <li>The claims are true!!  </li>
            <li>Very fine eye</li>
            <li>Love, love, love these discs!  </li>

            <li>My dermatologist in Canada more than 30 years ago gave me a copy of top skin care products and told me to use ROC as it showed better results than Lancome, Este Lauder and any top brands.  </li>
            <li>I told her I have been using that product for more than 30 years and that I am in my 50&#x27;s.  </li>

            <li>I love roc products, but I can&#x27;t use them exclusively since I still need something to prevent acne.</li>
            <li>this one is somewhat more time consuming to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>I noticed more of a difference in the beginning.</li>
            <li>but I love how well it works and use it every morning in the shower.</li>

            <li>Glad i got it.</li>
            <li>There is more lather and if you&#x27;re using it to remove makeup, I think it gives you a cleaner face after use.&lt;br</li>

            <li>The Roc discs are about $3.00 more than the Aveeno pads.</li>
            <li>Aloha,  I just reached 70 and thought I&#x27;d better start doing something about these \\&quot;freckles\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>

            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite out of all the RoC products I bought.</li>
            <li>Using an exfoliate seems to work better at brightening my skin.</li>
            <li>These changed my skin for the better.</li>
            <li>When I run out I notice a difference immediately--skin is rougher and flakes more without these.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>

            <li>I am so glad I discovered what savings I can get on my Roc products through them.</li>
            <li>I just love the convenience of this product.  </li>
            <li>I did notice the company changed the design of the top.  </li>
            <li>It used to have a &amp;#34;flip top&amp;#34; and now it is just a screw on top.  </li>
            <li>My pores have never been in better condition.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have this on Amazon&#x27;s ship &amp; save to be sure I never run out.</li>
            <li>love these disks!!!!i will continue to use them,</li>
            <li>this well.will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>ROC has been around for many, many years and has been giving me better results than I have ever experienced with any high end beauty product.</li>
            <li>was kind of hoping for a more obvious result of glowing beautiful skin, but i may have been unrealistic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They have a nice clean smell, and they work well as a wash.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to throw out the container, but when I do use them I rinse them completely clean of the cleanser that they come with and use my own.  </li>
            <li>This  product is effective for keeping skin/pores clean.</li>
            <li>Take off more makeup even after you have washed your face and think it is clean!  </li>
            <li>Liked the hint I saw elsewhere to cut them in half -- perfect.  </li>
            <li>At work a co-worker said i looked like i had a good nights sleep and a good facial :)</li>
            <li>After using the discs for nearly a month I am happy to say that I am more than pleased with the results of this product.</li>
            <li>Both are excellent cleansing pads made by Johnson &amp; Johnson with minor differences.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 34 with pretty good skin.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy this product again and with the Subscribe and Save from Amazon, the savings are amazing!!</li>
            <li>Product is easy to use and the results are outstanding.  </li>
            <li>i did face neck top of chest and arms with this product, easy peasy.</li>
            <li>They smell great, lather well and really clear up my skin!</li>
            <li>When I apply a foundation or tinted moisturizer, I am able to get very even coverage and a flawless finish, thanks to the smooth texture of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product smells great and you really feel like you&#x27;re getting your face clean</li>
            <li>Now my skin looks and feels smooth, which makes my make-up look better.</li>
            <li>The pads have a smooth side and a slightly more abrasive side.</li>
            <li>and I was really surprised at how great my face felt afterward...</li>
            <li>I have had better results with a cheap cleanser and a face scrubbing pad that is reuseable.</li>
            <li>Good price and high quality!</li>
            <li>The container holds in the moisture very well which was quite surprising.  </li>
            <li>Works very nicely and leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels very clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This product by ROC is the best I&#x27;ve found out of all the other exfoliating disks, pads, or whatever.  </li>
            <li>The most significant improvement is diminished appearance of lip lines.</li>
            <li>Make my skin feel so clean, and healthy.</li>
            <li>There so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>not so sure of any anti-aging affects, but these are a great scrubbing facial paid.  </li>
            <li>sure get my face clean.</li>
            <li>I love the 2 sided pads, smooth and textured, filled with a beauty cleanser.</li>
            <li>They are scented but it&#x27;s not overpowering and they easily remove any eye make-up I put on.</li>
            <li>All makeup easily removed, rinses easily as well.  </li>
            <li>Its easy to use.</li>
            <li>tell if the item would be great since most of it was outside the jar.</li>
            <li>The packaging was wonderful, but for whatever reason, the container full of pads and liquid was dry as a desert.</li>
            <li>They work great; make my face feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Overall I recommend this product because it is good for cleaning the face and getting off makeup and dirt very easily.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of fine lines yet, I&#x27;m using this as preventative,</li>
            <li>smoother and fine wrinkles on my face start to disappear.</li>
            <li>, they were fine, just not to my liking.  </li>
            <li>my fine lines.</li>
            <li>Excellent, I too cut them in half as I could not afford to use if I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>These are fine.  </li>
            <li>but it ENHANCED fine lines around eyes.</li>
            <li>and you know your decreasing fine lines as well.</li>
            <li>I will have to see how these work for fine lines etc.</li>
            <li>to the result of reducing fine lines and wrinkles, I do not see this product can reduce fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Freshens up my face, removes makeup, leaves a clean nice fragrance, makes my skin look younger and fresher after use with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>In fact, when I broke out from the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Night Cream, using these disks helped to scrub off the dried skin and help my skin to heal more quickly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy I kept my old container because I use that one instead of the new one because I like the flip top much better.</li>
            <li>These resurfacing disks are wonderful for making large pores appear smaller.</li>
            <li>These things are huge.  </li>
            <li>I am a HUGE makeup and skincare addict.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been huge on face wash and never had any issues with pimples</li>
            <li>Daily resurfacing disks are great.  </li>
            <li>but I do still use them here and there to smooth out my skin-especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>It always makes my face feel so creamy smooth</li>
            <li>I bought this as an add on to get free shipping</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling smooth and looking even.</li>
            <li>After about another minute using the smooth side</li>
            <li>My skin is virtually wrinkle free now</li>
            <li>This product removes the roughness of my T-zone area and leaves my pores feel free of whiteheads.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use them every day, but they are great for deep cleansing in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cheap</li>
            <li>She liked them so much she immediately ordered some for herself.  </li>
            <li>They really have a nice skin care line.  </li>
            <li>This is a great every day facial cleanser and scrub.</li>
            <li>There is definitely enough product to use it this way and a great money saving tip.</li>
            <li>I bought this two times it make my face smooth</li>
            <li>Light box.</li>
            <li>I find that they both do the same great things for my skin.</li>
            <li>These discs help to make your skin smooth and have a glow to it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s thing&amp;#34; (like a mask-but this turns to a light foam after I scrub a bit).&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are nice because they are exfoliating on one side (which I use on my whole face and neck area) and softer on the reverse side (which I use around my eye area).  </li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and tingly.</li>
            <li>They use them occasionally for exfoliation with great results.</li>
            <li>now I just started my second week but yesterday and today I was told how great my skin looked...</li>
            <li>It is a good product and will looking to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>So far it has worked good for me.</li>
            <li>Anyway, these disks are kind of huge; I can do my whole face, neck and chest with one.</li>
            <li>These disks are like magic- the way they smooth the surface of my skin and leave a fresh glow...</li>
            <li>I love these, it leaves your face smooth and very clean, I am getting ready to order another jar.  </li>
            <li>Now that I am getting older I have developed a keen appreciation for skin care, and this is one of my top five products I would recommend to anyone who wants to keep their skin looking its best.</li>
            <li>These pads are easy to use and full of sudsy cleaner.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using it, it made my face very smooth.  </li>
            <li>and I feel my face is really clean and smooth after every use.</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean and smooth after using them.  </li>
            <li>that one side is a bit rougher so you can clean deeper with the scrubby side and then flip over to use the smooth side for a softer cleansing.</li>
            <li>I used the smooth side to clean my eyes and it didn&#x27;t make me tear up like</li>
            <li>Skill is totally clean and smooth after each use.</li>
            <li>This producing makes my face feel so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something to do a quick and easy exfoliation - and these do the trick for me.</li>
            <li>At first I really loved these, but now I am noticing that it is really drying my skin out.</li>
            <li>Immediately after the first use, my skin looked noticably better...</li>
            <li>While they definitely left my skin smoother and more polished, they were too drying for me (at 65, would have been perfect in my younger years).  </li>
            <li>The results from using this product have been significant.</li>
            <li>Came across these disks on sale, and fell in love with them after the first use.</li>
            <li>These are great to clean your skin after a long day.</li>
            <li>They really clean my face well and removes all makeup residue.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face tingle and feel really clean.</li>

            <li>it did make my face squeaky, shiny clean.  </li>
            <li>They do as they say, and really clean my face well.</li>
            <li>It smells clean.  </li>
            <li>My face has NEVER felt this clean, not even with dermabrasion and skin vacuuming treatments.  </li>
            <li>My face has NEVER felt this clean, not even with dermabrasion and skin vacuuming treatments.  </li>
            <li>Even takes my eye make-up off clean without leaving  smearing or flaking.  </li>
            <li>They have a mild scrubbing side and a smooth cleansing side.  </li>
            <li>it does clean and my skin feels cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also use a neutrogena exfoliating cream wash, but I actually think this is somewhat more effective.</li>
            <li>It leaves skin feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>and it just makes me clean my face.</li>
            <li>My face felt clean.</li>
            <li>My face feels so refreshed and clean after using one of these.</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel clean and smell clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been on a quest for years, trying to find a cleanser that gets all the oil off and makes my skin feel really clean, without drying it out.</li>
            <li>So, I ordered some from Amazon, cheaper than the drugstore, and with free Super Saver shipping.</li>
            <li>My skin feels wonderfully clean afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These have a wonderfully pleasant scent and make my pores look smaller.  </li>
            <li>The foaming liquid that the disks are soaked in has a pleasant smell and there is plenty in the jar to last until the end.</li>
            <li>I really love this product - first of all, I needed an effective way to clean my skin and remove old cells.</li>
            <li>I find that these disks are very good at exfoliating, and good at removing makeup, but even when followed by a daily moisturizer they can be very drying, creating the same flaky skin that I am trying to avoid.  </li>
            <li>Would still buy them though, because it gives a good, deep clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hard to please, but this product truly makes my skin feel wonderful</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what (if anything) it&#x27;s doing for my pores and skin, but it&#x27;s a nice scrubby facewash at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Was using expensive Estee Lauder, which works great but was noticing fine lines to tried Roc and fine lines are disappearing and much more affordable then Estee Lauder!</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing &amp; looks better, can&#x27;t wait to see what long term use does.</li>
            <li>Yesterday notice her face was more radiant and smooth than normal days.</li>
            <li>The 5 stars are true.</li>
            <li>but I love the product, have noticed a differance all ready, been using three weeks</li>
            <li>I found this product to be really helpful in removing my blackheads, much more helpful than AHA-exfoliators.</li>
            <li>I loved these disks; it makes my facial cleaning routine a snap.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and then on the top of my hands and then around the nails, where I get really scaly and dirty---its great--once done I can oil my hands and nails</li>
            <li>My mum said she read Singapore news articles on Roc prdt where a commentary came from a local dotor was good.</li>
            <li>Sweet.</li>
            <li>Paid too much for this product for it to not to perform better.</li>
            <li>Although, I don&#x27;t know if that will be true for everybody.  </li>
            <li>My face feels super clean,</li>
            <li>I like the fact that there is so much product on each pad as I am able to scrub my arms and legs as well with just one pad.  </li>
            <li>now they are looking younger between this and a good hand cream.  </li>
            <li>by the time I rinse, I feel I have gotten the full</li>
            <li>The solution they&#x27;re soaked in is soothing and cool</li>
            <li>Even my husband noticed how much tighter and better by skin looked (and he didn&#x27;t even know I was using this product).  </li>
            <li>This product exfoliates nicely and gently, completely eradicates my chin problem and is fading my sun spot.</li>
            <li>Actually, can be used on most parts of the body which can be easily reached!  </li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of this particular product and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>i cant say that it has help much in the aging area but sure happy that it helps with the other</li>
            <li>My skins feels completely smooth and clean after using these, but they&#x27;re very gentle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these, I am buying more right now!</li>
            <li>My face was a little pink/red where I was more aggressive - so these can really do a good job of exfoliating.</li>
            <li>Just starting using this it is very gentle, yet effective!</li>
            <li>Super products.  </li>
            <li>They are gentle, yet they provide as much manual exfoliation as you could ever need on any kind of semi-regular basis.  </li>
            <li>I generally have pretty good skin although sun damaged from living in So.</li>
            <li>I like best: this RoC Daily resurfacing disks and the Shiseido ultimate cleansing oil.  </li>
            <li>It went away quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SUGGESTION:  These pads are dense and create a tremendous amount of cleanser in each pad</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling smooth with a nice glow to it.</li>
            <li>I ordered, and they were delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Lucky me, I found RoC products and this</li>
            <li>must caution those who are sensitive to fragrance that this product is very strongly scented.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>this product is so complete that it makes it very easy to use</li>
            <li>The best part is that they are HALF of what they would normally cost at the supermarket or drug store.</li>
            <li>I have reordered these discs several times and continue to be very pleased.  </li>
            <li>The so-called &amp;#34;rough side&amp;#34; to me is actually pretty smooth</li>
            <li>I used the smooth side first, then used the textured side for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>My pores appeared smaller and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I have been very satisfied, and have repurchased for the entire 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too soon to tell the longterm effects of this product however it makes my skin feel super clean and soft :)</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling soft, clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I had never tried this and really like how clean and smooth it leaves my skin</li>
            <li>They really do leave your face feeling smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>It was a great suggestion by another reviewer to cut these in half.  </li>
            <li>There are easy to pop into a plastic baggy if you are traveling to circumvent the whole liquid issue with security.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love these little disks!  </li>
            <li>hope this helps because I am very thankful to all the 5 stars that helped me choose this product.&lt;br /&gt;Happy cleansing!!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get enough of these disks, I have to use once a week because my teenagers have found them they also love them!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second container and love these discs!  </li>
            <li>Really like it and will reorder it again!!</li>
            <li>Amazon offers it at a better price and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>I liked the previous version of these disks better.</li>
            <li>Fine lines have really faded away.</li>
            <li>Works fine and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>These RoC Daily Discs are awesome for erasing those fine little lines that have started to appear.  </li>
            <li>The product did not remove all the flaws, but certainly did smooth out my  skin.  </li>
            <li>If used in the right frequency (I&#x27;d say no more than twice a week is all most women should need if you moisturize your skin properly in the morning and evenings), this product is PERFECT.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I did try these little gems.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this everyday for 3 years now and I am extremely happy.</li>
            <li>The disks are huge and very foamy.  </li>
            <li>Also, the pads are HUGE and unless you have a face the size of Shrek, you&#x27;d be throwing your money away by using a whole one.</li>
            <li>I like the exfoliating side of these a lot; not too harsh but still does a great job.</li>
            <li>sound like too much?</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference in my skin, but I do really like these disks.</li>
            <li>Soft and Slightly more textured side for exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>I have philosophy&#x27;s microdermabrasion kit, and honestly I rather use RoC&#x27;s disks because of the ease and similar outcome.</li>
            <li>but it is worth.</li>
            <li>They help to exfoliate the skin on my face and keep it fresh looking.  </li>
            <li>They are worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I actually use this product on my legs and it effectively prevents ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>Worth the try.</li>
            <li>but it could be that my skin is more sensitive than others.</li>
            <li>It says visible results after consistent use for a week, which is true, but I could FEEL the results after just one use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i found that the pads can be cut into 1/4&#x27;s in order to have it last longer yet still be effective.</li>
            <li>My face looked fresh.</li>
            <li>soft some of the pads are not foaming more liquid</li>
            <li>I am 48 yrs old and most people think I am about 35.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see much of a difference in my skin (if any), but I do love the feel of cleanliness</li>
            <li>After a week my face looked a lot better and had not been this soft...</li>
            <li>Best resurfacing product out there.&lt;br /&gt;Results instantly, smoother skin, more refined and less wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>These disks leave my skin feeling smooth, clean and have actually helped with some of the fine lines in my face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle; has a great smell and works well with my other 2 RoC products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used products 8x the price with a less successful outcome.  </li>
            <li>Tell the so called older folks that Roc diminishes wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>It has made a remarkable improvement in my skin tone, and I no longer have to deal with black heads on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>Not so rough that it peels your face but leaves the skin nice and clean.</li>
            <li>These ROC resurfacing disks are not as rough on skin as a scrub, but still get your face nice and clean</li>
            <li>Easily removes makeup and will be easy to travel with by putting a couple in a zip lock bag and won&#x27;t have to take a big jar along.  </li>
            <li>There are many products that are cruelty free, We just have to be aware and search them out and if enough people voice this maybe the companies who choose to do this will listen.</li>
            <li>Definitely must use with a good moisturizer but generally speaking, a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>I have had good luck with a lot of other things from Amazon before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they seemed so good especially since ROC products are highly recommended.</li>
            <li>These are great at cleaning my face but left my skin overly dry the following day, not so good.</li>
            <li>right over the sink because it drips alot</li>
            <li>I mistakenly swiped my right eye with the exfoliating side and although I realized it right away</li>
            <li>For the right price, I would continue to buy them.</li>
            <li>The price is right, they WORK.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t doing right, because I just kept looking crappier and crappier, and then I remembered these.</li>
            <li>As time goes by, I do not see the radiance on my skin and do not feel the tightness anymore right after using this product every night.  </li>
            <li>Gets my face clean, the pads are really convenient.  </li>
            <li>I have large pores and my skin is very sensitive to most products that I have tried to use.  </li>
            <li>brought these with me on a trip recently and was helpful because I didn&#x27;t have to have to wash my hands first-nor did it take up much space.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely needed to use a cream afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Not &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34; but a good staple for certain times.&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>These make my skin super soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job on dry skin -- it looks as soft as it feels.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my face once every few days, but my great discovery is that it works so well on my hands, which have taken a beating since I am a potter by profession, gardener by choice and a horse rider for sheer love of it.</li>
            <li>They also produce way more foam than I expected, so you definitely need a good rinse afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any discoloration and have pretty good skin due to staying away from the sun and being a non-smoker.</li>
            <li>this product does a fine job of cleaning-I&#x27;m not seeing any remarkable results with &amp;#34;resurfacing&amp;#34; as I have with outher products from my dermatoligist.&lt;br /&gt;The size of the disks are over sized in my opinion, so I cut them in half- which makes the product last twice as long and a fair value.</li>
            <li>The ROC resurfacing disks come nicely packaged in a sealed plastic jar and are surprisingly large for a facial pad.</li>
            <li>pores are smaller and this product is so easy to use!</li>
            <li>These discs are effective without being harsh, they are convenient to use and I am so happy with the results, I will continue to use the product and other Roc products in tandem.</li>
            <li>I loved the way it felt and it left my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I rinse my face with warm water then pat dry with a bath towel.  </li>
            <li>1 1\2 week use of the pad resulted in a really noticeable difference in dark lines/wrinkles on my neck-- a nice surprise!</li>
            <li>Easy on my sensitive skin as well.  </li>
            <li>These are absolutely amazing for gently removing the makeup that inevitably gets into your pores.</li>
            <li>The flip top design of the canister keep the pads moist so never dry out.</li>
            <li>Love that one side has a bit more texture to help lift dead skin cells and prepare skin for night treatment.  </li>
            <li>you think you&#x27;re getting a great facial scrub, but it&#x27;s actually resurfacing!</li>
            <li>I have cut these in half, they are a good size.....</li>
            <li>Getting the skin back to youthful is pricey, upkeep is also an investment so being able to purchase the RoC Resurfacing Discs thru Amazon has been worth it.</li>
            <li>They make your skin feel amazing, I use them couple times a week, made a big difference, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>After the first few days, my skin looked amazing!</li>
            <li>Make your face smoother, look up younger, After use, your skin is smooth and soft,Wrinkle really disappear.&lt;br /&gt;Daily Resurfacing Disks and Deep Wrinkle Night Cream.it has a pleasant scent,&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to tingle a bit but not too much!</li>
            <li>The product gives you a nice clean face without making your face feel tight.  </li>
            <li>- I cut the disks in half because it will extend your product twice as long and this way works excellent for me.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>They are wonderful with a rough side for exfoliating and a smooth side for extra facial cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I like Roc products very much, although this is not one that I will not re-purchase.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the product very much.</li>
            <li>Very gentle without a lot of perfume.  </li>
            <li>These really clean well and even with a clean face, you&#x27;d be surprised at how much dirt these will pull off..</li>
            <li>I can use they every day and my sensitive skin is fine with it as well.</li>
            <li>I am a 38 year old woman with some fine lines and hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 53 year old woman with combination dry/ somewhat oily T-zone skin, rosacea, fine wrinkles skin.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine as far as cleaning the face.</li>
            <li>I was looking at the other ROC products because I loved that one so much and stumbled on these Resurfacing Disks.</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong, like all RoC products I have tried, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to linger too long after rinsing.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for allowing reviews.. its very helpful!!</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh, clean, and soft after each use.</li>
            <li>Terrific quick and easy way to cleanse and exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Item shipped very fast and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price for a product that does so much!</li>
            <li>This is the first ROC product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>but once I get into a rhythem of using them regularly - I do see improvement :)</li>
            <li>Love these face daily resurfacing disks.</li>
            <li>pads are 2 side useable and the are more than enough..</li>
            <li>My skin really feels ever so much softer and my pores look tiny after...very nice product.</li>
            <li>I love these facial cleaning discs.</li>
            <li>I remove my makeup first and then use the disk....</li>
            <li>This is not my first order.  </li>
            <li>I love this facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more simple!</li>
            <li>I want to look younger everywhere. :)</li>
            <li>First I wash my face with the pad</li>
            <li>so now you have to unscrew the lid to get pads instead of just popping the top open.</li>
            <li>Many people cut their pads in two, I actually do in 4&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>What I noticed first was the improved texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>I have never used ROC products so this is my first (age 48).  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;These disks do a pretty good job in removing makeup and dead skin.</li>
            <li>-- so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Purchased these for the first time.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than is ever EVER has -- when I use them regularly.</li>
            <li>This is my first time ever writing a review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the changes will become more obvious with regular use.  </li>
            <li>As you probably know, you could spend a lot more money on products making similar claims.  </li>
            <li>I have used these off and on for years but now that I&#x27;m getting close to 40 and seeing wrinkles more pronounced, I decided to start using them again regularly.  </li>
            <li>just okay, no big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says: resurfaces.  </li>
            <li>Noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>Results are immediate after first use...</li>
            <li>I feel like it really exfoliates and cleans my skin!</li>
            <li>will DEFINITELY repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;i also love RoC&#x27;s retinol serum</li>
            <li>4/06- 4/13 after just the first use</li>
            <li>Most likely, I will purchase again because the price is within reason and not expensive.</li>
            <li>I throw a few in a baggie, seal it up, and I&#x27;m good to go for a weekend of travel,</li>
            <li>I had heard good things about this product, but it was too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li>Skin feels clean and still soft !</li>
            <li>The exfoliating disks feel like they really remove old skin and leave you feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>This product leaves your skin SUPER soft, no dry patches, no break outs, and no redness (like so many products).  </li>
            <li>Great purchase for exfoliating and not too harsh for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But I did feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li>soft and clean keep using i</li>
            <li>One disk is plenty to clean your face and neck, and I liked the fact that it&#x27;s double side lets you choose between a deep scrub or a gentle cleanse.</li>
            <li>I love them so much, that I hide them from my teenage daughters.</li>
            <li>It cleans off all my makeup, and the softer side is gentle enough for the eye area, and I love the exfoliating side.</li>
            <li>I do love them too; I noticed a difference in my skin tone very soon after starting to use them.</li>
            <li>Good price for something you can use every day and have last the entire month and then some.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say how much I like or dislike this product; that&#x27;s because I rarely use it since I cannot handle the smell.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be the only product that keeps my face clean!</li>
            <li>As others have suggested, please cut them in half to save more!</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels very smooth but not too dry after I use this.</li>
            <li>The cleanser the disks are soaked in is mild enough to remove eye makeup when using the soft side of the disc, but it gets my face super clean.</li>
            <li>After two months it was amazing to me how the bumps diminished, the dark spots and lines also lightened and lessened.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product religiously--it really does make a difference with consistent use-and the accompanying moisture/night creams.</li>
            <li>One side is smooth and the other has the smallest bumps on it, although both sides feel smooth</li>
            <li>tried thirds at first and still had too much.</li>
            <li>They really \\&quot;suds up\\&quot; - even without wetting your skin first.</li>
            <li>I usually am soooo into organic ingredients for my skin and body but with these I don&#x27;t even care what is in them because the results of my face are sooo good.</li>
            <li>My skin is on the oily side; my skin gets congested and my pores get huge very easily.. which leads to dull skin, and breakouts.</li>
            <li>instructions are to first wet your face, then wipe product over face, then rinse, which is two steps more than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>Easy remedy when I remember is to slather on lip balm prior to using the RoC disks to create a barrier.</li>
            <li>My face feels super soft after using these</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will be easy enough.</li>
            <li>Consider adding the Deep Wrinkle Serum in an easy to use pump bottle that helps prevent contamination of the product.</li>
            <li>It really scrubs , feels well and leaves the face really looking clean and clear.</li>
            <li>They are large, not too abrasive and no offensive odor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to use smart products like these as a preventative method.</li>
            <li>Plus, I have sunspots from years of never using sunscreen, lots of wrinkles, and large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li>Most of the time, I end up with red splotches and flaky skin when I try something new.  </li>
            <li>The jar seal was opened and the screwed on top was loose.  </li>
            <li>These pads do a great job, I cut them in half and they last longer.  </li>
            <li>Rinse and dry to use as a quick way to clean and polish the sink or soak up spills . . .</li>
            <li>my skin looks nice and tight after</li>
            <li>No irritability, no red blotchies, and those breakouts that always seemed inevitable no matter how healthy I ate, have disappeared!  </li>
            <li>This product evens out skin tone, helps with fine wrinkles, smooths and IS actually resurfacing my face.</li>
            <li>They soap up very foamy and the pads are quite large.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d always wanted to try Roc products, however, I wasn&#x27;t willing to gamble what I considered a high price for a drug store product.</li>
            <li>Very good but too expensive and the container is too bulky if you want to take them with you when you travel.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel very soft and yound, and the cost is great compared to other products that promise the same results.  </li>
            <li>It was great this time, it seems the last ones were all dried out...</li>
            <li>I can see a huge difference, my skin looks brighter and younger.</li>
            <li>I bought it at the beginning of pregnancy when my face was very oily</li>
            <li>I enjoy the convenience and quality of these Roc facial scrub pads.</li>
            <li>and really I would say have taken years off my skin.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this from the clearance section of my local store and so honestly didn&#x27;t expect much, though with the RoC name, took a gamble.  </li>
            <li>Within one week and can see a difference in my skin and my girlfriend says a look much</li>
            <li>My skin feels much smoother after using them and non greasy.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed I didn&#x27;t need to use as much.  </li>
            <li>My skin is fair, and sensitive and I found that this was gentle enough for daily use.  </li>
            <li>I found these about two years ago and highly recommend these to anyone!</li>
            <li>I figured it really was doing the job.</li>
            <li>Seems like a good value compared to similar products, but a soapy wash cloth could probably do the same thing with far fewer chemicals and a much lower cost.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, my skin feels NORMAL.  </li>
            <li>Is Gentle</li>
            <li>MUCH.  </li>
            <li>For skin care and repair products it really helps when a reviewer includes their age.</li>
            <li>but I use one after a workout and it gets all the sweat off my face and can tell it really cleans out your pores well.</li>
            <li>Too much juice in these.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine using a whole one because they are loaded with liquid.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this product for about 3 weeks, but my face is brighter and feels smooth.</li>
            <li>My pre teens were not remembering to wash their faces real well and started to break out.  </li>
            <li>Ladies don&#x27;t forget to take care of your hands because they can give away your age just as much as your face.</li>
            <li>This stuff really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>There was so much stuff on them, I found myself wringing them out before using.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted something that I wouldn&#x27;t have to rinse off afterward.</li>
            <li>Hearing so much about Roc, I decided to give my mum a try.</li>
            <li>I like that the cream is fast absorbing and doesn&#x27;t stay greasy on the skin for too long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started seeing real results within a couple of weeks, and after 6 weeks there really was a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>so they are ready to go.</li>
            <li>You shouldn&#x27;t have to use much pressure at all.</li>
            <li>It is very sudsy</li>
            <li>Used the exfoliating side for entire face and smooth side for eye area as recommended.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating side is not so gentle</li>
            <li>Thanks RoC..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you have alot of spots you want removed but be patient!</li>
            <li>I have switched over to Aveeno as it seems to be much nicer to my skin.</li>
            <li>Absolutely will not be without these ... ever.</li>
            <li>A recent convert to ROC products (who can beat the results with a fantastic price?)</li>
            <li>ONE week back on, I look fantastic again.</li>
            <li>The pads are ready to use on the face and after I finish &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; i just wash them and use them to get the soap of my skin.</li>
            <li>The eye side is gentle.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how much it really foams.</li>
            <li>It really works you see it working in a week</li>
            <li>well spent I love it</li>
            <li>I like the way the jar opens with a flip top lid to avoid fumbling around with wet hands.  </li>
            <li>The thing that really amazes me is how much lather it has in just one disc.</li>
            <li>I wish I had a whole barrel of this stuff.</li>
            <li>After two weeks of using these disks I found that my skin really improved.  </li>
            <li>After using the whole jar</li>
            <li>These really feel like they help your skin renew.</li>
            <li>This really makes your skin shine through.</li>
            <li>The pads provide a gentle deeper cleanse that makes my skin feel rejuvenated and ready to soak up some of RoC&#x27;s anti age moisturizers.</li>
            <li>My skin is chronically under-moisturized and produces a lot of oil, but tolerates chemicals and exfoliation very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way my skin feels after using the discs.</li>
            <li>I am stuck with a whole regimen of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Always</li>
            <li>After using it, I feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>quality is that I can wipe my face with it before a shower or while getting ready for bed....and let it &amp;#34;do</li>
            <li>I much prefer containers of this type and the tubes for the Retinol Day and Night cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m 68 and use Neutrogena foam cleanser, Cucumber and Pomegranate peel masks by Freeman, Smoothies (between the eyes), and Simple soothing eye balm (all available with Amazon prime).</li>
            <li>very absorbent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I&#x27;m really digging this product.</li>
            <li>but this product seems to really work.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t know how much I missed it.  </li>
            <li>A whole pad seems like overkill anyway.  </li>
            <li>One is just too much.  </li>
            <li>works very well</li>
            <li>but I decided to use continue( I am very regret now).</li>
            <li>, so they have been a better value for me than expected.</li>
            <li>My skin is really noticing the difference in not using one every day.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I can really see a reduction in my pore size.  </li>
            <li>This is my third jar and last weekend one of my sisters told me how refreshed, clear and good my face looked.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many facial wash products and so far I find 2</li>
            <li>my 35+ year old skin definitely looks better.</li>
            <li>But they are definitely good for the skin or at least for how it looks.</li>
            <li>I am 49 and had been using a similar cleansing product (Aveeno) and liked it, but the last time I ran out of them, I decided to try the ROC Resurfacing Disks for a change.</li>
            <li>They are thick and smell good, but I wont be purchasing them again.</li>
            <li>It did nothing special other than clean my face.</li>
            <li>other reviewer said, I cut these in half as they are plenty big enough to do so without sacrificing any cleaning :)  and DUDE, my skin already looks better!!!  </li>
            <li>, has a soapy scent that dissipates quickly, I prefer to use products that are as organic and natural as possible, but I am willing to trade that in for success.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice rosy glow to my normally pale face.  </li>
            <li>The key words to attract so called older folks: diminshes fine lines &amp; wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I did not buy this product on Amazon, however I always read the reviews here first before trying new products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not goin&#x27; down easy!</li>
            <li>Really like them and they clean very well, but I never noticed a change in my skin or its actual appearance in any way.  </li>
            <li>Clean my face  very well and at the same time moisturize my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d bet money that there are a lot of other products out there that cost 10 times more but</li>
            <li>&#x27;ll no more as I use it more!</li>
            <li>I stopped using those when I started with ROC because I thought using so many high chemical products would be too rough on my skin.</li>
            <li>Each pad keeps getting  more and more wet as I work my way down the neatly stacked pile of pads inside.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and the price is a steal when you consider the dramatic results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 34 &amp; \\&quot;had\\&quot; very flaky dry skin with fine lines.</li>
            <li>This product made my skin tighten and it feels like its working, I will update after a few more months of continuous use, it is the first ROC product I have tried</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s plenty to clean your face/neck and will double the value!</li>
            <li>Overall, I would still recommend this product as it can gently clean and exfoliate my face as well as can improve my skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to notice any difference between the two products, however, RoC does not merely deep clean the skin, it truly does &#x27;resurface.&#x27;</li>
            <li>They are large, I cut them in half to get more days out of them.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be a little dry; these disks are GREAT for cleansing and softening my skin.  </li>
            <li>use this along with a whole line of day &amp; night care and highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product really works.</li>
            <li>My intention when I bought this was for a quick face wash, but I find myself massaging my face for much longer than necessary because I know my cheeks will be rosy</li>
            <li>I have not used a lot of facial cleansers and this one is so easy and leaves your face feeling soft.</li>
            <li>My face is clear and super soft.</li>
            <li>These are amazing little disks, one side soft the other a more loofa.</li>
            <li>The list of chemicals in the ingredients seemed really long and didn&#x27;t sound like any items</li>
            <li>Sloughing off all those dead skin cells as really improved the overall appearance and my skin looks renewed and bright.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I put a regime on my face to get rid of dark spots and read about this product and thought about trying it.</li>
            <li>These pads are BIG and full of product.  </li>
            <li>I use the entire disk not only on my face, but there is more than enough rich lather to also do my arms and throat/chest area.  </li>
            <li>First used the soft side for cleansing.</li>
            <li>I have used one full package and just purchased my second.</li>
            <li>There is plenty of cleanser in the container and (again as per another reviewer&#x27;s suggestion) I position the container upside down to keep the top discs well hydrated.</li>
            <li>I love these little pads, My skin seems to like them just as much as i do.  </li>
            <li>They really help remove dry, dull unwanted skin and leave a nice smooth texture that is blemish-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As another reviewer said, you can cut these in half to get more usage from the package.</li>
            <li>and you can get more use by just using half of one.</li>
            <li>My pores have started to become less prominent.</li>
            <li>sure makes ya think you can wake up w one less defined wrinkle.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels and looks, and I notice my pores definitely look smaller.  </li>
            <li>I have used RoC products before, but not this particular one.  </li>
            <li>My skin clears up quickly with regular use.</li>
            <li>in all a decent product.</li>
            <li>I am able to use one disc for my entire face,neck and chest and STILL have plenty of lather left over.</li>
            <li>I plan on keeping this as my main cleanser from now on.</li>
            <li>I enjoy Roc Resurfacing discs AND Aveeno Clear Complexion Daily Cleansing Pads.</li>
            <li>I just purchased more and will likely go on to have it delivered regularly for an additional discount.  </li>
            <li>I use only one in the am and use a mild cleanser in the evening.</li>
            <li>Left my face feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>So far great, I can really feel my face smoorther and my dark spots are diminishing (of course with help of other products)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend anyone who has a  oily t-zone problem to try this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I believe that the 2 products are HIGHLY similiar in content</li>
            <li>and I look like a high school kid with acne.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and it gives a deep clean.</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazingly soft and clean, and with the Retinol, I feel that I&#x27;m cleansing and treating at the same time.</li>
            <li>Drying results - causes my skin to be a tad too dry - which I remedy with a rich moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I plan to order more and also check out the other ROC products!!  </li>
            <li>These really make your face feel soft after using them.</li>
            <li>Daily exfoliation is important for my skin type, but the product has to be gentle enough.</li>
            <li>I use these normally as part of my nightly ritual</li>
            <li>but I Can not enjoy the benefits knowing that  innocent animals may be subjected to tests and locked in a cage.  </li>
            <li>It actually seems to do what it advertises to do, which when it comes to skin care is rare for me.</li>
            <li>and It is much better then the harsh soap.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suffer breakouts, don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles and its the normal amount of oily.</li>
            <li>No hard scrubbing is needed.</li>
            <li>so I actually cut the pad in half and extended the jar usage with just as effective cleansing results.  </li>
            <li>I have using these disks for a short time and i have seen an improvement in my face especially on the dark blotches on my face.the disks are clearing and cleaning up the problem,also the fine lines around the jaw are improving and after using one my face feels so refreshing and soft.</li>
            <li>For example, on my legs right above my knees..</li>
            <li>I liked these, made your face and neck feel really clean, have a delicate and a rough surface, just splash water to the area and use.</li>
            <li>Each 4th of a circle is just enough to clean my whole face (a 3rd would be easier, but I&#x27;m thrifty like that)</li>
            <li>Before ordering I read another reviewers suggestion to cut the pads in half to save some $$, and she was right--the pads are big for a single use--half the pad works great.  </li>
            <li>The pads are very large and actually I cut them in half (which is more than enough to clean your entire face/neck).  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t spend the $10 drugstore asking price, but the amazon price of $6.95 is manageable, especially since I found a way to get two uses from each of the very large pads.</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing the product at Target and they seem to have discontinued it, which is actually the main reason I was shopping there in the first place.  </li>
            <li>Even after 28 days of daily usage, my face would tingle for the first few seconds of the disks touching my face</li>
            <li>These discs were easy and left my face clean but after a few days a fine rash developed betweeen my eyebrows then down my nose as I continued to use.  </li>
            <li>Went to a new Doctor, on 29 Nov. 2012.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started to use every three days and in three days I have a new pimple forming.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that you&#x27;d ever be able to get the right ratio of liquid back in by adding water.</li>
            <li>The lid screws on, but also has a lift-up tab to use more easily, especially when your eyes are closed after splashing your face before you use one.</li>
            <li>disk has a rough side and smooth side, so if you have sensitive skin you can still use these to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>The pads leave my face feeling amazingly smooth and soft, although they are somewhat abrasive on my dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I like to physically exfoliate the dead stuff off and these are nice.  </li>
            <li>But I also have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My face is very soft after using.  </li>
            <li>My skin can be very sensitive to products</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I do not have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I thought the procuct was ok, but it didnt really do anything different for my skin or complection than just a little squirt of body wash on a cloth does.</li>
            <li>The first time I was really scared because my skin is so dry anyway</li>
            <li>I was 65 years old!  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Like many of the other reviewers, my pores seem smaller, skin texture is waaay smoother and the even-ness of my skin tone looks like I did when I was in my teens</li>
            <li>and it is still more than big enough to cleanse the entire face</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I like the soft side better and only use the rough side of the disks on my nose.</li>
            <li>Okay, not sure I&#x27;d reorder.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love it, and I will be reordering this regularly!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>My 14 year old!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I was feeling some real rough areas on my forehead, now it is smooth again and supple.</li>
            <li>My skin has recently gone through a lot of changes recently, and I needed a product that would clean well, exfolliate and reduce the appearance of my pores.  </li>
            <li>So, I dropped my usage down to twice a week, and my skin stays exfoliated and smooth.</li>
            <li>My face looks much more clear and I feel less self conscience when I go bare faced to my workout class at 6 A.M.</li>
            <li>I made numerous changes to my diet recently (which made the most significant changes/improvements in my skin above anything esle), so I&#x27;m not sure how much the Roc Disks have helped, but I like them.  </li>
            <li>Huge disks which I cut in half when I use it.</li>
            <li>My hands are subject to hot water on a daily basis and were most definitely showing their age...</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the results -- I&#x27;ve had not-so-good skin over the years -- but this product, along with the day and nighttime moisturizers, has made the ongoing difference that I had paid megabucks for in the past, through facials and peels that only brought temporary results.</li>
            <li>but this was true only for my facial area skin.</li>
            <li>Not great for sensitive skin, but still a good product in general.</li>
            <li>Skin looks better and pores a slight bit smaller after use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The solution lightly foams and I can see the slight discoloration on the disc surface indicating old cells being sloughed off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and tight.  </li>
            <li>:  Strong scent (surprisingly fragrant) - I was concerned at first because I have sensitive skin however, I have not had bad experience due to scent.  </li>
            <li>They are large enough that can used for the body.</li>
            <li>As others have said, the disks are large and can be cut in two if you want to save $$$ and do only your face.  </li>
            <li>just worded differently to get certain people to buy them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it a little more time and if anything changes I will be back to write another review.</li>
            <li>Very high quality, low costing beauty routine.</li>
            <li>My skin was always so dull; however, cleansing with the RoC disk makes my wrinkled old skin look more refreshed.</li>
            <li>Pores on my face that been open for years (I kid you not) were closed and my skin was smooth.</li>
            <li>The product is clear.</li>
            <li>I was about to buy it, but I searched the ingredients and this has the chemical paraben that is clearly linked to breast cancer and impotence in men.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 years old, have used for about a year, and will use for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>I am almost 40yrs old.</li>
            <li>I have so far used this product for three weeks at about twice a week.</li>
            <li>I never use the rougher side because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using ROC products since early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now 54 years old and most people think I am still in my late 20&#x27;s or early 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Young men hit on me thinking I&#x27;m about their age.  </li>
            <li>Once, I was buying Roc in Walgreens and this young lady cannot make up her mind which product to use.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>These made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin as well and never have a problem with this product.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I have lately developed the habit of carrying over all of my face routines to my hands as well.</li>
            <li>Noticed NO drying so far.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my mum, who is now 72 years old.</li>
            <li>My face is baby-smooth at 60 years old.  </li>
            <li>My skin is to sensitive for this, but I could feel and see a difference.</li>
            <li>Each pad has alot of lather but the lather is soft.</li>
            <li>If used daily, this product is very drying to your skin.  </li>
            <li>I used the pads twice a day, using one pad both times (kept it in fridge 1during the day to save $ and not wasted the product).</li>
            <li>I have been using these for nearly a month and my skin is already transformed.</li>
            <li>I am a 53 year old women.</li>
            <li>so I cut them in 1/2 because they are really too big.  </li>
            <li>However, my skin is too sensitive for it.</li>
            <li>My skin is very acne prone, and this actually is helping to prevent break outs.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This has really worked to make me feel like I have younger looking skin</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>51 yrs young</li>
            <li>and I was completely out.  </li>
            <li>So far, I have found this product to be helping my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I use it every so often (not everyday)</li>
            <li>That way the jar lasts twice as long and you really get a bang for your buck!</li>
            <li>It has helped me smooth out my skin in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Once I complete my face</li>
            <li>I choose not to use near my eyes.</li>
            <li>pads do a reasonable job of keeping my acne at bay, but not as well as a product specifically designed to do so, like the Clearasil daily acne treatment pads.</li>
            <li>have also noticed that my skin has a smoother surface and has been effectively absorbing my facial products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried glycolic acid peels, philosophy &amp; Peter Thomas Roth products and these RoC products are by far my favorites.</li>
            <li>I am 35yrs old and have had expression lines for about 5yrs now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in early thirties, with sensitive skin prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>Thus, I need to exfoliate frequently.</li>
            <li>After using my skin is clear and soft.</li>
            <li>I also dont know if enough moisture is left in container to keep product useful.  </li>
            <li>Each thick pad is thoroughly saturated with cleanser, they foam up nicely, and the soft side is gentle enough to use to remove mascara and eye make-up, while the textured side invigorates and refreshes like a mini facial.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a few dry patches, so I use a very strong moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>The other days I can cleanse with regular old Neutrogena Oil free acne wash or whatever I&#x27;m into at the moment.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need a deep scrub, the other side of the disk is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>They are just enough to slough off delicately and give me a fresh clean feeling face.</li>
            <li>I love the two sides of the disk for my combination skin, and even the scent is clean and fresh without being annoying.  </li>
            <li>when I want to get a little deeper clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Have only been using these for a week so far in conjunction with a whole new facial regimen.</li>
            <li>My skin stays very smooth and firm ALL DAY LONG!</li>
            <li>Just be sure to keep the lid on tight so that they don&#x27;t dry out...</li>
            <li>But I love the packaging and it closes tight and doesn&#x27;t dry out the pads.</li>
            <li>I tried cutting these in half as some other reviewers suggested, but I really think it&#x27;s best to use a whole one.  </li>
            <li>After about a week, my skin was smooth and soft and I feel like it looks younger and less damaged.</li>
            <li>Not sure if they help fine lines or not</li>
            <li>Many products on the market that a way less expensive and do a better job.</li>
            <li>and I am not sure that it has did anything to my fine lines, however it I do like to use it</li>
            <li>I wear very little makeup, and my skin still looks smooth.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth, significantly less congested, and my pores look much smaller.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never had anything more than a slight pink to my skin after washing.  </li>
            <li>I spend 20 minutes or less a day and the results have been better than expected.</li>
            <li>My daughter used half the jar, so I really didn&#x27;t get the chance to see if it really worked on wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>normally buy my Roc Resurfacing Disks from either Walgreens, or Rite Aid, and only on sale.</li>
            <li>I guess I expected a little more than an face scrub pad can do.</li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY dry skin, and in my mid 40s extremely dry skin &#x3D; lots of fine lines and crepe like skin, yuck.</li>
            <li>They are quite large, more than I need for my face, so by cutting them and doubling the count, I think they are a decent value.  </li>
            <li>I cut them in half and there is plenty of soap/suds to clean my face daily.</li>
            <li>As a former costmetic consultant I can assure you a repair product works very differently on a 28 yr old than a 57 yr old.</li>
            <li>19yr old male, black oily face with mild acne scarring.</li>
            <li>I really think that the differences are psychological; not physical.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant if a cleansing disk pad could really be any different than a washcloth and facial cleanser.....</li>
            <li>and I see a major difference in my face</li>
            <li>Something I never expected!  </li>
            <li>Something I never expected!  </li>
            <li>They are priced differently because usually those trying to fight the signs of aging skin will spend more to look younger.</li>
            <li>There is no unpleasant smell as I had read in few comments.</li>
            <li>Since moving to the desert I struggled for 5 years with my skin getting progressively more dry, wrinkly, uneven, just flat out old looking.  </li>
            <li>I had a VERY hard time convincing him</li>
            <li>I would say if you get irritation-use it less often, until you find the right regimen for your skin.</li>
            <li>Use the instructions never to dry ur face by wiping but by padding gently with a soft towel(gently press or if possible let air</li>
            <li>One side is rough and the other smooth</li>
            <li>I use them every other day and so far I really like them.</li>
            <li>it gently exfoliates which leaves skin super soft without irritating it.</li>
            <li>I am a 53 year old male and this product exceeding my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Not enough leaked out to ruin the product which I&#x27;ve been using nearly every day to resuface my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 and just started seeing forehead creases and soft lines around my eyes in the last year or so and freaked out - this product, if used diligently, is a godsend for me.  </li>
            <li>I cut them into thirds; as is, they are far too big.</li>
            <li>I will use the non-textured side to wipe away my eye makeup and brows (it will sting eyes if not careful) and then use the textured side for the rest of my face to get the mini exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently had a professional facial and the cosmetician told me to keep using them (but not every day because they are pretty rough).</li>
            <li>I used the rough side first going over my entire face, including my eyelids!  </li>
            <li>What I was concerned about is the seal was broken on top</li>
            <li>: cut these discs in half, as they are large enough to do so &amp; will last that much longer.</li>
            <li>I stopped using them for a little while and noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>These RoC Daily Resurfacing Disks take off the years, apparently!!!  </li>
            <li>Dry mature sensitive skin and after reading some of the reviews, I decided to chance an adverse reaction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First Night: I cut them in half as suggested by many other reviews and it is definitely enough to use on your entire face and neck,.  </li>
            <li>My skin is more even looking (I have some discoloration due to past breakouts).</li>
            <li>These exfoliate very well and prepare your skin to absorb your other creams and lotions.</li>
            <li>I really hadn&#x27;t expected a change in the marionette lines or jowl thing-but they too are noticeably diminished!</li>
            <li>After buying one pack and using every other day for two weeks, I really saw a difference</li>
            <li>My 14 year old daughter asked if I was using something different because she said I looked younger!</li>
            <li>Does not dry out your skin...</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li>The cleansing pads do not dry out the skin.  </li>
            <li>and this did not dry out my skin</li>
            <li>The container is way larger than it needs to be, so if I were travelling or keeping them in my gym bag, I would put a couple of these in a zip top baggie and leave the container behind.  </li>
            <li>Pads are huge - as someone said previously, you can cut them in half - they&#x27;ll last longer and they are still plenty big (and thick) enough for easy use.</li>
            <li>I used it once a day and gently rub the bumps, dark spots  and lines that I&#x27;ve acquired as part of the aging process.</li>
            <li>I still always use moisturizers, but I really like using this daily or every other day in the morning.</li>
            <li>Apparently it is cheaper buying from your local stores, but I like the convenience of Amazon</li>
            <li>Apparently it is cheaper buying from your local stores, but I like the convenience of Amazon</li>
            <li>I am afraid it could cause irritation to my sensitive skin if I used it more frequently.</li>
            <li>I am a 32 year old acne prone African American female.</li>
            <li>I felt a difference in my skin in the first few days.</li>
            <li>I do like them a lot, I just wish the jar were at least full, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>The disks are rather large and I cut them in half and still get plenty of lather to do my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I gently buffs the skin, and my skin is dry, but this does not seem to dry it out.  </li>
            <li>and I can see the dirt removed as the pad becomes an icky brown tint - no matter how clean I thought I&#x27;d washed my face prior.</li>
            <li>Like many reviewers, cutting these in half saves money and is perfectly adequate for using.</li>
            <li>Been using this for less than a week and really like how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>They would take up way too much space in a typical toiletries bag.  </li>
            <li>:(( I am an African American with a light complexion prone to hyperpigmentation, with a tendency towards sensitive easily reddened and dry</li>
            <li>It comes with 60 large pads, but I cut them in half to make them last longer.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, prone to flakey dry patches, occasional break outs and yet an oily T-zone in the daytime.</li>
            <li>Sensitive and dry and irritable when I was younger, and then acne-prone through my 20&#x27;s and mid-30&#x27;s and</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even used any creams and the dry patchy red spots are darn near gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even used any creams and the dry patchy red spots are darn near gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband uses them because he has sensitive face skin that often gets dry and red blotches on it.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat dry skin that can be sensitive if treated too harshly by products or too much abrasion.</li>
            <li>Not overly harsh, and the discs are large.</li>
            <li>If I have a whitehead or little pimple coming in, it really can&#x27;t because of the scrubbing side.</li>

            <li> What a nice cleanser!</li>
            <li> After using Roc products, I feel now that the price point is excellent, as these products are comparable or BETTER than some department store items I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> so I am thrilled!)  </li>
            <li> Not too drying, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant as well.  </li>
            <li> This is one skin care product i strongly recommend--it is awesome.  </li>
            <li> Plus my Dermatologist who I see every 3 months for precancerous lesions says it is a good product to use.</li>
            <li> This is a good  product for me.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll have a shiny (in a good way) glow when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have noticed some difference in my face (which I already take good care of) but</li>
            <li> Oh man this stuff is good.</li>
            <li> It gets ALL of my eye makeup off, which can be a good bit.</li>
            <li> My skin type is fair to medium.  </li>
            <li> and she said its good.</li>
            <li> I am cheap and cut them in fourths, which works great!</li>
            <li> I use this product in the morning - it&#x27;s a good way to start the day.</li>
            <li> It is a good night moisturizer and that is how I have used it.  </li>
            <li> would use it again as I found it to be a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> They suds up really good</li>
            <li> The pads (there are 28 of them) are thicker than I was expecting - this is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Often times, the store will be out of this or that, so I like to order a good supply from Amazon</li>
            <li> They smell good, no residue, no peeling, no irritation.</li>
            <li> In my opinion,it&#x27;s as good as ANR.</li>
            <li> So I think this is a good value if you&#x27;re going to try one.</li>
            <li> and you can tell that they do a good job exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 and looking for products to keep my skin looking good.</li>
            <li> my skin always look good using this.  </li>
            <li> It has been rainy here, so I am trying to be fair, but</li>
            <li> Great combination from Roc that is actually effective . .</li>
            <li> 6 weeks for good results</li>
            <li> Either you have good genetics or a good plastic surgeon.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> It may be a good product, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove all of my eye makeup but good for my skin.  </li>
            <li> It has been good for my skin, clearing and smoothing some below the surface cystic acne and bumps.</li>
            <li> A toner afterward is good but not required.</li>
            <li> skin feels clean after using and removes make great!  </li>
            <li> They are mild on the skin and delightful to use.</li>
            <li> Love the convenience, the aroma and the great job of sloughing and cleansing my face.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great product :)</li>
            <li> After 1 week use, I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Roc is very famous in reducing wrinkles.</li>
            <li> love it, works great.  </li>

            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> Love these disks!  </li>
            <li> These are great scrubs pads, however, quite strong.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and do a great job of cleansing the skin.  </li>
            <li> These are amazing resurfacing disks.</li>
            <li> They are amazing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell how well it is doing on preventing break-outs, but the texture of my face feels amazing.</li>
            <li> The smooth side does a great job of removing my eye make-up and the textured side exfoliates the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> AMAZING.</li>
            <li> but the difference in my skin after the pads alone is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Great cleansing, removes all your make up, makes your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> These are amazing.</li>
            <li> My hands are now being resufaced also, and the difference is amazing in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> leaves a nice feel.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect product that really works.</li>
            <li> Leave a nice sensation  of cleanness.</li>
            <li> I did liked these disks before</li>
            <li> They are magical they work sooo good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had good skin but never have I received so many compliments on my skin as I have since I began using the Roc products.</li>
            <li> They smell absolutely wonderful, they are both gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nice.</li>
            <li> The cleansing pads feel nice on the skin of the face.</li>
            <li> A nice cleansing disk.</li>
            <li> Kind of defeats the purpose.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product, the 3 stars are for me not being able to use it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product for a good cleansing disk to use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind</li>
            <li> I just finished using one jar of these disks and although there weren&#x27;t any drastic improvements in my skin, it was still a nice and thorough exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Like ROC it is a good product and most of us like it.  </li>
            <li> Convenient, affordable, effective cleansing pads.  </li>
            <li> I always covered my face but liked the color on my chest.</li>
            <li> They do work really nice without being abrasive.  </li>
            <li> I finished off with another ROC product and together they gave me a really nice, moist, finished results.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and I really like it and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I use these pads every day and my face feels and looks so nice.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> I have aging skin so in order to get the best results from skin products the top layer needs to be fresh and these do the job.</li>
            <li> These lather up real good and are quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and smell fairly pleasant.</li>
            <li> Beautiful fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The scent smells really good and isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> but I get rashes very easy.</li>
            <li> how excited I am that I found this product or how effective it is!  </li>
            <li> Love, love!</li>
            <li> I am S&amp;S on these items and haven&#x27;t had a delivery for three months, but when I am able to get them I love them!</li>
            <li> This price is even more amazing.</li>
            <li> My face would breakout just wasnt a good fit for my skin</li>
            <li> These pads are perfect, they exfoliate while cleaning, leaving the skin soooo soft and silky.</li>
            <li> The claims are true!!  </li>
            <li> Very fine eye</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these discs!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy to be able to use the soft side to remove eye makeup.</li>
            <li> My face feels very smooth.</li>
            <li> They leave my skin very smooth.  </li>
            <li> These are wonderful, gentle and softened my skin right away!</li>
            <li> it looks more fine and smooth, almost like a pre-adolescent&#x27;s baby face!!</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and the suds rinse off easily and cleanly.</li>
            <li> pleasantly surprised with how these work, really pleased with the product and would gladly keep using these, price &amp; shipping were very good</li>
            <li> Love these disks.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s ROC...  said great product, works as stated and gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that since I started using them my face is smoother and more youthful looking.</li>
            <li> but I love this product,my face is</li>
            <li> but now I love them.  </li>

            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> Love this product, great cleansing and gentle, too.  </li>
            <li> (it isn&#x27;t a facelift), but you&#x27;ll sure feel fresher and more youthful after a couple weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sooooo glad I bought these and tried them out I will be buying these again for sure</li>
            <li> , I love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order some more for me and my daughter.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist in Canada more than 30 years ago gave me a copy of top skin care products and told me to use ROC as it showed better results than Lancome, Este Lauder and any top brands.  </li>
            <li> I told her I have been using that product for more than 30 years and that I am in my 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> These are absolutely phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> These are LOVELY.  </li>
            <li> My goodness, I love these SO.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and silky after using them!</li>
            <li> I would recommend to all my friends :)</li>
            <li> Would be better to use another product or buffing pad for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year and love it.  </li>
            <li> but I am still able to use this.  </li>
            <li> I am Really Enjoying this product , I will Reorder</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a miracle, but my skin does feel a lot better: smoother and more balanced.</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth now!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> I need to order more.</li>
            <li> Love this product and will continue to purchase through amazon.com</li>
            <li> I really love using these.</li>
            <li> I wish I could use one pad more than once</li>
            <li> It can be a bit on the drying side, so make sure you put on moisturizer after using.</li>
            <li> but these are a lot more cleansing I notice.</li>
            <li> Then, in about 3 more minutes I can feel my face tighten up.  </li>
            <li> I assumed my eyelids were just stained from so many years of wearing eyeshadow</li>
            <li> I pulled my hair back because I don&#x27;t want anything to touch it and ruin this great feeling!  </li>

            <li> I love roc products, but I can&#x27;t use them exclusively since I still need something to prevent acne.</li>
            <li> this one is somewhat more time consuming to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> I noticed more of a difference in the beginning.</li>

            <li> Glad i got it.</li>
            <li> There is more lather and if you&#x27;re using it to remove makeup, I think it gives you a cleaner face after use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and so when they were on sale, I bought three more.  </li>
            <li> 3-LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>

            <li> is marketed more towards \\&quot;younger\\</li>
            <li> &quot; skin and Roc is marketed towards more \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin.</li>
            <li> The Roc discs are about $3.00 more than the Aveeno pads.</li>
            <li> Aloha,  I just reached 70 and thought I&#x27;d better start doing something about these \\&quot;freckles\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> At my age, I&#x27;ve tried many products....</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using these!</li>
            <li> I have also purchased three more Roc products.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels silky smooth after i use this product!</li>
            <li> I love RoC products.</li>
            <li> Therefore I attempt to test out products and the roc line is interesting...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite out of all the RoC products I bought.</li>
            <li> Using an exfoliate seems to work better at brightening my skin.</li>
            <li> These changed my skin for the better.</li>
            <li> When I run out I notice a difference immediately--skin is rougher and flakes more without these.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> let you know!!:)) ....</li>
            <li> And my skin has freakin wrinkles more than before use this products...</li>
            <li> I am so glad I discovered what savings I can get on my Roc products through them.</li>
            <li> I just love the convenience of this product.  </li>
            <li> I did notice the company changed the design of the top.  </li>
            <li> It used to have a &amp;#34;flip top&amp;#34; and now it is just a screw on top.  </li>
            <li> My pores have never been in better condition.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I have this on Amazon&#x27;s ship &amp; save to be sure I never run out.</li>
            <li> love these disks!!!!i will continue to use them,</li>
            <li> this well.will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> ROC has been around for many, many years and has been giving me better results than I have ever experienced with any high end beauty product.</li>
            <li> was kind of hoping for a more obvious result of glowing beautiful skin, but i may have been unrealistic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They have a nice clean smell, and they work well as a wash.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to throw out the container, but when I do use them I rinse them completely clean of the cleanser that they come with and use my own.  </li>
            <li> This  product is effective for keeping skin/pores clean.</li>
            <li> Take off more makeup even after you have washed your face and think it is clean!  </li>
            <li> Liked the hint I saw elsewhere to cut them in half -- perfect.  </li>
            <li> At work a co-worker said i looked like i had a good nights sleep and a good facial :)</li>
            <li> After using the discs for nearly a month I am happy to say that I am more than pleased with the results of this product.</li>
            <li> Both are excellent cleansing pads made by Johnson &amp; Johnson with minor differences.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 with pretty good skin.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy this product again and with the Subscribe and Save from Amazon, the savings are amazing!!</li>

            <li> tell if the item would be great since most of it was outside the jar.</li>
            <li> The packaging was wonderful, but for whatever reason, the container full of pads and liquid was dry as a desert.</li>
            <li> They work great; make my face feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Overall I recommend this product because it is good for cleaning the face and getting off makeup and dirt very easily.</li>

            <li> my fine lines.</li>
            <li> Excellent, I too cut them in half as I could not afford to use if I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> These are fine.  </li>
            <li> but it ENHANCED fine lines around eyes.</li>
            <li> and you know your decreasing fine lines as well.</li>
            <li> I will have to see how these work for fine lines etc.</li>

            <li> Freshens up my face, removes makeup, leaves a clean nice fragrance, makes my skin look younger and fresher after use with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> In fact, when I broke out from the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Night Cream, using these disks helped to scrub off the dried skin and help my skin to heal more quickly.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy I kept my old container because I use that one instead of the new one because I like the flip top much better.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s thing&amp;#34; (like a mask-but this turns to a light foam after I scrub a bit).&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are nice because they are exfoliating on one side (which I use on my whole face and neck area) and softer on the reverse side (which I use around my eye area).  </li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and tingly.</li>
            <li> They use them occasionally for exfoliation with great results.</li>

            <li> Immediately after the first use, my skin looked noticably better...</li>
            <li> While they definitely left my skin smoother and more polished, they were too drying for me (at 65, would have been perfect in my younger years).  </li>
            <li> The results from using this product have been significant.</li>
            <li> Came across these disks on sale, and fell in love with them after the first use.</li>

            <li> Your skin will feel clean and smell clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been on a quest for years, trying to find a cleanser that gets all the oil off and makes my skin feel really clean, without drying it out.</li>
            <li> So, I ordered some from Amazon, cheaper than the drugstore, and with free Super Saver shipping.</li>
            <li> My skin feels wonderfully clean afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These have a wonderfully pleasant scent and make my pores look smaller.  </li>
            <li> The foaming liquid that the disks are soaked in has a pleasant smell and there is plenty in the jar to last until the end.</li>
            <li> I really love this product - first of all, I needed an effective way to clean my skin and remove old cells.</li>
            <li> I find that these disks are very good at exfoliating, and good at removing makeup, but even when followed by a daily moisturizer they can be very drying, creating the same flaky skin that I am trying to avoid.  </li>
            <li> Would still buy them though, because it gives a good, deep clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hard to please, but this product truly makes my skin feel wonderful</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what (if anything) it&#x27;s doing for my pores and skin, but it&#x27;s a nice scrubby facewash at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Was using expensive Estee Lauder, which works great but was noticing fine lines to tried Roc and fine lines are disappearing and much more affordable then Estee Lauder!</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing &amp; looks better, can&#x27;t wait to see what long term use does.</li>
            <li> Yesterday notice her face was more radiant and smooth than normal days.</li>
            <li> The 5 stars are true.</li>
            <li> but I love the product, have noticed a differance all ready, been using three weeks</li>
            <li> I found this product to be really helpful in removing my blackheads, much more helpful than AHA-exfoliators.</li>
            <li> I loved these disks; it makes my facial cleaning routine a snap.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and then on the top of my hands and then around the nails, where I get really scaly and dirty---its great--once done I can oil my hands and nails</li>
            <li> My mum said she read Singapore news articles on Roc prdt where a commentary came from a local dotor was good.</li>
            <li> Sweet.</li>
            <li> Paid too much for this product for it to not to perform better.</li>
            <li> Although, I don&#x27;t know if that will be true for everybody.  </li>
            <li> My face feels super clean,</li>
            <li> I like the fact that there is so much product on each pad as I am able to scrub my arms and legs as well with just one pad.  </li>
            <li> now they are looking younger between this and a good hand cream.  </li>
            <li> by the time I rinse, I feel I have gotten the full</li>
            <li> The solution they&#x27;re soaked in is soothing and cool</li>
            <li> Even my husband noticed how much tighter and better by skin looked (and he didn&#x27;t even know I was using this product).  </li>
            <li> This product exfoliates nicely and gently, completely eradicates my chin problem and is fading my sun spot.</li>
            <li> Actually, can be used on most parts of the body which can be easily reached!  </li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of this particular product and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> i cant say that it has help much in the aging area but sure happy that it helps with the other</li>
            <li> My skins feels completely smooth and clean after using these, but they&#x27;re very gentle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these, I am buying more right now!</li>
            <li> My face was a little pink/red where I was more aggressive - so these can really do a good job of exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Just starting using this it is very gentle, yet effective!</li>
            <li> Super products.  </li>
            <li> They are gentle, yet they provide as much manual exfoliation as you could ever need on any kind of semi-regular basis.  </li>
            <li> I generally have pretty good skin although sun damaged from living in So.</li>
            <li> I like best: this RoC Daily resurfacing disks and the Shiseido ultimate cleansing oil.  </li>
            <li> It went away quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SUGGESTION:  These pads are dense and create a tremendous amount of cleanser in each pad</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling smooth with a nice glow to it.</li>
            <li> I ordered, and they were delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Lucky me, I found RoC products and this</li>
            <li> must caution those who are sensitive to fragrance that this product is very strongly scented.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> this product is so complete that it makes it very easy to use</li>
            <li> The best part is that they are HALF of what they would normally cost at the supermarket or drug store.</li>
            <li> I have reordered these discs several times and continue to be very pleased.  </li>
            <li> The so-called &amp;#34;rough side&amp;#34; to me is actually pretty smooth</li>
            <li> I used the smooth side first, then used the textured side for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> My pores appeared smaller and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied, and have repurchased for the entire 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell the longterm effects of this product however it makes my skin feel super clean and soft :)</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling soft, clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I had never tried this and really like how clean and smooth it leaves my skin</li>
            <li> They really do leave your face feeling smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> It was a great suggestion by another reviewer to cut these in half.  </li>
            <li> There are easy to pop into a plastic baggy if you are traveling to circumvent the whole liquid issue with security.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love these little disks!  </li>
            <li> hope this helps because I am very thankful to all the 5 stars that helped me choose this product.&lt;br /&gt;Happy cleansing!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of these disks, I have to use once a week because my teenagers have found them they also love them!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second container and love these discs!  </li>
            <li> Really like it and will reorder it again!!</li>
            <li> Amazon offers it at a better price and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> I liked the previous version of these disks better.</li>
            <li> Fine lines have really faded away.</li>
            <li> Works fine and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> These RoC Daily Discs are awesome for erasing those fine little lines that have started to appear.  </li>
            <li> The product did not remove all the flaws, but certainly did smooth out my  skin.  </li>
            <li> If used in the right frequency (I&#x27;d say no more than twice a week is all most women should need if you moisturize your skin properly in the morning and evenings), this product is PERFECT.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I did try these little gems.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this everyday for 3 years now and I am extremely happy.</li>
            <li> The disks are huge and very foamy.  </li>
            <li> Also, the pads are HUGE and unless you have a face the size of Shrek, you&#x27;d be throwing your money away by using a whole one.</li>
            <li> I like the exfoliating side of these a lot; not too harsh but still does a great job.</li>
            <li> sound like too much?</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference in my skin, but I do really like these disks.</li>
            <li> Soft and Slightly more textured side for exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> I have philosophy&#x27;s microdermabrasion kit, and honestly I rather use RoC&#x27;s disks because of the ease and similar outcome.</li>
            <li> but it is worth.</li>
            <li> They help to exfoliate the skin on my face and keep it fresh looking.  </li>
            <li> They are worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I actually use this product on my legs and it effectively prevents ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> Worth the try.</li>
            <li> but it could be that my skin is more sensitive than others.</li>
            <li> It says visible results after consistent use for a week, which is true, but I could FEEL the results after just one use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i found that the pads can be cut into 1/4&#x27;s in order to have it last longer yet still be effective.</li>
            <li> My face looked fresh.</li>
            <li> soft some of the pads are not foaming more liquid</li>
            <li> I am 48 yrs old and most people think I am about 35.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see much of a difference in my skin (if any), but I do love the feel of cleanliness</li>
            <li> After a week my face looked a lot better and had not been this soft...</li>
            <li> Best resurfacing product out there.&lt;br /&gt;Results instantly, smoother skin, more refined and less wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> These disks leave my skin feeling smooth, clean and have actually helped with some of the fine lines in my face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle; has a great smell and works well with my other 2 RoC products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used products 8x the price with a less successful outcome.  </li>
            <li> Tell the so called older folks that Roc diminishes wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> It has made a remarkable improvement in my skin tone, and I no longer have to deal with black heads on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> Not so rough that it peels your face but leaves the skin nice and clean.</li>
            <li> These ROC resurfacing disks are not as rough on skin as a scrub, but still get your face nice and clean</li>
            <li> Easily removes makeup and will be easy to travel with by putting a couple in a zip lock bag and won&#x27;t have to take a big jar along.  </li>
            <li> There are many products that are cruelty free, We just have to be aware and search them out and if enough people voice this maybe the companies who choose to do this will listen.</li>
            <li> Definitely must use with a good moisturizer but generally speaking, a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> I have had good luck with a lot of other things from Amazon before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they seemed so good especially since ROC products are highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These are great at cleaning my face but left my skin overly dry the following day, not so good.</li>
            <li> right over the sink because it drips alot</li>
            <li> I mistakenly swiped my right eye with the exfoliating side and although I realized it right away</li>
            <li> For the right price, I would continue to buy them.</li>
            <li> The price is right, they WORK.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t doing right, because I just kept looking crappier and crappier, and then I remembered these.</li>
            <li> As time goes by, I do not see the radiance on my skin and do not feel the tightness anymore right after using this product every night.  </li>
            <li> Gets my face clean, the pads are really convenient.  </li>
            <li> I have large pores and my skin is very sensitive to most products that I have tried to use.  </li>
            <li> brought these with me on a trip recently and was helpful because I didn&#x27;t have to have to wash my hands first-nor did it take up much space.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely needed to use a cream afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Not &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34; but a good staple for certain times.&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> These make my skin super soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job on dry skin -- it looks as soft as it feels.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my face once every few days, but my great discovery is that it works so well on my hands, which have taken a beating since I am a potter by profession, gardener by choice and a horse rider for sheer love of it.</li>
            <li> They also produce way more foam than I expected, so you definitely need a good rinse afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any discoloration and have pretty good skin due to staying away from the sun and being a non-smoker.</li>
            <li> this product does a fine job of cleaning-I&#x27;m not seeing any remarkable results with &amp;#34;resurfacing&amp;#34; as I have with outher products from my dermatoligist.&lt;br /&gt;The size of the disks are over sized in my opinion, so I cut them in half- which makes the product last twice as long and a fair value.</li>
            <li> The ROC resurfacing disks come nicely packaged in a sealed plastic jar and are surprisingly large for a facial pad.</li>
            <li> pores are smaller and this product is so easy to use!</li>
            <li> These discs are effective without being harsh, they are convenient to use and I am so happy with the results, I will continue to use the product and other Roc products in tandem.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it felt and it left my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I rinse my face with warm water then pat dry with a bath towel.  </li>
            <li> 1 1\2 week use of the pad resulted in a really noticeable difference in dark lines/wrinkles on my neck-- a nice surprise!</li>
            <li> Easy on my sensitive skin as well.  </li>
            <li> These are absolutely amazing for gently removing the makeup that inevitably gets into your pores.</li>
            <li> The flip top design of the canister keep the pads moist so never dry out.</li>
            <li> Love that one side has a bit more texture to help lift dead skin cells and prepare skin for night treatment.  </li>
            <li> you think you&#x27;re getting a great facial scrub, but it&#x27;s actually resurfacing!</li>
            <li> I have cut these in half, they are a good size.....</li>
            <li> Getting the skin back to youthful is pricey, upkeep is also an investment so being able to purchase the RoC Resurfacing Discs thru Amazon has been worth it.</li>
            <li> They make your skin feel amazing, I use them couple times a week, made a big difference, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> After the first few days, my skin looked amazing!</li>
            <li> Make your face smoother, look up younger, After use, your skin is smooth and soft,Wrinkle really disappear.&lt;br /&gt;Daily Resurfacing Disks and Deep Wrinkle Night Cream.it has a pleasant scent,&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to tingle a bit but not too much!</li>
            <li> The product gives you a nice clean face without making your face feel tight.  </li>
            <li> - I cut the disks in half because it will extend your product twice as long and this way works excellent for me.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> They are wonderful with a rough side for exfoliating and a smooth side for extra facial cleansing.  </li>
            <li> I like Roc products very much, although this is not one that I will not re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the product very much.</li>
            <li> Very gentle without a lot of perfume.  </li>
            <li> These really clean well and even with a clean face, you&#x27;d be surprised at how much dirt these will pull off..</li>
            <li> I can use they every day and my sensitive skin is fine with it as well.</li>
            <li> I am a 38 year old woman with some fine lines and hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 53 year old woman with combination dry/ somewhat oily T-zone skin, rosacea, fine wrinkles skin.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine as far as cleaning the face.</li>
            <li> I was looking at the other ROC products because I loved that one so much and stumbled on these Resurfacing Disks.</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong, like all RoC products I have tried, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to linger too long after rinsing.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for allowing reviews.. its very helpful!!</li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh, clean, and soft after each use.</li>
            <li> Terrific quick and easy way to cleanse and exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Item shipped very fast and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price for a product that does so much!</li>
            <li> This is the first ROC product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> but once I get into a rhythem of using them regularly - I do see improvement :)</li>
            <li> Love these face daily resurfacing disks.</li>
            <li> pads are 2 side useable and the are more than enough..</li>
            <li> My skin really feels ever so much softer and my pores look tiny after...very nice product.</li>
            <li> I love these facial cleaning discs.</li>
            <li> I remove my makeup first and then use the disk....</li>
            <li> This is not my first order.  </li>
            <li> I love this facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more simple!</li>
            <li> I want to look younger everywhere. :)</li>
            <li> First I wash my face with the pad</li>
            <li> so now you have to unscrew the lid to get pads instead of just popping the top open.</li>
            <li> Many people cut their pads in two, I actually do in 4&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> What I noticed first was the improved texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have never used ROC products so this is my first (age 48).  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;These disks do a pretty good job in removing makeup and dead skin.</li>
            <li> -- so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Purchased these for the first time.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better than is ever EVER has -- when I use them regularly.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever writing a review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the changes will become more obvious with regular use.  </li>
            <li> As you probably know, you could spend a lot more money on products making similar claims.  </li>
            <li> I have used these off and on for years but now that I&#x27;m getting close to 40 and seeing wrinkles more pronounced, I decided to start using them again regularly.  </li>
            <li> just okay, no big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says: resurfaces.  </li>
            <li> Noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> Results are immediate after first use...</li>
            <li> I feel like it really exfoliates and cleans my skin!</li>
            <li> will DEFINITELY repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;i also love RoC&#x27;s retinol serum</li>
            <li> 4/06- 4/13 after just the first use</li>
            <li> Most likely, I will purchase again because the price is within reason and not expensive.</li>
            <li> I throw a few in a baggie, seal it up, and I&#x27;m good to go for a weekend of travel,</li>
            <li> I had heard good things about this product, but it was too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> Skin feels clean and still soft !</li>
            <li> The exfoliating disks feel like they really remove old skin and leave you feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> This product leaves your skin SUPER soft, no dry patches, no break outs, and no redness (like so many products).  </li>
            <li> Great purchase for exfoliating and not too harsh for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But I did feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li> soft and clean keep using i</li>
            <li> One disk is plenty to clean your face and neck, and I liked the fact that it&#x27;s double side lets you choose between a deep scrub or a gentle cleanse.</li>
            <li> I love them so much, that I hide them from my teenage daughters.</li>
            <li> It cleans off all my makeup, and the softer side is gentle enough for the eye area, and I love the exfoliating side.</li>
            <li> I do love them too; I noticed a difference in my skin tone very soon after starting to use them.</li>
            <li> Good price for something you can use every day and have last the entire month and then some.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say how much I like or dislike this product; that&#x27;s because I rarely use it since I cannot handle the smell.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be the only product that keeps my face clean!</li>
            <li> As others have suggested, please cut them in half to save more!</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels very smooth but not too dry after I use this.</li>
            <li> The cleanser the disks are soaked in is mild enough to remove eye makeup when using the soft side of the disc, but it gets my face super clean.</li>
            <li> After two months it was amazing to me how the bumps diminished, the dark spots and lines also lightened and lessened.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product religiously--it really does make a difference with consistent use-and the accompanying moisture/night creams.</li>
            <li> One side is smooth and the other has the smallest bumps on it, although both sides feel smooth</li>
            <li> tried thirds at first and still had too much.</li>
            <li> They really \\&quot;suds up\\&quot; - even without wetting your skin first.</li>
            <li> I usually am soooo into organic ingredients for my skin and body but with these I don&#x27;t even care what is in them because the results of my face are sooo good.</li>
            <li> My skin is on the oily side; my skin gets congested and my pores get huge very easily.. which leads to dull skin, and breakouts.</li>
            <li> instructions are to first wet your face, then wipe product over face, then rinse, which is two steps more than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> Easy remedy when I remember is to slather on lip balm prior to using the RoC disks to create a barrier.</li>
            <li> My face feels super soft after using these</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will be easy enough.</li>
            <li> Consider adding the Deep Wrinkle Serum in an easy to use pump bottle that helps prevent contamination of the product.</li>
            <li> It really scrubs , feels well and leaves the face really looking clean and clear.</li>
            <li> They are large, not too abrasive and no offensive odor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to use smart products like these as a preventative method.</li>
            <li> Plus, I have sunspots from years of never using sunscreen, lots of wrinkles, and large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> Most of the time, I end up with red splotches and flaky skin when I try something new.  </li>
            <li> The jar seal was opened and the screwed on top was loose.  </li>
            <li> These pads do a great job, I cut them in half and they last longer.  </li>
            <li> Rinse and dry to use as a quick way to clean and polish the sink or soak up spills . . .</li>
            <li> my skin looks nice and tight after</li>
            <li> No irritability, no red blotchies, and those breakouts that always seemed inevitable no matter how healthy I ate, have disappeared!  </li>
            <li> This product evens out skin tone, helps with fine wrinkles, smooths and IS actually resurfacing my face.</li>
            <li> They soap up very foamy and the pads are quite large.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d always wanted to try Roc products, however, I wasn&#x27;t willing to gamble what I considered a high price for a drug store product.</li>
            <li> Very good but too expensive and the container is too bulky if you want to take them with you when you travel.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel very soft and yound, and the cost is great compared to other products that promise the same results.  </li>
            <li> It was great this time, it seems the last ones were all dried out...</li>
            <li> I can see a huge difference, my skin looks brighter and younger.</li>
            <li> I bought it at the beginning of pregnancy when my face was very oily</li>
            <li> I enjoy the convenience and quality of these Roc facial scrub pads.</li>
            <li> and really I would say have taken years off my skin.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this from the clearance section of my local store and so honestly didn&#x27;t expect much, though with the RoC name, took a gamble.  </li>
            <li> Within one week and can see a difference in my skin and my girlfriend says a look much</li>
            <li> My skin feels much smoother after using them and non greasy.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed I didn&#x27;t need to use as much.  </li>
            <li> My skin is fair, and sensitive and I found that this was gentle enough for daily use.  </li>
            <li> I found these about two years ago and highly recommend these to anyone!</li>
            <li> I figured it really was doing the job.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good value compared to similar products, but a soapy wash cloth could probably do the same thing with far fewer chemicals and a much lower cost.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, my skin feels NORMAL.  </li>
            <li> Is Gentle</li>
            <li> MUCH.  </li>
            <li> For skin care and repair products it really helps when a reviewer includes their age.</li>
            <li> but I use one after a workout and it gets all the sweat off my face and can tell it really cleans out your pores well.</li>
            <li> Too much juice in these.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine using a whole one because they are loaded with liquid.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this product for about 3 weeks, but my face is brighter and feels smooth.</li>
            <li> My pre teens were not remembering to wash their faces real well and started to break out.  </li>
            <li> Ladies don&#x27;t forget to take care of your hands because they can give away your age just as much as your face.</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> There was so much stuff on them, I found myself wringing them out before using.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted something that I wouldn&#x27;t have to rinse off afterward.</li>
            <li> Hearing so much about Roc, I decided to give my mum a try.</li>
            <li> I like that the cream is fast absorbing and doesn&#x27;t stay greasy on the skin for too long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started seeing real results within a couple of weeks, and after 6 weeks there really was a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> so they are ready to go.</li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t have to use much pressure at all.</li>
            <li> It is very sudsy</li>
            <li> Used the exfoliating side for entire face and smooth side for eye area as recommended.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating side is not so gentle</li>
            <li> Thanks RoC..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you have alot of spots you want removed but be patient!</li>
            <li> I have switched over to Aveeno as it seems to be much nicer to my skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely will not be without these ... ever.</li>
            <li> A recent convert to ROC products (who can beat the results with a fantastic price?)</li>
            <li> ONE week back on, I look fantastic again.</li>
            <li> The pads are ready to use on the face and after I finish &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; i just wash them and use them to get the soap of my skin.</li>
            <li> The eye side is gentle.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how much it really foams.</li>
            <li> It really works you see it working in a week</li>
            <li> well spent I love it</li>
            <li> I like the way the jar opens with a flip top lid to avoid fumbling around with wet hands.  </li>
            <li> The thing that really amazes me is how much lather it has in just one disc.</li>
            <li> I wish I had a whole barrel of this stuff.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using these disks I found that my skin really improved.  </li>
            <li> After using the whole jar</li>
            <li> These really feel like they help your skin renew.</li>
            <li> This really makes your skin shine through.</li>
            <li> The pads provide a gentle deeper cleanse that makes my skin feel rejuvenated and ready to soak up some of RoC&#x27;s anti age moisturizers.</li>
            <li> My skin is chronically under-moisturized and produces a lot of oil, but tolerates chemicals and exfoliation very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way my skin feels after using the discs.</li>
            <li> I am stuck with a whole regimen of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Always</li>
            <li> After using it, I feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> quality is that I can wipe my face with it before a shower or while getting ready for bed....and let it &amp;#34;do</li>
            <li> I much prefer containers of this type and the tubes for the Retinol Day and Night cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m 68 and use Neutrogena foam cleanser, Cucumber and Pomegranate peel masks by Freeman, Smoothies (between the eyes), and Simple soothing eye balm (all available with Amazon prime).</li>
            <li> very absorbent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I&#x27;m really digging this product.</li>
            <li> but this product seems to really work.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t know how much I missed it.  </li>
            <li> A whole pad seems like overkill anyway.  </li>
            <li> One is just too much.  </li>
            <li> works very well</li>
            <li> but I decided to use continue( I am very regret now).</li>
            <li> , so they have been a better value for me than expected.</li>
            <li> My skin is really noticing the difference in not using one every day.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I can really see a reduction in my pore size.  </li>
            <li> This is my third jar and last weekend one of my sisters told me how refreshed, clear and good my face looked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many facial wash products and so far I find 2</li>
            <li> my 35+ year old skin definitely looks better.</li>
            <li> But they are definitely good for the skin or at least for how it looks.</li>
            <li> I am 49 and had been using a similar cleansing product (Aveeno) and liked it, but the last time I ran out of them, I decided to try the ROC Resurfacing Disks for a change.</li>
            <li> They are thick and smell good, but I wont be purchasing them again.</li>
            <li> It did nothing special other than clean my face.</li>
            <li> other reviewer said, I cut these in half as they are plenty big enough to do so without sacrificing any cleaning :)  and DUDE, my skin already looks better!!!  </li>
            <li> , has a soapy scent that dissipates quickly, I prefer to use products that are as organic and natural as possible, but I am willing to trade that in for success.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice rosy glow to my normally pale face.  </li>
            <li> The key words to attract so called older folks: diminshes fine lines &amp; wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this product on Amazon, however I always read the reviews here first before trying new products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not goin&#x27; down easy!</li>
            <li> Really like them and they clean very well, but I never noticed a change in my skin or its actual appearance in any way.  </li>
            <li> Clean my face  very well and at the same time moisturize my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d bet money that there are a lot of other products out there that cost 10 times more but</li>
            <li> &#x27;ll no more as I use it more!</li>
            <li> I stopped using those when I started with ROC because I thought using so many high chemical products would be too rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> Each pad keeps getting  more and more wet as I work my way down the neatly stacked pile of pads inside.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the price is a steal when you consider the dramatic results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 &amp; \\&quot;had\\&quot; very flaky dry skin with fine lines.</li>
            <li> This product made my skin tighten and it feels like its working, I will update after a few more months of continuous use, it is the first ROC product I have tried</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plenty to clean your face/neck and will double the value!</li>
            <li> Overall, I would still recommend this product as it can gently clean and exfoliate my face as well as can improve my skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to notice any difference between the two products, however, RoC does not merely deep clean the skin, it truly does &#x27;resurface.&#x27;</li>
            <li> They are large, I cut them in half to get more days out of them.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be a little dry; these disks are GREAT for cleansing and softening my skin.  </li>
            <li> use this along with a whole line of day &amp; night care and highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product really works.</li>
            <li> My intention when I bought this was for a quick face wash, but I find myself massaging my face for much longer than necessary because I know my cheeks will be rosy</li>
            <li> I have not used a lot of facial cleansers and this one is so easy and leaves your face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> My face is clear and super soft.</li>
            <li> These are amazing little disks, one side soft the other a more loofa.</li>
            <li> The list of chemicals in the ingredients seemed really long and didn&#x27;t sound like any items</li>
            <li> Sloughing off all those dead skin cells as really improved the overall appearance and my skin looks renewed and bright.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I put a regime on my face to get rid of dark spots and read about this product and thought about trying it.</li>
            <li> These pads are BIG and full of product.  </li>
            <li> I use the entire disk not only on my face, but there is more than enough rich lather to also do my arms and throat/chest area.  </li>
            <li> First used the soft side for cleansing.</li>
            <li> I have used one full package and just purchased my second.</li>
            <li> There is plenty of cleanser in the container and (again as per another reviewer&#x27;s suggestion) I position the container upside down to keep the top discs well hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love these little pads, My skin seems to like them just as much as i do.  </li>
            <li> They really help remove dry, dull unwanted skin and leave a nice smooth texture that is blemish-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As another reviewer said, you can cut these in half to get more usage from the package.</li>
            <li> and you can get more use by just using half of one.</li>
            <li> My pores have started to become less prominent.</li>
            <li> sure makes ya think you can wake up w one less defined wrinkle.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels and looks, and I notice my pores definitely look smaller.  </li>
            <li> I have used RoC products before, but not this particular one.  </li>
            <li> My skin clears up quickly with regular use.</li>
            <li> in all a decent product.</li>
            <li> I am able to use one disc for my entire face,neck and chest and STILL have plenty of lather left over.</li>
            <li> I plan on keeping this as my main cleanser from now on.</li>
            <li> I enjoy Roc Resurfacing discs AND Aveeno Clear Complexion Daily Cleansing Pads.</li>
            <li> I just purchased more and will likely go on to have it delivered regularly for an additional discount.  </li>
            <li> I use only one in the am and use a mild cleanser in the evening.</li>
            <li> Left my face feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> So far great, I can really feel my face smoorther and my dark spots are diminishing (of course with help of other products)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend anyone who has a  oily t-zone problem to try this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I believe that the 2 products are HIGHLY similiar in content</li>
            <li> and I look like a high school kid with acne.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and it gives a deep clean.</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazingly soft and clean, and with the Retinol, I feel that I&#x27;m cleansing and treating at the same time.</li>
            <li> Drying results - causes my skin to be a tad too dry - which I remedy with a rich moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plan to order more and also check out the other ROC products!!  </li>
            <li> These really make your face feel soft after using them.</li>
            <li> Daily exfoliation is important for my skin type, but the product has to be gentle enough.</li>
            <li> I use these normally as part of my nightly ritual</li>
            <li> but I Can not enjoy the benefits knowing that  innocent animals may be subjected to tests and locked in a cage.  </li>
            <li> It actually seems to do what it advertises to do, which when it comes to skin care is rare for me.</li>
            <li> and It is much better then the harsh soap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suffer breakouts, don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles and its the normal amount of oily.</li>
            <li> No hard scrubbing is needed.</li>
            <li> so I actually cut the pad in half and extended the jar usage with just as effective cleansing results.  </li>
            <li> I have using these disks for a short time and i have seen an improvement in my face especially on the dark blotches on my face.the disks are clearing and cleaning up the problem,also the fine lines around the jaw are improving and after using one my face feels so refreshing and soft.</li>
            <li> For example, on my legs right above my knees..</li>
            <li> I liked these, made your face and neck feel really clean, have a delicate and a rough surface, just splash water to the area and use.</li>
            <li> Each 4th of a circle is just enough to clean my whole face (a 3rd would be easier, but I&#x27;m thrifty like that)</li>
            <li> Before ordering I read another reviewers suggestion to cut the pads in half to save some $$, and she was right--the pads are big for a single use--half the pad works great.  </li>
            <li> The pads are very large and actually I cut them in half (which is more than enough to clean your entire face/neck).  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t spend the $10 drugstore asking price, but the amazon price of $6.95 is manageable, especially since I found a way to get two uses from each of the very large pads.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing the product at Target and they seem to have discontinued it, which is actually the main reason I was shopping there in the first place.  </li>
            <li> Even after 28 days of daily usage, my face would tingle for the first few seconds of the disks touching my face</li>
            <li> These discs were easy and left my face clean but after a few days a fine rash developed betweeen my eyebrows then down my nose as I continued to use.  </li>
            <li> Went to a new Doctor, on 29 Nov. 2012.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started to use every three days and in three days I have a new pimple forming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that you&#x27;d ever be able to get the right ratio of liquid back in by adding water.</li>
            <li> The lid screws on, but also has a lift-up tab to use more easily, especially when your eyes are closed after splashing your face before you use one.</li>
            <li> disk has a rough side and smooth side, so if you have sensitive skin you can still use these to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> The pads leave my face feeling amazingly smooth and soft, although they are somewhat abrasive on my dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like to physically exfoliate the dead stuff off and these are nice.  </li>
            <li> But I also have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My face is very soft after using.  </li>
            <li> My skin can be very sensitive to products</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I do not have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I thought the procuct was ok, but it didnt really do anything different for my skin or complection than just a little squirt of body wash on a cloth does.</li>
            <li> The first time I was really scared because my skin is so dry anyway</li>
            <li> I was 65 years old!  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers, my pores seem smaller, skin texture is waaay smoother and the even-ness of my skin tone looks like I did when I was in my teens</li>
            <li> and it is still more than big enough to cleanse the entire face</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I like the soft side better and only use the rough side of the disks on my nose.</li>
            <li> Okay, not sure I&#x27;d reorder.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love it, and I will be reordering this regularly!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> My 14 year old!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I was feeling some real rough areas on my forehead, now it is smooth again and supple.</li>
            <li> My skin has recently gone through a lot of changes recently, and I needed a product that would clean well, exfolliate and reduce the appearance of my pores.  </li>
            <li> So, I dropped my usage down to twice a week, and my skin stays exfoliated and smooth.</li>
            <li> My face looks much more clear and I feel less self conscience when I go bare faced to my workout class at 6 A.M.</li>
            <li> I made numerous changes to my diet recently (which made the most significant changes/improvements in my skin above anything esle), so I&#x27;m not sure how much the Roc Disks have helped, but I like them.  </li>
            <li> Huge disks which I cut in half when I use it.</li>
            <li> My hands are subject to hot water on a daily basis and were most definitely showing their age...</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with the results -- I&#x27;ve had not-so-good skin over the years -- but this product, along with the day and nighttime moisturizers, has made the ongoing difference that I had paid megabucks for in the past, through facials and peels that only brought temporary results.</li>
            <li> but this was true only for my facial area skin.</li>
            <li> Not great for sensitive skin, but still a good product in general.</li>
            <li> Skin looks better and pores a slight bit smaller after use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The solution lightly foams and I can see the slight discoloration on the disc surface indicating old cells being sloughed off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and tight.  </li>
            <li> :  Strong scent (surprisingly fragrant) - I was concerned at first because I have sensitive skin however, I have not had bad experience due to scent.  </li>
            <li> They are large enough that can used for the body.</li>
            <li> As others have said, the disks are large and can be cut in two if you want to save $$$ and do only your face.  </li>
            <li> just worded differently to get certain people to buy them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it a little more time and if anything changes I will be back to write another review.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, low costing beauty routine.</li>
            <li> My skin was always so dull; however, cleansing with the RoC disk makes my wrinkled old skin look more refreshed.</li>
            <li> Pores on my face that been open for years (I kid you not) were closed and my skin was smooth.</li>
            <li> The product is clear.</li>
            <li> I was about to buy it, but I searched the ingredients and this has the chemical paraben that is clearly linked to breast cancer and impotence in men.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old, have used for about a year, and will use for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I am almost 40yrs old.</li>
            <li> I have so far used this product for three weeks at about twice a week.</li>
            <li> I never use the rougher side because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using ROC products since early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 54 years old and most people think I am still in my late 20&#x27;s or early 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Young men hit on me thinking I&#x27;m about their age.  </li>
            <li> Once, I was buying Roc in Walgreens and this young lady cannot make up her mind which product to use.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin as well and never have a problem with this product.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I have lately developed the habit of carrying over all of my face routines to my hands as well.</li>
            <li> Noticed NO drying so far.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my mum, who is now 72 years old.</li>
            <li> My face is baby-smooth at 60 years old.  </li>
            <li> My skin is to sensitive for this, but I could feel and see a difference.</li>
            <li> Each pad has alot of lather but the lather is soft.</li>
            <li> If used daily, this product is very drying to your skin.  </li>
            <li> I used the pads twice a day, using one pad both times (kept it in fridge 1during the day to save $ and not wasted the product).</li>
            <li> I have been using these for nearly a month and my skin is already transformed.</li>
            <li> I am a 53 year old women.</li>
            <li> so I cut them in 1/2 because they are really too big.  </li>
            <li> However, my skin is too sensitive for it.</li>
            <li> My skin is very acne prone, and this actually is helping to prevent break outs.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This has really worked to make me feel like I have younger looking skin</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> 51 yrs young</li>
            <li> and I was completely out.  </li>
            <li> So far, I have found this product to be helping my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I use it every so often (not everyday)</li>
            <li> That way the jar lasts twice as long and you really get a bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> It has helped me smooth out my skin in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Once I complete my face</li>
            <li> I choose not to use near my eyes.</li>
            <li> pads do a reasonable job of keeping my acne at bay, but not as well as a product specifically designed to do so, like the Clearasil daily acne treatment pads.</li>
            <li> have also noticed that my skin has a smoother surface and has been effectively absorbing my facial products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried glycolic acid peels, philosophy &amp; Peter Thomas Roth products and these RoC products are by far my favorites.</li>
            <li> I am 35yrs old and have had expression lines for about 5yrs now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in early thirties, with sensitive skin prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> Thus, I need to exfoliate frequently.</li>
            <li> After using my skin is clear and soft.</li>
            <li> I also dont know if enough moisture is left in container to keep product useful.  </li>
            <li> Each thick pad is thoroughly saturated with cleanser, they foam up nicely, and the soft side is gentle enough to use to remove mascara and eye make-up, while the textured side invigorates and refreshes like a mini facial.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a few dry patches, so I use a very strong moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> The other days I can cleanse with regular old Neutrogena Oil free acne wash or whatever I&#x27;m into at the moment.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need a deep scrub, the other side of the disk is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> They are just enough to slough off delicately and give me a fresh clean feeling face.</li>
            <li> I love the two sides of the disk for my combination skin, and even the scent is clean and fresh without being annoying.  </li>
            <li> when I want to get a little deeper clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Have only been using these for a week so far in conjunction with a whole new facial regimen.</li>
            <li> My skin stays very smooth and firm ALL DAY LONG!</li>
            <li> Just be sure to keep the lid on tight so that they don&#x27;t dry out...</li>
            <li> But I love the packaging and it closes tight and doesn&#x27;t dry out the pads.</li>
            <li> I tried cutting these in half as some other reviewers suggested, but I really think it&#x27;s best to use a whole one.  </li>
            <li> After about a week, my skin was smooth and soft and I feel like it looks younger and less damaged.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they help fine lines or not</li>
            <li> Many products on the market that a way less expensive and do a better job.</li>
            <li> and I am not sure that it has did anything to my fine lines, however it I do like to use it</li>
            <li> I wear very little makeup, and my skin still looks smooth.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth, significantly less congested, and my pores look much smaller.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never had anything more than a slight pink to my skin after washing.  </li>
            <li> I spend 20 minutes or less a day and the results have been better than expected.</li>
            <li> My daughter used half the jar, so I really didn&#x27;t get the chance to see if it really worked on wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> normally buy my Roc Resurfacing Disks from either Walgreens, or Rite Aid, and only on sale.</li>
            <li> I guess I expected a little more than an face scrub pad can do.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY dry skin, and in my mid 40s extremely dry skin &#x3D; lots of fine lines and crepe like skin, yuck.</li>
            <li> They are quite large, more than I need for my face, so by cutting them and doubling the count, I think they are a decent value.  </li>
            <li> I cut them in half and there is plenty of soap/suds to clean my face daily.</li>
            <li> As a former costmetic consultant I can assure you a repair product works very differently on a 28 yr old than a 57 yr old.</li>
            <li> 19yr old male, black oily face with mild acne scarring.</li>
            <li> I really think that the differences are psychological; not physical.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant if a cleansing disk pad could really be any different than a washcloth and facial cleanser.....</li>
            <li> and I see a major difference in my face</li>
            <li> Something I never expected!  </li>
            <li> Something I never expected!  </li>
            <li> They are priced differently because usually those trying to fight the signs of aging skin will spend more to look younger.</li>
            <li> There is no unpleasant smell as I had read in few comments.</li>
            <li> Since moving to the desert I struggled for 5 years with my skin getting progressively more dry, wrinkly, uneven, just flat out old looking.  </li>
            <li> I had a VERY hard time convincing him</li>
            <li> I would say if you get irritation-use it less often, until you find the right regimen for your skin.</li>
            <li> Use the instructions never to dry ur face by wiping but by padding gently with a soft towel(gently press or if possible let air</li>
            <li> One side is rough and the other smooth</li>
            <li> I use them every other day and so far I really like them.</li>
            <li> it gently exfoliates which leaves skin super soft without irritating it.</li>
            <li> I am a 53 year old male and this product exceeding my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Not enough leaked out to ruin the product which I&#x27;ve been using nearly every day to resuface my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 and just started seeing forehead creases and soft lines around my eyes in the last year or so and freaked out - this product, if used diligently, is a godsend for me.  </li>
            <li> I cut them into thirds; as is, they are far too big.</li>
            <li> I will use the non-textured side to wipe away my eye makeup and brows (it will sting eyes if not careful) and then use the textured side for the rest of my face to get the mini exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently had a professional facial and the cosmetician told me to keep using them (but not every day because they are pretty rough).</li>
            <li> I used the rough side first going over my entire face, including my eyelids!  </li>
            <li> What I was concerned about is the seal was broken on top</li>
            <li> : cut these discs in half, as they are large enough to do so &amp; will last that much longer.</li>
            <li> I stopped using them for a little while and noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> These RoC Daily Resurfacing Disks take off the years, apparently!!!  </li>
            <li> Dry mature sensitive skin and after reading some of the reviews, I decided to chance an adverse reaction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First Night: I cut them in half as suggested by many other reviews and it is definitely enough to use on your entire face and neck,.  </li>
            <li> My skin is more even looking (I have some discoloration due to past breakouts).</li>
            <li> These exfoliate very well and prepare your skin to absorb your other creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> I really hadn&#x27;t expected a change in the marionette lines or jowl thing-but they too are noticeably diminished!</li>
            <li> After buying one pack and using every other day for two weeks, I really saw a difference</li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter asked if I was using something different because she said I looked younger!</li>
            <li> Does not dry out your skin...</li>
            <li> Does not dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li> The cleansing pads do not dry out the skin.  </li>
            <li> and this did not dry out my skin</li>
            <li> The container is way larger than it needs to be, so if I were travelling or keeping them in my gym bag, I would put a couple of these in a zip top baggie and leave the container behind.  </li>
            <li> Pads are huge - as someone said previously, you can cut them in half - they&#x27;ll last longer and they are still plenty big (and thick) enough for easy use.</li>
            <li> I used it once a day and gently rub the bumps, dark spots  and lines that I&#x27;ve acquired as part of the aging process.</li>
            <li> I still always use moisturizers, but I really like using this daily or every other day in the morning.</li>
            <li> Apparently it is cheaper buying from your local stores, but I like the convenience of Amazon</li>
            <li> Apparently it is cheaper buying from your local stores, but I like the convenience of Amazon</li>
            <li> I am afraid it could cause irritation to my sensitive skin if I used it more frequently.</li>
            <li> I am a 32 year old acne prone African American female.</li>
            <li> I felt a difference in my skin in the first few days.</li>
            <li> I do like them a lot, I just wish the jar were at least full, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> The disks are rather large and I cut them in half and still get plenty of lather to do my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I gently buffs the skin, and my skin is dry, but this does not seem to dry it out.  </li>
            <li> and I can see the dirt removed as the pad becomes an icky brown tint - no matter how clean I thought I&#x27;d washed my face prior.</li>
            <li> Like many reviewers, cutting these in half saves money and is perfectly adequate for using.</li>
            <li> Been using this for less than a week and really like how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> They would take up way too much space in a typical toiletries bag.  </li>
            <li> :(( I am an African American with a light complexion prone to hyperpigmentation, with a tendency towards sensitive easily reddened and dry</li>
            <li> It comes with 60 large pads, but I cut them in half to make them last longer.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, prone to flakey dry patches, occasional break outs and yet an oily T-zone in the daytime.</li>
            <li> Sensitive and dry and irritable when I was younger, and then acne-prone through my 20&#x27;s and mid-30&#x27;s and</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even used any creams and the dry patchy red spots are darn near gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even used any creams and the dry patchy red spots are darn near gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband uses them because he has sensitive face skin that often gets dry and red blotches on it.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat dry skin that can be sensitive if treated too harshly by products or too much abrasion.</li>
            <li> Not overly harsh, and the discs are large.</li>
            <li> If I have a whitehead or little pimple coming in, it really can&#x27;t because of the scrubbing side.</li>
            <li> First I cut my pads in half like another reviewer suggested, I wash my face with them, and then I also use the rough side on my hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 years old and have tried the most expensive to the least, and this product line is the one I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got a teeny little pit because I had this huge random pimple when I first started using these pads</li>
            <li> I would not use any other cleanser on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought these on a whim after being pleasantly surprised by other RoC products.  </li>
            <li> I bought some for my 35 year old daughter who&#x27;s on medication for acne problems due to Cushing&#x27;s Disease...</li>
            <li> I mean, this is the holy grail, right here.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, my face looked red and irritated -- maybe I was scrubbing too hard --</li>
            <li> i am 54 years old and starting to see wrinkles and dark spots.</li>
            <li> I do however have one large age/sun spot and get some small pimples on my chin once in a while.</li>
            <li> Brow furrows appear far less defined-still there but not as deep.</li>
            <li> I am generally lazy about removing make-up at the end of the day and don&#x27;t really like multi step routines.</li>
            <li> And Instead of cutting the disk into halves like some others, I actually cut it into quarters and make do, so it&#x27;s lasted me the last 3 months :)</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s made much difference in my skin</li>
            <li> I received this product partially opened, but the seal was barely leaking some of the liquid into the shipping bag.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll last twice as long and work just as well.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been using long enough to testify as to long-term results.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using these for a few days now and all I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li> I cut the circles into 4&#x27;s and they are lasting me a very long time.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t use the actual product on my lips, but the lather that accumulates makes them dry).</li>
            <li> If you cut these in half they give you plenty of soap and foaming action and surface area for cleaning your face.</li>
            <li> Cut the disks in half, you will only need half as they lather up really well.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and develop black heads frequently.</li>
            <li> I found it helpful but have not been using it long enough to weigh in on long term effects.</li>
            <li> they smelled weird and were just kind of messy.  </li>
            <li> the pads are large and thick---I recommend sterilizing/or cleansing well a pair of scissors, then cutting the first 5-10 in half...doing the same once those have been used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I used this product in the first several nights, I felt my skin a little bit dry and tight.  </li>
            <li> Definitely by the end of the week my forehead creases were less visible and my skin was just brighter in general.  </li>
            <li> The lines were smaller and this is the only new product I&#x27;ve added to my beauty regimen lately.  </li>
            <li> I usually scissor all of them in half when I first open a container.</li>
            <li> Can be abrasive if you scrub to hard but never seen so much gunk get off my face.</li>
            <li> These are totally amazing and can&#x27;t see how anyone would ever give them a bad review.</li>
            <li> I have already bought another jar and will be a faithful customer as long as they sell this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it will take a long time for me to get through it.</li>
            <li> Over the past year I developed a strange rash across my upper cheeks, and across the bridge of my nose.  </li>
            <li> Will keep buying for as long as I can find them...</li>
            <li> I am seeing some minor results already with regard to surface wrinkles and pores.  </li>
            <li> I searched a long time for a product that would not cause an allergic reaction on my face.  </li>
            <li> You do have to wet your face and rinse off the lather, which another reviewer actually had a problem with?!?</li>
            <li> I have used Roc skin products for a long time...</li>
            <li> Hope this long review helps someone out there.</li>
            <li> As recommended by another reviewer, they are plenty big enough &amp; have enough solution on them that they can be cut in half to stretch your dollar!</li>
            <li> Anyways-definently cut the pad in half to do your face...its way too soapy otherwise, and try it out on other parts-you may be surprised!</li>
            <li> and they are big enough cut in half.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and struggle with excessive oil and minor breakouts.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to any of the bad reviews out there, try them for yourself and you will see they are worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Takes care of the dry patches, my sunspots and smaller wrinkles are less noticeable, pores are smaller, and breakouts are almost non-existent.</li>
            <li> I have only found 1 other wash that did that (from Loreal that was discontinued).</li>
            <li> Just recently started using ROC products, I use this about twice a week along with all the other ROC Resurfacing Products, it helps exfoliate your skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;These discs are well made and simple to reuse for other purposes.</li>
            <li> The other day someone thought I was 15 years younger than I am.</li>
            <li> Whether the product actually helps do much else [like prevent the appearance of wrinkles], that is tough to say.</li>
            <li> I was worried, thinking they would quickly dry up, but I have not found any problem with the solution being too dry.</li>
            <li> It is dry and has flaky patches.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could buy just the dry discs and use the cleanser I want.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face not too dry</li>
            <li> My disks were dry, and not at all what I am used  to.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to people that have dry skin.</li>
            <li> It tends to get oily, I still have breakouts (I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s), but some areas get dry patches, in the midst of the oil.</li>
            <li> I am middle aged and have always had rough blemished skin that needs exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> After washing my face I wanted to see how much was left behind</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says, I&#x27;m a tough rater</li>
            <li> In Singapore, we are unable to get certain Roc product such as this and after checking with the sales HQ in Singapore, I was told that Singapore Roc product follows Europe standard</li>
            <li> Each disk is about 3x larger than a typical round cotton pad and bigger than necessary.</li>
            <li> One side is flat, and the other side has raised bubbles for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> One disk goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> So I can make this jar last for 2 months instead of one without feeling like I&#x27;m using less than needed.</li>
            <li> Cut in half to last even longer!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s on my face, because it stings my eyes ever so slightly when I open them to turn on the faucet.</li>
            <li> You can cut these into half or even 4th&#x27;s to save money without sacrificing having enough to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not designed to get off eye makeup and it really only takes off half</li>
            <li> I only use them only 1x/day to avoid excessive dryness or irritation.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> There are only slight differences.</li>
            <li> I cut the disks in half to make them last longer</li>
            <li> Which is weird because the pad does not feel super textured..</li>
            <li> Do recommend cutting pads in half, more then enough cleansing solution on a half of pad.</li>
            <li> skin is very dry</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and used to have a &amp;#34;flaky&amp;#34; appearance.</li>
            <li> the past few years my face skin has gotten very dry, especially around the cheek area near my nose.  </li>
            <li> I use these in the shower because I tend to make a big mess at the sink when I do a skin routine.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I am cutting the disks in half to maximize the value of my purchase.</li>
            <li> The only weird thing is that the jar is really large, and the disks take only about half the space, a bit misleading</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40 and had some rough patches of skin these pads smoothed my skin out and made my skin brighter.</li>
            <li> I have used them twice now, in the shower, on rough bumpy areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: Ive been through a few jars now and no longer use it regularly.</li>
            <li> I expected a stack of pre-soaked pads with glycolic acid that I could swipe over my face every day.</li>
            <li> I think I like them but have only used for a few days.  </li>
            <li> This product removes rough skin.  </li>
            <li> One side is rough to exfoliate your skin, so it&#x27;s like a 2 in 1.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving them, I noticed the container to be wet and smell like cleaning product.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t consider the &#x27;rough&#x27; side to be exfoliating at all.</li>
            <li> Not really a review, but a tip.</li>
            <li> even if I do that with these, my skin is not left feeling dried out or irritated.  </li>
            <li> but since it&#x27;s not available anymore I will review the current version.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely never write product reviews, but I have to do it this time.</li>
            <li> My skin was baby-soft after only a few days of using them.  </li>
            <li> I only reserved the one star because it&#x27;s heavily perfumed</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no moisture in the pads that I received, and the bottom of the box was soggy.</li>
            <li> Wet pad and get to cleaning.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating side isn&#x27;t too harsh, so your skin is glowing, not red and aggravated.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that it would not strong enough because I have been using retinol products for years.</li>
            <li> a lot - one side is nubbier for extra exfoliation, the other is smoother so you can do around your delicate eye area and clear away dead cells there as well, softening crows feet and other eye issues.</li>
            <li> I recommend using it every other day because it is a bit rough for the skin.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> After the sceansing my face feels a little tight, so moisturizer is definitely needed.</li>
            <li> The only negative I&#x27;ve noticed is that the cleanser in it makes my lips incredibly dry.</li>
            <li> I purchased mine here on Amazon, it was only a few cents less than off the shelf at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I found these because I no longer wanted to use products with microbeads due to the environmental damage they cause.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s only been a few days and hope springs eternal!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The other day, they asked me where did my wrinkles go?</li>
            <li> I purchased them from the department store or online with other suppliers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying them from anywhere else, Amazon beats all other prices I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the other favorable reviews.</li>
            <li> I had one pimple that came out on my forehead, but I figured it was due to all the impurities being drawn out.</li>
            <li> I purchased these after reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading its reviews and comparing the reviews with those of other products.</li>
            <li> I just started using this Roc product and other Roc products... and am SOLD on this line.  </li>
            <li> Over my 70 years I&#x27;ve used hundreds of products and other face cleansers did not do the job.  </li>
            <li> 1 side for cleansing and the other side for exfoliating).  </li>
            <li> I am VERY careful not to get any of the foam in my eyes, I bet it would sting like a mofo.</li>
            <li> I usually cut them in half as that is enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel a little tight and dry afterward</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I cut them in half.</li>
            <li> I had originally planned to use them on those occasions when I don&#x27;t have easy/convenient access to a sink, but that would be impossible.  </li>
            <li> I do not cut these in half as some of the other reviewers have suggested.</li>
            <li> They are always sold out in the stores and hard to find because they are such a gem.</li>
            <li> your skin gets tingly and maybe a little hot in spots which I know can be scary but</li>
            <li> Be careful not to rub too hard or too long in one area, or you can cause an abrasion on your skin.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is they should offer refill packs of 60 or 100</li>
            <li> My skin burned a little, but no redness or other reaction.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plenty of foaming product on disc, I use on my neck, chest, upper arms (those bothersome small bumps-gone!)</li>
            <li> I do cut them in half to cut down on cost.</li>
            <li> They are like the Cadillac of disposable make-up removers/ skin cleansers, a far cry from the thin little towelettes in the plastic pouches I have tried before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too harsh either like other products.</li>
            <li> A few other noteworthy observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I learned from another review to cut the pads in half.</li>
            <li> I cut the disks in half (as someone else recommended)</li>
            <li> U can cut pad in half doubling ur count because they are so generous with</li>
            <li> cleanser half a pad is quite sufficient.</li>
            <li> (No number was mentioned in the product description, which I thought was odd.)</li>
            <li> I cut in half and lather it up, it works well, but too soon to see difference.  </li>
            <li> I cut them in half</li>
            <li> but it was actually less than I pay for it at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I cut them in half like others have done.  </li>
            <li> I took the advice of others and cut these pads in half.</li>
            <li> The pads are less abrasive than I thought they would be, on the one side.</li>
            <li> I also cut the disks in half as half the disk is sufficient for removing my make-up and cleansing my face.</li>
            <li> less oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Might need to cut them in half like others do.</li>
            <li> Do cut them in half, as previous reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> I cut the pads in half and they still have ample cleanser to do the job.  </li>
            <li> cut in half and there is plenty of product for me to use.</li>
            <li> I cut them in half to save money...</li>
            <li> is that these discs can be cut in half to extend your use.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of product in just half a disc.</li>
            <li> I cut them in half, as others have suggested.</li>
            <li> another reviewer suggested, I cut each pad in half and even then I still cover my face, neck, shoulders, and chest</li>
            <li> I even cut the discs in half</li>
            <li> As others have said, cut the discs in half.  </li>
            <li> One of the reviews I read stated that she cut them in half -</li>
            <li> I cut them in half.</li>
            <li> I cut them in half since that&#x27;s all I need</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, brighter and my pores are less visible.</li>
            <li> On days I wear no face makeup, I cut them in hslf, using half in the morning and half at night before bed.</li>
            <li> I started using these pads every night upon receiving them, and I got a pretty bad rash and some dry patching.</li>
            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t typically get acne, I&#x27;ve even seen a decrease in the little bit I did have.</li>
            <li> Sometimes my face burns a little after using them.</li>
            <li> There is a little stingy feeling after I use it</li>
            <li> I went to put some wrinkle/line filler in those pesky little lines around my mouth before applying lip stick</li>
            <li> I feel like these little discs</li>
            <li> I did get a little rash under my lower lip after about a week or 2 of use it.</li>
            <li> The little rash healed up and hasn&#x27;t occurred again.</li>
            <li> I felt a little bit tingle...</li>
            <li> my dark spots are fading!</li>
            <li> The are a bit drippy and messy</li>
            <li> but the few I do have are reduced after just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Turns out, the seal had broken open so some of the liquid had leaked out during shipping.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want to waste the pad.</li>
            <li> I started using ROC products a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using once or twice a week, followed by heavy moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Harsh for My skin type</li>
            <li> You can feel and see the difference in the your skin after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I just got these a few days ago, and already my skin is softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> Don,t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I plan to write a review again in a few weeks, but after just ONE use, my skin is softer &amp; smoother than ever!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Too harsh.</li>
            <li> I gave a few disks to a friend to try.  </li>
            <li> After just a few days they have made a difference.  </li>
            <li> My mom swears that this has decreased her deep wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a fix all for my uneven skin tone</li>
            <li> so the packaging isn&#x27;t wasted.  </li>
            <li> but I had never had trouble with my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is difficult to care for - sensitive but also prone to blackheads and buildup.</li>
            <li> a few weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> Cleans my skin without being harsh.</li>
            <li> It almost feels like I put some harsh chemical, and I need tons of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am in my late thirties and have spent a lot of time in the sun.</li>
            <li> Not sure how anyone could give this less than 4 stars---it does what its claims say it does.  </li>
            <li> For less than $5 per month, I can cleanse, condition and exfoliate my face!</li>
            <li> I use a small tupperware container and cut the pads in half.</li>
            <li> One side is rougher than the other, but it&#x27;s hard to tell.</li>
            <li> I do crazy things like order skincare products from foreign countries far away.  </li>
            <li> However, the downside is you will need to use this either daily or every other day...which eventually can be a bit expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not noticed any particular overdrying or flaking which I was afraid of.</li>
            <li> After the first use, after about 30 minutes, I looked in the mirror expecting the worst and was really surprised.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for those of us who are a little lazy about exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend cutting the disk into.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that cutting them in half leaves plenty of disk/liquid for your entire face and neck, while saving you twice the money.</li>
            <li> My only thing I&#x27;d change about it, is that I&#x27;d make it about 2/3&#x27;s of the size it is, I tried cutting in half like other reviewers suggested, and it might be just a tad bit small.</li>
            <li> First, the container is gigantic and ugly (like a small jar of peanut butter).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have wrinkles so not sure how it would work for that.</li>
            <li> Im not sure how or why it worked, but it did.</li>
            <li> I am a bit lazy to use them at night</li>
            <li> I have a small face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> like I usually do</li>
            <li> I also used to get a lot of small skin tags on my neck before I started using them</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m that lazy...</li>
            <li> The cream works as well if not better than some.</li>
            <li> so I was not pleased with exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> I usually prefer the wipes that do not need rinsed..</li>
            <li> My skin feels crazy soft tonight to the point where I don&#x27;t want to touch it.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels crazy soft tonight to the point where I don&#x27;t want to touch it.  </li>
            <li> skin w/ small amounts of monthly acne.</li>
            <li> I usually forget/ don&#x27;t feel like cleaning my face in the evening.</li>
            <li> (I usually do this in the shower)</li>
            <li> My skin is still not yet cure past 3weeks.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is because I dont wear make-up regularly, but I started cutting them in half.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews prior to purchasing this product and followed the suggestion of cutting the disks in half.  </li>
            <li> The disks are a bit too big but cutting them in half makes them too</li>
            <li> I have been fighting for at least a year now looked &amp;#34;calmer&amp;#34; than usual.  </li>
            <li> I just put a little water on my face before using it, use in circular motion all over face &amp; neck at least 2 min, you can feel it working!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m a tough little cookie - and just try to keep it out of my eyes if I can.  </li>
            <li> If you see a lot of redness after using these, you might be scrubbing too hard...</li>
            <li> , I found it a little irritating</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and I have not had a bad reaction from these.</li>
            <li> My complexion is quite clear now, too, though it wasn&#x27;t that bad to begin with.  </li>
            <li> at least three separate times.  </li>
            <li> I can use it at least two times a week.</li>
            <li> My skin was beginning to show some superficial signs of aging (in my late 20s).  </li>
            <li> The 24 hour patch test was negative for inflammation (always recommended).</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never returned anything, I mean not one thing, In the years I have been shopping with Amazon, so I guess I will try it now.</li>
            <li> just plain difficult for the past 7 years.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Dove SkinVitalizer Facial Cleansing Massager and the Exfoliating Pillows are very expensive.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;s my life.  </li>
            <li> seriously, it works.</li>
            <li> Seriously-</li>
            <li> Start using this by late 20&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Only caution is that you keep it away from your eyes; it burns like crazy!</li>
            <li> One reviewer suggested cutting in half.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely shocked that my face has not gotten dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely shocked that my face has not gotten dry.  </li>
            <li> Like the idea of cutting them in half, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pricey for the amount of disks that are in the jar, however, another reviewer suggested cutting them in half.  </li>
            <li> if you are looking for a cleansing product that sloughs off dead cells and TIGHTENS skin - this is it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 and still get acne, it&#x27;s rather frustrating.</li>
            <li> The pads are soapy and create lots of unnecessary lather.</li>
            <li> and I figured this was going to make it worse.  </li>
            <li> Its unnecessary.</li>
            <li> so frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I also use them on my chest, and as I had hoped, it has decreased the appearance of some beginning age spots-curse that tanning machine</li>
            <li> Thank you to the woman who recommended cutting the pads in half!</li>
            <li> Disappointed in possibly not new product.</li>
            <li> Having tried endless remedies for oily/big pored skin, I was shocked at how well this product worked.</li>
            <li> Seriously, for $8 how can you not try it?!</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I did not see that they did anything dramatic.</li>
            <li> After about 3 minutes I notice a tingling sensation, which makes me uncomfortable because I&#x27;m afraid it is too harsh.  </li>
            <li> Once in awhile my drugstore runs out of these, so I&#x27;m forced to try something different that makes my skin miserable.</li>
            <li> The book How To Look Expensive made me buy this product.</li>
            <li> I now share itwith my boyfriend, he&#x27;s also addicted to it!</li>
            <li> The product is difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> They were obvious and annoying because I have never even smoked!</li>
            <li> Something went wrong, somewhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not happy!!</li>
            <li> Probably something wrong ingredients.</li>
            <li> HOLY COW!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> HOLY COW!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical since I have used ROC products in the past and have been extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> It has made a crazy improvement to my complexion and to my hands.</li>
            <li> desperate</li>
            <li> OOPS just revealed my age:)PS - I&#x27;ve used very expensive retinol.</li>
            <li> Very expensive to do nothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad because otherwise these things work well</li>
            <li> but my skin isn;t bad to start.</li>
            <li> I think I got a bad container.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I found these disks a bit annoying.  </li>
            <li> I hate wasting money on skincare products</li>
            <li> I hate the soap that these resurfacing disks come soaked with.  </li>
            <li> They just make your skin very, very angry!!).  </li>
            <li> I was very doubtful when i saw the reviews</li>
            <li> I am 24 and have terrible acne spots all over my my face.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love the product and pricing!</li>
            <li> Love these disks. Make my skin feel so clean, and healthy. My skin looks better, more glowing. I&#x27;m 60 years old, have used for about a year, and will use for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like getting a microdermabrasion facial in a facial cleansing pad. When I first started using it, my face looked red and irritated -- maybe I was scrubbing too hard -- but then I realized how it&#x27;s like getting a glycolic peel without the peel -- just some redness -- so be sure to wear sunblock. I am thrilled with the results -- I&#x27;ve had not-so-good skin over the years -- but this product, along with the day and nighttime moisturizers, has made the ongoing difference that I had paid megabucks for in the past, through facials and peels that only brought temporary results. Both my daughter and I use RoC because it rocks! I am 60; she is 30.</li>
            <li> There so easy to use.  I use them in the evening and think they do a great job cleaning your face.</li>
            <li> The book How To Look Expensive made me buy this product. I bought it at the beginning of pregnancy when my face was very oily and I was breaking out from everywhere. After about a week, my skin was smooth and soft and I feel like it looks younger and less damaged. Fine lines have really faded away. I now share itwith my boyfriend, he&#x27;s also addicted to it!</li>
            <li> not so sure of any anti-aging affects, but these are a great scrubbing facial paid.  Soft and Slightly more textured side for exfoliation.  These really clean well and even with a clean face, you&#x27;d be surprised at how much dirt these will pull off..</li>
            <li> These RoC Daily Discs are awesome for erasing those fine little lines that have started to appear.  I use in combination with RoC Daily Moisturizer and am always receiving compliments on my complexion.  I wear very little makeup, and my skin still looks smooth.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Daily resurfacing disks are great.  This is one product that I purchase over and over.</li>
            <li> I like this it seems to be working I did not price shop it might be cheaper some where else</li>
            <li> I enjoy the convenience and quality of these Roc facial scrub pads. They are mild on the skin and delightful to use. The product is difficult to find in stores. The flip-up lid is convenience.  I usually scissor all of them in half when I first open a container. 1/2 of a pad is plenty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40 and had some rough patches of skin these pads smoothed my skin out and made my skin brighter. Enough my mom noticed. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles so not sure how it would work for that. Maybe keep them away :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using ROC Resurfacing  Disks for about 2 years now.  They really clean my face well and removes all makeup residue.  I have never had a breakout with them and I think my skin is brighter. My skin does feel a little tight and dry afterward but I follow up with the ROC moisturizer.. The are a bit drippy and messy so I use then in the shower every morning.</li>
            <li> These things are huge.  Maybe it is because I dont wear make-up regularly, but I started cutting them in half.  They have a nice clean smell, and they work well as a wash.  I didnt see any difference in my skin while using them though.  But I did feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I keep this in the shower so I will use it daily and rinsing in the shower for me is the easiest.  I gently buffs the skin, and my skin is dry, but this does not seem to dry it out.  I still always use moisturizers, but I really like using this daily or every other day in the morning.</li>
            <li> Cleans well.  Removes waterproof mascara.  Is my favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li> Wonderful exfoliating results, for any age.  Actually, can be used on most parts of the body which can be easily reached!  Thank-you for a great product!  P. Griswold  Update:  Went to a new Doctor, on 29 Nov. 2012.  I had a VERY hard time convincing him I was 65 years old!  He thought I was MUCH younger!  These RoC Daily Resurfacing Disks take off the years, apparently!!!  Thank-you, Amazon, for having this wonderful product!!!  P. Griswold</li>
            <li> Since moving to the desert I struggled for 5 years with my skin getting progressively more dry, wrinkly, uneven, just flat out old looking.  These pads cleared up the acne, softened my skin and really I would say have taken years off my skin. One of my favorite products ever.</li>
            <li> My skin was always so dull; however, cleansing with the RoC disk makes my wrinkled old skin look more refreshed.</li>
            <li> Really helps remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this  at Ulta and tried it last night. I loved the way it felt and it left my skin feeling soft. I noticed a difference after washing and drying my face. When my hubby got in bed next to me he said, what did you do to your face it looks smoother and the pores look smaller? When i got up this morning, i couldnt believe it!! Pores on my face that been open for years (I kid you not) were closed and my skin was smooth. At work a co-worker said i looked like i had a good nights sleep and a good facial :) Will definitely buy this product again and with the Subscribe and Save from Amazon, the savings are amazing!! I look forward to seeing improvements in my skin after continued use. If I and others can see the difference with one use, I will be looking fab in no time!!</li>
            <li> These are great scrubs pads, however, quite strong. Sometimes my face burns a little after using them. They are the closest pad I have found to what I used to have in the Neutrogena scrub pads for acne.</li>
            <li> This is the first ROC product I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I have been using it for alomost a week now. I am almost 40yrs old. Immediately after the first use, my skin looked noticably better...-tighter &amp; smoother. I have only found 1 other wash that did that (from Loreal that was discontinued). It has since remained that way - I look better. No noticable differences on wrinkles or anything, but it has only been a week. Does not dry out your skin...leaves a nice feel. I recommend moisturizing anyways afterwards. But even cooler was what it did for the skin elsewhere on my body. I have used them twice now, in the shower, on rough bumpy areas. For example, on my legs right above my knees..hips..shoulders, etc. And again, imediately the skin was smoothed. No exfolients or scrubbers had been able to do that for me! Which is weird because the pad does not feel super textured..Im not sure how or why it worked, but it did. Anyways-definently cut the pad in half to do your face...its way too soapy otherwise, and try it out on other parts-you may be surprised! I have already bought another jar and will be a faithful customer as long as they sell this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Ive been through a few jars now and no longer use it regularly. I did not have any lasting results or reduction in wrinkles but I do still use them here and there to smooth out my skin-especially in the winter. I will probably always keep a jar on me...but it will take a long time for me to get through it. I had it at 5 stars in the beginning but because of the lack of results Im lowering it to 3.</li>
            <li> I used these disks regularly before my wedding. I am a bit lazy to use them at night but once I get into a rhythem of using them regularly - I do see improvement :)</li>
            <li> I actually bought this from the clearance section of my local store and so honestly didn&#x27;t expect much, though with the RoC name, took a gamble.  WOW!  I love, love, love these little disks!  I have sensitive skin, prone to flakey dry patches, occasional break outs and yet an oily T-zone in the daytime. This product leaves your skin SUPER soft, no dry patches, no break outs, and no redness (like so many products).  I have philosophy&#x27;s microdermabrasion kit, and honestly I rather use RoC&#x27;s disks because of the ease and similar outcome. I have so far used this product for three weeks at about twice a week. The disks are rather large and I cut them in half and still get plenty of lather to do my face and neck.  I am extremely happy!</li>
            <li> I definitely see a difference!  I don&#x27;t have a lot of fine lines yet, I&#x27;m using this as preventative, but the few I do have are reduced after just a few weeks.  I love the way my skin feels and looks, and I notice my pores definitely look smaller.  Amazing results for the price!</li>
            <li> I was searching for a product for my girlfriend and stumbled upon this and decided to give it a try.  I am a 53 year old male and this product exceeding my expectations.  Within one week and can see a difference in my skin and my girlfriend says a look much younger.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this everyday for 3 years now and I am extremely happy.</li>
            <li> Love these face daily resurfacing disks. Makes my face tingle and feel really clean. I learned from another review to cut the pads in half. That is all you need.  Do I look younger?? To me yes but maybe no. My skin is glowing. I also use the day cream and night cream for my face. The day cream has SPF 30 which is a plus. I will keep buying  Roc products. Plus my Dermatologist who I see every 3 months for precancerous lesions says it is a good product to use. That made it official to me.</li>
            <li> these are great for my face ...they clean my face so well.</li>
            <li> I have reordered these discs several times and continue to be very pleased.  I am middle aged and have always had rough blemished skin that needs exfoliating.  I found these because I no longer wanted to use products with microbeads due to the environmental damage they cause.  My skin feels much smoother after using them and non greasy.  I recently had a professional facial and the cosmetician told me to keep using them (but not every day because they are pretty rough).</li>
            <li> This is a perfect product that really works. It always makes my face feel so creamy smooth and my skin is firmer. I&#x27;m very impressed with this product as it does just what Amazon says it will do. Great product and great place to buy it at.</li>
            <li> The 5 stars are true.I have been using this for the last week:)&lt;br /&gt;I am happy I found this product.&lt;br /&gt;The pads are 2 side useable and the are more than enough..I cut them in 3 lol.I have a small face.&lt;br /&gt;my skin is very dry but I get rashes very easy.I was concerned since I was having a breakout when I got them.I made my self courage and started.There is a little stingy feeling after I use it but it is worth.I use retin-a 20 min after the pads.I never use the rougher side because I have sensitive skin.Use the instructions never to dry ur face by wiping but by padding gently with a soft towel(gently press or if possible let air dry)&lt;br /&gt;my pores are smaller and my expression wrinkles are almost gone.I am 30 btw:)&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps because I am very thankful to all the 5 stars that helped me choose this product.&lt;br /&gt;Happy cleansing!!</li>
            <li> I had bought the ROC Multi Correction Night Treatment and was sold immediately. I was looking at the other ROC products because I loved that one so much and stumbled on these Resurfacing Disks. I&#x27;ve always had an issue with my pores, so I gave them a try and I am glad I did. My skin really feels ever so much softer and my pores look tiny after...very nice product. Does not dry out my skin at all. I cut the disks in half (as someone else recommended) so they last longer, one is way too big for just my face. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I love these facial cleaning discs. Great price too!</li>
            <li> I am just finishing my 2nd jar of these discs. I just signed up for auto delivery because it&#x27;s the cheapest way to do it. These exfoliate very well and prepare your skin to absorb your other creams and lotions. I stopped using them for a little while and noticed a difference right away. Learned my lesson and I&#x27;m back. I&#x27;m a fan of all the ROC products, just wish they were cheaper.</li>
            <li> Clean my face  very well and at the same time moisturize my skin.  My face looks healthy after I used  it.  Leave a nice sensation  of cleanness. I feel refresh and more youthful.  i really love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love this product. This leaves my face feeling extremely clean without over drying. I highly recommend anyone who has a  oily t-zone problem to try this.</li>
            <li> These are great! Not overly harsh, and the discs are large. I cut them in half and there is plenty of soap/suds to clean my face daily. So I can make this jar last for 2 months instead of one without feeling like I&#x27;m using less than needed.</li>
            <li> I have used RoC products before, but not this particular one.  This stuff is fantastic!  I&#x27;m not kidding!  I went to put some wrinkle/line filler in those pesky little lines around my mouth before applying lip stick like I usually do and I noticed I didn&#x27;t need to use as much.  I did a double take in the mirror.  The lines were smaller and this is the only new product I&#x27;ve added to my beauty regimen lately.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you should.  My skin is fair, and sensitive and I found that this was gentle enough for daily use.  So how, if I can use it daily and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin could it be reducing the wrinkles?  I have no idea but I will continue to use it.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Love the convenience, the aroma and the great job of sloughing and cleansing my face.</li>
            <li> These really make your face feel soft after using them. I use them once a day in the shower on my face, chest and arms. The pads are really big so you can use them all over if you wanted. I can tell a difference in my face so hopefully the longer I use them the more results I will see.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough bout the subscribe and save with auto ship that YOU control when it ships and can change or cancel at any time. Now to the product. It&#x27;s ROC...  said great product, works as stated and gentle on skin. U can cut pad in half doubling ur count because they are so generous with cleanser half a pad is quite sufficient.</li>
            <li> I found these about two years ago and highly recommend these to anyone! I have noticed that since I started using them my face is smoother and more youthful looking. I also used to get a lot of small skin tags on my neck before I started using them and I don&#x27;t get them anymore at all. It&#x27;s like the discs scrub them off before they start! These are totally amazing and can&#x27;t see how anyone would ever give them a bad review. They are always sold out in the stores and hard to find because they are such a gem. Don&#x27;t listen to any of the bad reviews out there, try them for yourself and you will see they are worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I love this product,my face is smoother and fine wrinkles on my face start to disappear.Will continue to use the Roc products.</li>
            <li> Love these!  Take off more makeup even after you have washed your face and think it is clean!  I order 3 at a time!  3 months supply!</li>
            <li> I did liked these disks before but now I love them.  This is my third jar and last weekend one of my sisters told me how refreshed, clear and good my face looked.  I had noticed a difference but thought it was because I wanted to, so when she mentioned it I figured it really was doing the job. I started out using every morning but now I use it every third time I wash my face now (I wash my face every morning and evening.  I also use the day cream, the night cream and the eye creme.  Super products.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for a great price. Huge disks which I cut in half when I use it.</li>
            <li> Great product... very easy to use! What a great tool for exfoliating. They really help remove dry, dull unwanted skin and leave a nice smooth texture that is blemish-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - I cut the disks in half because it will extend your product twice as long and this way works excellent for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 and still get acne, it&#x27;s rather frustrating. My skin is on the oily side; my skin gets congested and my pores get huge very easily.. which leads to dull skin, and breakouts. But I also have very sensitive skin. Daily exfoliation is important for my skin type, but the product has to be gentle enough. These disks win!! My skin is smooth, significantly less congested, and my pores look much smaller. My skin is more even looking (I have some discoloration due to past breakouts). I can use they every day and my sensitive skin is fine with it as well. I highly recommend these, I am buying more right now!</li>
            <li> I received this product partially opened, but the seal was barely leaking some of the liquid into the shipping bag.  Not enough leaked out to ruin the product which I&#x27;ve been using nearly every day to resuface my face and neck.  It&#x27;s gentle; has a great smell and works well with my other 2 RoC products.</li>
            <li> I expected a stack of pre-soaked pads with glycolic acid that I could swipe over my face every day. What arrived was more of a pain to use. First, the container is gigantic and ugly (like a small jar of peanut butter). Second, there are 28 disposable \\&quot;disks.\\&quot; (No number was mentioned in the product description, which I thought was odd.) Each disk is about 3x larger than a typical round cotton pad and bigger than necessary. The list of chemicals in the ingredients seemed really long and didn&#x27;t sound like any items I recognized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are to first wet your face, then wipe product over face, then rinse, which is two steps more than I anticipated. Yes, I&#x27;m that lazy... The pads are soapy and create lots of unnecessary lather. One side is rougher than the other, but it&#x27;s hard to tell. I had so much extra soap in the pad that I basically wiped my entire body since there was so much left over. Then it started to get sticky, so I ended up in the shower (again, another step). My skin burned a little, but no redness or other reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen results yet. Seems like a good value compared to similar products, but a soapy wash cloth could probably do the same thing with far fewer chemicals and a much lower cost.</li>
            <li> Received it in a timely manner. Creates a lot of suds and is reusable. I remove my makeup first and then use the disk....at least three separate times.  It says, to use once but save your money and use it again, and again. I just started using it so can&#x27;t tell you how well it works. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I put a regime on my face to get rid of dark spots and read about this product and thought about trying it. So far great, I can really feel my face smoorther and my dark spots are diminishing (of course with help of other products) but I do see a difference after I started using these.</li>
            <li> Great price. Fast delivery. Love this product</li>
            <li> They work great; make my face feel soft and clean. Pads are huge - as someone said previously, you can cut them in half - they&#x27;ll last longer and they are still plenty big (and thick) enough for easy use.</li>
            <li> I like these pads.  This is not my first order.  They help to exfoliate the skin on my face and keep it fresh looking.  I use them 2-3 times each week.</li>
            <li> Love this product, great cleansing and gentle, too.  I wish they hadn&#x27;t removed this as a add on item.</li>
            <li> My skin has always been problematic.  Sensitive and dry and irritable when I was younger, and then acne-prone through my 20&#x27;s and mid-30&#x27;s and just plain difficult for the past 7 years.  Even when I didn&#x27;t have pimples, my skin was red and blotchy and it always felt like I was about to have a breakout.  I have used Pro-Activ for several years, which helped, but not like ROC Resurfacing Disks!  For the first time in my life, my skin feels NORMAL.  No irritability, no red blotchies, and those breakouts that always seemed inevitable no matter how healthy I ate, have disappeared!  Like many of the other reviewers, my pores seem smaller, skin texture is waaay smoother and the even-ness of my skin tone looks like I did when I was in my teens (b4 I got zits)!!!  I&#x27;ve been using the disks for about 3 weeks and I can&#x27;t put into words how excited I am that I found this product or how effective it is!  Not sure how anyone could give this less than 4 stars---it does what its claims say it does.  It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re going to look 20 years younger (it isn&#x27;t a facelift), but you&#x27;ll sure feel fresher and more youthful after a couple weeks of use.  I&#x27;d bet money that there are a lot of other products out there that cost 10 times more but are one-tenth as effective as ROC Resurfacing Disks!  Seriously, for $8 how can you not try it?!</li>
            <li> I think I like them but have only used for a few days.  I cut in half and lather it up, it works well, but too soon to see difference.  What I was concerned about is the seal was broken on top and I do not like that when applying something to my face.  I also dont know if enough moisture is left in container to keep product useful.  Disappointed in possibly not new product.</li>
            <li> I started using these pads every night upon receiving them, and I got a pretty bad rash and some dry patching. So, I dropped my usage down to twice a week, and my skin stays exfoliated and smooth. And I like the smell. Not great for sensitive skin, but still a good product in general.</li>
            <li> These are amazing resurfacing disks. My skin clears up quickly with regular use.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time</li>
            <li> Excellent value. For less than $5 per month, I can cleanse, condition and exfoliate my face! These discs are excellent at removing makeup and impurities. The best part is that they are HALF of what they would normally cost at the supermarket or drug store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sooooo glad I bought these and tried them out I will be buying these again for sure, I love them. They are amazing. They are totally inexspensive, they work wonders for my skin, and for my daughters skin. They are magical they work sooo good. I usually am soooo into organic ingredients for my skin and body but with these I don&#x27;t even care what is in them because the results of my face are sooo good. They moisturized, cleaned all the oiliness, they do it all. I&#x27;m going to order some more for me and my daughter. Great Product.</li>
            <li> My skins feels completely smooth and clean after using these, but they&#x27;re very gentle.</li>
            <li> This is a good  product for me.</li>
            <li> I keep a supply of these disks.  It seems to be the only product that keeps my face clean!</li>
            <li> This product removes rough skin.  Is Gentle and I feel my face is really clean and smooth after every use.</li>
            <li> Feels great on your face with no after-effects. Great for anyone with oily skin. As others have suggested, please cut them in half to save more!</li>
            <li> Use it every night seems to be working skin feelings soft and clean keep using i&#x27;ll no more as I use it more!</li>
            <li> I have been using ROC products since early 20&#x27;s.  My dermatologist in Canada more than 30 years ago gave me a copy of top skin care products and told me to use ROC as it showed better results than Lancome, Este Lauder and any top brands.  I&#x27;m now 54 years old and most people think I am still in my late 20&#x27;s or early 30&#x27;s.  Young men hit on me thinking I&#x27;m about their age.  I tell them I have a son about their age and they cannot believe it.  Once, I was buying Roc in Walgreens and this young lady cannot make up her mind which product to use.  I told her to use ROC but she looked at me and asked why.  I told her I have been using that product for more than 30 years and that I am in my 50&#x27;s.  She was so amazed because she thought I was her age. And she said &amp;#34;If I can look like you at your age…&amp;#34; She immediately picked up the ROC skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best so use it everyone!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 months and see a great improvement in the clarity and health of my skin.I&#x27;ve always had good skin but never have I received so many compliments on my skin as I have since I began using the Roc products.I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> These have a wonderfully pleasant scent and make my pores look smaller.  They also make your face feel so clean.  I use these normally as part of my nightly ritual and then I put on some Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Any time I use these they make me break out. The product smells great and you really feel like you&#x27;re getting your face clean but there&#x27;s something about the cleanser in them that my skin just doesn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Love these! I keep them in the shower to use them every day. I have sensitive skin, and I have not had a bad reaction from these. In fact, when I broke out from the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Night Cream, using these disks helped to scrub off the dried skin and help my skin to heal more quickly.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE makeup and skincare addict.  Seriously, it&#x27;s my life.  I do crazy things like order skincare products from foreign countries far away.  Things made with the ooze of snails and the venom of bees.  Things you might shudder at.  These are absolutely phenomenal.  They are gentle, yet they provide as much manual exfoliation as you could ever need on any kind of semi-regular basis.  (Ladies &amp; Gents, PLEASE stop scrubbing the dickens out of your skin -- I can hear it screaming from here.  Proper exfoliation is a combo of AHA and BHA, NOT 60-grit sandpaper.  NOT battery acid, or rock salt, or lemon juice or ANY of those wackadoo things you&#x27;ve hear are great. They&#x27;re not.  They just make your skin very, very angry!!).  These are LOVELY.  They smell absolutely wonderful, they are both gentle and effective.  They are worth every penny.  My goodness, I love these SO. MUCH.  Buy them now.  NOW!!!!</li>
            <li> Start using this by late 20&#x27;s! Thank you labellinda for including skin tags in your review - I&#x27;m sold! The review are always my way of purchasing anything. For skin care and repair products it really helps when a reviewer includes their age. As a former costmetic consultant I can assure you a repair product works very differently on a 28 yr old than a 57 yr old. OOPS just revealed my age:)PS - I&#x27;ve used very expensive retinol. The cream works as well if not better than some.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these discs!  They are large, not too abrasive and no offensive odor.  You will not be disappointed.  My face feels smooth and silky after using them!</li>
            <li> These pads are BIG and full of product.  I cut them in half and it is still more than big enough to cleanse the entire face and then some. It leaves my face feeling soft, clean and healthy.  It gives a nice rosy glow to my normally pale face.  My intention when I bought this was for a quick face wash, but I find myself massaging my face for much longer than necessary because I know my cheeks will be rosy and I&#x27;ll have a shiny (in a good way) glow when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took away one star because I haven&#x27;t yet seen any reduction of wrinkles but it&#x27;s only been a few days and hope springs eternal!</li>
            <li> These are great. I&#x27;ve never been huge on face wash and never had any issues with pimples but I use one after a workout and it gets all the sweat off my face and can tell it really cleans out your pores well.</li>
            <li> Beautiful fresh fragrance.  Skin feels thoroughly cleaned after you use it.  I&#x27;m very happy to be able to use the soft side to remove eye makeup.</li>
            <li> This is one skin care product i strongly recommend--it is awesome.  Before ordering I read another reviewers suggestion to cut the pads in half to save some $$, and she was right--the pads are big for a single use--half the pad works great.  I will continue to use this product religiously--it really does make a difference with consistent use-and the accompanying moisture/night creams.</li>
            <li> Have been using these RoC resurfacing disks for awhile and&lt;br /&gt;love the difference they have made on my skin!  I will&lt;br /&gt;certainly keep buying !!</li>
            <li> Cut in half to last even longer! I&#x27;m 34 &amp; \\&quot;had\\&quot; very flaky dry skin with fine lines. This transformed my skin in one use, after I washed it off I immediately apply my serum &amp; moisturizer. My skin feels amazing &amp; looks better, can&#x27;t wait to see what long term use does. I just put a little water on my face before using it, use in circular motion all over face &amp; neck at least 2 min, you can feel it working! I would recommend to all my friends :) p.s. I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Item shipped very fast and exactly as described. Do recommend cutting pads in half, more then enough cleansing solution on a half of pad.</li>
            <li> Like many reviewers, cutting these in half saves money and is perfectly adequate for using. The only negative I&#x27;ve noticed is that the cleanser in it makes my lips incredibly dry. (I don&#x27;t use the actual product on my lips, but the lather that accumulates makes them dry). Easy remedy when I remember is to slather on lip balm prior to using the RoC disks to create a barrier.</li>
            <li> Just recently started using ROC products, I use this about twice a week along with all the other ROC Resurfacing Products, it helps exfoliate your skin</li>
            <li> These pads are amazing! I only use 3 times a week and I see a major difference in my face, I get compliments too! I also use the eye cream in this brand and I am in love with it!</li>
            <li> Have only been using these for a week so far in conjunction with a whole new facial regimen. Great for washing off oil and make-up, but the exfoliating side is not so great at exfoliating. Would be better to use another product or buffing pad for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year and love it.  I have very sensitive skin but I am still able to use this.  I follow this with ROC Deep Wrinkle Repair. I bought this as an add on to get free shipping but it was actually less than I pay for it at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I love this facial cleanser.  It does a great job. Almost like a chemical peel, but not quite.  Leaves skin smooth and tight.  Also great to travel with.  Put it in an airtight container and it is not liquid.  I use a small tupperware container and cut the pads in half. A ziplock bag will also work.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I am Really Enjoying this product , I will Reorder</li>
            <li> Just starting using this it is very gentle, yet effective!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get in mouth tastes horrid but I love the product, have noticed a differance all ready, been using three weeks</li>
            <li> I would like to like this product but I Can not enjoy the benefits knowing that  innocent animals may be subjected to tests and locked in a cage.  I will pass!  There are many products that are cruelty free, We just have to be aware and search them out and if enough people voice this maybe the companies who choose to do this will listen.</li>
            <li> These are great to clean your skin after a long day. It&#x27;s the only cleaner that actually takes off all my makeup and cleans my face thoroughly. One side is rough to exfoliate your skin, so it&#x27;s like a 2 in 1. I love this line of products!</li>
            <li> These made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it daily since I got it.  My skin feels cleaner and it did reduce some blemishes on my chin area.  I will continue using it to the end of the pads to give it a final review.</li>
            <li> Too much juice in these. One reviewer suggested cutting in half.  I actually cut into quarters and find this provides enough liquid to cover my entire face. Leaves skin feeling smooth and looking even.</li>
            <li> I cut them in half like others have done.  Can&#x27;t imagine using a whole one because they are loaded with liquid.  The so-called &amp;#34;rough side&amp;#34; to me is actually pretty smooth so I was not pleased with exfoliation.  it did make my face squeaky, shiny clean.  does not help with wrinkles or age spots.</li>
            <li> Best resurfacing product out there.&lt;br /&gt;Results instantly, smoother skin, more refined and less wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to everyone.Try It Now.</li>
            <li> Another one of my favorite products to use from this line! Never change RoC!</li>
            <li> RoC Daily resurfacing pads were an impulse buy based off a friends recommendation. Upon receiving them, I noticed the container to be wet and smell like cleaning product. Turns out, the seal had broken open so some of the liquid had leaked out during shipping. I was worried, thinking they would quickly dry up, but I have not found any problem with the solution being too dry. Each pad keeps getting  more and more wet as I work my way down the neatly stacked pile of pads inside. The lid screws on, but also has a lift-up tab to use more easily, especially when your eyes are closed after splashing your face before you use one. The smell is nice. One side is smooth and the other has the smallest bumps on it, although both sides feel smooth and I don&#x27;t consider the &#x27;rough&#x27; side to be exfoliating at all. What surprised me about this item is that after I had spent a minute or so scrubbing my face, I opened my eyes and there wasn&#x27;t any foamy soap or anything. The product is clear. It feels lathered on my face, but there is nothing to see. I know it&#x27;s on my face, because it stings my eyes ever so slightly when I open them to turn on the faucet. The best part is how nice my skin feels afterward. My face feels very smooth. I&#x27;ve only used this product for 4-5 days, so I can&#x27;t tell how well it is doing on preventing break-outs, but the texture of my face feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I like these disks.  My face feels so clean and smooth after using them.  My complexion is quite clear now, too, though it wasn&#x27;t that bad to begin with.  I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say it&#x27;s a miracle, but my skin does feel a lot better: smoother and more balanced.</li>
            <li> It did not work for my skin type</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to help with my complexion. I am a 38 year old woman with some fine lines and hyperpigmentation. After using the discs for nearly a month I am happy to say that I am more than pleased with the results of this product. My face looks much more clear and I feel less self conscience when I go bare faced to my workout class at 6 A.M. I used to use a tinted BB cream before leaving the house and now I just put on my SPF moisturizer and I&#x27;m out the door. I am also using the ROC Retinol Correction Deep Wrinkle Night Cream with this and I am getting remarkable results. ROC has been around for many, many years and has been giving me better results than I have ever experienced with any high end beauty product.</li>
            <li> I like all the ROC products. I had never tried this and really like how clean and smooth it leaves my skin</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth now! I love it. I dont have as many break outs and the redness is fading! I like these disk a lot. I do cut them in half to cut down on cost. I have only used this product for about 3 weeks, but my face is brighter and feels smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat purchaser of these cleansing discs. I like them alot. I just keep the jar in the shower stall and use them daily as part of my shower routine.  Couldn&#x27;t be more simple!</li>
            <li> My pre teens were not remembering to wash their faces real well and started to break out.  I put these in their shower and they use them every day and their skin is clear.&lt;br /&gt;Wish they came in a larger package as this does not last even a month for one.</li>
            <li> The cleansing pads do not dry out the skin.  The cleansing pads feel nice on the skin of the face.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be really helpful in removing my blackheads, much more helpful than AHA-exfoliators. Would definitely recommend. The only weird thing is that the jar is really large, and the disks take only about half the space, a bit misleading</li>
            <li> Works very nicely and leaves my skin soft.  I think it cleans much better than a wash cloth.  A nice cleansing disk.</li>
            <li> I have not used a lot of facial cleansers and this one is so easy and leaves your face feeling soft. I need to order more.</li>
            <li> I actually use this product on my legs and it effectively prevents ingrown hairs.  I have sensitive skin as well and never have a problem with this product.  I have been purchasing the product at Target and they seem to have discontinued it, which is actually the main reason I was shopping there in the first place.  Love this product and will continue to purchase through amazon.com</li>
            <li> I did not buy this product on Amazon, however I always read the reviews here first before trying new products. Thanks Amazon for allowing reviews.. its very helpful!! First I cut my pads in half like another reviewer suggested, I wash my face with them, and then I also use the rough side on my hands. I have noticed some difference in my face (which I already take good care of) but my hands... WOW! They are soft and supple. Ladies don&#x27;t forget to take care of your hands because they can give away your age just as much as your face. I have lately developed the habit of carrying over all of my face routines to my hands as well. I want to look younger everywhere. :)</li>
            <li> I feel that this is a satisfactory product. My skin feels fresh, clean, and soft after each use. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really love using these. They do as they say, and really clean my face well. I&#x27;ve not noticed any particular overdrying or flaking which I was afraid of. They soap up very foamy and the pads are quite large. I wish I could use one pad more than once so they last longer, but I don&#x27;t think they are made for that. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looking clearer and cleaner after using them for about a month.</li>
            <li> A very pleasant feeling after cleaning my face with these disks. Not so rough that it peels your face but leaves the skin nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I loved these disks; it makes my facial cleaning routine a snap. One disk is plenty to clean your face and neck, and I liked the fact that it&#x27;s double side lets you choose between a deep scrub or a gentle cleanse. It has a pleasant smell and the skin looks great afterwards. It is a good product and will looking to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face once every few days, but my great discovery is that it works so well on my hands, which have taken a beating since I am a potter by profession, gardener by choice and a horse rider for sheer love of it. This stuff really makes a difference.  I use it on my face and then on the top of my hands and then around the nails, where I get really scaly and dirty---its great--once done I can oil my hands and nails and they look and feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> Not really a review, but a tip. If you cut these in half they give you plenty of soap and foaming action and surface area for cleaning your face. They&#x27;ll last twice as long and work just as well.</li>
            <li> Oh man this stuff is good. One side is flat, and the other side has raised bubbles for exfoliating. It gets ALL of my eye makeup off, which can be a good bit. It can be a bit on the drying side, so make sure you put on moisturizer after using.</li>
            <li> These make my skin super soft and smooth.  The disks are huge and very foamy.  You can cut these into half or even 4th&#x27;s to save money without sacrificing having enough to use.  I usually prefer the wipes that do not need rinsed..but these are a lot more cleansing I notice.</li>
            <li> I am a 50-year-old Caucasian female.  My skin type is fair to medium.  I generally have pretty good skin although sun damaged from living in So. California.  I have some forehead wrinkles but not severe.  Very fine eye lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past few years my face skin has gotten very dry, especially around the cheek area near my nose.  Over the past year I developed a strange rash across my upper cheeks, and across the bridge of my nose.  It is similar to a butterfly rash or Lupus rash.  It also resembles rosacea.  It is dry and has flaky patches.  I have tried numerous creams and soaps to get rid of it, to no avail. (should see a dermatologist)  I have even tried rosacea creams as well as creams for eczema and still nothing has made any difference.  I was about to just give up. I took a chance and ordered this product.  Oh My God!  I have used it three times now, at night at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Night: I cut them in half as suggested by many other reviews and it is definitely enough to use on your entire face and neck,.  It smells very nice and is not overpowering.  It smells clean.  I used the rough side first going over my entire face, including my eyelids!  After about 3 minutes I notice a tingling sensation, which makes me uncomfortable because I&#x27;m afraid it is too harsh.  After about another minute using the smooth side I rinse my face with warm water then pat dry with a bath towel.  Then, in about 3 more minutes I can feel my face tighten up.  The first time I was really scared because my skin is so dry anyway and I figured this was going to make it worse.  After the first use, after about 30 minutes, I looked in the mirror expecting the worst and was really surprised.  The redness and rash I have been fighting for at least a year now looked &amp;#34;calmer&amp;#34; than usual.  I still wasn&#x27;t convinced and went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second Night: Same routine, same tingling sensation, same skin tightening.  Noticed NO drying so far.  Redness and rash is definitely improved.  Also, I NOTICED THE SKIN ON MY EYELIDS IS GETTING LIGHTER!!!!! Something I never expected!  I assumed my eyelids were just stained from so many years of wearing eyeshadow and I just accepted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third Night: Same routine, same tingling sensation, same skin tightening.  NO DRYING!  Redness and rash are almost GONE! HOLY COW!!!!!!  My eyelids are almost the same color as the rest of my face!  Never did I ever expect this!!!  My skin feels crazy soft tonight to the point where I don&#x27;t want to touch it.  I pulled my hair back because I don&#x27;t want anything to touch it and ruin this great feeling!  My face has NEVER felt this clean, not even with dermabrasion and skin vacuuming treatments.  I&#x27;m absolutely shocked that my face has not gotten dry.  I haven&#x27;t even used any creams and the dry patchy red spots are darn near gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the heck is in this stuff????  I am SOLD, after just three uses in three days.  I&#x27;ll come back in a week or two and do an update but for now I will be buy this over and over again.  I wish I had found it sooner as it would have saved me a ton of time and money and research trying to fix my face skin problems.  I don&#x27;t know what the heck is in this but it is working for me!!!!  Apparently it is cheaper buying from your local stores, but I like the convenience of Amazon so will order again from here.sh is definitely improved.

            <li> I found these disks a bit annoying.  There was so much stuff on them, I found myself wringing them out before using.  Kind of defeats the purpose.  Other than that, they were fine, just not to my liking.  I really wanted something that I wouldn&#x27;t have to rinse off afterward.</li>
            <li> I love these disks and order them all the time. I use them to &amp;#34;sand off&amp;#34; my fine lines. My husband uses them because he has sensitive face skin that often gets dry and red blotches on it. Since using this product we&#x27;ve both seen a great improvement of our skin.</li>
            <li> love this product -as I have said before ROC delivers!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mum, who is now 72 years old. Hearing so much about Roc, I decided to give my mum a try. In Singapore, we are unable to get certain Roc product such as this and after checking with the sales HQ in Singapore, I was told that Singapore Roc product follows Europe standard and that is why some of the USA Roc prdt cannot be brought in. My mum said she read Singapore news articles on Roc prdt where a commentary came from a local dotor was good. My mum had started using this for the 3rd day and she said its good. Her wrinkles has diminished. She is also using the Max twin tube and eye correction cream. Yesterday notice her face was more radiant and smooth than normal days.</li>
            <li> I use all of the RoC products and I have to tell you, that with the wrinkles I had, I didn&#x27;t think anything would work! My grand kids always mentioned my wrinkles and I felt so AWEFUL about myself inside and out. The other day, they asked me where did my wrinkles go? My skin is virtually wrinkle free now and I&#x27;ve only been using the line for about 6 weeks. Wonderful product line! Can&#x27;t wait to see my results in 6 more weeks. I&#x27;m a customer for life!</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Exfoliates skin to bring a youthful appearance.  I have very sensitive skin and this did not dry out my skin</li>
            <li> I love these pads!  My face is baby-smooth at 60 years old.  I am cheap and cut them in fourths, which works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many facial wash products and so far I find 2 I like best: this RoC Daily resurfacing disks and the Shiseido ultimate cleansing oil.  This product removes the roughness of my T-zone area and leaves my pores feel free of whiteheads.  However, the downside is you will need to use this either daily or every other day...which eventually can be a bit expensive.  I recommend using it every other day because it is a bit rough for the skin.  I like the soft side better and only use the rough side of the disks on my nose.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever wash my face with another product!</li>
            <li> I love that I can use this all over my face, even my eye area. It does a very nice job of cleansing and resurfacing. Not too drying, pleasant scent. It actually seems to do what it advertises to do, which when it comes to skin care is rare for me. As another reviewer said, you can cut these in half to get more usage from the package. I purchased mine here on Amazon, it was only a few cents less than off the shelf at Walmart. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent, I too cut them in half as I could not afford to use if I didn&#x27;t. They leave your face feeling very good. Not sure if they help fine lines or not but I will keep using them for a while and see.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product.  My skin looks and feels very smooth but not too dry after I use this.</li>
            <li> No, you&#x27;re not going to look younger, but you skin will have a distinctive glow that people actually notice. I use this product in the morning - it&#x27;s a good way to start the day. Then use the deep wrinkle serum, followed by Olay regenerist (in the red jar). Very high quality, low costing beauty routine.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, the 3 stars are for me not being able to use it.  My skin is to sensitive for this, but I could feel and see a difference.</li>
            <li> I love this product- I use it every day and have noticed such a difference in my skin. I used to use all kinds of face brushes and exfoliating products, but haven&#x27;t used them since using this. I have very dry skin, and used to have a &amp;#34;flaky&amp;#34; appearance. Now my skin looks and feels smooth, which makes my make-up look better. I still use moisturizing serums and moisturizers, but this is the only cleansing product I use. Thank you very much. Sharon</li>
            <li> I love this product for a good cleansing disk to use in the shower.  I have purchased this twice from my local pharmacy.  Amazon offers it at a better price and quick delivery.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Love these things they are the best my skin stays so smooth can&#x27;t go without them. One of rocs best products. I would recommend for sure.</li>
            <li> Each pad has alot of lather but the lather is soft. First I wash my face with the pad right over the sink because it drips alot. I don&#x27;t even bother adding water. Its unnecessary. Then I use the scrub side. Then I wring it out and take off some of my eye makeup. It&#x27;s not designed to get off eye makeup and it really only takes off half but I don&#x27;t want to waste the pad. If I have a whitehead or little pimple coming in, it really can&#x27;t because of the scrubbing side. Since I use this everyday, I really don&#x27;t get whiteheads anymore because they get taken away by the scrubbing side. I got a teeny little pit because I had this huge random pimple when I first started using these pads and it didn&#x27;t stand a chance when I started in with the scrubber side.</li>
            <li> i love the way it make my skin feel and look. This is now a apart of my regular rountin. Ordering more soon</li>
            <li> Works fine and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re improving my skin at all, but I do like using them when I&#x27;m in a hurry to go to bed and I don&#x27;t feel like washing my face.  These lather up real good and are quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Great for travel. I throw a few in a baggie, seal it up, and I&#x27;m good to go for a weekend of travel,</li>
            <li> It is a good night moisturizer and that is how I have used it.  I like that the cream is fast absorbing and doesn&#x27;t stay greasy on the skin for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use it again as I found it to be a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I started using ROC products a few years ago. I purchased them from the department store or online with other suppliers. I couldn&#x27;t believe how much more affordable these products are at Amazon. I started seeing real results within a couple of weeks, and after 6 weeks there really was a noticeable difference. I&#x27;m 65 years old and have tried the most expensive to the least, and this product line is the one I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These are ok...I dont think they do anything miraculous but I do like the convenience factor. I would probably buy again.</li>
            <li> this product is very good, would buy it again</li>
            <li> It was great this time, it seems the last ones were all dried out...so frustrating.  These are fine.  Thank you very much. My delivery for September is NOT necessary. Sealed. Sweet.</li>
            <li> If used daily, this product is very drying to your skin.  I would recommend using once or twice a week, followed by heavy moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it will work in an instant,&lt;br /&gt;but after a couple of weeks you will see a difference in your skin.  Mine looks softer and feel wonderful.  Tightened my skin and cleared my pores.  I just set up renewed delivery each month.  Worth the try.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders on my neck! 1 1\2 week use of the pad resulted in a really noticeable difference in dark lines/wrinkles on my neck-- a nice surprise! I used the pads twice a day, using one pad both times (kept it in fridge 1during the day to save $ and not wasted the product). Definitely felt a tingle and tightening in my skin, seems to tighten and refine skin but it ENHANCED fine lines around eyes.:(( I am an African American with a light complexion prone to hyperpigmentation, with a tendency towards sensitive easily reddened and dry skin w/ small amounts of monthly acne. This product made my skin tighten and it feels like its working, I will update after a few more months of continuous use, it is the first ROC product I have tried and I like it, has a soapy scent that dissipates quickly, I prefer to use products that are as organic and natural as possible, but I am willing to trade that in for success. Best of luck to you.</li>
            <li> These work for me.  They are just enough to slough off delicately and give me a fresh clean feeling face.</li>
            <li> i use it three times a week in the shower to help scrub my face.  It feels wonderful!!  I have bought it several times and have it on my reorder list!</li>
            <li> This product is the best of it&#x27;s kind and you don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune to get a spa-quality exfoliation done on your facial skin. I have somewhat dry skin that can be sensitive if treated too harshly by products or too much abrasion. If used in the right frequency (I&#x27;d say no more than twice a week is all most women should need if you moisturize your skin properly in the morning and evenings), this product is PERFECT. Also, the pads are HUGE and unless you have a face the size of Shrek, you&#x27;d be throwing your money away by using a whole one. I cut them into quarters...tried thirds at first and still had too much. But 1/4 of a pad is plenty to exfoliate my facial area each time. I pre-cut a bunch of them at one time and replace them in the jar so they are ready to go. Just be sure to keep the lid on tight so that they don&#x27;t dry out...I&#x27;m not sure that you&#x27;d ever be able to get the right ratio of liquid back in by adding water. After doing my exfoliating treatment with these (and rinsing/drying), I immediately moisturize my face using a serum type moisturizer so it can really soak into my skin immediately after all the dead skin is removed. My skin just glows. If you see a lot of redness after using these, you might be scrubbing too hard...try easing up a bit. You shouldn&#x27;t have to use much pressure at all. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Okay, not sure I&#x27;d reorder. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> Harsh for My skin type</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with every RoC product I have tried, and these disks are no exception. They are like the Cadillac of disposable make-up removers/ skin cleansers, a far cry from the thin little towelettes in the plastic pouches I have tried before. Each thick pad is thoroughly saturated with cleanser, they foam up nicely, and the soft side is gentle enough to use to remove mascara and eye make-up, while the textured side invigorates and refreshes like a mini facial. Now that I am getting older I have developed a keen appreciation for skin care, and this is one of my top five products I would recommend to anyone who wants to keep their skin looking its best. Excellent!</li>
            <li> Good Value for a Great Product!  These ROC resurfacing disks are not as rough on skin as a scrub, but still get your face nice and clean and you can tell they exfoliate well.  They are larger discs, so plenty to wash your face then use on your neck ... and anywhere else you want your skin exfoliated.</li>
            <li> I took the advice of others and cut these pads in half. They&#x27;re plenty big and you can get more use by just using half of one. I like that one side is a bit rougher so you can clean deeper with the scrubby side and then flip over to use the smooth side for a softer cleansing. They suds up really good so you feel like you&#x27;re getting all of the makeup and dirt off.</li>
            <li> After washing my face I wanted to see how much was left behind so I washed my face then used the disk.&lt;br /&gt;Woww !!!! It works. The disks gets what regular soap and water doesn&#x27;t.I highly recommend cutting the disk into. The disks are big and it also makes them last longer. I well forever use them . Very satisfied !!!</li>
            <li> I love these little pads, My skin seems to like them just as much as i do.  Product is easy to use and the results are outstanding.  Skin looks healthy .  Easy on my sensitive skin as well.  I ran out and could not wait to get more.  This price is even more amazing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely marvelous works wonders! Does exactly what it says, I&#x27;m a tough rater but this is one of my all time favorites!!!</li>
            <li> The pads (there are 28 of them) are thicker than I was expecting - this is a good thing. They really \\&quot;suds up\\&quot; - even without wetting your skin first. The smell is pleasant and the suds rinse off easily and cleanly. I used the smooth side first, then used the textured side for exfoliating. My face was a little pink/red where I was more aggressive - so these can really do a good job of exfoliating. My facial pores did, in fact, look smaller/tighter after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something to do a quick and easy exfoliation - and these do the trick for me. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> The ROC resurfacing disks come nicely packaged in a sealed plastic jar and are surprisingly large for a facial pad. I have been using these for nearly a month and my skin is already transformed. My pores appear smaller, discolorations have faded and blemishes are no longer an issue.&lt;br /&gt;Each disk has a rough side and smooth side, so if you have sensitive skin you can still use these to exfoliate. The foaming liquid that the disks are soaked in has a pleasant smell and there is plenty in the jar to last until the end. I actually have quite a bit left over in the bottom after using all the disks.&lt;br /&gt;This product is inexpensive for what it accomplishes!</li>
            <li> I have a friend that swears by these (who now has the rest of my jar).  While they definitely left my skin smoother and more polished, they were too drying for me (at 65, would have been perfect in my younger years).  Liked the hint I saw elsewhere to cut them in half -- perfect.  Do the same and save yourself some $.</li>
            <li> Product is great but they changed the lid to a cheaper version so now you have to unscrew the lid to get pads instead of just popping the top open. I like the exfoliating side of these a lot; not too harsh but still does a great job.</li>
            <li> These work great! I can see a huge difference, my skin looks brighter and younger. Cut the disks in half, you will only need half as they lather up really well.</li>
            <li> Love these - my skin feels smoother.  I love the scent and the feel of the pads.  I tend to over-scrub my face, but even if I do that with these, my skin is not left feeling dried out or irritated.  Like the idea of cutting them in half, too.</li>
            <li> I bought the Dove SkinVitalizer Facial Cleansing Massager and the Exfoliating Pillows are very expensive. The Roc Resurfacing Disks fit on the Dove product and they work amazingly. My skin feels so soft and it gives a deep clean.</li>
            <li> I guess I expected a little more than an face scrub pad can do. I thought the procuct was ok, but it didnt really do anything different for my skin or complection than just a little squirt of body wash on a cloth does. The pads are less abrasive than I thought they would be, on the one side. They are thick and smell good, but I wont be purchasing them again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of ROC products and after reading all the good reviews for this product I had to try it! So far it has worked good for me. You can feel and see the difference in the your skin after a few uses. I did breakout a bit in the beginning but it could be that my skin is more sensitive than others. I use one disk for my entire body. One disk goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> These cleansing pads are amazing!  They leave my skin very smooth.  I use many ROC products and for the price these really are great value.  They are large, I cut them in half to get more days out of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a week, and I&#x27;ve had great results already. I keep the jar in my shower, and use them in the morning;  I follow up with my toner and moisturizer. My skin stays very smooth and firm ALL DAY LONG! I love them so much, that I hide them from my teenage daughters. Don&#x27;t bother buying them from anywhere else, Amazon beats all other prices I&#x27;ve found. Great product :)</li>
            <li> I just got these a few days ago, and already my skin is softer and smoother. It cleans off all my makeup, and the softer side is gentle enough for the eye area, and I love the exfoliating side. It&#x27;s not too harsh either like other products. My only thing I&#x27;d change about it, is that I&#x27;d make it about 2/3&#x27;s of the size it is, I tried cutting in half like other reviewers suggested, and it might be just a tad bit small. Other than that, I love it, and I will be reordering this regularly!</li>
            <li> I looked at all of the reviews before buying...they seemed so good especially since ROC products are highly recommended. These discs were easy and left my face clean but after a few days a fine rash developed betweeen my eyebrows then down my nose as I continued to use.  Also my skin showed no change....&lt;br /&gt;If convenience is what you are looking for it is this ...I take them on trips to avoid the liquids at airport. But they did not \\&quot;resurface\\&quot;my face.</li>
            <li> Will likely buy again</li>
            <li> These disks work well for cleaning the face. Skin looks better and pores a slight bit smaller after use.&lt;br /&gt;I must caution those who are sensitive to fragrance that this product is very strongly scented.&lt;br /&gt;All in all a decent product.</li>
            <li> Paid too much for this product for it to not to perform better. Many products on the market that a way less expensive and do a better job. Don,t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell the longterm effects of this product however it makes my skin feel super clean and soft :)</li>
            <li> Coming across this product was a happy accident for me - bought them by accident but decided to give them a try and LOVED them. It says visible results after consistent use for a week, which is true, but I could FEEL the results after just one use.  Definitely by the end of the week my forehead creases were less visible and my skin was just brighter in general.  I&#x27;m 31 and just started seeing forehead creases and soft lines around my eyes in the last year or so and freaked out - this product, if used diligently, is a godsend for me.  Definitely must use with a good moisturizer but generally speaking, a fantastic product.  Even takes my eye make-up off clean without leaving  smearing or flaking.  Love them.  Love, love!</li>
            <li> i like the price (i used to use PTR products) and the scrub surface on the pads. my skin looks nice and tight after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;downside is all the harmful preservatives.</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin like I do this product isn&#x27;t for you. My face would breakout just wasnt a good fit for my skin .You can still try it it could work for you</li>
            <li> great product, I have seen a difference in my complexion within 2 days.  I would definately tell my friends and family about this.</li>
            <li> Great purchase for exfoliating and not too harsh for my sensitive skin. I can use it at least two times a week.</li>
            <li> I just finished using one jar of these disks and although there weren&#x27;t any drastic improvements in my skin, it was still a nice and thorough exfoliator. It is very sudsy so I was able to use it on my face, shoulders and neck. Even after 28 days of daily usage, my face would tingle for the first few seconds of the disks touching my face but this was true only for my facial area skin. Used the exfoliating side for entire face and smooth side for eye area as recommended. The exfoliating side is not so gentle so DO NOT USE AROUND EYE AREA. I mistakenly swiped my right eye with the exfoliating side and although I realized it right away and it was just one swipe, I did irritate the eye lid severely. I mostly only wear eyeliner and makeup removers irritate my acne prone skin. I used the smooth side to clean my eyes and it didn&#x27;t make me tear up like soap does. Although, I don&#x27;t know if that will be true for everybody.  Overall I recommend this product because it is good for cleaning the face and getting off makeup and dirt very easily.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling this jar will last awhile! Many people cut their pads in two, I actually do in 4&#x27;s. For the price and the quality, I&#x27;m very pleased! They feel so exfoliating and you know your decreasing fine lines as well. I&#x27;m trying to use smart products like these as a preventative method. Thanks RoC..</li>
            <li> Like ROC it is a good product and most of us like it.  There are some better but it does what it needs to.</li>
            <li> I plan to write a review again in a few weeks, but after just ONE use, my skin is softer &amp; smoother than ever!&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend doing what another reviewer did: cut these discs in half, as they are large enough to do so &amp; will last that much longer.</li>
            <li> I got this product to help with my aging skin. Turns out it helps with acne as well. my face cleared up as about the second time i used it. i cant say that it has help much in the aging area but sure happy that it helps with the other</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the other favorable reviews. Wow! I am so glad I did. I am a 53 year old women. I don&#x27;t have any discoloration and have pretty good skin due to staying away from the sun and being a non-smoker. What I noticed first was the improved texture of my skin. After two weeks, my skin looks incredible! Sloughing off all those dead skin cells as really improved the overall appearance and my skin looks renewed and bright. I also cut the disks in half as half the disk is sufficient for removing my make-up and cleansing my face. I love that it&#x27;s an all in one process. The smooth side does a great job of removing my eye make-up and the textured side exfoliates the rest of my face. I just splash water on my face to rinse and I&#x27;m done.  I am generally lazy about removing make-up at the end of the day and don&#x27;t really like multi step routines. If you&#x27;re the same way, then this product is for you. My face didn&#x27;t become irritated. I had one pimple that came out on my forehead, but I figured it was due to all the impurities being drawn out. It went away quickly. My make-up applies great in the morning. I couldn&#x27;t be any more pleased with this OTC product. Do not hesitate to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I liked these, made your face and neck feel really clean, have a delicate and a rough surface, just splash water to the area and use. i did face neck top of chest and arms with this product, easy peasy.</li>
            <li> I was very doubtful when i saw the reviews but i had to try it and I&#x27;m so amazed by the results! I&#x27;m definitely buying things after reading reviews. I highly recommend it if you have alot of spots you want removed but be patient! It won&#x27;t happen over night.</li>
            <li> Great product, very happy will order again</li>
            <li> This product by ROC is the best I&#x27;ve found out of all the other exfoliating disks, pads, or whatever.  Often times, the store will be out of this or that, so I like to order a good supply from Amazon so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> At first I really loved these, but now I am noticing that it is really drying my skin out. I will not be buying again as it is just too drying. I have switched over to Aveeno as it seems to be much nicer to my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and struggle with excessive oil and minor breakouts. I am also paranoid about the size of my pores. I started washing my face with these pads 1x a day about 10 days ago, and about 3 days in I noticed the reduction of pore size and my skin started feeling a lot smoother and healthier. Having tried endless remedies for oily/big pored skin, I was shocked at how well this product worked. I&#x27;m a big fan-- you got me, RoC!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I need it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see cell renewal.  I saw drying and skin eruptions.  Too harsh. I would not recommend it. I like Dr. Gross  Alpha Beta Peel treatments better.</li>
            <li> As we age, our pores gets larger (along with everything else). These are absolutely amazing for gently removing the makeup that inevitably gets into your pores. The pads have a smooth side and a slightly more abrasive side. No hard scrubbing is needed. They remove eye makeup, too. I take one into the shower with me, use it all over my face and neck, then rinse thoroughly. Absolutely will not be without these ... ever.</li>
            <li> I have never used ROC products so this is my first (age 48).  After 1 week use, I am very pleased with the results.  I have combo skin (oily T zone) and this product definitely cleanses and exfoliates.  A few other noteworthy observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  Convenient, affordable, effective cleansing pads.  Skin felt softer and smoother, less oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  Strong scent (surprisingly fragrant) - I was concerned at first because I have sensitive skin however, I have not had bad experience due to scent.  Drying results - causes my skin to be a tad too dry - which I remedy with a rich moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUGGESTION:  These pads are dense and create a tremendous amount of cleanser in each pad so I actually cut the pad in half and extended the jar usage with just as effective cleansing results.  ;)</li>
            <li> I cut them into thirds; as is, they are far too big. I do love them too; I noticed a difference in my skin tone very soon after starting to use them.</li>
            <li> A recent convert to ROC products (who can beat the results with a fantastic price?) I purchased these after reading other reviews.  They are wonderful with a rough side for exfoliating and a smooth side for extra facial cleansing.  I don&#x27;t use them every day, but they are great for deep cleansing in the shower.  Will keep buying for as long as I can find them...LOVE the results I am seeing with ROC moisturizers and creams...best skin I have had for years!</li>
            <li> I feel like these little discs sure get my face clean. Easy to use and smell fairly pleasant. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use in conjunction with the RoC Max Wrinkle Resurfacing System. It did nothing special other than clean my face. While the 2 different surfaces are supposed to &amp;#34;resurface&amp;#34; your skin, I found no change in my face with these cleaning pads. Very expensive to do nothing.</li>
            <li> I liked the previous version of these disks better. I feel they were more potent but since it&#x27;s not available anymore I will review the current version.&lt;br /&gt;These disks do a pretty good job in removing makeup and dead skin. They are especially good for acne prone skin. They are large enough that can used for the body.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of these disks, I have to use once a week because my teenagers have found them they also love them!  My face is very soft after using.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cheap so I cut them in 1/2 because they are really too big.  But great results immediately.  LOVE Roc products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second container and love these discs!  They have a mild scrubbing side and a smooth cleansing side.  And you cannot beat the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to improve my aging skin.  I&#x27;m hard to please, but this product truly makes my skin feel wonderful -- so soft and smooth.  As others have said, the disks are large and can be cut in two if you want to save $$$ and do only your face.  I use the entire disk not only on my face, but there is more than enough rich lather to also do my arms and throat/chest area.  It does a great job on dry skin -- it looks as soft as it feels.  I plan to order more and also check out the other ROC products!!  Note:  I was so impressed with this I gave a few disks to a friend to try.  She liked them so much she immediately ordered some for herself.  Enough said!</li>
            <li> Purchased these for the first time. After just a few days they have made a difference.  They make my face smoother and cleaner and I can visually see the effects.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what (if anything) it&#x27;s doing for my pores and skin, but it&#x27;s a nice scrubby facewash at a very reasonable price. And Instead of cutting the disk into halves like some others, I actually cut it into quarters and make do, so it&#x27;s lasted me the last 3 months :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this now off and on I should say for about 6 months and I am not sure that it has did anything to my fine lines, however it I do like to use it and It is much better then the harsh soap.</li>
            <li> My mom swears that this has decreased her deep wrinkles.  When I first started using it, it made my face very smooth.  However, my skin is too sensitive for it.</li>
            <li> I made numerous changes to my diet recently (which made the most significant changes/improvements in my skin above anything esle), so I&#x27;m not sure how much the Roc Disks have helped, but I like them.  They smell good, no residue, no peeling, no irritation. For the right price, I would continue to buy them.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my mom since she only uses roc products and she loves them</li>
            <li> pleasantly surprised with how these work, really pleased with the product and would gladly keep using these, price &amp; shipping were very good</li>
            <li> it does clean and my skin feels cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I was kind of hoping for a more obvious result of glowing beautiful skin, but i may have been unrealistic.&lt;br /&gt;i found that the pads can be cut into 1/4&#x27;s in order to have it last longer yet still be effective.</li>
            <li> I love roc products, but I can&#x27;t use them exclusively since I still need something to prevent acne. Ugh. Anyway, these disks are kind of huge; I can do my whole face, neck and chest with one. Might need to cut them in half like others do. I also use a neutrogena exfoliating cream wash, but I actually think this is somewhat more effective. I&#x27;m going to alternate them...this one is somewhat more time consuming to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Okay... I was wrong. These are the freaking amaze-balls super awesome perfect exfoliation product. I mean, this is the holy grail, right here. The price is right, they WORK. My skin looks better than is ever EVER has -- when I use them regularly. For me, maybe 2-3 times a week is enough. The other days I can cleanse with regular old Neutrogena Oil free acne wash or whatever I&#x27;m into at the moment. My skin is very acne prone, and this actually is helping to prevent break outs. It&#x27;s also done WONDERS in improving the texture of my skin-- it looks more fine and smooth, almost like a pre-adolescent&#x27;s baby face!! I went for some weeks neglecting to use this product and started wondering what the heck I wasn&#x27;t doing right, because I just kept looking crappier and crappier, and then I remembered these. ONE week back on, I look fantastic again. AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year and my lines on my forehead have gotten smaller. I noticed more of a difference in the beginning. It&#x27;s not a fix all for my uneven skin tone but I love how well it works and use it every morning in the shower. Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Roc is very famous in reducing wrinkles.I bought this product in a hurry so it&#x27;s not what I want.I thought it&#x27;s a cream not pads.&lt;br /&gt;The score is just for the brand not for the product.In my opinion,it&#x27;s as good as ANR.</li>
            <li> love it, works great.  skin feels clean after using and removes make great!  use this along with a whole line of day &amp; night care and highly recommend.  Was using expensive Estee Lauder, which works great but was noticing fine lines to tried Roc and fine lines are disappearing and much more affordable then Estee Lauder!</li>
            <li> I absolutely never write product reviews, but I have to do it this time. I purchased these and started using them a week ago. I have EXTREMELY dry skin, and in my mid 40s extremely dry skin &#x3D; lots of fine lines and crepe like skin, yuck. I use these in the shower because I tend to make a big mess at the sink when I do a skin routine. Here&#x27;s the deal- You can feel it work- your skin gets tingly and maybe a little hot in spots which I know can be scary but seriously, it works. I do have to follow this with an antioxidant serum and a moisturizer  but the difference in my skin after the pads alone is AMAZING. Seriously- if you are looking for a cleansing product that sloughs off dead cells and TIGHTENS skin - this is it!!!</li>
            <li> love the product, great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li> These disks leave my skin feeling smooth, clean and have actually helped with some of the fine lines in my face.  I will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product.  It leaves skin feeling clean and refreshed.  However,  the perfumey smell is almost unbearable.  Why does it need the perfume?</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I felt a difference in my skin in the first few days. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My skin has recently gone through a lot of changes recently, and I needed a product that would clean well, exfolliate and reduce the appearance of my pores.  I&#x27;ve been using these for a month now, and they do all 3.  I love the two sides of the disk for my combination skin, and even the scent is clean and fresh without being annoying.  I totally recommend these!</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever writing a review. I bought this product after reading its reviews and comparing the reviews with those of other products. I hate wasting money on skincare products that don&#x27;t so anything to improve my skin. I am 53 and my concerns were forehead furrows, lip lines, marionette lines, and some jowls starting to sag. I was considering looking into mini lift or maybe fillers like Botox.. The results from using this product have been significant. My 14 year old daughter asked if I was using something different because she said I looked younger! My 14 year old! I was concerned that it would not strong enough because I have been using retinol products for years. The most significant improvement is diminished appearance of lip lines. They were obvious and annoying because I have never even smoked! Wow. I have to look closely to see any sign of them now. Brow furrows appear far less defined-still there but not as deep. I really hadn&#x27;t expected a change in the marionette lines or jowl thing-but they too are noticeably diminished! I did get a little rash under my lower lip after about a week or 2 of use it. But I just avoided that area for a while and protected it with chap lip. The little rash healed up and hasn&#x27;t occurred again. I would say if you get irritation-use it less often, until you find the right regimen for your skin. I do use the pads more than once. There is plenty of medication on the pads. There is no unpleasant smell as I had read in few comments. I also use them on my chest, and as I had hoped, it has decreased the appearance of some beginning age spots-curse that tanning machine I used a decade ago! I always covered my face but liked the color on my chest. Now I am happy to get the splotches of color aka age spots off my chest! Anyway. I am so happy with the product that I had to write and recommend it to others. Oh also as someone else wrote don&#x27;t forget your neck!</li>
            <li> I usually forget/ don&#x27;t feel like cleaning my face in the evening. this product is so complete that it makes it very easy to use and it just makes me clean my face. The pads are ready to use on the face and after I finish &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; i just wash them and use them to get the soap of my skin. Glad i got it.</li>
            <li> Been using this for less than a week and really like how it makes my skin feel.  I am seeing some minor results already with regard to surface wrinkles and pores.  I&#x27;m sure the changes will become more obvious with regular use.  I tried cutting these in half as some other reviewers suggested, but I really think it&#x27;s best to use a whole one.  There is more lather and if you&#x27;re using it to remove makeup, I think it gives you a cleaner face after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it five stars but I haven&#x27;t been using long enough to testify as to long-term results.  As you probably know, you could spend a lot more money on products making similar claims.  So I think this is a good value if you&#x27;re going to try one.</li>
            <li> These pads are easy to use and full of sudsy cleaner.  I have sensitive skin but these do not cause any problems. The eye side is gentle. Skin feels very clean and smooth.  Great for travel too.</li>
            <li> Great product. I would recommend for deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> Wow! Awesome. My face felt clean. I followed the instructions perfectly. First used the soft side for cleansing. I could see the disk picking up the dirt from the face. I then used the rougher side for scrubbing. My face looked fresh. Definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love the 2 sided pads, smooth and textured, filled with a beauty cleanser. The flip top design of the canister keep the pads moist so never dry out. You will see a difference in your skin texture as I did.  I would not use any other cleanser on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It left my skin feeling smooth with a nice glow to it. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have used these off and on for years but now that I&#x27;m getting close to 40 and seeing wrinkles more pronounced, I decided to start using them again regularly.  After buying one pack and using every other day for two weeks, I really saw a difference and so when they were on sale, I bought three more.  My skin can be very sensitive to products but I&#x27;ve never had anything more than a slight pink to my skin after washing.  Even though I don&#x27;t typically get acne, I&#x27;ve even seen a decrease in the little bit I did have.</li>
            <li> APPROACHING WEEK 3-LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT, ITS AN EXCELLENT FACE CLEANSER AND I SEE VISIBLE RESULTS. A MUST HAVE AS A PART OF YOUR BEAUTY REGIME.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I was amazed at how much it really foams. Takes off make up wonderfully and even mascara. After the sceansing my face feels a little tight, so moisturizer is definitely needed. But I love the packaging and it closes tight and doesn&#x27;t dry out the pads. Definitely inventive concept. Getting more.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and develop black heads frequently. I had heard good things about this product, but it was too harsh for my skin. I had skin peeling off in patches all over my face. I had to stop using it after two days.</li>
            <li> Freshens up my face, removes makeup, leaves a clean nice fragrance, makes my skin look younger and fresher after use with a good moisturizer. I like these cleansing disks a lot - one side is nubbier for extra exfoliation, the other is smoother so you can do around your delicate eye area and clear away dead cells there as well, softening crows feet and other eye issues.</li>
            <li> It really works you see it working in a week you aren&#x27;t wasteing your money its money well spent I love it</li>
            <li> I bought these on a whim after being pleasantly surprised by other RoC products.  They really have a nice skin care line.  These work well and are relatively inexpensive compared to similar products.  My only complaint is they should offer refill packs of 60 or 100 so the packaging isn&#x27;t wasted.  I like the way the jar opens with a flip top lid to avoid fumbling around with wet hands.  The product gives you a nice clean face without making your face feel tight.  I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> i am 54 years old and starting to see wrinkles and dark spots. This has really worked to make me feel like I have younger looking skin</li>
            <li> This is a great every day facial cleanser and scrub. If you don&#x27;t need a deep scrub, the other side of the disk is soft and smooth. I have yet to have a break out since I started using this product. I use it before I shave as well and find it helps soften my beard as well. Good price for something you can use every day and have last the entire month and then some.</li>
            <li> i love it because it works..immediately! Use in conjuction with the Roc CompleteLift Serum. Viola! Notieable difference in skin.&lt;br /&gt;I like this product because it does what it says it will do.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to Men and Women who want to make themselves look better, care for their skin, and want a product line that works.</li>
            <li> Make your face smoother, look up younger, After use, your skin is smooth and soft,Wrinkle really disappear.&lt;br /&gt;Daily Resurfacing Disks and Deep Wrinkle Night Cream.it has a pleasant scent,&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to tingle a bit but not too much! My face feels super soft after using these and I notice that blemishes seem to disappear faster.&lt;br /&gt;使​你的​臉更​平滑​，看​起來​更年​輕, 使​用它​們, 你​的皮​膚看​上去​會顯​著更​​與順​暢。​你可​以真​正感​受到​你的​臉黑​斑減​少. 使​用後, 你​的皮​膚是​光滑​，柔​軟，​細紋​真的​消失​。&lt;br /&gt;每日換膚和深層抗皺晚霜。它有一個愉快的氣味，使用這些之後, 感覺我的臉超柔和我注意到的瑕疵似乎消失得更快。</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it everywhere and I have sensitive skin. It&#x27;s a definite must in my medicine cabinet from now on.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical since I have used ROC products in the past and have been extremely disappointed. I have only been using these for a few days now and all I can say is WOW!  A little goes a long way. My face feels so refreshed and clean after using one of these. The thing that really amazes me is how much lather it has in just one disc. I am able to use one disc for my entire face,neck and chest and STILL have plenty of lather left over. I wish I had a whole barrel of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Only four stars for this product, however.  There aren&#x27;t enough disks in the jar for me to continue paying this price when you can get them at a pharmacy for 5.00 bucks.  I don&#x27;t know ...  They do work really nice without being abrasive.  Your skin will feel clean and smell clean.  I do like them a lot, I just wish the jar were at least full, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> I hate the soap that these resurfacing disks come soaked with.  It&#x27;s overly perfumed, dries out my skin, and burned like heck when I got some in my eye.  I&#x27;m not going to throw out the container, but when I do use them I rinse them completely clean of the cleanser that they come with and use my own.  It&#x27;s too bad because otherwise these things work well, I like the scrubbers on the physical disk and you can tell that they do a good job exfoliating.  I wish I could buy just the dry discs and use the cleanser I want.</li>
            <li> @ 51 yrs young we need a lil help with our skin,I find this to be gentle enough for everyday use my pores are getting smaller with use</li>
            <li> Gets my face clean, the pads are really convenient.  Not sure it&#x27;s made much difference in my skin but my skin isn;t bad to start.</li>
            <li> just okay, no big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product only because the Roc cleanser was out of stock and I was completely out.  I have been using this product for about ten days and I am definitely impressed with the results.  I have large pores and my skin is very sensitive to most products that I have tried to use.  So far, I have found this product to be helping my skin.  It is definitely smoother and my pores are smaller.&lt;br /&gt;It is pricey for the amount of disks that are in the jar, however, another reviewer suggested cutting them in half.  I like that idea.  There is definitely enough product to use it this way and a great money saving tip.</li>
            <li> I love these, it leaves your face smooth and very clean, I am getting ready to order another jar.  The smell is great too.</li>
            <li> I was about to buy it, but I searched the ingredients and this has the chemical paraben that is clearly linked to breast cancer and impotence in men.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price for a product that does so much! I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 2 days, but can see and feel a noticeable difference already! Do cut them in half, as previous reviewers have said. It&#x27;s plenty to clean your face/neck and will double the value! My face feels super clean, pores are smaller and this product is so easy to use! I&#x27;m 45 and looking for products to keep my skin looking good. A+ for RoC resurfacing Disks! I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> my daughter uses this faithfully</li>
            <li> I searched a long time for a product that would not cause an allergic reaction on my face.  I have very sensitive skin...dry with occasional break-outs.  These disks do not irritate my skin the way most products do.  Most of the time, I end up with red splotches and flaky skin when I try something new.  The disks caused no issues at all.&lt;br /&gt;  I read the reviews prior to purchasing this product and followed the suggestion of cutting the disks in half.  I also remove eye makeup before washing my face with the disks.  I only use them only 1x/day to avoid excessive dryness or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;  This product does exactly what it says: resurfaces.  My skin was beginning to show some superficial signs of aging (in my late 20s).  These disks are like magic- the way they smooth the surface of my skin and leave a fresh glow...I can even use them in my eye area!  My skin was baby-soft after only a few days of using them.  Any signs of aging are diminished.  When I apply a foundation or tinted moisturizer, I am able to get very even coverage and a flawless finish, thanks to the smooth texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;  I would recommend these to anyone, any age.  This is a great product and the price is a steal when you consider the dramatic results.  I&#x27;ve used products 8x the price with a less successful outcome.  I will be ordering this product on auto-ship.</li>
            <li> I cut the pads in half and they still have ample cleanser to do the job.  Love that one side has a bit more texture to help lift dead skin cells and prepare skin for night treatment.  Reduces pore size.  Easily removes makeup and will be easy to travel with by putting a couple in a zip lock bag and won&#x27;t have to take a big jar along.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this two times it make my face smooth soft some of the pads are not foaming more liquid then the others but  I like it and I will buy more.</li>
            <li> my skin always look good using this.  have use roc for years</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using these disks I found that my skin really improved.  I finished off with another ROC product and together they gave me a really nice, moist, finished results.  My pores appeared smaller and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  I only reserved the one star because it&#x27;s heavily perfumed and I wish it weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference after the first use. Skin looked refreshed, younger, and tighter. After using the whole jar I can deff see a difference. I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I like the size of these discs and the fact that there is enough product on each.  They exfoliate well, and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I like the ROC products.  I am 48 yrs old and most people think I am about 35.  Yea!</li>
            <li> These really feel like they help your skin renew. Skill is totally clean and smooth after each use. So practical to take with during traveling too. Light box.</li>
            <li> My menopausal skin has been giving me issues..scaling..oily..like a teenagers skin but I had never had trouble with my skin. This really makes your skin shine through. Bought 4 more!</li>
            <li> Love these! I can&#x27;t find them in my area so hope they stick around Amazon. Like another reviewer said....cut in half and there is plenty of product for me to use. Leaves my face not too dry</li>
            <li> These pads do a great job, I cut them in half and they last longer.  The company does not skimp on this product!</li>
            <li> Great I can already see a very nice difference.  Looking forward to 30 days from now  and I will post review then.</li>
            <li> I like this product and I use it every so often (not everyday) when I want to get a little deeper clean feeling. The pads provide a gentle deeper cleanse that makes my skin feel rejuvenated and ready to soak up some of RoC&#x27;s anti age moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see much of a difference in my skin (if any), but I do love the feel of cleanliness these cleaning pads provide.  Get every trace of dirt/oils.  The pads are very large and actually I cut them in half (which is more than enough to clean your entire face/neck).  That way the jar lasts twice as long and you really get a bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> What a nice cleanser! I love it. I plan on keeping this as my main cleanser from now on. It has helped me smooth out my skin in just a few weeks. I was feeling some real rough areas on my forehead, now it is smooth again and supple.</li>
            <li> I like them a lot! They are scented but it&#x27;s not overpowering and they easily remove any eye make-up I put on. Like other reviewers, I cut them in half. You do have to wet your face and rinse off the lather, which another reviewer actually had a problem with?!? For $8, just give &#x27;em a try.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say how much I like or dislike this product; that&#x27;s because I rarely use it since I cannot handle the smell.  It is like washing your face with foamy perfume.  YUCK!</li>
            <li> 19yr old male, black oily face with mild acne scarring. Definitely faded the scars on my face. Took two weeks, I like to use it post work out and I look chiseled for the rest of the day. Can be abrasive if you scrub to hard but never seen so much gunk get off my face. Can use it after apricot scrub and it&#x27;ll still manage to remove some gunk.</li>
            <li> I enjoy Roc Resurfacing discs AND Aveeno Clear Complexion Daily Cleansing Pads. Do you know why I like both of these products? Because they are made by the same company, Johnson &amp; Johnson AND have similiar ingredients in them. Read the back of the Aveeno container and the Roc container. There are only slight differences. I noticed that Roc doesn&#x27;t list salicylic acid in it&#x27;s ingredients. I am not a scientist so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because salicylic acid is for acne and Aveeno is marketed more towards \\&quot;younger\\&quot; skin and Roc is marketed towards more \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin. I believe that the 2 products are HIGHLY similiar in content just worded differently to get certain people to buy them. Tell the younger folk that Aveeno helps with acne. Key word: Acne. Tell the so called older folks that Roc diminishes wrinkles and fine lines. The key words to attract so called older folks: diminshes fine lines &amp; wrinkles. They are priced differently because usually those trying to fight the signs of aging skin will spend more to look younger. The Roc discs are about $3.00 more than the Aveeno pads. Both are excellent cleansing pads made by Johnson &amp; Johnson with minor differences. I find that they both do the same great things for my skin. I really think that the differences are psychological; not physical. *I am LC from NC*</li>
            <li> Aloha,  I just reached 70 and thought I&#x27;d better start doing something about these \\&quot;freckles\\&quot;.  Purchased this item because of all the great reviews.  I love it.  I like the fact that there is so much product on each pad as I am able to scrub my arms and legs as well with just one pad.  In just one week i am noticing results and within one day my skin felt firmer- and that my friends is a miracle.  I just purchased more and will likely go on to have it delivered regularly for an additional discount.  Can&#x27;t beat the price and it works.</li>
            <li> I have used Roc skin products for a long time...I would say about 15 years. I have been very satisfied, and have repurchased for the entire 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally buy my Roc Resurfacing Disks from either Walgreens, or Rite Aid, and only on sale. Amazon was cheaper, so I decided to try them. I have had good luck with a lot of other things from Amazon before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited until I was out of the pads to order from Amazon. I ordered, and they were delivered quickly. The packaging was wonderful, but for whatever reason, the container full of pads and liquid was dry as a desert. There was absolutely no moisture in the pads that I received, and the bottom of the box was soggy. It has been rainy here, so I am trying to be fair, but I think I got a bad container. My disks were dry, and not at all what I am used  to.  Something went wrong, somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never returned anything, I mean not one thing, In the years I have been shopping with Amazon, so I guess I will try it now. Hopefully it will be easy enough. I will write a follow up if not.</li>
            <li> I have tried these,  and still do. they feel great when being used.  afterwards,  your skin feels and looks great.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  Only caution is that you keep it away from your eyes; it burns like crazy!</li>
            <li> This producing makes my face feel so smooth and clean. I&#x27;ve only been using it for four days so I haven&#x27;t seen results yet but I EXPECT to.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and I really like it and the results are amazing. You can actually see your pores getting smaller daily delivering a smoother surface.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 53 year old woman with combination dry/ somewhat oily T-zone skin, rosacea, fine wrinkles skin.  These are absolutely amazing!!!  I cut them in half to save money...1/2 pad is plenty. I was hesitant if a cleansing disk pad could really be any different than a washcloth and facial cleanser.....BIG difference I found out!!  At my age, I&#x27;ve tried many products....this trumps them all!!.  My face actually glows now.  This product evens out skin tone, helps with fine wrinkles, smooths and IS actually resurfacing my face. Plenty of foaming product on disc, I use on my neck, chest, upper arms (those bothersome small bumps-gone!) and hands...what a difference!  My hands are subject to hot water on a daily basis and were most definitely showing their age...now they are looking younger between this and a good hand cream.  All makeup easily removed, rinses easily as well.  Results are immediate after first use...have been using almost a month now.  I bought some for my 35 year old daughter who&#x27;s on medication for acne problems due to Cushing&#x27;s Disease...she says her skin is improving with each use.  I just started using this Roc product and other Roc products... and am SOLD on this line.  Before Roc, I basically used L&#x27;oreal or Oil of Olay poducts.  Hope this long review helps someone out there.</li>
            <li> I do not have very sensitive skin.  My skin is chronically under-moisturized and produces a lot of oil, but tolerates chemicals and exfoliation very well.  I find that these disks are very good at exfoliating, and good at removing makeup, but even when followed by a daily moisturizer they can be very drying, creating the same flaky skin that I am trying to avoid.  I cannot use them daily.  I use them about 2-3 times a week.  I agree with other reviewers that cutting them in half leaves plenty of disk/liquid for your entire face and neck, while saving you twice the money.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using these! The scent smells really good and isn&#x27;t too strong. I will use the non-textured side to wipe away my eye makeup and brows (it will sting eyes if not careful) and then use the textured side for the rest of my face to get the mini exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s also great is that these discs can be cut in half to extend your use. There&#x27;s a lot of product in just half a disc. Once I complete my face (I usually do this in the shower) I&#x27;ll wipe my elbows to get some exfoliation there too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great!</li>
            <li> My face is clear and super soft. Love this product! Its easy to use. Wet pad and get to cleaning. I leave it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Roc is a great product.  These discs help to make your skin smooth and have a glow to it.  I have also purchased three more Roc products.  I really like the way my skin feels after using the discs.</li>
            <li> I have tried this on several occasions and I find that this product does not work for me as advertised!</li>
            <li> These disks are a great buy for the price.  They really do leave your face feeling smooth and clean.  I would definitely order these again.</li>
            <li> May be my skin type but my skin did not like these Roc products at all.&lt;br /&gt;I saw where another review had problems too&lt;br /&gt;It left a sore on my chin so I quit using it for a while and tried later..&lt;br /&gt;Then I ended up with 2 sores on my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am stuck with a whole regimen of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Always buy 1 then buy the rest of the regimen.</li>
            <li> you think you&#x27;re getting a great facial scrub, but it&#x27;s actually resurfacing! These are amazing little disks, one side soft the other a more loofa. Don&#x27;t forget your neck!</li>
            <li> I use these pads every day and my face feels and looks so nice. After using it, I feel so much cleaner. You don&#x27;t get that with just  using soap!</li>
            <li> This makes my face feel great after washing.  I have cut these in half, they are a good size.....so I get double the product.</li>
            <li> Not happy!! This stuff has made me breakout like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. And my skin doesn&#x27;t breakout. I am in my mid thirtys and I look like a high school kid with acne. I&#x27;ve started to use every three days and in three days I have a new pimple forming. Everyone is different and obviously didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m not wasting it. I&#x27;m giving it a little more time and if anything changes I will be back to write another review. My fingers are crossed for that. Maybe it&#x27;s just getting all the dirt up and out. Idk I&#x27;m patient we will see</li>
            <li> Great Product. Very Nice!</li>
            <li> These work great. I cut them in half, as others have suggested. Be careful not to rub too hard or too long in one area, or you can cause an abrasion on your skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you to the woman who recommended cutting the pads in half! These are wonderful, gentle and softened my skin right away! My pores have started to become less prominent. Extremely happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Only use in adjunct to my mainstay facial products.&lt;br /&gt;Best quality is that I can wipe my face with it before a shower or while getting ready for bed....and let it &amp;#34;do it&#x27;s thing&amp;#34; (like a mask-but this turns to a light foam after I scrub a bit).&lt;br /&gt;So by the time I rinse, I feel I have gotten the full benefit.&lt;br /&gt;I brought these with me on a trip recently and was helpful because I didn&#x27;t have to have to wash my hands first-nor did it take up much space.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely needed to use a cream afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Not &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34; but a good staple for certain times.&lt;br /&gt;Because the pads are large and thick---I recommend sterilizing/or cleansing well a pair of scissors, then cutting the first 5-10 in half...doing the same once those have been used.&lt;br /&gt;I still prefer the &amp;#34;Boogie Wipes&amp;#34; because they don&#x27;t require any rinsing.</li>
            <li> It was a great suggestion by another reviewer to cut these in half.  They are quite large, more than I need for my face, so by cutting them and doubling the count, I think they are a decent value.  The container is way larger than it needs to be, so if I were travelling or keeping them in my gym bag, I would put a couple of these in a zip top baggie and leave the container behind.  They would take up way too much space in a typical toiletries bag.  They also produce way more foam than I expected, so you definitely need a good rinse afterwards.  I had originally planned to use them on those occasions when I don&#x27;t have easy/convenient access to a sink, but that would be impossible.  I probably would not have bought them if I knew that in advance. The smell is very strong, like all RoC products I have tried, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to linger too long after rinsing.  I am VERY careful not to get any of the foam in my eyes, I bet it would sting like a mofo.</li>
            <li> this product does a fine job of cleaning-I&#x27;m not seeing any remarkable results with &amp;#34;resurfacing&amp;#34; as I have with outher products from my dermatoligist.&lt;br /&gt;The size of the disks are over sized in my opinion, so I cut them in half- which makes the product last twice as long and a fair value. I like Roc products very much, although this is not one that I will not re-purchase.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be a little dry; these disks are GREAT for cleansing and softening my skin.  I cut the disks in half to make them last longer and they work well that way.  I have been using them for about 3 weeks and my 35+ year old skin definitely looks better.</li>
            <li> I feel like it really exfoliates and cleans my skin! My skin feels silky smooth after i use this product!</li>
            <li> I love RoC products. These resurfacing disks are wonderful for making large pores appear smaller. I use only one in the am and use a mild cleanser in the evening. I am afraid it could cause irritation to my sensitive skin if I used it more frequently.</li>
            <li> I cut the circles into 4&#x27;s and they are lasting me a very long time. Each 4th of a circle is just enough to clean my whole face (a 3rd would be easier, but I&#x27;m thrifty like that) and I can see the dirt removed as the pad becomes an icky brown tint - no matter how clean I thought I&#x27;d washed my face prior. My skin is difficult to care for - sensitive but also prone to blackheads and buildup. This product has given my skin its youth back. And I&#x27;m only 29.</li>
            <li> This is the third addition to the Roc Retinol collection. Dry mature sensitive skin and after reading some of the reviews, I decided to chance an adverse reaction. The 24 hour patch test was negative for inflammation (always recommended). I choose not to use near my eyes. Terrific quick and easy way to cleanse and exfoliate. Consider adding the Deep Wrinkle Serum in an easy to use pump bottle that helps prevent contamination of the product. I much prefer containers of this type and the tubes for the Retinol Day and Night cream. Great combination from Roc that is actually effective . . . 6 weeks for good results and it only gets better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 68 and use Neutrogena foam cleanser, Cucumber and Pomegranate peel masks by Freeman, Smoothies (between the eyes), and Simple soothing eye balm (all available with Amazon prime). C. Booth Honey Almond for body care . . . sound like too much? I spend 20 minutes or less a day and the results have been better than expected. Everything fits in a decorative basket that helps keep things organized and out of the way. I do not enjoy &#x27;real&#x27; shopping so this has been a great choice for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These discs are well made and simple to reuse for other purposes. Rinse and dry to use as a quick way to clean and polish the sink or soak up spills . . . very absorbent. Think recycle and use your imagination!</li>
            <li> I am 20 and had noticed a wrinkle forming on my forehead; these pads in conjunction with the ROC wrinkle serum have made it disappear (for now)! The pads leave my face feeling amazingly smooth and soft, although they are somewhat abrasive on my dry and sensitive skin. I have noticed a few dry patches, so I use a very strong moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer suggested, I cut each pad in half and even then I still cover my face, neck, shoulders, and chest area.&lt;br /&gt;These pads do a reasonable job of keeping my acne at bay, but not as well as a product specifically designed to do so, like the Clearasil daily acne treatment pads. I stopped using those when I started with ROC because I thought using so many high chemical products would be too rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> Lets not lie to ourselves. Either you have good genetics or a good plastic surgeon. I have neitheir. Therefore I attempt to test out products and the roc line is interesting...sure makes ya think you can wake up w one less defined wrinkle. Makes the skin feel smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;m really digging this product. I tried the Roc creams here at Amazon but this product seems to really work. This is the only  Roc product Ive repurchased...</li>
            <li> This product is the best. My face feels rejuvinated after I use the pads. It really scrubs , feels well and leaves the face really looking clean and clear.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  My local CVS seems to have stopped selling it and I didn&#x27;t know how much I missed it.  It was cheaper on Amazon as an add-on.  I even cut the discs in half so they last longer.  A whole pad seems like overkill anyway.  Love these things!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. use every disk twice and it has plenty of soap left on it. it gently exfoliates which leaves skin super soft without irritating it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite out of all the RoC products I bought.</li>
            <li> As others have said, cut the discs in half.  One is just too much.  They are nice because they are exfoliating on one side (which I use on my whole face and neck area) and softer on the reverse side (which I use around my eye area).  They do a great job of removing make up and making my skin look and feel polished.  My pores have improved, seeming to appear smaller.  Nice product.</li>
            <li> I really love this product - first of all, I needed an effective way to clean my skin and remove old cells. I have aging skin so in order to get the best results from skin products the top layer needs to be fresh and these do the job. One of the reviews I read stated that she cut them in half - I did the same because I use them twice a day and they are big enough cut in half. One side is rough and the other smooth so my skin areas of need are sufficiently covered by both textures. There is plenty of cleanser in the container and (again as per another reviewer&#x27;s suggestion) I position the container upside down to keep the top discs well hydrated. The solution lightly foams and I can see the slight discoloration on the disc surface indicating old cells being sloughed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed that my skin has a smoother surface and has been effectively absorbing my facial products. This product is great and for the price an even greater investment. Getting the skin back to youthful is pricey, upkeep is also an investment so being able to purchase the RoC Resurfacing Discs thru Amazon has been worth it.</li>
            <li> Been using this product daily for a week along with the daily resurfacing cleanser, Deep wrinkle night cream, 5 in 1 moisturizer and I see a difference in pore size and forehead wrinkles. I&#x27;ve tried glycolic acid peels, philosophy &amp; Peter Thomas Roth products and these RoC products are by far my favorites. I am 35yrs old and have had expression lines for about 5yrs now and finally I see an improvement in such a short time.</li>
            <li> UPDATED REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m bumping this product up to five stars b/c I found that it works great after a chemical peel.  I started self-peeling and found that these disks are gentle enough to exfoliate the dead skin afterward.  The solution they&#x27;re soaked in is soothing and cool which feels great after the hotness of a peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLD REVIEW WITH THREE STARS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five things about this product:&lt;br /&gt;1.  I don&#x27;t feel a difference in skin texture or see a difference in tone.  I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The disks are a bit too big but cutting them in half makes them too small.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Squeeze a bit before using as the solution stings if it gets in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;4.  For the price, it&#x27;s not much.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Using an exfoliate seems to work better at brightening my skin.</li>
            <li> These changed my skin for the better. When I run out I notice a difference immediately--skin is rougher and flakes more without these.</li>
            <li> works very well , I found it a little irritating</li>
            <li> So convenient. Love these.</li>
            <li> Great cleansing, removes all your make up, makes your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> These are great at cleaning my face but left my skin overly dry the following day, not so good. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to people that have dry skin. I even used a night moisturizer after using these and my skin was flaky the next morning. I won&#x27;t be using again.</li>
            <li> This is the third month I&#x27;ve used this product and it has noticeably resurfaced my face.  I used it once a day and gently rub the bumps, dark spots  and lines that I&#x27;ve acquired as part of the aging process. After two months it was amazing to me how the bumps diminished, the dark spots and lines also lightened and lessened.  The product did not remove all the flaws, but certainly did smooth out my  skin.  Over my 70 years I&#x27;ve used hundreds of products and other face cleansers did not do the job.  Another plus is it resurfaces but it also moisturizes, not drying at all. Really like it and will reorder it again!!</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of this particular product and I LOVE it! The claims are true!!  I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> The disks are great to use at night before I go to bed. The cleanser in each disk is plentiful - I almost want to re-use them. Good price. Been using these for months now and people compliment how youthful I am. The other day someone thought I was 15 years younger than I am.</li>
            <li> These are amazing. They smell great, lather well and really clear up my skin! I even cut each on into fourths so they are a steal!!! will DEFINITELY repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;i also love RoC&#x27;s retinol serum</li>
            <li> I buy a lot o&#x27; stuff for my face....I&#x27;m not goin&#x27; down easy! I used one of these wipes as soon as they arrived...in the kitchen after work...and I was really surprised at how great my face felt afterward...without even add-in moisturizer!!!I&#x27;m back online today to get moisturizer, because this line has become my fave and is replacing the serums I&#x27;ve been using. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it...</li>
            <li> Just got these RoC resurfacing disks today and I immediately had to try one. I am so happy that I did try these little gems.My face feels smooth and tingly.I used the same disk after my face, on my hands , elbows and knees . Now they are so smooth as well!!! I will have to see how these work for fine lines etc.I will try for a month then let you know!!:)) ....I am ordering again because they do make your skin brighter,  softer and lines minimized ... almost gone!!!</li>
            <li> I am a 32 year old acne prone African American female. I have very sensitive skin, this did not break me out or irritate my face at all. It seems like my pores look smaller and smaller with every use. I would and will buy again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> This product has reduced the size of my pores as well as helped to remove bumps and redness on my skin.  It is a great product and I use the subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> Left my face feeling smooth and soft. I use them every other day and so far I really like them. I havent noticed any dryness of my skin or redness. Will order these again.</li>
            <li> I used 3 times this patches. I felt a little bit tingle...but I decided to use continue( I am very regret now). Used this patches after 3rd times then, my cheeks skin turned to red...My skin is still not yet cure past 3weeks. And my skin has freakin wrinkles more than before use this products...Probably something wrong ingredients.</li>
            <li> I did not care for these...they smelled weird and were just kind of messy.  Furthermore, I did not see that they did anything dramatic. I have had better results with a cheap cleanser and a face scrubbing pad that is reuseable.</li>
            <li> I have a lot going on with the skin on my face. It tends to get oily, I still have breakouts (I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s), but some areas get dry patches, in the midst of the oil. Plus, I have sunspots from years of never using sunscreen, lots of wrinkles, and large pores on my nose. I&#x27;d been on a quest for years, trying to find a cleanser that gets all the oil off and makes my skin feel really clean, without drying it out. Came across these disks on sale, and fell in love with them after the first use. The cleanser the disks are soaked in is mild enough to remove eye makeup when using the soft side of the disc, but it gets my face super clean. The exfoliating side isn&#x27;t too harsh, so your skin is glowing, not red and aggravated. Takes care of the dry patches, my sunspots and smaller wrinkles are less noticeable, pores are smaller, and breakouts are almost non-existent. Once in awhile my drugstore runs out of these, so I&#x27;m forced to try something different that makes my skin miserable. So, I ordered some from Amazon, cheaper than the drugstore, and with free Super Saver shipping. Two days later they landed on my&lt;br /&gt;front porch. Yea!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the product very much. I had a allergic reaction to the ingredients in the product. It may be a good product, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> These are great! As recommended by another reviewer, they are plenty big enough &amp; have enough solution on them that they can be cut in half to stretch your dollar! My skin was noticeably smoother after 1 week of usage once daily.</li>
            <li> I use RoC Daily Resurfacing Disks every night.  Cleans my skin without being harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in early thirties, with sensitive skin prone to breakouts. These pads are perfect, they exfoliate while cleaning, leaving the skin soooo soft and silky. My only complain is the burning sensation. It almost feels like I put some harsh chemical, and I need tons of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product is very good.  Very gentle without a lot of perfume.  I think that the disks could be smaller w/more of them.  I cut them in half.</li>
            <li> Love these! Skin feels clean and still soft !</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove all of my eye makeup but good for my skin.  I cut them in half since that&#x27;s all I need, so they have been a better value for me than expected.</li>
            <li> I am S&amp;S on these items and haven&#x27;t had a delivery for three months, but when I am able to get them I love them! My skin is really noticing the difference in not using one every day.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference in my skin, but I do really like these disks. I usually cut them in half as that is enough to do the job. There are easy to pop into a plastic baggy if you are traveling to circumvent the whole liquid issue with security.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for those of us who are a little lazy about exfoliating. I am in my late thirties and have spent a lot of time in the sun. Thus, I need to exfoliate frequently. These discs are effective without being harsh, they are convenient to use and I am so happy with the results, I will continue to use the product and other Roc products in tandem. I&#x27;d always wanted to try Roc products, however, I wasn&#x27;t willing to gamble what I considered a high price for a drug store product. After using Roc products, I feel now that the price point is excellent, as these products are comparable or BETTER than some department store items I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Very good but too expensive and the container is too bulky if you want to take them with you when you travel.  But they are definitely good for the skin or at least for how it looks.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product really works. Good price and high quality! After using my skin is clear and soft. Very very good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a year.  When I used this product in the first several nights, I felt my skin a little bit dry and tight.  However, I could see the radiance shown on my face immediately.  As time goes by, I do not see the radiance on my skin and do not feel the tightness anymore right after using this product every night.  Nevertheless, the skin tone and texture is definitely improved and the pores on my nose are smaller.  Also, this product can do both cleansing and exfoliating jobs at the same time (2 different textures on both sides of the disk.  1 side for cleansing and the other side for exfoliating).  As such, I do not need to separately buy a facial scrub for exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the result of reducing fine lines and wrinkles, I do not see this product can reduce fine lines and wrinkles.  Overall, I would still recommend this product as it can gently clean and exfoliate my face as well as can improve my skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, and is a lot cheaper at Amazon. I am so glad I discovered what savings I can get on my Roc products through them.</li>
            <li> They make your skin feel amazing, I use them couple times a week, made a big difference, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I just love the convenience of this product.  It comes with 60 large pads, but I cut them in half to make them last longer.  I did notice the company changed the design of the top.  It used to have a &amp;#34;flip top&amp;#34; and now it is just a screw on top.  I don&#x27;t like that change at all and I&#x27;m happy I kept my old container because I use that one instead of the new one because I like the flip top much better.</li>
            <li> Really like them and they clean very well, but I never noticed a change in my skin or its actual appearance in any way.  Would still buy them though, because it gives a good, deep clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon these on accident while perusing Amazon - I was looking for an inexpensive product that actually works!  Lucky me, I found RoC products and this I vow, I shall use them for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewer said, I cut these in half as they are plenty big enough to do so without sacrificing any cleaning :)  and DUDE, my skin already looks better!!!  (and I&#x27;ve only used them for a couple of weeks so I am thrilled!)  The only thing is if you get any in yo&#x27; eyes it stings like the dickens.  But I&#x27;m a tough little cookie - and just try to keep it out of my eyes if I can.  I use this in combination with the night cream.  Ah, RoC, I&#x27;m in love with your products!! :)</li>
            <li> I am 49 and had been using a similar cleansing product (Aveeno) and liked it, but the last time I ran out of them, I decided to try the ROC Resurfacing Disks for a change. I didn&#x27;t expect to notice any difference between the two products, however, RoC does not merely deep clean the skin, it truly does &#x27;resurface.&#x27; I noticed a difference within a couple of uses. My skin feels amazingly soft and clean, and with the Retinol, I feel that I&#x27;m cleansing and treating at the same time. It has made a remarkable improvement in my skin tone, and I no longer have to deal with black heads on my nose and cheeks. My pores have never been in better condition. As an added bonus, after using the disk on my face, there is still enough lather and moisture left to use it on the backs of my hands. My hands are now being resufaced also, and the difference is amazing in just a couple of days. Like many others, I am cutting the disks in half to maximize the value of my purchase. I will permanently switch from Aveeno...and that speaks a lot about the quality of these resurfacing disks&lt;br /&gt;since I have never been a big fan of RoC products. This one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found these cleansing pads.  I wouldn&#x27;t spend the $10 drugstore asking price, but the amazon price of $6.95 is manageable, especially since I found a way to get two uses from each of the very large pads. After the first few days, my skin looked amazing! I&#x27;ve been using these (along with a Retin A cream) for about 2 months now. My skin is smoother, brighter and my pores are less visible. I will eventually give up the Retin A cream, but I will never give these up.  I just wish I had found them in my 20&#x27;s. My sons like them too.  They use them occasionally for exfoliation with great results. Try them!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week now and I can already see the differences.  Even my husband noticed how much tighter and better by skin looked (and he didn&#x27;t even know I was using this product).  You will regret not trying this!</li>
            <li> The jar seal was opened and the screwed on top was loose.  The liquid had leaked out all over the jar and onto the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t tell if the item would be great since most of it was outside the jar.</li>
            <li> I use these every day.  My skin feels wonderfully clean afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I olve the ROC products.  &#x27;Have tried the cheaper ones and I can feel and see the difference with the ROC.&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars and then some!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  The exfoliating disks feel like they really remove old skin and leave you feeling clean and fresh.  I have used one full package and just purchased my second.</li>
            <li> Love these disks!  They are easy to use and do a great job of cleansing the skin.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I do not cut these in half as some of the other reviewers have suggested. I find the size to be perfect. I use it on my face, neck and then on my hands. It has made a crazy improvement to my complexion and to my hands.I have already stocked up!</li>
            <li> This  product is effective for keeping skin/pores clean. I found it helpful but have not been using it long enough to weigh in on long term effects.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes your skin feel very soft and yound, and the cost is great compared to other products that promise the same results.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Using 1 of these cleansing pads at the end of the day feels so good! I finally feel that I am getting all my make up off. It has been good for my skin, clearing and smoothing some below the surface cystic acne and bumps. I still need to have my acne facials to get the blackheads cleared but that&#x27;s not what this is for. A toner afterward is good but not required. I have this on Amazon&#x27;s ship &amp; save to be sure I never run out. On days I wear no face makeup, I cut them in hslf, using half in the morning and half at night before bed. I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have using these disks for a short time and i have seen an improvement in my face especially on the dark blotches on my face.the disks are clearing and cleaning up the problem,also the fine lines around the jaw are improving and after using one my face feels so refreshing and soft. love these disks!!!!i will continue to use them,nothing else worked this well.will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 with pretty good skin. I don&#x27;t suffer breakouts, don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles and its the normal amount of oily. I do however have one large age/sun spot and get some small pimples on my chin once in a while. This product exfoliates nicely and gently, completely eradicates my chin problem and is fading my sun spot. That&#x27;s a lot to get out of one affordable product.</li>
            <li> I am 24 and have terrible acne spots all over my my face. Make up would not cover the red from the scars...desperate I decided to try this product after reading hundreds of reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1 4/06- 4/13 after just the first use I noticed my face was softer and found the tingle sensation pleasent. After a week my face looked a lot better and had not been this soft...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 2 4/13-4/20 now I just started my second week but yesterday and today I was told how great my skin looked...so I have to say after this I am a faithful to RoC products...my dark spots are fading!</li>
            <li> I like to physically exfoliate the dead stuff off and these are nice.  The smell is pleasant as well.  The container holds in the moisture very well which was quite surprising.  Whether the product actually helps do much else [like prevent the appearance of wrinkles], that is tough to say.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily.  Like the way it makes my skin feel.  I can really see a reduction in my pore size.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> It worked fine as far as cleaning the face. My daughter used half the jar, so I really didn&#x27;t get the chance to see if it really worked on wrinkles.  Most likely, I will purchase again because the price is within reason and not expensive.</li>
