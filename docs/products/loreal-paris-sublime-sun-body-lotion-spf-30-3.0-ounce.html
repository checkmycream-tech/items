            <li>It is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Feels good, works great.  </li>
            <li>And haveBeen Trying To Find A Good Moisturizer Spf Combo.</li>
            <li>This is really a great sunblock and it is not greasy like most sunblock lotions.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It does apply nicely without feeling crumbly or slimy and it seems to absorb ultra-fast.  </li>
            <li>I Know Can Honestly SayI</li>
            <li>It smelled amazing, had a lovely consistency, and worked well.</li>
            <li>And I Can Honestly Say I Have Had More Acne</li>
            <li>Kept me from burning and went on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I Plan On Giving It Two More Weeks.</li>
            <li>Covers easily, doesn&#x27;t stain, and provides broad-band protection.</li>
            <li>My Skin Tends To Adjust Easily, But IM</li>
            <li>It even makes your skin look better, and it does not sting your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;It is priced right too.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>My new favorite.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find the right information of this product.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and smooth while protecting it from the sun.</li>
            <li>I hope it has better availability next summer.</li>
            <li>I opened the bottle, but I could smell right away that the scent was nowhere near the lovely scent of my previous bottle of L&#x27;Oreal Paris Sublime Sun Advanced Sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Normal smell without any perfume, good for regular daily use.&lt;br /&gt;Come</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that the new bottle didn&#x27;t have the SPF number written across the front of the bottle in a large font like the picture</li>
            <li>I doubt whether this is a real L&#x27;OReal.</li>
            <li>Absorbs into skin so that it isn&#x27;t very greasy.</li>
            <li>It really protects my skin.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this in the mail, since I was almost out of my last bottle, but when I opened up the package...</li>
            <li>Not So Pleased With The 4 Pimples I Currently Have Since Starting The Product.</li>
            <li>Get Three Pimples A Year Tops, Even In High School.</li>
            <li>So much so that I found I had to apply more than I usually do.</li>
            <li>this should hopefully do the job that I need when I&#x27;m outside, thanks!</li>
            <li>The consistency of the previous product (marketed in the same way) had a clear light weight consistency.  </li>
            <li>Finally, finally, a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t break me out, isn&#x27;t overtly toxic, is not too greasy, doesn&#x27;t turn me even whiter than normal, and is affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>big issue is sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I still love the previous product, so I may try to buy it from a different company, but I was really disappointed that this was not the same product that I know and love.</li>
            <li>My wife says that it stains her clothes yellow, she just threw out a half used tube much to my dismay</li>

            <li> Your face will glow. And, it&#x27;s the best &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; of sunscreen. No chemicals that seep into your skin, just sun protection.</li>
            <li> It does apply nicely without feeling crumbly or slimy and it seems to absorb ultra-fast.  So much so that I found I had to apply more than I usually do. I&#x27;d expect that this product doesn&#x27;t go as far as other sunscreen lotions you&#x27;re used to using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My big issue is sensitive skin.  Within 30 minutes of application, I was feeling a burning sensation.  The instructions tell you not to apply to broken or cut skin, and to talk to a dermatologist if you break out in a rash.  I&#x27;m not prepared to wait until this turns into a rash, so I washed it off.</li>
            <li> When I got this product, the bar code was covered by black marker. I removed the cover with ethanol and scanned with my iphone. I can&#x27;t find the right information of this product. I doubt whether this is a real L&#x27;OReal.</li>
            <li> My wife says that it stains her clothes yellow, she just threw out a half used tube much to my dismay</li>
            <li> I bought this product in a store last year and I absolutely fell in love with it. It smelled amazing, had a lovely consistency, and worked well. It didn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out, so I could use it for body and face. I was really excited to get this in the mail, since I was almost out of my last bottle, but when I opened up the package...The first thing I noticed was that the new bottle didn&#x27;t have the SPF number written across the front of the bottle in a large font like the picture has online and like my previous bottle had. I was a little skeptical, but I figured maybe it was just a minor defect or that L&#x27;Oreal had changed the packaging. NOPE. I opened the bottle, but I could smell right away that the scent was nowhere near the lovely scent of my previous bottle of L&#x27;Oreal Paris Sublime Sun Advanced Sunscreen. I will say that I tried a little of the sunscreen and it seems to have the same consistency as the other. I can&#x27;t tell if it works and I don&#x27;t have any experience into whether or not it will cause me to break out. I still love the previous product, so I may try to buy it from a different company, but I was really disappointed that this was not the same product that I know and love.</li>
            <li> Finally, finally, a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t break me out, isn&#x27;t overtly toxic, is not too greasy, doesn&#x27;t turn me even whiter than normal, and is affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, L&#x27;Oreal, please don&#x27;t discontinue it next season!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It even makes your skin look better, and it does not sting your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;It is priced right too.</li>
            <li> White cream with no sticky feeling. Normal smell without any perfume, good for regular daily use.&lt;br /&gt;Come with a big size, can use through the summer.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Makes my skin feel soft and smooth while protecting it from the sun.</li>
            <li> Used this all summer. Kept me from burning and went on very smoothly. Absorbs into skin so that it isn&#x27;t very greasy.</li>
            <li> HATE HATE HATE IT!!!  It smells so bad, I don&#x27;t care if they are giving it away, I&#x27;d never use it again.</li>
            <li> I got a tube of this at a Wellness Event at Rite Aid. It isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t clog your pores. My nose always burns due to the reflection of my sunglasses. But this product prevented that. I had tried everything else. I looked everywhere to buy it when my sample ran out. I finally ordered it online. I hope it has better availability next summer.</li>
            <li> This is really a great sunblock and it is not greasy like most sunblock lotions. It really protects my skin.</li>
            <li> Feels good, works great.  My new favorite.</li>
            <li> Received the wrong product.</li>
            <li> I got this sunscreen because a dermatologist on Dr. Oz recommended it.  It is wonderful.  Covers easily, doesn&#x27;t stain, and provides broad-band protection.</li>
            <li> Needed some Sun Block so I ordered this...this should hopefully do the job that I need when I&#x27;m outside, thanks!</li>
            <li> my Skin Has Been Noticeably Less Dry, And No Greesy Feeling After Applying. However It&#x27;s Only Been Two Weeks Since I Started Using It Daily And I Can Honestly Say I Have Had More Acne Since I Started Using It. I Have Far From Sensitive Skin, And One Of The Few People I Know Can Honestly SayI Get Three Pimples A Year Tops, Even In High School. But I Do Have Dry Skin And haveBeen Trying To Find A Good Moisturizer Spf Combo. I Plan On Giving It Two More Weeks. My Skin Tends To Adjust Easily, But IM Not So Pleased With The 4 Pimples I Currently Have Since Starting The Product. No Burning Or Rash. Just Zits.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the previous product (marketed in the same way) had a clear light weight consistency.  I was disappointed in this product as it was heavy weight and greasy.  I usually wear a gel (hard to find with a sunscreen), I don&#x27;t understand why they had to &amp;#34;reinvent the wheel&amp;#34; so to speak.</li>
