            <li>I love this nail drill, it works just like being in the nail shop.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Very happy and hope to get a lot of uses for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>wonderful n comes with many other sizes of tips to work with.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t sealed, has a huge crack and the some of the bits have rust spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This item worked great for only 6 months....</li>
            <li>It works well very useful</li>
            <li>I was a little scared in the beginning, but this company has been the absolute best with me, i am a cosmotologist and , when I got my first drill from them the drill bit wouldn&#x27;t release so , i told them and they were very respectful and understanding, not snobby</li>
            <li>I love it and it does exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>i have original  box and all accesories included.</li>
            <li>cuz if i dont then when i apply pressure it slows down and dont work as good but othere than that i love it</li>
            <li>I even acknowledged in my message that I was aware that it couldn&#x27;t be returned but wondered if they knew what the problem was and if it was worth repairing.  </li>
            <li>Need a more professional model to really do the job.</li>
            <li>First one sorta messed up on me and contacted the buyer n did respond and&lt;br /&gt;Helped</li>
            <li>It does get hot</li>
            <li>The directions could be a little more useful for changing the bit.  </li>
            <li>Left a detailed message, which they never returned.</li>
            <li>It wobbles too much.  </li>
            <li>Fast service, def recommend buying from them!&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I would def buy from them again, this is how I decided to purchase things on Amazon, off of real customer reviews</li>
            <li>I would recommend this item to anyone who wants to do nails at home.</li>
            <li>without much use.</li>
            <li>You do need to turn it up high to use it</li>
            <li>looked as though it wasn&#x27;t new.  </li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t had a problem with my new drill at all</li>
            <li>Machine is new but stopped working and would like to replace</li>
            <li>If you want something to last then invest in a higher end drill, if you are practicing then start with this one.</li>
            <li>The drill does get hot if you leave it in one place for too long, but thats a given when you have an object spinning at a high speed on your sensitive nail beds.</li>
            <li>It made a really loud grinding noise if it was set to the max.</li>
            <li>but so far I have not had any  problems with it.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, when you purchase from Mambate, they are only interested until they get your money.  </li>
            <li>At first, when it started acting up, it would only engage when slid to high, now it engages as soon as you start to move the slide, but only in high speed.</li>
            <li>Overall it has good speed and did not become bogged down.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last night and it will definitely take some practice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this item for a few months now and use it at least once a week for my own personal acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>i would recommend for anyone to purchase this item took way to long to arrive and it was broken when i received it so not happy and not of good quality very cheapy looking</li>
            <li>, they didn&#x27;t think I was lying or anything, they told me they would send me a new drill and to take my time sending the other drill back to them</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what you use all the other bits in the large blue container for, but just using this two times pays for the price of a pedicure!</li>

            <li> and then the pink part turns to unlock to bit.  </li>
            <li> You insert whatever bit you want to use and turn the pink section to lock it in.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed because I loved it (while it worked).  </li>
            <li> The wand is coming loose after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;m not completely happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shipping box was in tact, but when I opened it, the drill&#x27;s box looked a little beat up.  </li>
            <li> A small rubber washer came off my machine and now it is noisy and vibrates.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I would in a nail salon.  </li>
            <li> This works on thick  and damaged nails.</li>
            <li> This drill isn&#x27;t bad.</li>

            <li> I purchased this item and received it in about 3 days.  When I received the package and opened it, it seems as though the item was returned once, before being shipped to me. The item also did not work for long.  It made a really loud grinding noise if it was set to the max.After contacting the vendor I was asked to troubleshoot the problem to find out where the problem was located. I refused because the item would not power on.  I have yet to receive a replacement.  No offer of a return postage label or anything.  I would not recommend this product or vendor to anyone.</li>
            <li> If I had written this a month ago, I would have given a 5 star rating.  I&#x27;ve only used it 4 times and the speed control broke. At first, when it started acting up, it would only engage when slid to high, now it engages as soon as you start to move the slide, but only in high speed. This began 2 weeks after my return agreement expired. I did call the company for recommendations for repair. Left a detailed message, which they never returned. I even acknowledged in my message that I was aware that it couldn&#x27;t be returned but wondered if they knew what the problem was and if it was worth repairing.  No response.  Apparently, when you purchase from Mambate, they are only interested until they get your money.  Very disappointed because I loved it (while it worked).  Update!   Apparently, the phone number listed is not the best way to contact Mambate! I emailed them and they have graciously agreed to replace my AGPtek nail drill!  Thank you....I really do love this product!</li>
            <li> It works well very useful</li>
            <li> The wand is coming loose after a few uses.  It wobbles too much.  Need a more professional model to really do the job.</li>
            <li> This drill isn&#x27;t bad. You do need to turn it up high to use it otherwise it will stop if you use pressure.</li>
            <li> I received my drill today, as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping box was in tact, but when I opened it, the drill&#x27;s box looked a little beat up.  Everything seemed to be well packaged/bubble wrapped.  But once I started to open it, I see the container holding the 30 pcs. looked as though it wasn&#x27;t new.  It wasn&#x27;t sealed, has a huge crack and the some of the bits have rust spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m not completely happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very great service. First one sorta messed up on me and contacted the buyer n did respond and&lt;br /&gt;Helped with sending out another. Fast service, def recommend buying from them!&lt;br /&gt;works wonderful n comes with many other sizes of tips to work with.&lt;br /&gt;Try it! you truly will love it!! </li>
            <li> the only way that it works is if i turn it up almost all the way cuz if i dont then when i apply pressure it slows down and dont work as good but othere than that i love it</li>
            <li> I was a little scared in the beginning, but this company has been the absolute best with me, i am a cosmotologist and , when I got my first drill from them the drill bit wouldn&#x27;t release so , i told them and they were very respectful and understanding, not snobby, they didn&#x27;t think I was lying or anything, they told me they would send me a new drill and to take my time sending the other drill back to them and they would refund me the cost of shipping , and they kept there word, a couple days later $ back in my account, this company rocks, they keep there word, I haven&#x27;t had a problem with my new drill at all, I would def buy from them again, this is how I decided to purchase things on Amazon, off of real customer reviews</li>
            <li> A small rubber washer came off my machine and now it is noisy and vibrates.  Before this happened I was thrilled with it.  I can&#x27;t get washer to go back on.</li>
            <li> Me gusto mucho my Nail Drill muchas gracias por el servicio, seguridad y confianza que da a sus clientes........ Lo recomiendo con 5 stars :)</li>
            <li> I finally went ahead and bought a drill to start doing my nails at home again. I chose this one because it has the pedal option. I used it for the first time last night and it will definitely take some practice. Overall it has good speed and did not become bogged down. It does not take any pressure to file nails either. I definitely think it is comparable to drills used in my local salons. I would recommend this item to anyone who wants to do nails at home.</li>
            <li> This item worked great for only 6 months....without much use. If you want something to last then invest in a higher end drill, if you are practicing then start with this one.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed</li>
            <li> I love this nail drill, it works just like being in the nail shop. It my sister an her friend nails came out nice. I would recommend this drill to anyone.</li>
            <li> When nail clippers won&#x27;t work anymore I needed something else. This works on thick  and damaged nails. I would recommend  wearing a mask because of the nail dust.</li>
            <li> I am using this for personal use.  I am not sure if I would in a nail salon.  It does get hot but so far I have not had any  problems with it.  I would definitely recommend and purchase again for personal use.</li>
            <li> No stars for item!!!!!! that quit after two months.  Don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> Loved it was just what I was looking for now I can save money on pedicures! And my daughter also has started doing her own manicures!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great machine with affordable price.  It came with 30 bits, great to work around the house. 4 stars</li>
            <li> The directions could be a little more useful for changing the bit.  Once I figured out the pink middle section was supposed to move, I had to loosen the silver part above the middle pink section a tad and then the pink part turns to unlock to bit.  You insert whatever bit you want to use and turn the pink section to lock it in.  You are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it immediately and I love it.  There are a lot of sanding covers and they will last a long time.  I&#x27;m not sure what you use all the other bits in the large blue container for, but just using this two times pays for the price of a pedicure!</li>
            <li> i would recommend for anyone to purchase this item took way to long to arrive and it was broken when i received it so not happy and not of good quality very cheapy looking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this item for a few months now and use it at least once a week for my own personal acrylic nails. (DIY). I love it and it does exactly what I want. The drill does get hot if you leave it in one place for too long, but thats a given when you have an object spinning at a high speed on your sensitive nail beds. Very happy and hope to get a lot of uses for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item and it stopped working 40 days after purchasr and was used about 4 times . It says i am not eligble to replace. Machine is new but stopped working and would like to replace i have original  box and all accesories included.</li>
