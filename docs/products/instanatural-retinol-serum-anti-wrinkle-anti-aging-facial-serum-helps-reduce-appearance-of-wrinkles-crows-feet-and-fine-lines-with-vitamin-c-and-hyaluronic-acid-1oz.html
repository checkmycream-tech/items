            <li>it&#x27;s awesome first time</li>
            <li>Even my husband keeps mentioning how beautiful and smooth my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t notice any great improvement on my fine line after I wash my face.</li>
            <li>my skin is real smooth.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>BUT I am happy that I have had no problems using it on my skin which is a HUGE plus!&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li>All I have to say is the amazing result</li>
            <li>The company sends follow up emails to be sure you are happy with their product and offers suggestions on the best way to use it.</li>
            <li>This Retinol Serum is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF SMELLS AMAZING</li>
            <li>Oh this serum has an amazing citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s an age defying serum, but it&#x27;s just amazing skin care for anyone wanting healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed an amazing difference, but skin does appear to be tighter.</li>
            <li>My skin really feels great after using this product, It goes great underneath a moisturizer, I have seen a visible difference in lines on my face from using this for about a month.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own</li>
            <li>I also hoped it would help my eye bags, as retinal and vitamin C are supposedly effective towards that regard.</li>
            <li>i can honestly say i do not see any change or improvement in my skin,</li>
            <li>I use this every night after the Rose Water Toner and before a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>and then a gentle moisturizer before bed for best</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I received a sample of this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li>Thanks for another great product InstaNatural!</li>
            <li>excellent product reasonably priced</li>
            <li>It dries really nicely.</li>
            <li>I honestly.  </li>
            <li>I was really thrilled with all the improvements that happened to my face and my neck.</li>
            <li>This product is loaded with so many quality good things that I know it will benefit my skin .</li>
            <li>I already use Vitamin A at night and thought how nice it would be to wear the retinol during the day as well (under my make-up).</li>
            <li>This product was sent to me for review purposes, as always, I give an honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Nice Price.</li>
            <li>Since you get a discount for purchasing more than 1 product at a time, it&#x27;s a great discount combined with free prime shipping!</li>
            <li>Bought the serum, eye gel and face lotion for my sister, who is also using and loving it.</li>
            <li>Wears nicely under makeup.</li>
            <li>Loving this serum for my face.</li>
            <li>Would have liked o know that it has a floral odor or scent, or a mix of floral and orange.  </li>
            <li>and it smell nice.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to purchase at a promotional price in order to evaluate it and share my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>vitamin C is a nice touch</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own let alone used in conjunction with Retinol and Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice smell of vit c.</li>
            <li>It perks your skin up nicely.</li>
            <li>It spreads nicely on the face (I put it all over face and neck).</li>
            <li>I honestly have no need to look for another serum.</li>
            <li>Nice consistency and no sticky residue.</li>
            <li>and this is my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s fragrance was so nice</li>
            <li>feels nice on the skin without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I feel it may be too soon to see any kind of miraculous changes in the quality of my skin</li>
            <li>I am absolutely thrilled with InstaNatural Retinol Serum.</li>
            <li>It has what I would describe as a nice orange peel scent which reminds me of my citrus scented oils.</li>
            <li>After 10 – 15 minutes of drying on your face, use a warm washcloth and wash the mask off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a watery texture but it moisturizes once it touches the skin, which I find quite amusing.</li>
            <li>so I guess this is just a nice product for maintaining your skin health.</li>
            <li>I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving the results.  </li>

            <li>and I can honestly say I can tell a difference in the fine lines and the softness of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use it under my makeup and it gives my skin a beautiful glow.</li>

            <li>I am sure with continued use, the effects will continue.  </li>
            <li>This serum has made my skin brighter, smoother and more glowy.</li>

            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Would buy this again :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li>the retinol is being talked about more and more.</li>
            <li>I want more than hope in a jar, I want results.  </li>
            <li>Best overall results.  </li>
            <li>have tried many products for wrinkle reduction.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and so does my son.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m nervous to bump up the application to twice a day since I think even more blemishes will appear if I smear the recommended sunscreen on top of my make-up, moisturizer and the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and yes, it makes my skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it, Im an esthetician 6years, and I just came across this brand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I also like the eye dropper style top.</li>
            <li>Once applied it absorbs into the skin really fast and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li>In case you didn&#x27;t know, I LOVE naturals products.</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin to be more plump and with a glow.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t sting or feel like an acid peel.</li>
            <li>I feel that the longer I use it the better results I will see.</li>
            <li>so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I love this serum.</li>
            <li>Love ths serum.</li>
            <li>know they can be more drying for me.</li>
            <li>if more the moisturiser ‘balls’.  </li>
            <li>So, each bottle costs over $6 more than for US customers.  </li>
            <li>To top it off it does what it says.</li>
            <li>My skin is noticibly brighter and more even toned.</li>
            <li>I have been using for about 3 weeks now and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this serum...</li>

            <li>I am so in love...  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed with it, I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li>I wanna say I love it</li>
            <li>how many days I suppose to wait??</li>
            <li>Have tried several of them and they all work great!</li>
            <li>It has made my skin texture better.</li>
            <li>younger is best.</li>
            <li>I always love InstaNatural&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but I have been using it for almost a month now, only at night, and continue to be impressed.</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t seen a change to the age spots (I would like to give it more time to work)</li>
            <li>I Love my Line if InstaNaturals I got.  </li>
            <li>and it does not make my oily skin more oily</li>
            <li>I have tried many products and none have worked.  </li>
            <li>I will surely post my response to the moisturizer when I start using it.</li>
            <li>Thank You :-)</li>
            <li>Even so, I wanted to try some of the newer products before considering something more</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with the YouthExpress Eye Gel by the same company and I am very happy with the results.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used this serum for a couple of weeks, and am totally satisfied with the results I&#x27;m seeing.  </li>
            <li>I would give it more than 5 stars if I could.</li>

            <li>The smell most closely resembles Goo-Gone.  </li>
            <li>We received this product for free from InstaNatural, the review is our own.</li>
            <li>My wife has enjoyed all of the InstaNatural products she has used.</li>
            <li>The things I like better with InstaNatural is they list all their ingredients and they give you directions how to use the product.</li>
            <li>It works for fading blemishes and this seems to be more of a problem</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I was able to review this.</li>
            <li>I have bought so many anti wrinkle creams that did not work</li>
            <li>Have enjoyed using this serum.  </li>
            <li>need the most attention.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it</li>
            <li>products n love the</li>
            <li>I am able to use it every evening with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks a lot smoother than before where the InstaNatural Retinol Serum is helping to absorb more of the InstaNatural Retinol Moisturizer Cream into my skin as opposed to using the moisturizer alone.</li>
            <li>I think if she would use it more dilegently it would be even better.</li>
            <li>serum does absorb fast and I am hearing great things, so i&#x27;m sure it does work with some skin types</li>
            <li>, I have most of their line.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the results of this product.  </li>
            <li>I feel this serum is effective and it has made a significant difference in the feel and look of my face.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>The serum goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, smells great (light and citrusy), makes my skin feel softer and more radiant.</li>
            <li>Feels nice and clean on your face.</li>
            <li>I tried the Healthy wise serum and Insta Natural is so much better!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to any woman who cares greatly about their skin.</li>
            <li>I have also been looking in to ‘clean’ beauty products and attempting to learn more about the chemicals in products I use, so trying these products from Instanatural was a great first</li>
            <li>This does absorb quickly into the skin after application, which I love!    </li>
            <li>It has a nice natural pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>This serum feels cool and hydrating upon application, which I liked.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a good experience when I tried retinols for the first time years ago.</li>
            <li>Its gentle yet extremely effective!</li>
            <li>Love this product, and used with other InstaNatural products you can have that perfect skin you desire :)  </li>
            <li>prefer this to my Phillip  Thomas Roth because it&#x27;s a bit thicker and goes on much more easily and evenly.</li>
            <li>i put this on after a quick rinse of rose water.</li>
            <li>The dropper is wonderful, this is very lightweight and spreads really well.  </li>
            <li>I do know that overtime, I&#x27;ll be able to tell if it is doing anything for fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t do what Botox and fillers do, but it does even skin tone, and reduce fine lines, which gives a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>very sweet smell.</li>
            <li>I wish I could say better things about this serum because I am a HUGE InstaNatural fan</li>
            <li>think this is a great company and their products are phenomenal, I definitely will be trying out more products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>My skin is beautiful and has such a healthy glow...</li>
            <li>I saw some more resilence with my skin and found the product went on incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural Retinol Serum plus Astaxanthin - InstaNatural is becoming a household name around here</li>
            <li>I feel more comfortable using safer products on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Retinol Serum is one of my go to products as nothing is better than retinol to smooth out the edges.  </li>
            <li>love this light, citrus scent serum.</li>
            <li>but I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>My wife is happy to use natural products that do not harm her skin.</li>
            <li>I have written a more detailed review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
            <li>I did receive this complimentary for review although my thoughts and opinions are always unbiased and completely my own.</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary bottle for giving my honest opinion and review.</li>
            <li>Now it is available in many easy to acquire beauty products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The company was very interested in my review and did an awesome job following up with me.  </li>
            <li>Their formulations only include the best, highest quality ingredients, and they do exactly what they claim!&lt;br /&gt;After reading many skincare books, and listening to a dermatologist on the radio, I&#x27;ve keyed in to the word Retinol.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Retinol is now easy to get in a multitude of skin care products.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to control.</li>
            <li>Its orange is color, smells like oranges, and soaks into the skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>This serum is easy to apply and is non greasy and doesn&#x27;t haze my vision like some of the others.</li>
            <li>Absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>The all do such wonderful things to help keep my skin dew and fresh looking.</li>
            <li>Easy squeeze dropper to dispense.  </li>
            <li>Truthfully, I really thought the price was too cheap for it to be any good  </li>
            <li>So far so good, need more time...</li>
            <li>So far so good &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>The first week was fantastic--I thought it tightened up my skin amazingly and for someone who is 70 that is saying something.  </li>
            <li>and I honestly thought I saw a difference the first day.  </li>
            <li>My fine lines and wrinkles are disappearing.  </li>
            <li>Retinol is a known wrinkle fighter and can even reduce fine lines.</li>
            <li>My skin has cleared up and my fine lines around my eyes seem to have diminished.</li>
            <li>so I cannot tell how it is working on fine lines and wrinkles to date.  </li>
            <li>– I didn’t notice any difference changing to  Instanatural serums except that I now seem to have fine ‘smokers lines’.</li>
            <li>My skin texture is smoother, with diminished appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>I used this on my fine lines and age spots.</li>
            <li>The fine lines that Father Time seems to leave with us gradually fade or diminish and the skin takes on a smoother appearance.  </li>
            <li>Since it is a squeeze top, I never twisted the top on -</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>Fine Lines&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can use it twice a day and feel it has improved the appearance of my skin, both reducing fine lines and evening out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Fine lines are fading....</li>
            <li>I am 59 and my fine lines and wrinkles have reduced after a couple of weeks using these products.  </li>
            <li>My fine lines seems to have gone away.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li>It seems to help my skin retain moisture which plumps up fine lines and reduces flakiness.</li>
            <li>I gave this stuff 3 because I saw a mild improvement, but I&#x27;ve used better products.  </li>
            <li>I love how quickly it absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li>No issues, arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>Feels ok on skin, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and it is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>Been using it for 2 weeks, good so far!</li>
            <li>Do wish that this serum was a bit thicker, but that just a minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did receive this product for free in exchange for an honest &amp; fair review.</li>
            <li>the gel has a great slip and glides on easily and absorbs instantly.</li>
            <li>So the serum was not thick at all and  absorbed in the skin very nicely without a sticky residue.</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference in the fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, and will certainly buying more when it runs out.</li>
            <li>retinol serum is a huge exception to the rule.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a huge change in my lines.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural and smells amazing.</li>

            <li>My honest opinion for a product that really works.   </li>
            <li>Eye gel also fabulous.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for light peel this is the product.  </li>
            <li>but I do smell and extremely light citrus.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for making the overall skin texture smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>I got this item free for reviewing.</li>
            <li>Having used this for about 3 weeks, I am happy to report that this is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li>I have also recently ordered a 2-oz. supply of Hyaluronic Acid serum from Insta Natural--a great deal through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love this serum, it is packed with antioxidants and it&#x27;s easily absorbed by skin.</li>
            <li>Has a light citrusy smell, that is energizing.</li>
            <li>Use it daily and found that I have experienced firming on a continuing basis.</li>

            <li>She has been using it for a few weeks now and has nothing but wonderful things to say.</li>
            <li>The serum is light in texture but closer to a gel versus being watery.</li>
            <li>*Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>After a month of use her acne has not disappeared entirely but it is greatly improved.</li>
            <li>I have no affiliation with Insta-Naturals and my customer experience has been fantastic.</li>
            <li>This product has a light citrusy fragrance that I like.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, dont hesitate, even though i have sensitive skin,it has been a greta product to use, no redness on application or after effects, easily absorbed, a deffinate must,..</li>

            <li>So far so good thankful</li>
            <li>I do love InstaNatural products, and have had only good experience with their products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even done wonders for my complexion, I feel like my pores are super clean!</li>
            <li>I can feel my face feel better right away.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see that this serum smelled like citrus and didnt contain as many chemicals as other comparable serums.</li>
            <li>Just ordered my second serving of this product - I&#x27;m sooo fortunate to have stumbled on this supplier!!!</li>
            <li>Will definitely continue to use this, love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>This is a very powerful Retinol serum.</li>
            <li>Good on sensitive skin because it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts nor sting when applied even to skin that has been irritated, but it goes on smooth, cool and non-oily and skin feels refreshed.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy, making it perfect for oiler skin types and it&#x27;s great under day or night cream for dry skin.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and overall it&#x27;s a fine product</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re worried about it lingering or being too strong, you should know that it fades quickly and is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and easily and makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite!</li>
            <li>What more could i say thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Has a great citrus smell, feels smooth on my face and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>Might be a good introduction to retinol, but not quite strong enough for more seasoned retinol users.</li>
            <li>It has more glow, more clarity, and is very soft.</li>
            <li>So I ordered a retinol serum from InstaNatural, and just 4 weeks later my skin is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to receive this product and try it.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I was just rubbing tangerine scented water into my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used any kind of serum because I honestly didn&#x27;t like the smell of them and how many harsh and often time acidic chemicals they include.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t seen a significant difference.</li>
            <li>significantly improve the health of my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the light, fresh orange scent and the way the serum is completely absorbed by my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this serum because it really works wonders on the fine lines that I have on the sides of my nose.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure will in time.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such an amazing serum</li>
            <li>Dries clean, so you can add whatever moisturizer you want.</li>
            <li>My first impression when I opened it was very appealing because the scent is very citrusy.</li>
            <li>have found though that all natural facial masks do work the best for me though.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is light, nothing sticky or oily, and it absorbs quickly, and there is no lingering smell.  </li>
            <li>I personally liked the Vit C Cream Moisturizer 20% facial lotion better than the Retinol Serum.</li>
            <li>, I use it at night before my night cream, it smells pleasant to me and not greasy at all, it goes on light and soaks in quickly, I have been using only two weeks  </li>
            <li>It is just that, pleasant, not overpowering, but enough.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews before purchasing, so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy like other serums and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>I find it very effective pre-makeup to smooth out any rough areas in my face.</li>
            <li>this product is as good as some other serums many times the cost.  </li>
            <li>but if you give it time, you will most certainly notice the tone and texture of your skin improving.</li>
            <li>Very good deal for such a high quality product.</li>
            <li>My skin is already looking more smooth and vibrant.</li>
            <li>First very good price, 2nd very fast delivery</li>
            <li>now on my last order the product is a bright orange color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, i would recommend for sensitive/dried parts of the face to be using carefully but still its great serum and does not stick on face.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after extensive comparison of available skin serums, and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Great product working as well as I expected will order again</li>
            <li>, I might give 5 star after couple of months see the full result.</li>
            <li>Since my favorite InstaNatural serum is the Hyaluronic Acid one, I am very please</li>
            <li>I liked the natural ingredient list from this serum.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.)</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>My skin feels nice and soft.</li>
            <li>This is a really good serum I am on my second bottle</li>
            <li>Good regular price for a lot of product and</li>
            <li>After one month I really do look better.</li>
            <li>My overall appearance was good because of the moisture and my skin felt tighter.  </li>
            <li>my face had some red blotches but after using product for 3 weeks there is no redness and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>The package was good, the product arrived promptly and in good condition, especially considering I am currently residing overseas.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for consumers.</li>
            <li>Pat it in for a minute or two for full absorption.  </li>
            <li>This ensures that serum full absorbs.</li>
            <li>I have had no bad reactions or irritations and I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li>smell is not BAD, it just isn&#x27;t orderless.</li>
            <li>Great serum, little strong on the retinol</li>
            <li>It has a soft creamy texture and a very pleasant slight citrusy smell that I love.</li>
            <li>Amazing serum, works well for my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This allows the products to absorb quickly and also allows your skin to reap the product&#x27;s full benefits by creating a moisturizing barrier.</li>
            <li>first I was a bit red but that quickly went away and my face felt tighter, very smooth and had a nice glow to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It moisturizers great that I don&#x27;t need to use my other moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have not had any peeling like I experienced with other retinol products.  </li>
            <li>I do not have noticable wrinkles, but from other reviews I&#x27;ve read this product is great for prevention of wrinkles as well as for existing wrinkles.</li>
            <li>My skin is now brighter, more even tone, my pores are still huge, but they are clear and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The sensation was fine at first but the problem came when I put it on my skin.</li>
            <li>so my skin changed dramatically and quickly.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice, light serum that absorbs well and has ingredients that are clinically proven to help wth various skin issues.  </li>
            <li>its not sticky and dries quickly for makeup application.</li>
            <li>My skin was not use to this type of product and it quickly adjusted and I had no problems after one week.</li>
            <li>, it is not tacky and absorbs fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Mixing the 2 - as in this serum - will quickly oxidise the vitamin C and render the Niacinamide, nicotinic acid.</li>
            <li>and yes, I know I&#x27;m lucky),</li>
            <li>and you will continue to succeed tremendously.</li>
            <li>I use it at night and then apply a super moisturizing night cream over it.</li>
            <li>The serum absorbs quickly so I don&#x27;t have to wait forever to apply the night cream.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This serum is great so far, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week in combination with the retinol moisturizer and my skin is softer and brighter and has even helped clear up some breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have been told my skin looks more youthful and vibrant in appearance.</li>
            <li>More than a million visitors each year flock to this extraordinary body of water in the Mediterranean, which contains many minerals beneficial to the skin, such as magnesium, sodium, bromine, potassium and calcium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>After getting an email from the company , i wrote back asking if there were more appropriate products for her acne.</li>
            <li>I love that it contains antioxidants, hyaluronic acid and a high percentage of vitamin c.</li>

            <li>It is great that there are still products out there that actually perform as promised.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>Okay maybe because it&#x27;s new to my skin</li>
            <li>the color of the serum in an opaque white and what I especially noticed about the serum was the very pleasant scent.  </li>

            <li>The dropper makes it easy to apply and not use too much.</li>

            <li>I love Insta Natural products if you don&#x27;t already know!</li>
            <li>me look younger and more glowing!</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural!</li>
            <li>The serum seems to have really smoothed out the fine lines.</li>
            <li>It is more even toned and has reduced fine lines, especially underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li>gentle with a light citrus scent.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>Really pumps my face ,and  smooth my skin.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic, like real orange extract.  </li>
            <li>My skin is definitely softer and has a nice glow.</li>
            <li>: I was provided a complimentary sample.</li>
            <li>I have used Rx creams that have had benefit but this is much lighter and more gentle to my skin.</li>
            <li>I was using oz-natural retinol serum previously, I recently tried insta Natural retinol serum, I am really happy with this serum</li>
            <li>gave it a good solid try, but it just didn&#x27;t make much difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;(I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily absorbed by your skin, with no peeling side effects so prevalent with retinol</li>
            <li>Over the years I have tried many things, most with minimal or no results at all.</li>
            <li>I love beauty products and I am always on the lookout for products that are natural.</li>
            <li>The only product I dislike is their cleanser, which it is not the product itself, but my own preference.</li>
            <li>My laugh lines (and I laugh a LOT) are still there</li>
            <li>But so far, I love it.</li>
            <li>So far I have totally enjoyed the InstaNatural line of products.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for a couple weeks and my skin feels like it&#x27;s glowing and looking fresh.</li>
            <li>This serum is effective especially after I use my micro-needling instrument.</li>
            <li>For the price, it is worth the chance; I&#x27;d recommend it it anyone.</li>
            <li>I love it so far.  </li>
            <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Companies like yours are rare.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and most Retinol products</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because I feel that it could provide better results than what I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Packed with 2.5% of Retinol that protects against free-radical damage, helps reverse the appearance of sun damage and the telltale signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;- Powerful antioxidants that trap moisture to prevent future loss so you can enjoy a more youthful appearance with firmer, plumper skin.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I would definitely be into trying more of these products, as they are straight forward, a great price point, and you actually see the results.  </li>
            <li>I rarely have a reaction to those.  </li>
            <li>Smoothes out one&#x27;s complexion like whoa and supercharges with powerful antioxidants like vitamins C and E.  </li>
            <li>Gets absorbed into the skin almost immediately but needs additional moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li>Does not burn around the eye area at all since it gets absorbed into skin without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly worth a try.</li>
            <li>I have been using InstaNatural Age Defying Retinol Serum for a few weeks now and am very happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>Great function, cost less!</li>
            <li>If you only read the first line of my review : BUY THIS SERUM!&lt;br /&gt;I am ridiculously in love with this product!</li>
            <li>You can use the serum twice a day with your skincare regimen, unless you spot redness and/or peeling, which then you would use once daily or until you find the time schedule that works best for your skin (i.e. every other day if you continue to experience sensitivity).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The serum itself is pretty liquidy, but it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have particularly high hopes when ordering this serum, but was pleasantly surprised with how effective this product is in getting rid of age spots on my face and hands.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away and like the feel of my skin after using the serum.    </li>
            <li>The serum goes on right after I wash my face in the morning</li>
            <li>right after I have cleansed my face.</li>
            <li>Right price....</li>
            <li>So far I am excited by these products!</li>
            <li>Having worked in an executive capacity for a major cosmetic company for over 15 years I have to say I love it.</li>
            <li>I use this religiously twice a day and when I look in the mirror I can&#x27;t believe that after hundreds of products, I have finally found the one that is showing 100% promise of getting my skin back to flawless, poreless, baby smooth skin.</li>
            <li>The retinol is definitely present, as I did see the turnover and newer (better looking) skin rather quickly.</li>
            <li>The retinol is definitely present, as I did see the turnover and newer (better looking) skin rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve to say higher price normally guarantees good quality including  fancy packaging , but doesn&#x27;t necessary</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good anti-aging product or you have dark spots, this is the one to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the addition of the hyaluronic acid also helps allow the additional hydration of the skin keep away the redness and flakiness that such a strong retinol would normally cause.  </li>
            <li>Due to the antioxidant blend and also the vitamins, I noticed a quick plumping from the vitamin C, which smoothed out my face nicely before applying moisturizers and make-up.</li>

            <li>Will certainly keep buying this product!</li>
            <li>It’s relatively scentless, has a nice consistency, and applies really well.</li>
            <li>I actually have several of InstaNatural&#x27;s products and have been happy with them all.</li>
            <li>I only use it once at nights only, no sensitivity which is great.</li>
            <li>--it didn&#x27;t cause a breakout, it smells good, and I am noticing a slight difference on my neck...</li>
            <li>This one however, is super gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most gentle serum with retinol I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice product to use at night,but gentle enough for daytime.</li>
            <li>My skin looks very healthy and smooth only when I have it on and the fine lines are less visible.  </li>
            <li>I like the serum very much.  </li>
            <li>I have received compliments on my skin and have seen a marked reduction of fine lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my second order, and I love the result</li>
            <li>Admittedly, I try many different serums, lotions &amp; potions...</li>
            <li>I get at least one compliment a day about how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li>i did high hopes for this to work!!</li>
            <li>It is really making a difference!</li>
            <li>I think it is worth trying for anyone who has the desire to refine and gently exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li>love this serum and works wonders on my boy friend&#x27;s skin -it is my second bottle</li>
            <li>This product keeps skin soft and wrinkle free skin clarity is noticicable.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say any more than that since I&#x27;ve been using this product for a short while.</li>
            <li>I do not have many wrinkles yet, but it does seem to tighten the tiny ones around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I like that my skin feels &#x27;tighter&#x27; but not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>Also, I noticed 2 sun spots on my forehead so I am really hoping this will help with those!</li>
            <li>I literally saw results on the first use.</li>
            <li>To be able to treat both my acne and my wrinkles with one product is nothing short of a miracle.  </li>
            <li>could you tell me how I can give you back the product and benefit of your guarantee satisfied or money</li>
            <li>However, within the first week, I broke out &#x3D;</li>
            <li>It is also pretty hydrating</li>
            <li>The smell is very yummy too!  </li>
            <li>Could not expect more, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle.</li>
            <li>I use this serum in the morning and at night and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I used this serum day and night for the first 2 months.</li>
            <li>Absorbs fast!</li>
            <li>Which is exactly what I am looking for.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>molecule which is stable at higher pH. Vitamin C (or the stable phosphate salt derivative used here) is stable at pH 3-7</li>
            <li>My skin feels like it&#x27;s in much better condition, and I feel a lot younger.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a magical wrinkle eraser, but I don&#x27;t think that there is such thing anyways..</li>
            <li>This will make u look younger for sure.</li>
            <li>This product does relax wrinkles when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>i love face oils and this one is no different.  </li>

            <li>It makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This really does a great job of firming up your skin and giving it that healthy glow and at the same time is helping to reduce wrinkles and age spots, even uneven skin or scars!  </li>
            <li>and I really like the fresh look</li>
            <li>Will keep using and most likely will buy again</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t exactly say if it is from this serum or a combination of InstaNatural products as I use their whole line of products!</li>
            <li>Only time will tell  I am still using it &amp; I am not quite sure yet what the benefits are.  </li>
            <li>I was able to buy the product at a reduced cost and will be buying it again in the future even without a discount.</li>
            <li>I have tried and reacted to many different Retinols creams, lotions, and serums.</li>
            <li>When I finish this first bottle, I will update this review with the results that I have, or have not, had.  </li>
            <li>First time users may want to use it once a day just to see how their skin feels afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel the price is reasonable and was fortunate enough to try it for free to review through BrandBacker.</li>
            <li>Why would you put yourself through red, flaky skin on your face with a more aggressive form?</li>
            <li>I use this first, then apply the InstaNatural moisturing cream.</li>
            <li>I found the combination of these two facial creams and hydrating myself appropriately (8 glasses of water a day)</li>
            <li>My wife tried this product and she noticed softer skin after the first use.</li>
            <li>If you have the chance to looker younger and have healthier skin, take the chance, you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>I like being able to use one product on multiple areas.</li>
            <li>This was my way to make sure I did not have red skin during the holidays.</li>
            <li>This was my way to make sure I did not have red skin during the holidays.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give a five star because I believe it should last for more than 30 days</li>
            <li>With my love for the chase, I very rarely settle down, and add a product permanently to my beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I didn’t notice any adverse reaction of the product on my skin, but my mom experienced discomfort and a bit of a flaky dry patch on her skin after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a big fan of Retinol treatments, ever since my days with philosophy cosmetics using their Miracle Worker line and Help Me treatment.</li>
            <li>I really like the variety of strong antioxidants and natural ingredients in this product.  </li>
            <li>I am very excited with the results I am seeing in only 2ish weeks of using!  </li>
            <li>I have made sure to keep the retinol cream away from my eyes, as I have very sensitive under eye skin and that has been working thus far.  </li>
            <li>The price was a amazing as were the other reviews.  </li>
            <li>It really is an incredible product for when you need a little something extra.</li>
            <li>One night, I tried it alone without any other skincare product in my regimen and the result was astounding.</li>
            <li>I am 73 years old with significant wrinkles around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li>so far so good.. haven&#x27;t seen any real changes but haven&#x27;t used it for that long..</li>
            <li>Packed with goodness to help blemishes, clear pores and clean your skin all over.  </li>
            <li>and I really love that it absorbs quickly and makes my skin extra soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much the wrinkles with continue to &amp;#34;smooth out&amp;#34; but I will definitely keep using it to give it time to work its magic.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as it is well worth a try.</li>
            <li>I had another brand of retinol serum,that made my skin a little irritated,so I was not sure if I should this at all,but I gave it a try my skin was not itchy,was not red,my skin actually loved this brand,j was very pleased with the outcome .My</li>
            <li>Always keep in mind the easy rule of applying skincare products in the order they are formulated, from thinnest first to heaviest being your last.</li>
            <li>and I am seeing positive results after one week.</li>
            <li>It really works clarifying your skin and reducing wrinkles, VERY SATIFIED with product!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 2-3 weeks so far, i&#x27;m going to give this a few more weeks and see if I can have a better opinion.</li>
            <li>I got this for my sister to try because I have loved all the Instanatural products I&#x27;ve gotten in the past.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full of quality natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>In the first week I could definitely see a difference in fine lines and decrease in dullness.  </li>
            <li>have always been kind of scared to use any serums, but I was shocked at how much I really liked this product!</li>
            <li>skin looks bright, clear and remarkably wrinkle-free (this is also due to the other products I use, but the serum is definitely the spark that made everything else work.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Makes skin super soft.</li>
            <li>I am sure I can keep using this in the summer months as well since it doesn’t dry my skin</li>
            <li>The serum goes on vey smoothly and is absorbed into the skin rather quickly, with no sticky residue or tight feeling.  </li>
            <li>It may take more treatments for these and only time will bare witness to this product&#x27;s success.  </li>
            <li>What attracted me to this product is that it’s suppose to not only help repair your skin it also stimulate new healthy skin.</li>
            <li>And I can notice a different in fine wrinkles around my eyes</li>
            <li>The formula was a bit runnier than other serums I&#x27;ve used in the past, but it smelled wonderful and didn&#x27;t tingle at all.  </li>
            <li>I am starting to get fine lines and wrinkles and with this product</li>
            <li>It is a very high quality Serum...</li>
            <li>My smile lines are looking less apparent and becoming filled.</li>
            <li>I see that my fine lines and wrinkles are much smoother and my overall skin tone feels tighter and brighter.</li>
            <li>The serum smells lightly of oranges and absorbs immediately, and so far I am very pleased with this, and I will definitely purchase again, and I am looking forward to trying  other InstaNatural products.</li>
            <li>and like I mentioned, I have very fair thin freckly 70 year old skin</li>
            <li>I have only been using retinol for a few weeks and it has been a great experience.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s lightweight and has an amazing texture when it goes on- not greasy or heavy like some brands.</li>
            <li>It has definitely helped my skins health and after a month I can tell a huge change in the tightness around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;*I</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, has really helped my skin around my eyes look younger</li>
            <li>I can definitely tell a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>After many years spent in the sun, my skin is showing some sun damage and hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>You also don’t need much.</li>
            <li>It’s also really recommended that you use a sunscreen with it, as Retinol can enhance the effects of the sun.</li>
            <li>The customer support is great and has no problem refunding you if you&#x27;re not happy.  </li>
            <li>It has really worked well for me.  </li>
            <li>Retinol can be very drying and the hyaluronic acid</li>
            <li>really helps counteract that effect when I use it.</li>
            <li>and I get the same youthful and smooth look and feel to my face.  </li>
            <li>This serum helped smooth out my one stubborn deep line between my brows.</li>
            <li>I use this serum at night and have been very please with the results.</li>
            <li>It is also gentle around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Cleared a very deep/cystic acne blemish I have had for weeks in two uses.</li>
            <li>Minimizes lines and gives an overall smooth appearance</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so soft, firm, acne free and wrinkle free!</li>
            <li>my face looks so much clearer</li>
            <li>i really like this product</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the whole bottle yet</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much of a scent</li>
            <li>The ingredients  in this serum do help much to retain the hydration your skin needs to keep youthful and provides you that glow and even tone throughout your face.</li>
            <li>I really do like the InstaNatural product line.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum</li>
            <li>I much prefer a water soluble cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like how fast if absorbs and leaves no greasy feel on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>but I really like the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t??</li>
            <li>When I first used it i got break out is it normal?</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It works better than expected and now my daughter is using it too.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will absolutely buy this product again.</li>
            <li>I still have some breakouts around my forehead, but because I&#x27;ve been using their mask, it&#x27;s helped so much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also received compliments which I really did not expect.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>It really glows my skin.</li>
            <li>I absolutely do like the product.</li>
            <li>I can say that this product really did</li>
            <li>Maybe it needs to be used in junction with a derma roller to really penetrate the skin.</li>
            <li>I have now been using this for 2 months, and I am absolutely amazed at the difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to getting it on a promo to try and review</li>
            <li>My skin texture is much nicer, and I have a glow even without makeup.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and item was well packaged.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li>Reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The serum absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>This really helps with them</li>
            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>Then my wrinkles are very not visible.</li>
            <li>This product really does work.</li>
            <li>under eye wrinkles are disappearing fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think its really doing anything.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really doing the job.</li>
            <li>Cant really see any change.</li>
            <li>but dont really see any change or improvement</li>
            <li>I was not expecting this to do much or anything at all to my skin</li>
            <li>Your products are in no way responsible for the condition of my skin, I have done it all to myself.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say anything about this product really.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very watery.</li>
            <li>serum is somewhat milky/tawny in color and very watery.</li>
            <li>will continue using this product and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>When I heard about this promotion the mask sounded promising.  </li>
            <li>thanks for the product.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks so much clearer and tighter since I&#x27;ve been using this product.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>but don&#x27;t really see any improvements.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>hopefully, I  will continue to see improvement as the product is very affordable.</li>
            <li>Product works really well.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
            <li>I really like their products.</li>
            <li>My complexion looks so much brighter and my skin tone has evened out.</li>
            <li>It really works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sikha</li>
            <li>Could be that the zit is caused by something else, but I&#x27;m still putting this product on hold for a while to see it really is the culprit.</li>
            <li>She said it works really well.  </li>
            <li>Bad:&lt;br /&gt;-It smells very citrus-y.  </li>
            <li>The product is reasonable and is guaranteed to work for you.</li>
            <li>I lightly dabbed my problem areas like under eyes, forehead, middle of eyebrows, and neck area.</li>
            <li>so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from InstaNatural.  </li>
            <li>so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from InstaNatural.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I have sensitive skin, but I definitely have to be mindful of the products I use, as many things break me out.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>My skin more hydrated, clear, pores smaller, birghter skin.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my sister who has problem skin and the following review is her story: Normally a product containing 2.5% Retinol serum would be way too strong for my skin to handle</li>
            <li>I love that I have found a good skincare regimen to slow down the aging process as my skin is just starting to show signs of aging - losing elasticity and fine lines.</li>
            <li>first thing that I always do when trying a new product is smell it.</li>
            <li>At first, I was concerned that it might irritate my skin because of some of the feedback, but that is not the case - and, I do have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I threw away all the other stuff I&#x27;ve collected trying to search for the better one--</li>
            <li>I have not seen any major results yet but will report back when I do as i am sure I will.  </li>
            <li>I may try it every other night and also find a better moisturizer.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s definitely something to smile about!</li>
            <li>I am 34, ops, 35 years old with normal skin and wrinkles around eyes that get really noticeable when I smile.</li>
            <li>products from this company are gentle and natural with real results!</li>
            <li>Very quick to dry as well.</li>
            <li>but, after years of playing softball and long summers of swimming, I have fine lines around my eyes and forehead from squinting at the sun.</li>
            <li>This serum has given me the same results for much, much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it because it features the key ingredients if my favorite Rodan and Fields products for a much lower price.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone that is considering the much costlier dermatologist options.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a refreshing slight scent of citrus while applying it - not a heavy smell at all and dissipates right away.  </li>
            <li>I am always on a quest to find a good skin repairing regiment to help with the Dry and Rough skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell any difference in the appearance of my skin, other than more blemishes than normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other InstaNatural products and have been very pleased with them.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell a very noticeable difference which is normal because any products need 2/3 months to see a result.</li>
            <li>Somehow I feel my dark spots are getting lighter , stil need more time to see</li>
            <li>I almost wish I had the guts to treat one side of my face and not the other so that I could post pictures to show how effective the product really is, but I&#x27;m only willing to go so far for the sake of an Amazon review.</li>
            <li>I am a new fan!  </li>
            <li>Dark circles are also a huge issue I have and this really helps me out a lot!</li>
            <li>and It works just as well or better for half the cost....</li>
            <li>I can see that the bags under her eyes are less noticeable and her skin looks better but don&#x27;t tell her</li>
            <li>I love the product and its slightly orange-y smell.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed my skin is softer, particularly below my eyes where my cheeks begin.</li>
            <li>This is only the second Vitamin C product I&#x27;ve ever used, so I am giving it an OK</li>
            <li>The actual product is not sticky and it does adsorb quickly.</li>
            <li>I definitely feel like I have smoother, more younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>As I get older</li>
            <li>I decided to test it on my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; because this area as we get older will tend to sag as well.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to help prevent it from looking older if I can help it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t turn back the clock, but it definitely diminishes the texture by smoothening the surface and gives skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I am older</li>
            <li>the older I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i am a breast cancer patient and the chemo therapy really made my skin dry and wrinkled specially around my eyes.</li>
            <li>i-herb shipping is $8 for a large order, so if getting supplements anyway,  other products basically have free shipping – so will investigate what products are on offer.</li>
            <li>I have only used for a little while, but my skin certainly seems to look better!</li>
            <li>I had an acne breakout, in the middle of my forehead, I picked at it and it left a scab, but after daily use, my scab healed faster and the scar turned very light brown to almost non-existent, all this over a week!.</li>
            <li>It feels very soothing on my skin, and I have noticed that it even quickly heals minor blemishes, which was not a stated benefit.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>the price and size, I highly recommend it as an addition to your anti-aging prevention program.</li>
            <li>I got this product by having a high discount code.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend giving this product a try.</li>
            <li>A versatile serum that can be worn under makeup and is also friendly to sensitive skin for daily use, day or night.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough, but I will say that it makes my face very smooth before putting on my makeup.</li>
            <li>Most had little to no visible effect.  </li>
            <li>This product came to me in the mail completely frozen and cracked !!</li>
            <li>The Serum is potent and powerful so you only need to apply a little and work it into the skin.</li>
            <li>; very effective wrinkle reduction and reduced hyperpigmentation from the high-dose retinol, the soothing anti-acne/anti-rosacea properties of the niacinamide, moisturizing of the argon oil and hyaluronic acid,  the antioxidant effects of the CoQ10 and green tea, and all the other ingredients that I have not listed.</li>
            <li>I was also bad at picking at my face and this product has done a wonderful job reducing my blemish scars.</li>
            <li>Am 60 years old, have been using it since January, and really can tell the difference.</li>
            <li>Ugh...I wanted to love this so badly because I really do like the company, but I have to be honest when something doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>far I really like it.</li>
            <li>I apply the serum to clean, dry skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much softer and I&#x27;ve noticed less fine lines.</li>
            <li>I’ve been using the Retinol Serum for a few days and love the results.</li>
            <li>I been ordering this product for a few months  now, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin</li>
            <li>Normally, I can not tell what a retinol serum is doing.  </li>
            <li>After about a week I noticed my moisturizer was actually being absorbed into my face again.</li>
            <li>Had a nice smell, but overall I only used this 2 times and replaced it already with a different product.</li>
            <li>I unfortunatly couldn&#x27;t use it any more than a few times because I dropped it on my bathroom floor.</li>
            <li>It was worth ordering it and paying extra for  currency conversion and shipment to Canada.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any changes but will write more in a month.</li>
            <li>I have NO negative effects from this.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly this hydrating formula simultaneously works to soften blemishes, clear pores and remove dirt, grime and dead facial skin with a wondrous combination of Witch Hazel, Salicylic Acid and Glycolic Acid.</li>
            <li>Other reasons that fed into my decision to purchase this, besides the high ratings, were that it&#x27;s made in the USA and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>The serum is really lightweight as sinks into your skin really quickly.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t have enough retinol, right?</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see real results on my fine lines yet</li>
            <li>Thicker than other serums, goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>This is an &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t live without this&amp;#34; item for me.  </li>
            <li>when I woke up today i saw a new pimple:</li>
            <li>I like putting this directly on my new pillow wrinkle on the side of my nose and on my brow furrow.</li>
            <li>Retinol won&#x27;t make the wrinkles go away, but hopefully it will keep the new ones at bay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>instaNatural has a new fan.</li>
            <li>Being that this is a serum and a very light formulation, you usually apply this product after a toner and before applying a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and prone to outbrakes</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks of daily use on sensitive skin, I have felt no pain, dryness, redness or other unpleasantness as I&#x27;ve experienced with other unfamiliar skin care products.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin when it comes to products with Retinol, but</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The dark spots are about 80% gone and the texture of my skin is very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>i am 1/2 way through my second bottle, as i really wanted this to work!</li>
            <li>can you please let me know if this is normal for the product to be orange when it has always been a clear color</li>
            <li>It comes in a dark brown bottle which I like because it keeps the light out and prolongs the life of the serum.</li>
            <li>For me personally, this is the exact combination I need.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be working well so far!</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and less fine lines.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not usually one to believe anti-aging claims), but this thing is pretty amazing---however, for a different purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin looks brighter, it is softer, my fine lines are less noticeable</li>
            <li>I live in New Zealand, and Instanatural doesn’t send directly to NZ –</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m missing that retinol oomph I&#x27;ve experienced with other similar products.</li>
            <li>After using for approximately a month, I can say I love it!  </li>
            <li>If for some reason your skin feels too tight, apply a light moisturizer</li>
            <li>My skin feels tight and wrinkle free.</li>
            <li>As usual I am not disappointed with the results from an InstaNatural product!  </li>
            <li>retinol products are very important to exfoliate dead skin and let the younger skin be on surface..</li>
            <li>I have notice my neck feels so smooth and a little tighter.</li>
            <li>My bottle is almost empty because I have been religiously using it, and I can see the improvement on my fine lines.</li>
            <li>use the InstaNatural serum morning and night, and it absorbs quickly so that other products (moisturizer and makeup) can be applied soon after with no problem.  </li>
            <li>my face look clear in the morning</li>
            <li>Overall, I do think it lives up to its claim and my sensitive skin likes it very</li>
            <li>I like the expiry data printed clearly on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I think its a great substitute of 100$ expensive serums which have same ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a white female in my early 30s with HUGE pores and moderate acne issues.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li>The serum is clear and has a citrus scent which goes away after you apply it.  </li>
            <li>It has already helped clear out</li>
            <li>Sensitive and acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m in my late twenties, I&#x27;m more concerned with repair and fixing/delaying wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product for a second time - it is much cheaper</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old and use this serum along with InstaNatural eye cream, day cream and night cream.  </li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but that is made  from natural derived ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin too and it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much difference after using it religiously!</li>
            <li>using this oil once, I felt my skin in the morning and it felt as soft as if I had just put some of it on..</li>
            <li>but my skin has just been glowing and soft and moisturized ever since I started using this twice a day.</li>
            <li>This definitely makes my skin much smoother..</li>
            <li>I am 52 years old</li>
            <li>and my skin feels silky soft afterward.</li>
            <li>bottle of Insta Natural Retinol serum.  </li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s just going to take awhile; I am 66 years old.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;66-year old</li>
            <li>I do like it a lot so far.</li>
            <li>If your skin is sensitive or sun intolerant, applying a moisturizing cream or lotion after the serum dries is helpful.</li>
            <li>Makes me skin so soft - haven&#x27;t noticed the difference yet</li>
            <li>and I would be red, peeling and inflamed after just one use, but this is a very well-balanced out product.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt soft and I noticed that my lines are diminishing, I have always wanted to get botox, but even after a week using this stuff, I can tell I won&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li>Using it nightly with no issues to my fairly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so far I like it</li>
            <li>This is the one and only product I have ever tried that really works.</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, and I&#x27;m not experiencing any breakouts.  </li>
            <li>did not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Irritated my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is so much tighter, brighter, firmer and it has changed my entire face!</li>
            <li>The reason I purchased it was because I was dealing with adult acne around my mouth and chin over a lengthy period of time.</li>
            <li>I really like to use beauty serums on my facial skin.  </li>
            <li>have rather sensitive skin-</li>
            <li>Not harsh</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>do not recommend for sensitive skin though</li>
            <li>retinol smells lovely, like delicate orange and it is orange in color.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized and softens the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The PTR is nearly watery, and slips around everywhere.</li>
            <li>so far has not improved at all my melasma&lt;br</li>
            <li>have sensitive, clogged, acneic skin and this has helped improve my complexion.</li>
            <li>so far seems to be helping.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I like it so far.  </li>
            <li>And my skin is ultra sensitive and no issues.  </li>
            <li>I realize that refund policies are not always honored, but with Amazon&#x27;s return policies and the risk of negative feedback online, I felt confident in ordering it.  </li>
            <li>and so far I like it.</li>
            <li>It comes in a dropper which they recommend applying a few drops on your fingertips before lightly smoothing over your face in upward circular motions after using a cleanser and toner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve explored nearly any and everything.</li>
            <li>This serum has completely reset my skin.</li>
            <li>skin was soft had a glow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reduced those nagging bags (from lack of sleep) that I get in the morning to nearly nothing -</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate or aggravate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin felt so soft afterwards and the softness lasts as well.</li>
            <li>my skin feels soft and plump afterwards.</li>
            <li>I do believe it&#x27;s still premature to see a difference since it does take four to eight weeks for the old epidermis to completely slough off and be replaced.  </li>
            <li>product can cause redness if used too often or on sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>but I will need to order it directly from them since it is not carried by Amazon.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t try out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel firm and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is not a paid review, I am a 48 year old woman</li>
            <li>, i will say it help the face get clear but no tight</li>
            <li>It has helped with fine lines and wrinkles, mainly under my delicate eye area.</li>
            <li>My dark spots are diminishing and fine lines on my forehead and near where crows feet are starting to form are smoothing out.  </li>
            <li>At night, I first apply Retinol Serum and let dry; then apply Eye Gel for maximum results.  </li>
            <li>This product stated clearing up my dark spits really Quick</li>
            <li>I have been using this for less than a full week and am already seeing improvement in &amp;#34;smoothing out&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>At first I really enjoyed how firm it made my skin feel and it seemed to help the acne a little bit.</li>
            <li>I apply to a clean face after I have used my toner and like to apply it when my skin is still a little damp.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that with the other products in this line that the skin is definitely looking better and I was good about using some very expensive products.  </li>
            <li>Actually, favorite face product - I use it twice a day (there are days I haven&#x27;t gotten around to it, but generally I use it at least once a day).  </li>
            <li>I particularly enjoy finding small companies that no one knows about, or cult favorites from far reaching areas of the globe.</li>
            <li>Not sure which serum will help the most, but I won&#x27;t use the two serums at the same time.  </li>
            <li>My problem is that I try so many products at the same time, when I do notice a difference, I&#x27;m not sure which one</li>
            <li>I sometimes get a slight blush but it quickly subsides.</li>
            <li>In fact, I was shocked to see that in just a few days I was seeing my deeper wrinkles disappear, my skin tone is even, the pores are minimal, the texture of my skin is baby-bottom smooth, my neighbors have even commented on how great I look!  </li>
            <li>I believe this makes my skin feel balanced because they&#x27;ve added high quality essential oils.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a new addition to your facial routine and are looking for an all natural face mask</li>
            <li>I gave this product a complete try - using it as instructed (which turned into once daily as it left my skin red and tingly), but because I went to once daily, by time I had used it completely (in order to give it a full chance to work) when I tried to return it because it didn&#x27;t work at all, I was told - &amp;#34;This item no longer eligible for returns&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Liking it so far, I have combination skin with very oily T zone and dry, flaky skin everywhere.</li>
            <li>Half a droppers worth of serum completely covers my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>When it came I was worried because the bottle seemed smaller than i thought it would, but you honestly need very little so this bottle will go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am using it for small wrinkles and light acne scarring.</li>
            <li>I get the odd little pimple, but nothing like the mess and irritation I experienced before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Application- Wash your face and gently pat dry.</li>
            <li>I am in the quest to remain as youthful looking as possible or at least be able to age gracefully.</li>
            <li>For anti-aging products you need to give them six months, that&#x27;s the amount of time it takes for complete cell turnover in your skin (sloughing off the old cells) and to see ultimate results.</li>
            <li>I am a 58 year old Afican American woman is sensitive oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I was REALLY hoping that the quality would be there and that I would get that tightening feeling, smaller pore appearance and overall glow that the Skinceuticals product provided, but it&#x27;s just not there.  </li>
            <li>I wonder how much of the ingredients listed are actually in the bottle for only $20.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into my skin quickly and does not feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>NOT safe for sensitive skin!!!!!!</li>
            <li>That fact alone will warrant my purchasing another bottle from you in the very near future.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a major use for retinol</li>
            <li>, will be a returning customer interested to try other products</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this serum, as it also contains my two other favorite skincare products Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid, and will definitely be trying other InstaNatural&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>Sure if the weather had been blistering cold and windy the entire time I was using it, I could have blamed my rawness and super sensitivity on that.</li>
            <li>I have been satisfied with a few other products from Instanatural as well.</li>
            <li>I am excited to see what results I achieve over the next few months.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of using fine lines which started appearing a year ago are slowly fading.</li>
            <li>All of those ingredients make for a powerful little serum that has helped me with all of my skin</li>
            <li>It seems that in the last 5 years my skin has also become more sensitive and has occasionally either broken out or had a rash when I tried a new product.</li>
            <li>it’s really hard to fit spa time in let alone</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have used this long enough to tell if it is really going to help.</li>
            <li>I was recommended to try Retinol serums when I went to get a facial to clear up my acne.</li>
            <li>I have co-workers, and  clients constantly  compliment on how young I  look.....</li>
            <li>I am 48 years old and have gotten a lot of compliments on my skin since I have been using this along with washing my face with Vitamin C Facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely no greasiness and it has not broken me out at all.  </li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t seen any vast differences</li>
            <li>Until recently, I had monthly professional facials which cost about $125.  </li>
            <li>I had tried different make-up and sensitive skin soap/ face lotion products.</li>
            <li>Something that finally works...  Lots of damage (67 yrs young) to correct, but see differences in just over a week.  </li>
            <li>I use it at night only, as my skin is quite sensitive, though after a bit--I will apply during the day as well.  </li>
            <li>Younger looking, soft skin..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s, oily skin and moderate acne.</li>
            <li>This 2.5% Retinol serum with 20% Vitamin C offers a double punch.</li>
            <li>First impression of this product, I noticed the citrus-y scent, that is enough for me to mentally confirm this product does contain a form of vitamin C in it.</li>
            <li>I have never experienced any burning or tingling but should say that I had been using a glycolic acid cream at night for many years before I switched to this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell spa-ish which is what I usually expect.  </li>
            <li>It sloughs off skin that causes dullness as you use it but does it gently enough that skin does not appear dry and flaky but a with a little more glow as you continue to use daily.</li>
            <li>and although I have some health problems, I saw a new doctor who looked twice at my paperwork and commented that I looked much younger than my age when he was going over my overall health summary.</li>
            <li>I am half way through with my first 1-oz.</li>
            <li>And it took less than two months to get exactly the results I was looking for</li>
            <li>It seems to work as well as any other brand, but it leaves a bit of stickiness and the smell it just too much.</li>
            <li>guess I&#x27;ve made her a believer in the brand because she wants to try some of their other products now.</li>
            <li>In the areas that my makeup tends to go cakey because of dryness and skin surface issues, this product has really made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;8 drops covers my entire face, so this will last a long time, even with using it day and night&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And not just the slight, new lines around my eyes that one would consider cute, and the occasional little bump that could be hidden with concealer, but actual real crows feet, deep lines between the brows, and problematic acne in the T-zone as well as both cheeks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such an important part of your skincare regimen when you hit your late 20s/early 30s</li>
            <li>the only concern I have now is that after ordering this product several times, it has always been a clear color liquid.</li>
            <li>It was gente enough for my sensitive skin, especially around my eye area.  </li>
            <li>I am now finishing up my third bottle and now only use it in the morning because my face has completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>Because my skin is sensitive, I have to only use it at night and occasionally skip nights</li>
            <li>package came really fast, the serum is really thick, absorbs really well and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the smell and how the product sinks into my skin and then slowly tightens it.  </li>
            <li>and I have been looking with a critical eye because I have bought so many other serums in the past which promised results</li>
            <li>This with my other daily and nightly skin products have helped my skin so much.</li>
            <li>Your new skin will be very sensitive so you will need to protect your skin from the sun and harsh</li>
            <li>Soon after it dries skin fells little tight, but not too much, not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few, more expensive retinal serums and so far, I would absolutely buy this instead.</li>
            <li>I let my skin dry completely (20 to 30 minutes) after washing, before I apply the serum.  </li>
            <li>This product I used for a straight week and a half, thought I would notice some peeling from the retinol but didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I learned to let it dry completely before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I did notice a difference in my skin texture after a few weeks as old skin sloughed off and new finer pored skin emerged.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried several other high dollar products</li>
            <li>I have very dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I comes in a little bottle with a dropper which allows for absolute control of the distribution of the serum.  </li>
            <li>I like the dropper type dispenser as I can have as little or as much as I need.  </li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know if it makes a major difference, but i will update my review if i see any improvement on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Even if its a good product, if the smell is bad, it will keep me from purchasing the product again.</li>

            <li> Even my husband keeps mentioning how beautiful and smooth my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t notice any great improvement on my fine line after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> my skin is real smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> BUT I am happy that I have had no problems using it on my skin which is a HUGE plus!&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> All I have to say is the amazing result</li>
            <li> The company sends follow up emails to be sure you are happy with their product and offers suggestions on the best way to use it.</li>
            <li> This Retinol Serum is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF SMELLS AMAZING</li>
            <li> Oh this serum has an amazing citrus scent.  </li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s an age defying serum, but it&#x27;s just amazing skin care for anyone wanting healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed an amazing difference, but skin does appear to be tighter.</li>
            <li> My skin really feels great after using this product, It goes great underneath a moisturizer, I have seen a visible difference in lines on my face from using this for about a month.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own</li>
            <li> I also hoped it would help my eye bags, as retinal and vitamin C are supposedly effective towards that regard.</li>
            <li> i can honestly say i do not see any change or improvement in my skin,</li>
            <li> I use this every night after the Rose Water Toner and before a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> and then a gentle moisturizer before bed for best</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I received a sample of this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> Thanks for another great product InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> excellent product reasonably priced</li>
            <li> It dries really nicely.</li>
            <li> I honestly.  </li>
            <li> I was really thrilled with all the improvements that happened to my face and my neck.</li>
            <li> This product is loaded with so many quality good things that I know it will benefit my skin .</li>
            <li> I already use Vitamin A at night and thought how nice it would be to wear the retinol during the day as well (under my make-up).</li>
            <li> This product was sent to me for review purposes, as always, I give an honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Nice Price.</li>
            <li> Since you get a discount for purchasing more than 1 product at a time, it&#x27;s a great discount combined with free prime shipping!</li>
            <li> Bought the serum, eye gel and face lotion for my sister, who is also using and loving it.</li>
            <li> Wears nicely under makeup.</li>
            <li> Loving this serum for my face.</li>
            <li> Would have liked o know that it has a floral odor or scent, or a mix of floral and orange.  </li>
            <li> and it smell nice.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to purchase at a promotional price in order to evaluate it and share my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> vitamin C is a nice touch</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own let alone used in conjunction with Retinol and Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice smell of vit c.</li>
            <li> It perks your skin up nicely.</li>
            <li> It spreads nicely on the face (I put it all over face and neck).</li>
            <li> I honestly have no need to look for another serum.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency and no sticky residue.</li>
            <li> and this is my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s fragrance was so nice</li>
            <li> feels nice on the skin without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I feel it may be too soon to see any kind of miraculous changes in the quality of my skin</li>
            <li> I am absolutely thrilled with InstaNatural Retinol Serum.</li>
            <li> It has what I would describe as a nice orange peel scent which reminds me of my citrus scented oils.</li>
            <li> After 10 – 15 minutes of drying on your face, use a warm washcloth and wash the mask off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a watery texture but it moisturizes once it touches the skin, which I find quite amusing.</li>
            <li> so I guess this is just a nice product for maintaining your skin health.</li>
            <li> I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving the results.  </li>

            <li> This serum has made my skin brighter, smoother and more glowy.</li>
            <li> The eyedropper is not the most convenient but no reason not to use the serum.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m nervous to bump up the application to twice a day since I think even more blemishes will appear if I smear the recommended sunscreen on top of my make-up, moisturizer and the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> In case you didn&#x27;t know, I LOVE naturals products.</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin to be more plump and with a glow.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t sting or feel like an acid peel.</li>

            <li> know they can be more drying for me.</li>
            <li> if more the moisturiser ‘balls’.  </li>
            <li> So, each bottle costs over $6 more than for US customers.  </li>
            <li> To top it off it does what it says.</li>
            <li> My skin is noticibly brighter and more even toned.</li>

            <li> I am very impressed with it, I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I wanna say I love it</li>

            <li> younger is best.</li>

            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but I have been using it for almost a month now, only at night, and continue to be impressed.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t seen a change to the age spots (I would like to give it more time to work)</li>
            <li> I Love my Line if InstaNaturals I got.  </li>
            <li> and it does not make my oily skin more oily</li>
            <li> I have tried many products and none have worked.  </li>
            <li> I will surely post my response to the moisturizer when I start using it.</li>
            <li> Thank You :-)</li>
            <li> Even so, I wanted to try some of the newer products before considering something more</li>

            <li> I love this serum</li>
            <li> I just use moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li> My wife love it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered more of their line already;</li>
            <li> Hey you might get better results than I did, maybe my skin type doesn&#x27;t need these ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally in love with this product for it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li> I freakin&#x27; love this serum.  </li>
            <li> This product smells like oranges which I personally love but the smell fades for anyone worried about it.</li>
            <li> and i just love this serum</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> and I love how there is also vitamin c in it.  </li>
            <li> love this stuff</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I do like the way my skin feels, and I love the scent - citrusy.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than two weeks</li>
            <li> I love this product for skin &amp;#34;repair.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> The smell most closely resembles Goo-Gone.  </li>
            <li> We received this product for free from InstaNatural, the review is our own.</li>
            <li> My wife has enjoyed all of the InstaNatural products she has used.</li>
            <li> The things I like better with InstaNatural is they list all their ingredients and they give you directions how to use the product.</li>
            <li> It works for fading blemishes and this seems to be more of a problem</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I was able to review this.</li>
            <li> I have bought so many anti wrinkle creams that did not work</li>
            <li> Have enjoyed using this serum.  </li>
            <li> need the most attention.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it</li>
            <li> products n love the</li>
            <li> I am able to use it every evening with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks a lot smoother than before where the InstaNatural Retinol Serum is helping to absorb more of the InstaNatural Retinol Moisturizer Cream into my skin as opposed to using the moisturizer alone.</li>
            <li> I think if she would use it more dilegently it would be even better.</li>
            <li> serum does absorb fast and I am hearing great things, so i&#x27;m sure it does work with some skin types</li>
            <li> , I have most of their line.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE the results of this product.  </li>
            <li> I feel this serum is effective and it has made a significant difference in the feel and look of my face.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> The serum goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, smells great (light and citrusy), makes my skin feel softer and more radiant.</li>
            <li> Feels nice and clean on your face.</li>
            <li> I tried the Healthy wise serum and Insta Natural is so much better!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to any woman who cares greatly about their skin.</li>
            <li> I have also been looking in to ‘clean’ beauty products and attempting to learn more about the chemicals in products I use, so trying these products from Instanatural was a great first</li>
            <li> This does absorb quickly into the skin after application, which I love!    </li>
            <li> It has a nice natural pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This serum feels cool and hydrating upon application, which I liked.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a good experience when I tried retinols for the first time years ago.</li>
            <li> Its gentle yet extremely effective!</li>
            <li> Love this product, and used with other InstaNatural products you can have that perfect skin you desire :)  </li>
            <li> prefer this to my Phillip  Thomas Roth because it&#x27;s a bit thicker and goes on much more easily and evenly.</li>
            <li> i put this on after a quick rinse of rose water.</li>
            <li> The dropper is wonderful, this is very lightweight and spreads really well.  </li>
            <li> I do know that overtime, I&#x27;ll be able to tell if it is doing anything for fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t do what Botox and fillers do, but it does even skin tone, and reduce fine lines, which gives a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> very sweet smell.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say better things about this serum because I am a HUGE InstaNatural fan</li>
            <li> think this is a great company and their products are phenomenal, I definitely will be trying out more products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> My skin is beautiful and has such a healthy glow...</li>
            <li> I saw some more resilence with my skin and found the product went on incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Retinol Serum plus Astaxanthin - InstaNatural is becoming a household name around here</li>
            <li> I feel more comfortable using safer products on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Retinol Serum is one of my go to products as nothing is better than retinol to smooth out the edges.  </li>
            <li> love this light, citrus scent serum.</li>
            <li> but I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> My wife is happy to use natural products that do not harm her skin.</li>
            <li> I have written a more detailed review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> I did receive this complimentary for review although my thoughts and opinions are always unbiased and completely my own.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary bottle for giving my honest opinion and review.</li>
            <li> Now it is available in many easy to acquire beauty products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The company was very interested in my review and did an awesome job following up with me.  </li>
            <li> Their formulations only include the best, highest quality ingredients, and they do exactly what they claim!&lt;br /&gt;After reading many skincare books, and listening to a dermatologist on the radio, I&#x27;ve keyed in to the word Retinol.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Retinol is now easy to get in a multitude of skin care products.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to control.</li>
            <li> Its orange is color, smells like oranges, and soaks into the skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> This serum is easy to apply and is non greasy and doesn&#x27;t haze my vision like some of the others.</li>
            <li> Absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> The all do such wonderful things to help keep my skin dew and fresh looking.</li>
            <li> Easy squeeze dropper to dispense.  </li>
            <li> Truthfully, I really thought the price was too cheap for it to be any good  </li>
            <li> So far so good, need more time...</li>
            <li> So far so good &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The first week was fantastic--I thought it tightened up my skin amazingly and for someone who is 70 that is saying something.  </li>
            <li> and I honestly thought I saw a difference the first day.  </li>
            <li> My fine lines and wrinkles are disappearing.  </li>
            <li> Retinol is a known wrinkle fighter and can even reduce fine lines.</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up and my fine lines around my eyes seem to have diminished.</li>
            <li> so I cannot tell how it is working on fine lines and wrinkles to date.  </li>
            <li> – I didn’t notice any difference changing to  Instanatural serums except that I now seem to have fine ‘smokers lines’.</li>
            <li> My skin texture is smoother, with diminished appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li> I used this on my fine lines and age spots.</li>
            <li> The fine lines that Father Time seems to leave with us gradually fade or diminish and the skin takes on a smoother appearance.  </li>
            <li> Since it is a squeeze top, I never twisted the top on -</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and easy.</li>
            <li> Fine Lines&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can use it twice a day and feel it has improved the appearance of my skin, both reducing fine lines and evening out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Fine lines are fading....</li>
            <li> I am 59 and my fine lines and wrinkles have reduced after a couple of weeks using these products.  </li>
            <li> My fine lines seems to have gone away.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li> It seems to help my skin retain moisture which plumps up fine lines and reduces flakiness.</li>
            <li> I gave this stuff 3 because I saw a mild improvement, but I&#x27;ve used better products.  </li>
            <li> I love how quickly it absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li> No issues, arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> Feels ok on skin, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and it is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for 2 weeks, good so far!</li>
            <li> Do wish that this serum was a bit thicker, but that just a minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did receive this product for free in exchange for an honest &amp; fair review.</li>
            <li> the gel has a great slip and glides on easily and absorbs instantly.</li>
            <li> So the serum was not thick at all and  absorbed in the skin very nicely without a sticky residue.</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference in the fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, and will certainly buying more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> retinol serum is a huge exception to the rule.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a huge change in my lines.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li> My honest opinion for a product that really works.   </li>
            <li> Eye gel also fabulous.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for light peel this is the product.  </li>
            <li> but I do smell and extremely light citrus.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for making the overall skin texture smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> I got this item free for reviewing.</li>
            <li> Having used this for about 3 weeks, I am happy to report that this is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> I have also recently ordered a 2-oz. supply of Hyaluronic Acid serum from Insta Natural--a great deal through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I love this serum, it is packed with antioxidants and it&#x27;s easily absorbed by skin.</li>
            <li> Has a light citrusy smell, that is energizing.</li>
            <li> Use it daily and found that I have experienced firming on a continuing basis.</li>

            <li> She has been using it for a few weeks now and has nothing but wonderful things to say.</li>
            <li> The serum is light in texture but closer to a gel versus being watery.</li>
            <li> *Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> After a month of use her acne has not disappeared entirely but it is greatly improved.</li>
            <li> I have no affiliation with Insta-Naturals and my customer experience has been fantastic.</li>
            <li> This product has a light citrusy fragrance that I like.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, dont hesitate, even though i have sensitive skin,it has been a greta product to use, no redness on application or after effects, easily absorbed, a deffinate must,..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it and so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice and it smells fine no weird odor and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good thankful</li>
            <li> I do love InstaNatural products, and have had only good experience with their products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even done wonders for my complexion, I feel like my pores are super clean!</li>
            <li> I can feel my face feel better right away.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see that this serum smelled like citrus and didnt contain as many chemicals as other comparable serums.</li>
            <li> Just ordered my second serving of this product - I&#x27;m sooo fortunate to have stumbled on this supplier!!!</li>
            <li> Will definitely continue to use this, love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful Retinol serum.</li>
            <li> Good on sensitive skin because it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts nor sting when applied even to skin that has been irritated, but it goes on smooth, cool and non-oily and skin feels refreshed.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy, making it perfect for oiler skin types and it&#x27;s great under day or night cream for dry skin.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and overall it&#x27;s a fine product</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re worried about it lingering or being too strong, you should know that it fades quickly and is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and easily and makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite!</li>
            <li> What more could i say thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Has a great citrus smell, feels smooth on my face and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> Might be a good introduction to retinol, but not quite strong enough for more seasoned retinol users.</li>
            <li> It has more glow, more clarity, and is very soft.</li>
            <li> So I ordered a retinol serum from InstaNatural, and just 4 weeks later my skin is amazing!  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this product and try it.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I was just rubbing tangerine scented water into my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any kind of serum because I honestly didn&#x27;t like the smell of them and how many harsh and often time acidic chemicals they include.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen a significant difference.</li>
            <li> significantly improve the health of my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the light, fresh orange scent and the way the serum is completely absorbed by my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this serum because it really works wonders on the fine lines that I have on the sides of my nose.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure will in time.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such an amazing serum</li>
            <li> Dries clean, so you can add whatever moisturizer you want.</li>
            <li> My first impression when I opened it was very appealing because the scent is very citrusy.</li>
            <li> have found though that all natural facial masks do work the best for me though.  </li>
            <li> The product itself is light, nothing sticky or oily, and it absorbs quickly, and there is no lingering smell.  </li>
            <li> I personally liked the Vit C Cream Moisturizer 20% facial lotion better than the Retinol Serum.</li>
            <li> , I use it at night before my night cream, it smells pleasant to me and not greasy at all, it goes on light and soaks in quickly, I have been using only two weeks  </li>
            <li> It is just that, pleasant, not overpowering, but enough.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews before purchasing, so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy like other serums and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I find it very effective pre-makeup to smooth out any rough areas in my face.</li>
            <li> this product is as good as some other serums many times the cost.  </li>
            <li> but if you give it time, you will most certainly notice the tone and texture of your skin improving.</li>
            <li> Very good deal for such a high quality product.</li>
            <li> My skin is already looking more smooth and vibrant.</li>
            <li> First very good price, 2nd very fast delivery</li>
            <li> now on my last order the product is a bright orange color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, i would recommend for sensitive/dried parts of the face to be using carefully but still its great serum and does not stick on face.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after extensive comparison of available skin serums, and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Great product working as well as I expected will order again</li>
            <li> , I might give 5 star after couple of months see the full result.</li>
            <li> Since my favorite InstaNatural serum is the Hyaluronic Acid one, I am very please</li>
            <li> I liked the natural ingredient list from this serum.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.)</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> My skin feels nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This is a really good serum I am on my second bottle</li>
            <li> Good regular price for a lot of product and</li>
            <li> After one month I really do look better.</li>
            <li> My overall appearance was good because of the moisture and my skin felt tighter.  </li>
            <li> my face had some red blotches but after using product for 3 weeks there is no redness and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> The package was good, the product arrived promptly and in good condition, especially considering I am currently residing overseas.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for consumers.</li>
            <li> Pat it in for a minute or two for full absorption.  </li>
            <li> This ensures that serum full absorbs.</li>
            <li> I have had no bad reactions or irritations and I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> smell is not BAD, it just isn&#x27;t orderless.</li>
            <li> Great serum, little strong on the retinol</li>
            <li> It has a soft creamy texture and a very pleasant slight citrusy smell that I love.</li>
            <li> Amazing serum, works well for my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This allows the products to absorb quickly and also allows your skin to reap the product&#x27;s full benefits by creating a moisturizing barrier.</li>
            <li> first I was a bit red but that quickly went away and my face felt tighter, very smooth and had a nice glow to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It moisturizers great that I don&#x27;t need to use my other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have not had any peeling like I experienced with other retinol products.  </li>
            <li> I do not have noticable wrinkles, but from other reviews I&#x27;ve read this product is great for prevention of wrinkles as well as for existing wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My skin is now brighter, more even tone, my pores are still huge, but they are clear and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The sensation was fine at first but the problem came when I put it on my skin.</li>
            <li> so my skin changed dramatically and quickly.  </li>
            <li> Dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice, light serum that absorbs well and has ingredients that are clinically proven to help wth various skin issues.  </li>
            <li> its not sticky and dries quickly for makeup application.</li>
            <li> My skin was not use to this type of product and it quickly adjusted and I had no problems after one week.</li>
            <li> , it is not tacky and absorbs fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Mixing the 2 - as in this serum - will quickly oxidise the vitamin C and render the Niacinamide, nicotinic acid.</li>
            <li> and yes, I know I&#x27;m lucky),</li>
            <li> and you will continue to succeed tremendously.</li>
            <li> I use it at night and then apply a super moisturizing night cream over it.</li>
            <li> The serum absorbs quickly so I don&#x27;t have to wait forever to apply the night cream.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This serum is great so far, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week in combination with the retinol moisturizer and my skin is softer and brighter and has even helped clear up some breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have been told my skin looks more youthful and vibrant in appearance.</li>
            <li> More than a million visitors each year flock to this extraordinary body of water in the Mediterranean, which contains many minerals beneficial to the skin, such as magnesium, sodium, bromine, potassium and calcium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super quick delivery and packaged well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind quick results and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind quick results and</li>
            <li> After getting an email from the company , i wrote back asking if there were more appropriate products for her acne.</li>
            <li> I love that it contains antioxidants, hyaluronic acid and a high percentage of vitamin c.</li>
            <li> They have a better price tag than the high end drug store brand she was considering before I talked her into trying this.</li>
            <li> This Is one with more &amp;#34;Bang for your Buck&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;All of the high quality ingredients</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using with a JeNu if you have one to make the product even more beneficial to work.</li>
            <li> It works great, have been using it for a month, day/night, and at 53 years old I can see improvements in fine lines, especially around eyes, forehead.</li>
            <li> And the price is very reasonable for a product of this quality!</li>
            <li> It is great that there are still products out there that actually perform as promised.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Okay maybe because it&#x27;s new to my skin</li>
            <li> the color of the serum in an opaque white and what I especially noticed about the serum was the very pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> Just received, easy to use, very affordable.</li>
            <li> The dropper makes it easy to apply and not use too much.</li>
            <li> Mild fresh scent.</li>

            <li> I love Insta Natural products if you don&#x27;t already know!</li>
            <li> me look younger and more glowing!</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural!</li>
            <li> The serum seems to have really smoothed out the fine lines.</li>
            <li> It is more even toned and has reduced fine lines, especially underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> gentle with a light citrus scent.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> Really pumps my face ,and  smooth my skin.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, like real orange extract.  </li>
            <li> My skin is definitely softer and has a nice glow.</li>
            <li> : I was provided a complimentary sample.</li>
            <li> I have used Rx creams that have had benefit but this is much lighter and more gentle to my skin.</li>
            <li> I was using oz-natural retinol serum previously, I recently tried insta Natural retinol serum, I am really happy with this serum</li>
            <li> gave it a good solid try, but it just didn&#x27;t make much difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily absorbed by your skin, with no peeling side effects so prevalent with retinol</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried many things, most with minimal or no results at all.</li>
            <li> I love beauty products and I am always on the lookout for products that are natural.</li>
            <li> The only product I dislike is their cleanser, which it is not the product itself, but my own preference.</li>
            <li> My laugh lines (and I laugh a LOT) are still there</li>
            <li> But so far, I love it.</li>
            <li> So far I have totally enjoyed the InstaNatural line of products.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple weeks and my skin feels like it&#x27;s glowing and looking fresh.</li>
            <li> This serum is effective especially after I use my micro-needling instrument.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is worth the chance; I&#x27;d recommend it it anyone.</li>
            <li> I love it so far.  </li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Companies like yours are rare.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and most Retinol products</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because I feel that it could provide better results than what I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Packed with 2.5% of Retinol that protects against free-radical damage, helps reverse the appearance of sun damage and the telltale signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;- Powerful antioxidants that trap moisture to prevent future loss so you can enjoy a more youthful appearance with firmer, plumper skin.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I would definitely be into trying more of these products, as they are straight forward, a great price point, and you actually see the results.  </li>
            <li> I rarely have a reaction to those.  </li>
            <li> Smoothes out one&#x27;s complexion like whoa and supercharges with powerful antioxidants like vitamins C and E.  </li>
            <li> Gets absorbed into the skin almost immediately but needs additional moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> Does not burn around the eye area at all since it gets absorbed into skin without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using InstaNatural Age Defying Retinol Serum for a few weeks now and am very happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li> Great function, cost less!</li>
            <li> If you only read the first line of my review : BUY THIS SERUM!&lt;br /&gt;I am ridiculously in love with this product!</li>
            <li> You can use the serum twice a day with your skincare regimen, unless you spot redness and/or peeling, which then you would use once daily or until you find the time schedule that works best for your skin (i.e. every other day if you continue to experience sensitivity).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The serum itself is pretty liquidy, but it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have particularly high hopes when ordering this serum, but was pleasantly surprised with how effective this product is in getting rid of age spots on my face and hands.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away and like the feel of my skin after using the serum.    </li>
            <li> The serum goes on right after I wash my face in the morning</li>
            <li> right after I have cleansed my face.</li>
            <li> Right price....</li>
            <li> So far I am excited by these products!</li>
            <li> Having worked in an executive capacity for a major cosmetic company for over 15 years I have to say I love it.</li>
            <li> I use this religiously twice a day and when I look in the mirror I can&#x27;t believe that after hundreds of products, I have finally found the one that is showing 100% promise of getting my skin back to flawless, poreless, baby smooth skin.</li>
            <li> The retinol is definitely present, as I did see the turnover and newer (better looking) skin rather quickly.</li>
            <li> The retinol is definitely present, as I did see the turnover and newer (better looking) skin rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve to say higher price normally guarantees good quality including  fancy packaging , but doesn&#x27;t necessary</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good anti-aging product or you have dark spots, this is the one to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the addition of the hyaluronic acid also helps allow the additional hydration of the skin keep away the redness and flakiness that such a strong retinol would normally cause.  </li>
            <li> Due to the antioxidant blend and also the vitamins, I noticed a quick plumping from the vitamin C, which smoothed out my face nicely before applying moisturizers and make-up.</li>
            <li> Due to the antioxidant blend and also the vitamins, I noticed a quick plumping from the vitamin C, which smoothed out my face nicely before applying moisturizers and make-up.</li>
            <li> Will certainly keep buying this product!</li>
            <li> It’s relatively scentless, has a nice consistency, and applies really well.</li>
            <li> I actually have several of InstaNatural&#x27;s products and have been happy with them all.</li>
            <li> I only use it once at nights only, no sensitivity which is great.</li>
            <li> --it didn&#x27;t cause a breakout, it smells good, and I am noticing a slight difference on my neck...</li>
            <li> This one however, is super gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most gentle serum with retinol I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nice product to use at night,but gentle enough for daytime.</li>
            <li> My skin looks very healthy and smooth only when I have it on and the fine lines are less visible.  </li>
            <li> I like the serum very much.  </li>
            <li> I have received compliments on my skin and have seen a marked reduction of fine lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second order, and I love the result</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I try many different serums, lotions &amp; potions...</li>
            <li> I get at least one compliment a day about how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li> i did high hopes for this to work!!</li>
            <li> It is really making a difference!</li>
            <li> I think it is worth trying for anyone who has the desire to refine and gently exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li> love this serum and works wonders on my boy friend&#x27;s skin -it is my second bottle</li>
            <li> This product keeps skin soft and wrinkle free skin clarity is noticicable.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say any more than that since I&#x27;ve been using this product for a short while.</li>
            <li> I do not have many wrinkles yet, but it does seem to tighten the tiny ones around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I like that my skin feels &#x27;tighter&#x27; but not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Also, I noticed 2 sun spots on my forehead so I am really hoping this will help with those!</li>
            <li> I literally saw results on the first use.</li>
            <li> To be able to treat both my acne and my wrinkles with one product is nothing short of a miracle.  </li>
            <li> could you tell me how I can give you back the product and benefit of your guarantee satisfied or money</li>
            <li> However, within the first week, I broke out &#x3D;</li>
            <li> It is also pretty hydrating</li>
            <li> The smell is very yummy too!  </li>
            <li> Could not expect more, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle.</li>
            <li> I use this serum in the morning and at night and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I used this serum day and night for the first 2 months.</li>
            <li> Absorbs fast!</li>
            <li> Which is exactly what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> molecule which is stable at higher pH. Vitamin C (or the stable phosphate salt derivative used here) is stable at pH 3-7</li>
            <li> My skin feels like it&#x27;s in much better condition, and I feel a lot younger.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a magical wrinkle eraser, but I don&#x27;t think that there is such thing anyways..</li>
            <li> This will make u look younger for sure.</li>
            <li> This product does relax wrinkles when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> i love face oils and this one is no different.  </li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This really does a great job of firming up your skin and giving it that healthy glow and at the same time is helping to reduce wrinkles and age spots, even uneven skin or scars!  </li>
            <li> and I really like the fresh look</li>
            <li> Will keep using and most likely will buy again</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t exactly say if it is from this serum or a combination of InstaNatural products as I use their whole line of products!</li>
            <li> Only time will tell  I am still using it &amp; I am not quite sure yet what the benefits are.  </li>
            <li> I was able to buy the product at a reduced cost and will be buying it again in the future even without a discount.</li>
            <li> I have tried and reacted to many different Retinols creams, lotions, and serums.</li>
            <li> When I finish this first bottle, I will update this review with the results that I have, or have not, had.  </li>
            <li> First time users may want to use it once a day just to see how their skin feels afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel the price is reasonable and was fortunate enough to try it for free to review through BrandBacker.</li>
            <li> Why would you put yourself through red, flaky skin on your face with a more aggressive form?</li>
            <li> I use this first, then apply the InstaNatural moisturing cream.</li>
            <li> I found the combination of these two facial creams and hydrating myself appropriately (8 glasses of water a day)</li>
            <li> My wife tried this product and she noticed softer skin after the first use.</li>
            <li> If you have the chance to looker younger and have healthier skin, take the chance, you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I like being able to use one product on multiple areas.</li>
            <li> This was my way to make sure I did not have red skin during the holidays.</li>
            <li> This was my way to make sure I did not have red skin during the holidays.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give a five star because I believe it should last for more than 30 days</li>
            <li> With my love for the chase, I very rarely settle down, and add a product permanently to my beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I didn’t notice any adverse reaction of the product on my skin, but my mom experienced discomfort and a bit of a flaky dry patch on her skin after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a big fan of Retinol treatments, ever since my days with philosophy cosmetics using their Miracle Worker line and Help Me treatment.</li>
            <li> I really like the variety of strong antioxidants and natural ingredients in this product.  </li>
            <li> I am very excited with the results I am seeing in only 2ish weeks of using!  </li>
            <li> I have made sure to keep the retinol cream away from my eyes, as I have very sensitive under eye skin and that has been working thus far.  </li>
            <li> The price was a amazing as were the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> It really is an incredible product for when you need a little something extra.</li>
            <li> One night, I tried it alone without any other skincare product in my regimen and the result was astounding.</li>
            <li> I am 73 years old with significant wrinkles around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li> so far so good.. haven&#x27;t seen any real changes but haven&#x27;t used it for that long..</li>
            <li> Packed with goodness to help blemishes, clear pores and clean your skin all over.  </li>
            <li> and I really love that it absorbs quickly and makes my skin extra soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much the wrinkles with continue to &amp;#34;smooth out&amp;#34; but I will definitely keep using it to give it time to work its magic.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as it is well worth a try.</li>
            <li> I had another brand of retinol serum,that made my skin a little irritated,so I was not sure if I should this at all,but I gave it a try my skin was not itchy,was not red,my skin actually loved this brand,j was very pleased with the outcome .My</li>
            <li> Always keep in mind the easy rule of applying skincare products in the order they are formulated, from thinnest first to heaviest being your last.</li>
            <li> and I am seeing positive results after one week.</li>
            <li> It really works clarifying your skin and reducing wrinkles, VERY SATIFIED with product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2-3 weeks so far, i&#x27;m going to give this a few more weeks and see if I can have a better opinion.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister to try because I have loved all the Instanatural products I&#x27;ve gotten in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s full of quality natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> In the first week I could definitely see a difference in fine lines and decrease in dullness.  </li>
            <li> have always been kind of scared to use any serums, but I was shocked at how much I really liked this product!</li>
            <li> skin looks bright, clear and remarkably wrinkle-free (this is also due to the other products I use, but the serum is definitely the spark that made everything else work.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Makes skin super soft.</li>
            <li> I am sure I can keep using this in the summer months as well since it doesn’t dry my skin</li>
            <li> The serum goes on vey smoothly and is absorbed into the skin rather quickly, with no sticky residue or tight feeling.  </li>
            <li> It may take more treatments for these and only time will bare witness to this product&#x27;s success.  </li>
            <li> What attracted me to this product is that it’s suppose to not only help repair your skin it also stimulate new healthy skin.</li>
            <li> And I can notice a different in fine wrinkles around my eyes</li>
            <li> The formula was a bit runnier than other serums I&#x27;ve used in the past, but it smelled wonderful and didn&#x27;t tingle at all.  </li>
            <li> I am starting to get fine lines and wrinkles and with this product</li>
            <li> It is a very high quality Serum...</li>
            <li> My smile lines are looking less apparent and becoming filled.</li>
            <li> I see that my fine lines and wrinkles are much smoother and my overall skin tone feels tighter and brighter.</li>
            <li> The serum smells lightly of oranges and absorbs immediately, and so far I am very pleased with this, and I will definitely purchase again, and I am looking forward to trying  other InstaNatural products.</li>
            <li> and like I mentioned, I have very fair thin freckly 70 year old skin</li>
            <li> I have only been using retinol for a few weeks and it has been a great experience.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s lightweight and has an amazing texture when it goes on- not greasy or heavy like some brands.</li>
            <li> It has definitely helped my skins health and after a month I can tell a huge change in the tightness around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;*I</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, has really helped my skin around my eyes look younger</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> After many years spent in the sun, my skin is showing some sun damage and hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> You also don’t need much.</li>
            <li> It’s also really recommended that you use a sunscreen with it, as Retinol can enhance the effects of the sun.</li>
            <li> The customer support is great and has no problem refunding you if you&#x27;re not happy.  </li>
            <li> It has really worked well for me.  </li>
            <li> Retinol can be very drying and the hyaluronic acid</li>
            <li> really helps counteract that effect when I use it.</li>
            <li> and I get the same youthful and smooth look and feel to my face.  </li>
            <li> This serum helped smooth out my one stubborn deep line between my brows.</li>
            <li> I use this serum at night and have been very please with the results.</li>
            <li> It is also gentle around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Cleared a very deep/cystic acne blemish I have had for weeks in two uses.</li>
            <li> Minimizes lines and gives an overall smooth appearance</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so soft, firm, acne free and wrinkle free!</li>
            <li> my face looks so much clearer</li>
            <li> i really like this product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the whole bottle yet</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much of a scent</li>
            <li> The ingredients  in this serum do help much to retain the hydration your skin needs to keep youthful and provides you that glow and even tone throughout your face.</li>
            <li> I really do like the InstaNatural product line.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum</li>
            <li> I much prefer a water soluble cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like how fast if absorbs and leaves no greasy feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> but I really like the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t??</li>
            <li> When I first used it i got break out is it normal?</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> It works better than expected and now my daughter is using it too.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will absolutely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I still have some breakouts around my forehead, but because I&#x27;ve been using their mask, it&#x27;s helped so much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also received compliments which I really did not expect.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> It really glows my skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely do like the product.</li>
            <li> I can say that this product really did</li>
            <li> Maybe it needs to be used in junction with a derma roller to really penetrate the skin.</li>
            <li> I have now been using this for 2 months, and I am absolutely amazed at the difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to getting it on a promo to try and review</li>
            <li> My skin texture is much nicer, and I have a glow even without makeup.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and item was well packaged.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li> Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The serum absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> This really helps with them</li>
            <li> I really like this.  </li>
            <li> Then my wrinkles are very not visible.</li>
            <li> This product really does work.</li>
            <li> under eye wrinkles are disappearing fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think its really doing anything.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really doing the job.</li>
            <li> Cant really see any change.</li>
            <li> but dont really see any change or improvement</li>
            <li> I was not expecting this to do much or anything at all to my skin</li>
            <li> Your products are in no way responsible for the condition of my skin, I have done it all to myself.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything about this product really.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very watery.</li>
            <li> serum is somewhat milky/tawny in color and very watery.</li>
            <li> will continue using this product and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> When I heard about this promotion the mask sounded promising.  </li>
            <li> thanks for the product.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks so much clearer and tighter since I&#x27;ve been using this product.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> but don&#x27;t really see any improvements.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> hopefully, I  will continue to see improvement as the product is very affordable.</li>
            <li> Product works really well.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
            <li> I really like their products.</li>
            <li> My complexion looks so much brighter and my skin tone has evened out.</li>
            <li> It really works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sikha</li>
            <li> Could be that the zit is caused by something else, but I&#x27;m still putting this product on hold for a while to see it really is the culprit.</li>
            <li> She said it works really well.  </li>
            <li> Bad:&lt;br /&gt;-It smells very citrus-y.  </li>
            <li> The product is reasonable and is guaranteed to work for you.</li>
            <li> I lightly dabbed my problem areas like under eyes, forehead, middle of eyebrows, and neck area.</li>
            <li> so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from InstaNatural.  </li>
            <li> so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from InstaNatural.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I have sensitive skin, but I definitely have to be mindful of the products I use, as many things break me out.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> My skin more hydrated, clear, pores smaller, birghter skin.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my sister who has problem skin and the following review is her story: Normally a product containing 2.5% Retinol serum would be way too strong for my skin to handle</li>
            <li> I love that I have found a good skincare regimen to slow down the aging process as my skin is just starting to show signs of aging - losing elasticity and fine lines.</li>
            <li> first thing that I always do when trying a new product is smell it.</li>
            <li> At first, I was concerned that it might irritate my skin because of some of the feedback, but that is not the case - and, I do have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I threw away all the other stuff I&#x27;ve collected trying to search for the better one--</li>
            <li> I have not seen any major results yet but will report back when I do as i am sure I will.  </li>
            <li> I may try it every other night and also find a better moisturizer.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s definitely something to smile about!</li>
            <li> I am 34, ops, 35 years old with normal skin and wrinkles around eyes that get really noticeable when I smile.</li>
            <li> products from this company are gentle and natural with real results!</li>
            <li> Very quick to dry as well.</li>
            <li> but, after years of playing softball and long summers of swimming, I have fine lines around my eyes and forehead from squinting at the sun.</li>
            <li> This serum has given me the same results for much, much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it because it features the key ingredients if my favorite Rodan and Fields products for a much lower price.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone that is considering the much costlier dermatologist options.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a refreshing slight scent of citrus while applying it - not a heavy smell at all and dissipates right away.  </li>
            <li> I am always on a quest to find a good skin repairing regiment to help with the Dry and Rough skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference in the appearance of my skin, other than more blemishes than normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other InstaNatural products and have been very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell a very noticeable difference which is normal because any products need 2/3 months to see a result.</li>
            <li> Somehow I feel my dark spots are getting lighter , stil need more time to see</li>
            <li> I almost wish I had the guts to treat one side of my face and not the other so that I could post pictures to show how effective the product really is, but I&#x27;m only willing to go so far for the sake of an Amazon review.</li>
            <li> I am a new fan!  </li>
            <li> Dark circles are also a huge issue I have and this really helps me out a lot!</li>
            <li> and It works just as well or better for half the cost....</li>
            <li> I can see that the bags under her eyes are less noticeable and her skin looks better but don&#x27;t tell her</li>
            <li> I love the product and its slightly orange-y smell.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin is softer, particularly below my eyes where my cheeks begin.</li>
            <li> This is only the second Vitamin C product I&#x27;ve ever used, so I am giving it an OK</li>
            <li> The actual product is not sticky and it does adsorb quickly.</li>
            <li> I definitely feel like I have smoother, more younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> As I get older</li>
            <li> I decided to test it on my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; because this area as we get older will tend to sag as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help prevent it from looking older if I can help it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn back the clock, but it definitely diminishes the texture by smoothening the surface and gives skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I am older</li>
            <li> the older I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i am a breast cancer patient and the chemo therapy really made my skin dry and wrinkled specially around my eyes.</li>
            <li> i-herb shipping is $8 for a large order, so if getting supplements anyway,  other products basically have free shipping – so will investigate what products are on offer.</li>
            <li> I have only used for a little while, but my skin certainly seems to look better!</li>
            <li> I had an acne breakout, in the middle of my forehead, I picked at it and it left a scab, but after daily use, my scab healed faster and the scar turned very light brown to almost non-existent, all this over a week!.</li>
            <li> It feels very soothing on my skin, and I have noticed that it even quickly heals minor blemishes, which was not a stated benefit.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> the price and size, I highly recommend it as an addition to your anti-aging prevention program.</li>
            <li> I got this product by having a high discount code.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend giving this product a try.</li>
            <li> A versatile serum that can be worn under makeup and is also friendly to sensitive skin for daily use, day or night.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough, but I will say that it makes my face very smooth before putting on my makeup.</li>
            <li> Most had little to no visible effect.  </li>
            <li> This product came to me in the mail completely frozen and cracked !!</li>
            <li> The Serum is potent and powerful so you only need to apply a little and work it into the skin.</li>
            <li> ; very effective wrinkle reduction and reduced hyperpigmentation from the high-dose retinol, the soothing anti-acne/anti-rosacea properties of the niacinamide, moisturizing of the argon oil and hyaluronic acid,  the antioxidant effects of the CoQ10 and green tea, and all the other ingredients that I have not listed.</li>
            <li> I was also bad at picking at my face and this product has done a wonderful job reducing my blemish scars.</li>
            <li> Am 60 years old, have been using it since January, and really can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Ugh...I wanted to love this so badly because I really do like the company, but I have to be honest when something doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> far I really like it.</li>
            <li> I apply the serum to clean, dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much softer and I&#x27;ve noticed less fine lines.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using the Retinol Serum for a few days and love the results.</li>
            <li> I been ordering this product for a few months  now, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin</li>
            <li> Normally, I can not tell what a retinol serum is doing.  </li>
            <li> After about a week I noticed my moisturizer was actually being absorbed into my face again.</li>
            <li> Had a nice smell, but overall I only used this 2 times and replaced it already with a different product.</li>
            <li> I unfortunatly couldn&#x27;t use it any more than a few times because I dropped it on my bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> It was worth ordering it and paying extra for  currency conversion and shipment to Canada.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any changes but will write more in a month.</li>
            <li> I have NO negative effects from this.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly this hydrating formula simultaneously works to soften blemishes, clear pores and remove dirt, grime and dead facial skin with a wondrous combination of Witch Hazel, Salicylic Acid and Glycolic Acid.</li>
            <li> Other reasons that fed into my decision to purchase this, besides the high ratings, were that it&#x27;s made in the USA and cruelty free.</li>
            <li> The serum is really lightweight as sinks into your skin really quickly.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t have enough retinol, right?</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see real results on my fine lines yet</li>
            <li> Thicker than other serums, goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> This is an &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t live without this&amp;#34; item for me.  </li>
            <li> when I woke up today i saw a new pimple:</li>
            <li> I like putting this directly on my new pillow wrinkle on the side of my nose and on my brow furrow.</li>
            <li> Retinol won&#x27;t make the wrinkles go away, but hopefully it will keep the new ones at bay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> instaNatural has a new fan.</li>
            <li> Being that this is a serum and a very light formulation, you usually apply this product after a toner and before applying a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and prone to outbrakes</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks of daily use on sensitive skin, I have felt no pain, dryness, redness or other unpleasantness as I&#x27;ve experienced with other unfamiliar skin care products.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin when it comes to products with Retinol, but</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The dark spots are about 80% gone and the texture of my skin is very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> i am 1/2 way through my second bottle, as i really wanted this to work!</li>
            <li> can you please let me know if this is normal for the product to be orange when it has always been a clear color</li>
            <li> It comes in a dark brown bottle which I like because it keeps the light out and prolongs the life of the serum.</li>
            <li> For me personally, this is the exact combination I need.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be working well so far!</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and less fine lines.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not usually one to believe anti-aging claims), but this thing is pretty amazing---however, for a different purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter, it is softer, my fine lines are less noticeable</li>
            <li> I live in New Zealand, and Instanatural doesn’t send directly to NZ –</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m missing that retinol oomph I&#x27;ve experienced with other similar products.</li>
            <li> After using for approximately a month, I can say I love it!  </li>
            <li> If for some reason your skin feels too tight, apply a light moisturizer</li>
            <li> My skin feels tight and wrinkle free.</li>
            <li> As usual I am not disappointed with the results from an InstaNatural product!  </li>
            <li> retinol products are very important to exfoliate dead skin and let the younger skin be on surface..</li>
            <li> I have notice my neck feels so smooth and a little tighter.</li>
            <li> My bottle is almost empty because I have been religiously using it, and I can see the improvement on my fine lines.</li>
            <li> use the InstaNatural serum morning and night, and it absorbs quickly so that other products (moisturizer and makeup) can be applied soon after with no problem.  </li>
            <li> my face look clear in the morning</li>
            <li> Overall, I do think it lives up to its claim and my sensitive skin likes it very</li>
            <li> I like the expiry data printed clearly on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I think its a great substitute of 100$ expensive serums which have same ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a white female in my early 30s with HUGE pores and moderate acne issues.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li> The serum is clear and has a citrus scent which goes away after you apply it.  </li>
            <li> It has already helped clear out</li>
            <li> Sensitive and acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m in my late twenties, I&#x27;m more concerned with repair and fixing/delaying wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for a second time - it is much cheaper</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and use this serum along with InstaNatural eye cream, day cream and night cream.  </li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but that is made  from natural derived ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin too and it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference after using it religiously!</li>
            <li> using this oil once, I felt my skin in the morning and it felt as soft as if I had just put some of it on..</li>
            <li> but my skin has just been glowing and soft and moisturized ever since I started using this twice a day.</li>
            <li> This definitely makes my skin much smoother..</li>
            <li> I am 52 years old</li>
            <li> and my skin feels silky soft afterward.</li>
            <li> bottle of Insta Natural Retinol serum.  </li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s just going to take awhile; I am 66 years old.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;66-year old</li>
            <li> I do like it a lot so far.</li>
            <li> If your skin is sensitive or sun intolerant, applying a moisturizing cream or lotion after the serum dries is helpful.</li>
            <li> Makes me skin so soft - haven&#x27;t noticed the difference yet</li>
            <li> and I would be red, peeling and inflamed after just one use, but this is a very well-balanced out product.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and I noticed that my lines are diminishing, I have always wanted to get botox, but even after a week using this stuff, I can tell I won&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> Using it nightly with no issues to my fairly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so far I like it</li>
            <li> This is the one and only product I have ever tried that really works.</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, and I&#x27;m not experiencing any breakouts.  </li>
            <li> did not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Irritated my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is so much tighter, brighter, firmer and it has changed my entire face!</li>
            <li> The reason I purchased it was because I was dealing with adult acne around my mouth and chin over a lengthy period of time.</li>
            <li> I really like to use beauty serums on my facial skin.  </li>
            <li> have rather sensitive skin-</li>
            <li> Not harsh</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> do not recommend for sensitive skin though</li>
            <li> retinol smells lovely, like delicate orange and it is orange in color.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized and softens the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The PTR is nearly watery, and slips around everywhere.</li>
            <li> so far has not improved at all my melasma&lt;br</li>
            <li> have sensitive, clogged, acneic skin and this has helped improve my complexion.</li>
            <li> so far seems to be helping.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I like it so far.  </li>
            <li> And my skin is ultra sensitive and no issues.  </li>
            <li> I realize that refund policies are not always honored, but with Amazon&#x27;s return policies and the risk of negative feedback online, I felt confident in ordering it.  </li>
            <li> and so far I like it.</li>
            <li> It comes in a dropper which they recommend applying a few drops on your fingertips before lightly smoothing over your face in upward circular motions after using a cleanser and toner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve explored nearly any and everything.</li>
            <li> This serum has completely reset my skin.</li>
            <li> skin was soft had a glow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reduced those nagging bags (from lack of sleep) that I get in the morning to nearly nothing -</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate or aggravate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so soft afterwards and the softness lasts as well.</li>
            <li> my skin feels soft and plump afterwards.</li>
            <li> I do believe it&#x27;s still premature to see a difference since it does take four to eight weeks for the old epidermis to completely slough off and be replaced.  </li>
            <li> product can cause redness if used too often or on sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> but I will need to order it directly from them since it is not carried by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t try out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel firm and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is not a paid review, I am a 48 year old woman</li>
            <li> , i will say it help the face get clear but no tight</li>
            <li> It has helped with fine lines and wrinkles, mainly under my delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are diminishing and fine lines on my forehead and near where crows feet are starting to form are smoothing out.  </li>
            <li> At night, I first apply Retinol Serum and let dry; then apply Eye Gel for maximum results.  </li>
            <li> This product stated clearing up my dark spits really Quick</li>
            <li> I have been using this for less than a full week and am already seeing improvement in &amp;#34;smoothing out&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> At first I really enjoyed how firm it made my skin feel and it seemed to help the acne a little bit.</li>
            <li> I apply to a clean face after I have used my toner and like to apply it when my skin is still a little damp.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that with the other products in this line that the skin is definitely looking better and I was good about using some very expensive products.  </li>
            <li> Actually, favorite face product - I use it twice a day (there are days I haven&#x27;t gotten around to it, but generally I use it at least once a day).  </li>
            <li> I particularly enjoy finding small companies that no one knows about, or cult favorites from far reaching areas of the globe.</li>
            <li> Not sure which serum will help the most, but I won&#x27;t use the two serums at the same time.  </li>
            <li> My problem is that I try so many products at the same time, when I do notice a difference, I&#x27;m not sure which one</li>
            <li> I sometimes get a slight blush but it quickly subsides.</li>
            <li> In fact, I was shocked to see that in just a few days I was seeing my deeper wrinkles disappear, my skin tone is even, the pores are minimal, the texture of my skin is baby-bottom smooth, my neighbors have even commented on how great I look!  </li>
            <li> I believe this makes my skin feel balanced because they&#x27;ve added high quality essential oils.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a new addition to your facial routine and are looking for an all natural face mask</li>
            <li> I gave this product a complete try - using it as instructed (which turned into once daily as it left my skin red and tingly), but because I went to once daily, by time I had used it completely (in order to give it a full chance to work) when I tried to return it because it didn&#x27;t work at all, I was told - &amp;#34;This item no longer eligible for returns&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Liking it so far, I have combination skin with very oily T zone and dry, flaky skin everywhere.</li>
            <li> Half a droppers worth of serum completely covers my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> When it came I was worried because the bottle seemed smaller than i thought it would, but you honestly need very little so this bottle will go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am using it for small wrinkles and light acne scarring.</li>
            <li> I get the odd little pimple, but nothing like the mess and irritation I experienced before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application- Wash your face and gently pat dry.</li>
            <li> I am in the quest to remain as youthful looking as possible or at least be able to age gracefully.</li>
            <li> For anti-aging products you need to give them six months, that&#x27;s the amount of time it takes for complete cell turnover in your skin (sloughing off the old cells) and to see ultimate results.</li>
            <li> I am a 58 year old Afican American woman is sensitive oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I was REALLY hoping that the quality would be there and that I would get that tightening feeling, smaller pore appearance and overall glow that the Skinceuticals product provided, but it&#x27;s just not there.  </li>
            <li> I wonder how much of the ingredients listed are actually in the bottle for only $20.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into my skin quickly and does not feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> NOT safe for sensitive skin!!!!!!</li>
            <li> That fact alone will warrant my purchasing another bottle from you in the very near future.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a major use for retinol</li>
            <li> , will be a returning customer interested to try other products</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this serum, as it also contains my two other favorite skincare products Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid, and will definitely be trying other InstaNatural&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li> Sure if the weather had been blistering cold and windy the entire time I was using it, I could have blamed my rawness and super sensitivity on that.</li>
            <li> I have been satisfied with a few other products from Instanatural as well.</li>
            <li> I am excited to see what results I achieve over the next few months.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using fine lines which started appearing a year ago are slowly fading.</li>
            <li> All of those ingredients make for a powerful little serum that has helped me with all of my skin</li>
            <li> It seems that in the last 5 years my skin has also become more sensitive and has occasionally either broken out or had a rash when I tried a new product.</li>
            <li> it’s really hard to fit spa time in let alone</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have used this long enough to tell if it is really going to help.</li>
            <li> I was recommended to try Retinol serums when I went to get a facial to clear up my acne.</li>
            <li> I have co-workers, and  clients constantly  compliment on how young I  look.....</li>
            <li> I am 48 years old and have gotten a lot of compliments on my skin since I have been using this along with washing my face with Vitamin C Facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no greasiness and it has not broken me out at all.  </li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seen any vast differences</li>
            <li> Until recently, I had monthly professional facials which cost about $125.  </li>
            <li> I had tried different make-up and sensitive skin soap/ face lotion products.</li>
            <li> Something that finally works...  Lots of damage (67 yrs young) to correct, but see differences in just over a week.  </li>
            <li> I use it at night only, as my skin is quite sensitive, though after a bit--I will apply during the day as well.  </li>
            <li> Younger looking, soft skin..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s, oily skin and moderate acne.</li>
            <li> This 2.5% Retinol serum with 20% Vitamin C offers a double punch.</li>
            <li> First impression of this product, I noticed the citrus-y scent, that is enough for me to mentally confirm this product does contain a form of vitamin C in it.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced any burning or tingling but should say that I had been using a glycolic acid cream at night for many years before I switched to this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell spa-ish which is what I usually expect.  </li>
            <li> It sloughs off skin that causes dullness as you use it but does it gently enough that skin does not appear dry and flaky but a with a little more glow as you continue to use daily.</li>
            <li> and although I have some health problems, I saw a new doctor who looked twice at my paperwork and commented that I looked much younger than my age when he was going over my overall health summary.</li>
            <li> I am half way through with my first 1-oz.</li>
            <li> And it took less than two months to get exactly the results I was looking for</li>
            <li> It seems to work as well as any other brand, but it leaves a bit of stickiness and the smell it just too much.</li>
            <li> guess I&#x27;ve made her a believer in the brand because she wants to try some of their other products now.</li>
            <li> In the areas that my makeup tends to go cakey because of dryness and skin surface issues, this product has really made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;8 drops covers my entire face, so this will last a long time, even with using it day and night&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And not just the slight, new lines around my eyes that one would consider cute, and the occasional little bump that could be hidden with concealer, but actual real crows feet, deep lines between the brows, and problematic acne in the T-zone as well as both cheeks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an important part of your skincare regimen when you hit your late 20s/early 30s</li>
            <li> the only concern I have now is that after ordering this product several times, it has always been a clear color liquid.</li>
            <li> It was gente enough for my sensitive skin, especially around my eye area.  </li>
            <li> I am now finishing up my third bottle and now only use it in the morning because my face has completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> Because my skin is sensitive, I have to only use it at night and occasionally skip nights</li>
            <li> package came really fast, the serum is really thick, absorbs really well and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the smell and how the product sinks into my skin and then slowly tightens it.  </li>
            <li> and I have been looking with a critical eye because I have bought so many other serums in the past which promised results</li>
            <li> This with my other daily and nightly skin products have helped my skin so much.</li>
            <li> Your new skin will be very sensitive so you will need to protect your skin from the sun and harsh</li>
            <li> Soon after it dries skin fells little tight, but not too much, not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few, more expensive retinal serums and so far, I would absolutely buy this instead.</li>
            <li> I let my skin dry completely (20 to 30 minutes) after washing, before I apply the serum.  </li>
            <li> This product I used for a straight week and a half, thought I would notice some peeling from the retinol but didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I learned to let it dry completely before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I did notice a difference in my skin texture after a few weeks as old skin sloughed off and new finer pored skin emerged.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried several other high dollar products</li>
            <li> I have very dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I comes in a little bottle with a dropper which allows for absolute control of the distribution of the serum.  </li>
            <li> I like the dropper type dispenser as I can have as little or as much as I need.  </li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know if it makes a major difference, but i will update my review if i see any improvement on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Even if its a good product, if the smell is bad, it will keep me from purchasing the product again.</li>
            <li> The Argon oil and CoQ 10 are extremely soothing, and the niacinamide, which has been proven to be very effective against rosacea, acne, and possibly even acne scars, let alone wrinkles, all seem to work together to negate any negative effects the strength of the retinol may have against irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> She loves it - she is a little older than me and complains sometimes about the texture and tone of her skin.&lt;br /&gt;According to her</li>
            <li> I came across this product by accident, and decided to try it based on the positive reviews, and the fact that the company promises a refund if you are not satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any real difference in my facial skin, and I am using it faithfully on a daily basis for the past 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have been testing out products from Instanatural due to the natural ingredients that they use.</li>
            <li> I don;t know if I&#x27;ve seen any significant changes in my skin after using this, but my skin hasn&#x27;t gotten worse or anything</li>
            <li> I am not familiar with whatever the general alleged benefits of retinol serums are and am only speaking of this particular product.</li>
            <li> A half-dropper will cover my entire neck and face so this will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This product has all the important ingredients to help slow down the skin&#x27;s aging process.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and gives your skin a glow but does not leave an oily residue, my face appears matte, but with a slight glow, it is not oily, neither is it dry or tight.</li>
            <li> The serum to me does make my face very dry, to the point that I can only use it every 3rd day and only at night.  </li>
            <li> This not only kept my skin clear but it helped fade some acne scars from previous treatments.</li>
            <li> , I could not smile or move my face  naturally.</li>
            <li> I have not been using this long enough to tell a difference yet.</li>
            <li> Between my age, long work hours and some medical issues/treatments my skin has had a lot to deal with</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t linger too long, so not a big concern.&lt;br /&gt;-While</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first given the high concentration of retinol claimed on the packaging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It won&#x27;t erase all of your wrinkles - nothing will do that job - but it will slow down the signs of aging and plump up your face to make wrinkles less prominent.</li>
            <li> I’ve really gotten into serums lately (I’ve got another one to review, later).</li>
            <li> I even have to put a moisturizer on later at night because it gets so dry.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are less noticeable and my skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the implications and other reviews, there is NO long term &amp;#34;fixing&amp;#34; the problem , it is simply a temporary solution.</li>
            <li> You have to work quickly though since the serum is so thin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to know just how it&#x27;s protecting from free radicals, since those are invisible, but the air quality where I live is not great, it&#x27;s still the height of winter, and the wind chill alone can sting your face.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use, I did notice some subtle differences, as my fine lines became shallower.  </li>
            <li> Your skin feels so soft and tight.</li>
            <li> ultimately -- while I thought it did have a positive effect on my skin, it wasn&#x27;t dramatic enough to add it to my regular beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> As I said earlier in my other review, when paired with the Retinol moisturizer, it gives an extra boost.</li>
            <li> I imagine that it will last quite a while because I use about 6 drops for my very dry face.  </li>
            <li> I gently pat it into for at least two minutes with the tips of my fingers.</li>
            <li> It even outs the complexion, keep pores clear and also removes dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use these products for as long as they will make it.</li>
            <li> Lifted the grey tone &amp; dullness from my skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say what the long term affects of this product will be</li>
            <li> At my age, that hasn&#x27;t happened for a long time.</li>
            <li> Retinol is clinically proven to help with signs of aging with long term use</li>
            <li> Over time, both men and women will start to develop an aged appearance from the following signs:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> but I am eager to see the long term results.</li>
            <li> then it has been in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Both of these are part of my skin care routine for a long time.</li>
            <li> Only a few drops is enough and it last a long time!</li>
            <li> I had been suffering from severely flaky, dry, dull skin for weeks (thanks, Winter).  </li>
            <li> I actually think; it has made my lines above nose  less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It is now half it&#x27;s size and the only change in my facial care</li>
            <li> I tried several other similar products with minimal results.  </li>
            <li> You only use a little, it goes a long way and makes your skin look and feel younger.</li>
            <li> This is a very thin serum with a light citrus aroma.  </li>
            <li> I only use this at night as with any other retinol product.</li>
            <li> I revamped my skin care regimen recently, and I was looking for something that would give me anti-aging benefits, sandwiched between all the other products I use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used products with Retinol in them for years, as well as various other products containing hyaluronic acid, and Vitamins C and E.  </li>
            <li> so I stopped for several days and have now backed off a little on the amount I use and everything is back on course.  </li>
            <li> Although I have not been using the serum very long I have seen a softening in some deeper forehead wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> My skin does get a bit dry with it</li>
            <li> In my opinion is better than peeling and pay $250 only to fade the sun damage and stay ugly for weeks with peeling skin all over your face.</li>
            <li> It helped to dry out existing acne and fix any scar discoloration.</li>
            <li> I do think I may be using it too often, as my face has become a bit dry.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell, but it doesn&#x27;t overly dry, yet seems to be working on some brown spots.</li>
            <li> I let it dry for a minute or two after appllying and then add moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It didn’t have that flakiness once it was dry.</li>
            <li> Although it extracted dirt from my pores, it did not overly dry out my face.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smoother but dry.  </li>
            <li> has really smoothed the skin on our face, while removing dark spots and small wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Now my issue is which serum do I put on at night, ha what a terrible problem to have right? :)</li>
            <li> However I do not use this everyday , I use this in the evening , every other day,  which fits for my  sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are way lighter only in 1week use and also my skin tone has improved.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have been using InstaNatural skin care line this past year as I switched over to all natural products.  </li>
            <li> I tried that last night and this morning noticed that the dark circles are slowing diminishing.</li>
            <li> My face was still breaking out, and I was starting to realized that my upper cheeks were raw-</li>
            <li> I had a very very minor initial breakout that lasted less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> every day...all day long!!  </li>
            <li> I have also started using some other products that have been extremely helpful (from the same folks)</li>
            <li> This is an update to my previous review posted shortly after purchasing the Retinol serum.  </li>
            <li> But this serum is less costly than their proprietary products with the same results.</li>
            <li> My skin got very dry after using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little different that what I expect but the smell  like orange and pineapple</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of each is enough.</li>
            <li> You may get a little red and flaky, but that goes away.</li>
            <li> little Retinol serum is age defying, and is supercharged with antioxidants-- everything I could possibly want!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is not greasy and a little bit goes a long long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> do not have bad skin or acne, but i am always trying to make it look better.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my sin is dulling as I am getting older also from getting less sleep because of either kids or staying up late working on schoolwork or house work.</li>
            <li> yup, total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m embarrassed to say how much I&#x27;ve spent on skin care over the years.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> SHOULD NOT HAVE EXPECTED MIRACLES.</li>
            <li> no results at all , very watery and thin.</li>
            <li> Retinol serum is terrific for discoloration, brown spots, uneven skin...</li>
            <li> I noticed results within a few days of using it only at night.</li>
            <li> using this product for only a few days, but-I can already see a difference in my elasticity and vibrancy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been really careful, picky to choose what to put on my face .</li>
            <li> apply I fill the dropper and tilt my head and squeeze a bit on my cheeks one at a time and spread it around to my nose area, forehead, and over my eyes (with them closed).</li>
            <li> Please read ingredients carefully.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful with what I put on my skin.  </li>
            <li> , then definitely check out InstaNatural’s Dead Sea Mud Mask, Retinol Moisturizer and Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days, but I seem to notice evening of skin color.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about three weeks and grew a big zit a few days ago.</li>
            <li> If you are looking at this, you are trying to get rid of wrinkles, spots or rough aged skin.</li>
            <li> Let me share with you a few of the key ingredients: 2.5% retinol, 20% vitamin c, 10% hyaluronic acid &amp; fruit &amp; plant</li>
            <li> I feel it makes my skin brighter in combination with the other InstaNatural Skincare products I have also been using such as the dead sea mask and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful with retinol due to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Moreover, it seemed sticky or something like that and with no positive result on my face at all.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> My feedback is not positive at all.</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few Insta Natural products in the past and one thing I have to say about this brand is that it never disappoints.</li>
            <li> I hated my smile lines and was told it was from fat loss and couldn&#x27;t be helped much but they are literally gone!</li>
            <li> My skin soaks it up and you only need a little!</li>
            <li> I have red acne marks on my skin that have lighten up which makes them  a little less noticeable</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t forget a little bit does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t changed any other habit (nutrition/exercises)</li>
            <li> so I can guarantee you that the results I&#x27;m describing are due to the serum.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had an overly drying effect as with other retinol products.</li>
            <li> This product is a ‘milky orange’ colour, presumably due to the retinol.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and what a difference it makes!  </li>
            <li> The only downside is the bottle is rather small.</li>
            <li> I have also purchased other products from InstaNatural because of the results I got from this serum.  </li>
            <li> A little drop goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure how these other ppl had results like they&#x27;re saying they did, but I didn&#x27;t notice a bit of any change.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had a white spot on the side of my nose for the past 2 years and within 1 week, it started shrinking.  </li>
            <li> In order for me to fully review this product it can take like 6 months because a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Witch Hazel, Salicylic Acid and Glycolic Acid as well as other ingredients</li>
            <li> I intend to try some of their other products that might benefit my skin.  </li>
            <li> Ozi Oprah show and other beauty sources</li>
            <li> I think that my skin became brighter and freshness, pink color after 14 days from the use of this serum !</li>
            <li> (But, that was an emergency situation, please follow their recommendations carefully!)</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t been using it that long, but hoping to see a difference in a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> and it doesn’t peel like with the use of other retinol products.</li>
            <li> I started using this retinol serum and am starting to notice a small difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t work for this company or have any relationship other than as a consumer.</li>
            <li> In the past I would only use retinol products at night, but I can use this product in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li> I put this on my face once every other day.</li>
            <li> I know this serum works because it causes my skin to dry out a little and peel as it cause skin cells to turn over faster.</li>
            <li> You can feel the active ingredients working.</li>
            <li> Very pleased, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It does what all the other product do with half the time.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user of this product and was a little skeptical based on some of the reviews.</li>
            <li> I noticed it helps with my under-eye wrinkles and dark circles.</li>
            <li> Dark circles around my eyes seemed to lighten.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is sturdy and the dark bottle will maintain the product from getting spoiled.</li>
            <li> My under eye dark circles have lightened dramatically.  </li>
            <li> I had sun damage on my cheeks but from the time I started to use this serum, all my dark spots started to fade.</li>
            <li> I will probably finish this bottle and see where I am with the dark spots before deciding if I will buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say I noticed a difference in wrinkle or dark spot reduction.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for products that have weird smells.</li>
            <li> I thought this would help with my dark spots,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me they have not done much for my wrinkles or skin.</li>
            <li> I am not in the least expecting any money back, I want to continue with the applications and</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Dark Circles&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Not sure it did what it claim to do, had to quit using it after about two weeks, because it gave me a chemical burn on my forehead and cheek area which after three weeks has still not completely healed.</li>
            <li> From acne, to dark spots and over production of oil.</li>
            <li> I used all types of lotions and after a few hours my skin still felt rough...</li>
            <li> but I could tell my skin overall is slowly turning brighter</li>
            <li> The product comes in a dark amber colored glass bottle, which keeps oxidation down to a minimum.</li>
            <li> mean always work since everyone has different concerns.</li>
            <li> Dark spots seem to be fading and the deepest wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> To make a long story short, my skin was highly sensitive and hurt so bad.</li>
            <li> To preface this entire review, I was using the Skinceuticals Vitamin C serum, and it&#x27;s over 100 bucks, so this was a serious step down in terms of price.  </li>
            <li> I live in a climate with dramatic seasons and I tried this one in the dead of winter when the weather is the coldest and driest.</li>
            <li> Slight citrus aroma, not sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my face is fuller and my wrinkles are less visible.</li>
            <li> For the price, I also decided to use this product on my neck and décolletage, and I am noticing a slight difference there.  </li>
            <li> As you&#x27;ve probably noticed in my previous emails, I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> half a syringe is all you need.</li>
            <li> When I applied this to my skin, I noticed a slight tingle, and redness where all of my blemishes were.</li>
            <li> My lines around my mouth and eyes are gradually getting less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I have used half of the bottle already and can already tell I am never going to be without this stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 InstaNatural products for my daughter wanting to try less toxic options for her cystic acne.</li>
            <li> The serum is what I expected, but directions on the bottle are really, really small...</li>
            <li> If it is too noticeable or bothersome, cut down the use to a few times a week instead of every day.</li>
            <li> skin around eyes is tight.</li>
            <li> if I neglect to do this in the morning, my skin is dry and dull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised - my face seems a little brighter and less tired than usual.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I am a little scared to use it, I don&#x27;t want to break out or have an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> after using this a little while i wanted to update my review.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous but thought I&#x27;d try it out to see how it worked on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I applied this after getting out of the shower and noticed that it did make my skin a little flushed and tingly.</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel a little tighter and softer.</li>
            <li> act with synergy to give me the effect I wanted in little time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this caused it - have used other products from Instanatural with no problems.</li>
            <li> a little smoother.&lt;br /&gt;-Not</li>
            <li> but hopefully at the very least, it will stave off any further lines for a while.  </li>
            <li> Is extremely affordable!!</li>
            <li> My eye bags actually became  worse.</li>
            <li> It contains vitamins C and E, as well as green tea, which I attribute to the &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; effect.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried a few.  </li>
            <li> This serum helps my face to feel firm.</li>
            <li> I bought it with the hope that it would reduce some dark spots that I have on my face, but I&#x27;m not sure that it has lightened them any.</li>
            <li> I have been using the retinol serum on my face and hands for a few weeks and have noticed improvement in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I put two drops on my finger tip, dab it in a few places around my face, then rub it in using a circular motion.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using it she can tell a difference in the look and feel of her face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I held off to review this product until I had used it for a few months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a few weeks and my skin looks brighter and feels smoother.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at night for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Not sticky, greasy, stinky or harsh.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use this everyday mybe once or twice a week</li>
            <li> I had a few skin tags on my face and one of them for years.</li>
            <li> Age-Defying Retinol Serum has an abundance of antioxidants and nutrients that will help your face feel firm, youthful and renewed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its not oily or heavy</li>
            <li> I use a vit c and retinol everyday....</li>
            <li> but I could see a difference just after a few days.</li>
            <li> Here is some information about the Dead Sea Mud Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to InstaNatural, “InstaNatural’s Dead Sea Mud Mask is an all-natural detoxifier and purifier that comes from the renowned and sacred Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> It will help with acne scars and hyperpigmentation because it encourages cell turn over-removing dead skin and repairing damaged cells.</li>
            <li> and I am not a huge fan of either product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that any scars or discoloration from previous blemishes (acne scars) are a thing of the past and this serum provided the quickest &amp;#34;scar</li>
            <li> that any scars or discoloration from previous blemishes (acne scars) are a thing of the past and this serum provided the quickest &amp;#34;scar</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any breakouts when using it.(Now that I&#x27;ve gotten lazy and haven&#x27;t been using anything my skins a mess).</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t causing me to break out or any other negative reactions.</li>
            <li> I have been washing with raw honey and then using the Retinol serum for a few weeks and my complexion has improved drastically.</li>
            <li> I did some reading and there are few things that can slow down wrinkles progress and some of them are botox and retinol.</li>
            <li> I always seem to have a hard time sleeping, so that&#x27;s why I get my dark circles.</li>
            <li> This will be a long time beauty secret for me.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to use it again, but chugged along because sometimes my skin will break out when I try something new, but these didn&#x27;t go away.  </li>
            <li> This will make your skin feel very tight.</li>
            <li> Some moisturizer then to dry flaky leaving an appearance of a thin whitish film</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little under a month and feel like this in combination with the Vitamin C serum is improving my skin on my face and will continuing using this product!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure which is working</li>
            <li> Even my old chicken pox scar on my forehead is now even to the touch.</li>
            <li> A small amount is all you need.</li>
            <li> and I have even caught him using it a few times himself!  </li>
            <li> so i had anticipated this happening as I have used retinol products in the past and</li>
            <li> I have noticed a reduction in visible small lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I apply few drops of Insatnatural retinol serum along with my night cream and Voila !</li>
            <li> After my skin absorbs the serum, I apply my usual moisturizer/sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My face isn&#x27;t covered in angry red pimples anymore.</li>
            <li> But it failed to lighten my upper lip melasma.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;d order it again.</li>
            <li> Not impressed, saw no difference in my facial complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I should experiencing.</li>
            <li> , I could see a difference within just a few days!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken care of my skin for most of my life, so it wasn&#x27;t in really terrible shape.</li>
            <li> Not, satisfied with this product, it make me breakout on my face</li>
            <li> Use about 4 small drops to cover my face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li> No more flakiness, the dullness has gone, and though the frown lines are still there, I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;ll soon be minimized.  </li>
            <li> This smells VERY heavily of citrus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 and have very few lines and plan to keep it that way.  </li>
            <li> The consistency of the product was a very thin fluid, it doesn’t feel oily or sticky to the touch which is something I look for in a serum.</li>
            <li> I figured it was because of the serum, so I decreased the usage to every other night.</li>
            <li> BTW, this product offers mad hydration with moisturizing ingredients like hyaluronic acid and organic jojoba oil, and it smells like heaven.  </li>
            <li> I have tried expensive retinol products before that were too irritating to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any negative issues with breakouts (which have sometimes been a problem in the past) or sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> you first open the Mud Mask, it is very cold and will feel cold to your face.  </li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to some makeup I purchased over the summer that left me with dark spots on one side of my face.</li>
            <li> I was previously using prescription strength Retin A but found it too irritating.</li>
            <li> Ordering a single bottle is expensive, with ordering 4 bottles, the shipping was over $25.  </li>
            <li> My face is not in horrible condition, but I do want to get rid of fine lines &amp; wrinkles around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> However, after using it for approximately a month, I&#x27;m afraid my 72 year old &amp;#34;weathered&amp;#34; skin is beyond repair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little confused about the color of this serum.</li>
            <li> For 60 year old skin, mine is not too bad.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I have started too late.</li>
            <li> In my late 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> In the last couple of years I turned 40 and my skin went crazy.  </li>
            <li> Delicate texture that can be used alone or mix with cream.  </li>
            <li> I use about 4 drops every morning after washing my face and follow-up with moisturizer with at least 30 SPF.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid it may leave last thing redness.</li>
            <li> With Retinols, you have to go slow in order to prevent dryness, skin sensitivities, and the like.</li>
            <li> (terrifying) but these grey New York days I haven’t worried about it.</li>
            <li> and doesn&#x27;t burn like retinol usually does!</li>
            <li> my wife and i have used this product for about 6 months and the results are unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I tried a couple different serums and this one doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky or smell unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Need to do some serious skin correcting?</li>
            <li> Together, they provide a terrific base for my makeup without being so heavy as to cause a breakout.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to report that is not true for those around the mouth.  </li>
            <li> My advice to all younger people out there is to start your skin care regime in your 20&#x27;s, not wait till you&#x27;re 60, like me:(</li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely, not greasy or smelly - noticed a difference immediately!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out crazy bad like some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried either!</li>
            <li> This product caused an allergic reaction all over my face including painful blisters and dry patches around my mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li> Was told I was aging well and asked my secret.</li>
            <li> Have not experienced any redness or irritation like some retinol products.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a couple weeks and have not experienced any irritation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been approximately 16 days that I have used the Retinol serum</li>
            <li> You can opt to apply a thin layer all over your skin or just target the zones you feel</li>
            <li> So, obviously  it was very unpleasant, disagreeable.</li>
            <li> I had tried another retinol based product a few years ago and had a bad reaction to it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t help me in either regard.</li>
            <li> so sorry -</li>
            <li> It saved me money for I had been ordering expensive ones that did not do a thing to my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at that unfortunate stage in life where I&#x27;m developing my wrinkles while still fighting acne.  </li>
            <li> The serum was sticky, and made my face uncomfortable when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> so I was a bit skeptical about trying another one.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but have been using it for coumple of weeks, not every night, and am already seing benefits.</li>
            <li> do not have to purchase a expensive Vitamin C serum which I have done for years, this is the one to try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they don’t like me.  </li>
            <li> disappointing to see zero results.</li>
            <li> I can put this on and make a run to the grocery store without having to worry about smelling awkward.</li>
            <li> You can’t go wrong!  </li>
            <li> I used this product while I was on fertility drugs, in the past I have had horrible acne with medicated cycles.</li>
            <li> All of the paid 5 star reviews make me very skeptical.</li>
            <li> THAT BAD .</li>
            <li> My eyes were getting bad and I felt to young(41) to have all those wrinkles(I smoke).</li>
            <li> I am shocked that after 3-4 weeks W/moisturizer as they say to do....</li>
            <li> Have not noticed a difference yet:(</li>
            <li> but I still got &#x27;em :(</li>
            <li> I was seriously disappointed in both</li>
            <li> Wish it was a bit cheeper on postage! :(</li>
            <li> Vera Base (no H20 fillers here)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I was looking terrible.</li>
            <li> I have terrible skin, post-children.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Best product I have ever used!!! My skin looks and feels amazing!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Shared the info with my aesthetician sister who advised me it was a good sale so I bought it &amp; I love it!</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS&#x27;NT THAT BAD . I MIGHT BUY IT AGAIN.ALTHOUGH I LIKE THE INSTANATURAL SERUM IN THE BLUE BOTTLE ALOT BETTER</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second order, and I love the result, I might give 5 star after couple of months see the full result.</li>
            <li> Sensitive and acne prone skin.  Now that I&#x27;m in my late twenties, I&#x27;m more concerned with repair and fixing/delaying wrinkles.  This stuff is wonderful!  My skin is in the best shape it&#x27;s been and looks more youthful!</li>
            <li> After many years spent in the sun, my skin is showing some sun damage and hyperpigmentation. This product has help with both of my concerns and also may skin appears to be smoother overall. Very please with this product and this company!!</li>
            <li> I love it. First very good price, 2nd very fast delivery</li>
            <li> My skin really feels great after using this product, It goes great underneath a moisturizer, I have seen a visible difference in lines on my face from using this for about a month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little different that what I expect but the smell  like orange and pineapple my face look clear in the morning , i will say it help the face get clear but no tight</li>
            <li> This stuff works. My fine lines and wrinkles are disappearing.  Works so well I ordered 2 bottles when I reordered this product. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, dont hesitate, even though i have sensitive skin,it has been a greta product to use, no redness on application or after effects, easily absorbed, a deffinate must,..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel the skin improvement.</li>
            <li> My skin is glowing. I love love love this product. Use it is daily!</li>
            <li> This was an excellent product!</li>
            <li> Skin is starting to even out..</li>
            <li> I like this serum, I use it at night before my night cream, it smells pleasant to me and not greasy at all, it goes on light and soaks in quickly, I have been using only two weeks  but so far so good!!</li>
            <li> I’ve been using the Retinol Serum for a few days and love the results. My skin is definitely softer and has a nice glow. I noticed it helps with my under-eye wrinkles and dark circles. The serum itself is pretty liquidy, but it absorbs quickly. You also don’t need much. It’s also really recommended that you use a sunscreen with it, as Retinol can enhance the effects of the sun. I’ve been using it both day and night for best results. I haven’t noticed any breakouts or anything from using it either, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this serum with the hopes it would help my skin even out. I also hoped it would help my eye bags, as retinal and vitamin C are supposedly effective towards that regard. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t help me in either regard. My eye bags actually became  worse. Until I realized what was causing their sudden extra darkness/baginess I looked like a corpse; however, the product does have a saving grace.  The customer support is great and has no problem refunding you if you&#x27;re not happy.  Give it a try, see if it works.</li>
            <li> I received the InstaNatural Age-Defying Retinol Serum for Review and was greatly pleased.  I comes in a little bottle with a dropper which allows for absolute control of the distribution of the serum.  the color of the serum in an opaque white and what I especially noticed about the serum was the very pleasant scent.  It is just that, pleasant, not overpowering, but enough.  The serum goes on vey smoothly and is absorbed into the skin rather quickly, with no sticky residue or tight feeling.  It contains vitamins C and E, as well as green tea, which I attribute to the &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; effect.  It was gente enough for my sensitive skin, especially around my eye area.  After a few days of use, I did notice some subtle differences, as my fine lines became shallower.  Dark circles around my eyes seemed to lighten.  I am sure with continued use, the effects will continue.  I highly recommend this product as it is well worth a try.</li>
            <li> Makes my face look younger! I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product!! I&#x27;m on my second bottle and plan on ordering my third. Improved tone, texture and overall appearance of my skin. Admittedly, I try many different serums, lotions &amp; potions...this one works. I get at least one compliment a day about how great my skin looks. I plan on this being a regular part of my skincare regime.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It has really worked well for me.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> i am 1/2 way through my second bottle, as i really wanted this to work! i can honestly say i do not see any change or improvement in my skin, so sorry - i did high hopes for this to work!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough, but I will say that it makes my face very smooth before putting on my makeup. And I can notice a different in fine wrinkles around my eyes</li>
            <li> Have used this for 2 weeks, morning and night, and have had no adverse reaction. My skin feels smoother and softer and brighter, but I have not noticed any visible reduction in lines. Perhaps I have started too late. My advice to all younger people out there is to start your skin care regime in your 20&#x27;s, not wait till you&#x27;re 60, like me:(</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin and works well, a quality product</li>
            <li> Retinol is a known wrinkle fighter and can even reduce fine lines. I&#x27;ve been using products with it for years. I use this every night after the Rose Water Toner and before a moisturizer. Since my favorite InstaNatural serum is the Hyaluronic Acid one, I am very please their retinol serum contains that ingredient. Retinol can be very drying and the hyaluronic acid really helps counteract that effect when I use it. Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li> I have been using this with microneedling and I&#x27;m not sure which is working or if they&#x27;re both working together, but I have to say I&#x27;ve noticed an incredible difference on my face.  It feels tighter, and firmer.  I have made sure to keep the retinol cream away from my eyes, as I have very sensitive under eye skin and that has been working thus far.  My dark spots are diminishing and fine lines on my forehead and near where crows feet are starting to form are smoothing out.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this stuff!  It is really making a difference!</li>
            <li> Liking it so far, I have combination skin with very oily T zone and dry, flaky skin everywhere. It moisturizers great that I don&#x27;t need to use my other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> have always been kind of scared to use any serums, but I was shocked at how much I really liked this product! I combined it with the Retinol Moisturizer and it just made my skin look an feel amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this Cerum, it leaves my skin feeling great! My skin does get a bit dry with it so I only use it at nighttime. Will certainly keep buying this product!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first given the high concentration of retinol claimed on the packaging. I was previously using prescription strength Retin A but found it too irritating. This serum has made my skin brighter, smoother and more glowy. I know this serum works because it causes my skin to dry out a little and peel as it cause skin cells to turn over faster. I love that it contains antioxidants, hyaluronic acid and a high percentage of vitamin c. I can&#x27;t wait to finish the bottle so I can get more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using various serums for a dozen years so my face is accustomed to a product such as this.  I bought this product for a second time - it is much cheaper and I get the same youthful and smooth look and feel to my face.  The eyedropper is not the most convenient but no reason not to use the serum.  I noticed a difference right away and like the feel of my skin after using the serum.    I only use this at night as with any other retinol product.</li>
            <li> I gave this stuff 3 because I saw a mild improvement, but I&#x27;ve used better products.  Might be a good introduction to retinol, but not quite strong enough for more seasoned retinol users.</li>
            <li> This smells VERY heavily of citrus. It seems to work as well as any other brand, but it leaves a bit of stickiness and the smell it just too much.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference within 2 weeks. Very good product I love it</li>
            <li> Retinol is the best product for removing fine lines. I love how it works.</li>
            <li> Update 22 Nov 2015: I finished my bottle, and I stand by my initial review. This serum helped smooth out my one stubborn deep line between my brows. Together with their anti-aging moisturizers, the line is no longer visible and the area is now plump. Even my old chicken pox scar on my forehead is now even to the touch. My honest opinion for a product that really works.   I use this serum at night and have been very please with the results. It is also gentle around the eyes. It has a soft creamy texture and a very pleasant slight citrusy smell that I love. A small amount is all you need. My skin looks amazing in the morning!  It works well with my InstaNatural Vitamin C cream, Night Cream, and Eye cream. All of them have made a big difference on my skin and neck. I&#x27;m 52 and have very few lines and plan to keep it that way.  I will continue to use these products for as long as they will make it. I threw away all the other stuff I&#x27;ve collected trying to search for the better one--yup, total waste of money.  I highly recommend it to any woman who cares greatly about their skin.</li>
            <li> Retinol at night yes please! I love this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell and it absorbs quickly. I do take very good care of my skin and this is a treat.</li>
            <li> I liked the natural ingredient list from this serum. The consistency of the product was a very thin fluid, it doesn’t feel oily or sticky to the touch which is something I look for in a serum. I didn’t notice any adverse reaction of the product on my skin, but my mom experienced discomfort and a bit of a flaky dry patch on her skin after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a big fan of Retinol treatments, ever since my days with philosophy cosmetics using their Miracle Worker line and Help Me treatment. I have also been looking in to ‘clean’ beauty products and attempting to learn more about the chemicals in products I use, so trying these products from Instanatural was a great first step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample of this serum to try out in partnership with BrandBacker. No compensation was provided for this review. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my sister and she loves it! Lightweight. Would buy this again :)</li>
            <li> In my late 20&#x27;s. Made an instant difference in the look of my skin. Have stopped using my current products and will be using this brand. Eye gel also fabulous. After 2 weeks of using fine lines which started appearing a year ago are slowly fading. Lifted the grey tone &amp; dullness from my skin. Every use adds a tiny hint of glow. pls note: I haven&#x27;t changed any other habit (nutrition/exercises) so I can guarantee you that the results I&#x27;m describing are due to the serum.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a week now. Already, bags under my eyes are gone! skin around eyes is tight. Forehead wrinkles are disappearing before my eye. Skins feels softer and smoother to my touch. I am a man.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best Retinol serums I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this. I have used Rx creams that have had benefit but this is much lighter and more gentle to my skin. I think it is worth trying for anyone who has the desire to refine and gently exfoliate the skin. I could feel an improvement in one use.</li>
            <li> As with all Instanatural products I&#x27;ve tried over the last year, this one is A+. I LOVE what it does for my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it over a month now, and I&#x27;m not even halfway done with the bottle. My skin has cleared up and my fine lines around my eyes seem to have diminished. It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out crazy bad like some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried either! LOVE this one!</li>
            <li> I was pushed into medically induced menopause at 35 so my skin changed dramatically and quickly.  I can&#x27;t say what the long term affects of this product will be but my pores seem smaller and my skin seems smoother and I have only been using it a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Wonderful serum and I have tried a few.  I do notice a difference in my skin tone and complexion.</li>
            <li> As we all age we start thinking and searching for the best thing to help us aging women the retinol is being talked about more and more. It use to be something that you can only get by seeing a physician or your Dermatologist. Now it is available in many easy to acquire beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;Retinol is now easy to get in a multitude of skin care products. This Serum from Instanatural has 2.5% Retinol, as well as Vit C, Hyaluronic acid and fruit acids. It is a bit gel like and glides on wonderfully. There is no burning or irritation noted. I have been adding this in with my night routine and while it has a bit of a slip to it upon application that settles in and there is no lingering oily feeling after absorption. This with my other daily and nightly skin products have helped my skin so much. I have only been using retinol for a few weeks and it has been a great experience. The bottle is sturdy and the dark bottle will maintain the product from getting spoiled. I was sent this for review, however this does not effect my thoughts and unbiased opinions.</li>
            <li> love this serum and works wonders on my boy friend&#x27;s skin -it is my second bottle and i will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I was using oz-natural retinol serum previously, I recently tried insta Natural retinol serum, I am really happy with this serum I can certanly notice a difference since changing products.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! gentle with a light citrus scent. I recommend using buffing grains and then applying this product and then a gentle moisturizer before bed for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with retinol, it is best to use the product at night while your skin can breath, make sure to rub in thoroughly making sure that it fully absorbs into the skin so that skin can still breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products from this company are gentle and natural with real results!</li>
            <li> Retinol is the bomb.  I&#x27;m embarrassed to say how much I&#x27;ve spent on skin care over the years.  I want more than hope in a jar, I want results.  This retinol serum is anti-aging and skin-clearing.  Best overall results.  Get this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Cleared a very deep/cystic acne blemish I have had for weeks in two uses. My skin feels very hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> gave it a good solid try, but it just didn&#x27;t make much difference.  Giong to give it another go when the seasons change.</li>
            <li> This product grew into me whilst using it this fall and winter season. I find it very effective pre-makeup to smooth out any rough areas in my face. As I said earlier in my other review, when paired with the Retinol moisturizer, it gives an extra boost. Just a little bit of each is enough. One night, I tried it alone without any other skincare product in my regimen and the result was astounding. It does what all the other product do with half the time. Overall, I do think it lives up to its claim and my sensitive skin likes it very much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.)</li>
            <li> this is nice!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; must have</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and use this serum along with InstaNatural eye cream, day cream and night cream.  These 4 products have slowed my wrinkles. My under eye dark circles have lightened dramatically.  I no longer wear concealer.  My husband always compliments my complexion and says I have no wrinkles - but I do.  They are just not as prominent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products for wrinkle reduction.  InstaNatural feels wonderful on the skin.  Non-greasy, can be worn under makeup without smearing.  Dries quickly.  Brightens your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t erase all of your wrinkles - nothing will do that job - but it will slow down the signs of aging and plump up your face to make wrinkles less prominent.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! I revamped my skin care regimen recently, and I was looking for something that would give me anti-aging benefits, sandwiched between all the other products I use. For nighttime use, Instanatural&#x27;s Retinol Serum is superb. It&#x27;s easily absorbed by your skin, with no peeling side effects so prevalent with retinol products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks bright, clear and remarkably wrinkle-free (this is also due to the other products I use, but the serum is definitely the spark that made everything else work.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price and size, I highly recommend it as an addition to your anti-aging prevention program. It&#x27;s an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received a sample of this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> I have used several products from InstaNatural.  My favorite is the Age Defying skin clearing serum (great for problem skin).  However, this one is also wonderful.  I use it at night and wake up to refreshed and bright skin.  I have only used it for a few weeks so I cannot tell how it is working on fine lines and wrinkles to date.  I can say that my husband has noticed a difference (since he is the only one who sees me in the morning without makeup).  He is impressed and I have even caught him using it a few times himself!  Thanks for another great product InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> Love this product and so does my son. I bought this for him as well and it has helped with his acne. His skin is clearer and fewer breakouts. This product keeps skin soft and wrinkle free skin clarity is noticicable.</li>
            <li> This will be a long time beauty secret for me.</li>
            <li> Minimizes lines and gives an overall smooth appearance</li>
            <li> I have used this with the Retinol moisturizer for 3 months..  There is a visible difference in the smoothness of my skin.  I use the toner and moisturizer too.  .  I love these products!</li>
            <li> An amazing product!!! We look forward to purchasing more products to introduce to our clients!</li>
            <li> Amazing serum, works well for my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> excellent product reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Being a guy I was feeling embarrassed even ordering something like this. My eyes were getting bad and I felt to young(41) to have all those wrinkles(I smoke). I am shocked that after 3-4 weeks W/moisturizer as they say to do....50%-60% of those wrinkles are gone....the bags I&#x27;d get, well over the last week, none existent..I wish I had a before picture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product once a day (at night only) for a week. I can&#x27;t tell any difference in the appearance of my skin, other than more blemishes than normal. I&#x27;m nervous to bump up the application to twice a day since I think even more blemishes will appear if I smear the recommended sunscreen on top of my make-up, moisturizer and the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing to see zero results. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great retinol product! I will use again!</li>
            <li> Great product, noticeable results within a week!</li>
            <li> Great stuff ! I have been using it for a few months &amp;amp; really do notice a difference. I&#x27;m on my second bottle &amp;amp; truly see a difference. My line are diminishing &amp;amp; my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I love it. I got this product by having a high discount code. it smells good. I use it mix with toner, then this will keep my face feels moisture.</li>
            <li> I’ve really gotten into serums lately (I’ve got another one to review, later). I’ve been hesitant of Retinol because I know you have to use sunscreen and you cannot get your brows waxed (terrifying) but these grey New York days I haven’t worried about it. It dries really nicely. It says it would work under makeup, but I’m only using this system at night, so that’s not an issue. It’s relatively scentless, has a nice consistency, and applies really well.</li>
            <li> This serum does its job. I have a sensitive skin so I only use it at night and yes, it makes my skin nice and smooth. I love this product.</li>
            <li> About 6 months ago I switched all my facial cleansers to instanatural. My skin has never been so soft, firm, acne free and wrinkle free! I will never use another face product! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Good product, good seller</li>
            <li> Great serum..... I use it every night after Hyaluronic Acid Serum (extra boost)</li>
            <li> I been ordering this product for a few months  now, I absolutely love it. my face looks so much clearer the acne mark have disappear and I look radiant. the only concern I have now is that after ordering this product several times, it has always been a clear color liquid. now on my last order the product is a bright orange color. I am a little scared to use it, I don&#x27;t want to break out or have an allergic reaction. can you please let me know if this is normal for the product to be orange when it has always been a clear color</li>
            <li> Love it, Im an esthetician 6years, and I just came across this brand.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great company and their products are phenomenal, I definitely will be trying out more products.</li>
            <li> My skin looks very healthy and smooth only when I have it on and the fine lines are less visible.  I haven&#x27;t notice any great improvement on my fine line after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that  I feel my face in the morning.  Very smooth and well nourished.  I honestly.  can&#x27;t say any more than that since I&#x27;ve been using this product for a short while.</li>
            <li> Love this product &amp; line! It is a very high quality Serum...It has improved my skin in a short time. I really Love the items from this company!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! Smells good and feels good, I really am noticing a difference.</li>
            <li> This serum feels cool and hydrating upon application, which I liked. The scent is pleasant and overall it&#x27;s a fine product but i&#x27;m missing that retinol oomph I&#x27;ve experienced with other similar products.</li>
            <li> smells absolutely amazing! i haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know if it makes a major difference, but i will update my review if i see any improvement on my skin.  after using this a little while i wanted to update my review. i can tell a difference in the clarity of my face and redness is reduced. i really like this product</li>
            <li> I apply it every night before the Retinol cream. I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my face and hands. I haven&#x27;t had an overly drying effect as with other retinol products. However, I do feel I&#x27;ve seen wrinkle improvement around my eyes. My hands look younger too. I will continue to use this. I haven&#x27;t used the whole bottle yet which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars. I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for light peel this is the product.  And it feels good on....my skin is real smooth.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural has done it again!  InstaNatutal is one of my favorite brands and the Age-Defying Retinol Serum that they sent me to review for my blog, GlamRiver ,is another great product to add to the growing list!  This serum makes a great addition to any skincare routine because it is packed with the ingredients we have all come to know and love.  Not only does it contain Retinol but it also has Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid and also Vitamin E.  All of those ingredients make for a powerful little serum that has helped me with all of my skin issues!&lt;br /&gt;I like to use this serum as part of my nighttime skincare routine.  I apply to a clean face after I have used my toner and like to apply it when my skin is still a little damp.  The serum is really lightweight as sinks into your skin really quickly.  I love that this is a multi-tasking product!</li>
            <li> InsatNatural makes some great products and this is one of them. It comes in a dark brown bottle which I like because it keeps the light out and prolongs the life of the serum. I also like the eye dropper style top. The serum itself is like a thicker gel so it&#x27;s easy to control. There isn&#x27;t much of a scent but I do smell and extremely light citrus. That tiny scent disappears as soon as it absorbs. Once applied it absorbs into the skin really fast and makes my skin feel great. There&#x27;s no sticky feeling or oily/greasy feeling. This is a great product for making the overall skin texture smoother and softer. It also works great under a moisturizer, under makeup, or even on it&#x27;s on. I did receive this complimentary for review although my thoughts and opinions are always unbiased and completely my own.</li>
            <li> In case you didn&#x27;t know, I LOVE naturals products. This is cruelty-free, made in the USA, and comes with a 100% lifetime satisfaction money back guarantee! You can’t go wrong!  Over the years I have tried many things, most with minimal or no results at all. I am in the quest to remain as youthful looking as possible or at least be able to age gracefully. I love beauty products and I am always on the lookout for products that are natural. The ingredients  in this serum do help much to retain the hydration your skin needs to keep youthful and provides you that glow and even tone throughout your face. I noticed my skin to be more plump and with a glow. I love that it doesn&#x27;t sting or feel like an acid peel. I have had no bad reactions or irritations and I use it twice a day. This serum has a very nice light citrus scent. I have red acne marks on my skin that have lighten up which makes them  a little less noticeable I will definitely stick with this serum I feel that the longer I use it the better results I will see. I definitely recommend this serum if you are looking for a serum that is age defying and has retinol but that is made  from natural derived ingredients.</li>
            <li> Smells great, absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> I really do like the InstaNatural product line. I use this in combination with the Retinol moisturizer (and even share it with my mom). She loves it because it makes the deep wrinkles soften and I really love that it absorbs quickly and makes my skin extra soft. It really is an incredible product for when you need a little something extra. It isn&#x27;t greasy like other serums and it works beautifully. It does all it promises. Five stars!</li>
            <li> I feel like after 3 weeks of nightly use I can see a difference. I have sensitive skin too and it doesn&#x27;t burn. Smells good too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks. I&#x27;ve tried a few, more expensive retinal serums and so far, I would absolutely buy this instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it and so far so good. My skin feels smoother and clearer than before. I wish this serum is a bit thicker, so that one drop, instead of two should be enough for my face. Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to endorse this product when the company request it.  Now, having used this product for several weeks I must admit that it works.  I  I tried several other similar products with minimal results.  I am 73 years old with significant wrinkles around my eyes and mouth.  The wrinkles around my eyes are all but gone.  I am sorry to report that is not true for those around the mouth.  It may take more treatments for these and only time will bare witness to this product&#x27;s success.  If you are looking for a product that removes wrinkles around your eyes, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Having worked in an executive capacity for a major cosmetic company for over 15 years I have to say I love it. Now that I am retired, this one step application is all you need for radient,firm, youthful looking skin. I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> This product reasonably priced and I am seeing results with the retinol after just a few weeks.  The serum smells lightly of oranges and absorbs immediately, and so far I am very pleased with this, and I will definitely purchase again, and I am looking forward to trying  other InstaNatural products.</li>
            <li> Just 3-4 drops would moisturize</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before purchasing, so many positive reviews. I ordered and it was delivered in a timely manner. I am in my lower 40&#x27;s and have already been complemented on my skin. Was told I was aging well and asked my secret. I did share the info with her because this is a miracle serum and why keep a good thing to myself. Share it with every woman you know. Im so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum, it does not irritate my skin, but I have noticed a change in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I used this Retinol serum for almost 3 weeks. This serum helps my face to feel firm. I had sun damage on my cheeks but from the time I started to use this serum, all my dark spots started to fade. I was really thrilled with all the improvements that happened to my face and my neck. In my opinion is better than peeling and pay $250 only to fade the sun damage and stay ugly for weeks with peeling skin all over your face. I did that before and I was looking terrible. I am very happy with all InstaNatural&#x27;s products. Really great, honest company, excellent ingredients. If you are looking for a good anti-aging product or you have dark spots, this is the one to use. A+ again for InstaNatural products and their customer service.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. Really pumps my face ,and  smooth my skin. However I do not use this everyday , I use this in the evening , every other day,  which fits for my  sensitive skin. I have co-workers, and  clients constantly  compliment on how young I  look.....:)&lt;br /&gt; I do love instanatural&#x27;s  products, they very good in price and  great ingredients. The only product I dislike is their cleanser, which it is not the product itself, but my own preference. I do not like oil in my skin. I much prefer a water soluble cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was  offered this  production with a discount  price  for review. However my opinion is honor and unbiased.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference after using it religiously!</li>
            <li> Love ths serum.A little bit goes a long way.My skin smoother and brighter.</li>
            <li> I got this item free for reviewing. It was a good product works well.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this product and try it.  When it came I was worried because the bottle seemed smaller than i thought it would, but you honestly need very little so this bottle will go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I do not have bad skin or acne, but i am always trying to make it look better. The serum to me does make my face very dry, to the point that I can only use it every 3rd day and only at night.  I even have to put a moisturizer on later at night because it gets so dry. I have normal skin so i had anticipated this happening as I have used retinol products in the past and know they can be more drying for me. I have not seen any major results yet but will report back when I do as i am sure I will.  This product is loaded with so many quality good things that I know it will benefit my skin .</li>
            <li> I have changed to this serum at night and used it for just over a month(followed by my regular night moisturiser) and to the Instanatural Vitamin C serum in the morning.  I had been using a more expensive product in a pump bottle.  This product is a ‘milky orange’ colour, presumably due to the retinol.  I use 4 drops on my face – if more the moisturiser ‘balls’.  I like the expiry data printed clearly on the bottle.  I had problems with using a dropper rather than a pump, the dropper ‘dripped’ and also I found I continued to hold the dropper, releasing product (not a problem with a pump bottle).  I live in New Zealand, and Instanatural doesn’t send directly to NZ – so order via Amazon.  Ordering a single bottle is expensive, with ordering 4 bottles, the shipping was over $25.  So, each bottle costs over $6 more than for US customers.  Bottom line – I didn’t notice any difference changing to  Instanatural serums except that I now seem to have fine ‘smokers lines’. I still want to economise on serums.  i-herb shipping is $8 for a large order, so if getting supplements anyway,  other products basically have free shipping – so will investigate what products are on offer.</li>
            <li> This stuff in amazing and smells incredible! It has the most incredible orange smell, I love it. To top it off it does what it says. My skin is noticibly brighter and more even toned. Wrinkles are smoothing out. I have been using for about 3 weeks now and love it. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and bought it because of the Retinol. I already use Vitamin A at night and thought how nice it would be to wear the retinol during the day as well (under my make-up). I like how fast if absorbs and leaves no greasy feel on my skin. It smells good too. I even mix it into my moisturizer and I&#x27;m all set. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> bought this for my mom and she already ordered another bottle!</li>
            <li> I love this serum...I love it!!!  Normally, I can not tell what a retinol serum is doing.  I just can&#x27;t see any long-term effects, but this one is different.  In the last couple of years I turned 40 and my skin went crazy.  I started using retinol serums to help with my skin and aging.  Most had little to no visible effect.  I love the Argan Oil that Instanatural sells, so I thought I would try this.  I am so in love...  My skin is beautiful and has such a healthy glow...every day...all day long!!  This is an &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t live without this&amp;#34; item for me.  Try it and it will be for you too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a good experience when I tried retinols for the first time years ago. To make a long story short, my skin was highly sensitive and hurt so bad. This product gets two thumbs up because in a month, I feel like my skin tone looks even, but I&#x27;m not peeling, nor does my skin hurt! I believe this makes my skin feel balanced because they&#x27;ve added high quality essential oils. This product was sent to me for review purposes, as always, I give an honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed a difference yet:(</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  Very pleased, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 3 weeks now and I really like it. I bought it with the hope that it would reduce some dark spots that I have on my face, but I&#x27;m not sure that it has lightened them any. I have noticed that my skin is softer and smoother since I began using this serum. I do not have many wrinkles yet, but it does seem to tighten the tiny ones around my eyes. I will probably finish this bottle and see where I am with the dark spots before deciding if I will buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my friend and she told me that is a great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this serum at a promotional price and am using it once in the morning, once at night after cleansing. I am very pleased with the results. My skin texture is smoother, with diminished appearance of fine lines. My laugh lines (and I laugh a LOT) are still there but I&#x27;ll keep those! I like that my skin feels &#x27;tighter&#x27; but not uncomfortable. My skin is thanking me!</li>
            <li> AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;The package came really fast, the serum is really thick, absorbs really well and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;I felt the difference after ONE USE! I used all types of lotions and after a few hours my skin still felt rough...&lt;br /&gt;after using this oil once, I felt my skin in the morning and it felt as soft as if I had just put some of it on..</li>
            <li> Having used this for about 3 weeks, I am happy to report that this is definitely a keeper. I use it at night after cleansing and toner. It makes the skin feel firmer and smoother.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have been using the retinol serum on my face and hands for a few weeks and have noticed improvement in my skin tone. My face &amp; hands appear brighter, age spots are lighter &amp; overall clarity is improving in my skin. This serum is a keeper &amp; will continue to be a staple in my skin care regiman.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! I have been using this for a few weeks now and I can notice a difference. I am very impressed with it, I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> This product feels great on my skin. I have only been using it about a week,  but I really like the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I have been using for a couple of weeks. But, my skin is clearing and looking radiant and bright.</li>
            <li> Works great. Noticeable difference in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I wanna say I love it but I really don&#x27;t?? When I first used it i got break out is it normal? Okay maybe because it&#x27;s new to my skin but I still got &#x27;em :( when I woke up today i saw a new pimple:(  it&#x27;s 10 days now how many days I suppose to wait?? Still didn&#x27;t see any good results...</li>
            <li> It sounds good but I still need moisturizer with it. Havn&#x27;t noticed anything different</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have used this long enough to tell if it is really going to help. I am using it for small wrinkles and light acne scarring. Also, I noticed 2 sun spots on my forehead so I am really hoping this will help with those!</li>
            <li> so far so good.. haven&#x27;t seen any real changes but haven&#x27;t used it for that long..</li>
            <li> Just received, easy to use, very affordable.</li>
            <li> Love instanaturals products! Have tried several of them and they all work great!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  I have had prescription retin A and of course this isn&#x27;t as potent yet it delivers!  In the first week I could definitely see a difference in fine lines and decrease in dullness.  I have been using for about 2 1/2 weeks and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this serum. It has made my skin texture better. My dark spots are way lighter only in 1week use and also my skin tone has improved.&lt;br /&gt;However, i would recommend for sensitive/dried parts of the face to be using carefully but still its great serum and does not stick on face. I think its a great substitute of 100$ expensive serums which have same ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO IF YOU HAVE DONE THE SENSITIVITY TEST AND WEAR ENOUGH SPF AND DONT BREAK OUT I 100% RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a major use for retinol yet but I know starting a regimen with it younger is best. I saw some more resilence with my skin and found the product went on incredibly smooth. Very quick to dry as well.</li>
            <li> I always love InstaNatural&#x27;s products. They are perfect for my sensitive skin. I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> If you only read the first line of my review : BUY THIS SERUM!&lt;br /&gt;I am ridiculously in love with this product! As a self proclaimed beauty product junkie, I search the globe, scour blogs, and go out of my way to find the best skin care and beauty products around. I particularly enjoy finding small companies that no one knows about, or cult favorites from far reaching areas of the globe. With my love for the chase, I very rarely settle down, and add a product permanently to my beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;This retinol serum is a huge exception to the rule. Since beginning to use this almost a month ago, my skin is beautiful! I am a white female in my early 30s with HUGE pores and moderate acne issues. I wouldn&#x27;t say I have sensitive skin, but I definitely have to be mindful of the products I use, as many things break me out. With this retinol serum, my skin is glowing! I only use this in the morning. I put two drops on my finger tip, dab it in a few places around my face, then rub it in using a circular motion. Its orange is color, smells like oranges, and soaks into the skin very quickly. My skin is now brighter, more even tone, my pores are still huge, but they are clear and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I am the go to beauty advice guru for all of my friends and family, and I have been recommending this to everyone who asks! I absolutely love it, and will certainly buying more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> OMG, I am seriously loving this!! Idk if it&#x27;s this alone, or the combo of my skin products in my routine but my skin has just been glowing and soft and moisturized ever since I started using this twice a day. Love it.</li>
            <li> Based on the wonderful reviews, I decided to give this a shot. I literally saw results on the first use. I thought it was temporary but I have been using it for almost a month now, only at night, and continue to be impressed. I used this on my fine lines and age spots. While I haven&#x27;t seen a change to the age spots (I would like to give it more time to work) I&#x27;ve seen a huge change in my lines. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I received this at a great discount to review. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks and still no change. I&#x27;ll wait to see what happens when I finish the bottle. The packaging is nice and it smells fine no weird odor and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I think there has been an improvement in my skin tone with this product. My brow lines were not deep but I would say I even see an improvement there.</li>
            <li> Good Item. Nice Price.</li>
            <li> I Love my Line if InstaNaturals I got.  I especially love the Retinol Eye Serum, I will be purchasing again... Thank you..</li>
            <li> This definitely makes my skin much smoother..I use this in the morning and the evening..no side effects and it does not make my oily skin more oily</li>
            <li> very nice product. goes on well, can feel a tightening after smoothing on. good pricing</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6-8 months and I really like it. I am 52 years old and I&#x27;ve tried several other high dollar products and It works just as well or better for half the cost.... Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice citrus smell.  I like the serum very much.  I was blessed with good skin and this product is just perfect for it</li>
            <li> Smells and feels good. Works great</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks.  I have noticed a reduction in visible small lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I am 48 years old and have gotten a lot of compliments on my skin since I have been using this along with washing my face with Vitamin C Facial cleanser. Highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Did what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> Very good! Products works just like i need it to! I will buy again</li>
            <li> wonderful serum that is quality made and works well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and my skin feels great! I use it twice a day, morning and night. It has a wonderful orange scent, goes on easily and my skin feels silky soft afterward. (Note: it does feel tacky as it dries, but that only lasts about 30 seconds.) I love that it&#x27;s all natural and smells amazing. For anti-aging products you need to give them six months, that&#x27;s the amount of time it takes for complete cell turnover in your skin (sloughing off the old cells) and to see ultimate results. I&#x27;ll update this review in five months on the final results. But so far, I love it.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the retinol serum. I have tried many products and none have worked.  I feel this serum is effective and it has made a significant difference in the feel and look of my face.</li>
            <li> A company that gives a great product at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;I use more expensive lines that don&#x27;t exceed this product&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome.  It works better than expected and now my daughter is using it too.  It has cleared up her complexion like nothing else ever has.</li>
            <li> It does feel good on the skin. wrinkles are still there.</li>
            <li> I am half way through with my first 1-oz. bottle of Insta Natural Retinol serum.  I can tell that it has helped my skin some; it&#x27;s just going to take awhile; I am 66 years old.  My face is not in horrible condition, but I do want to get rid of fine lines &amp; wrinkles around my mouth.  I have also recently ordered a 2-oz. supply of Hyaluronic Acid serum from Insta Natural--a great deal through Amazon.  I expect to receive it today or tomorrow.  Not sure which serum will help the most, but I won&#x27;t use the two serums at the same time.  I&#x27;m hoping for very good results eventually!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;66-year old</li>
            <li> I have not been using this long enough to tell a difference yet. I do like it a lot so far. Have not experienced any redness or irritation like some retinol products.</li>
            <li> Retinol Serum is a product I will purchase again.  I consider it a concentrated version of the retinol moisturizer cream.  The fine lines that Father Time seems to leave with us gradually fade or diminish and the skin takes on a smoother appearance.  If your skin is sensitive or sun intolerant, applying a moisturizing cream or lotion after the serum dries is helpful.</li>
            <li> i am a breast cancer patient and the chemo therapy really made my skin dry and wrinkled specially around my eyes.After 1 week of using this InstaNatural Retinol serum,I noticed the gradual disappearance of my wrinkles.My skin feels nice and soft.I ordered the Antiaging facial Moisturizer also but i have not use it yet.I will surely post my response to the moisturizer when I start using it.Thank you for this product.It saved me money for I had been ordering expensive ones that did not do a thing to my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this serum, it is packed with antioxidants and it&#x27;s easily absorbed by skin. I need to use a moisturizer after it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister to try because I have loved all the Instanatural products I&#x27;ve gotten in the past. She loves it - she is a little older than me and complains sometimes about the texture and tone of her skin.&lt;br /&gt;According to her, it&#x27;s lightweight and has an amazing texture when it goes on- not greasy or heavy like some brands. After a few weeks of using it she can tell a difference in the look and feel of her face. I can see that the bags under her eyes are less noticeable and her skin looks better but don&#x27;t tell her I said that.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ve made her a believer in the brand because she wants to try some of their other products now. They have a better price tag than the high end drug store brand she was considering before I talked her into trying this. Since you get a discount for purchasing more than 1 product at a time, it&#x27;s a great discount combined with free prime shipping!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I lIke the Product feels great on my face and a Little does go a long way keep up the good job Thank You :-) &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am 47 and I&#x27;ve never had any &#x27;work done&#x27;, not even botox.  I&#x27;ve done a good job of using sunscreen over the years and stayed out of tanning beds.  Even so, I wanted to try some of the newer products before considering something more &#x27;drastic&#x27;.  I&#x27;ve been using InstaNatural Retinol Serum and a Hyaluronic Acid for about 30 days and I can honestly say I can tell a difference in the fine lines and the softness of my skin.  I just ordered my second bottle.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Very nice product. I use it in combination with the YouthExpress Eye Gel by the same company and I am very happy with the results. I actually use it on my entire face/neck under my day or night cream. My skin is very sensitive and prone to outbrakes but I have no problems using these products. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Makes me skin so soft - haven&#x27;t noticed the difference yet but I&#x27;m sure will in time.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such an amazing serum</li>
            <li> Best Serum I have ever used. And it took less than two months to get exactly the results I was looking for</li>
            <li> Purchased for my sister who has problem skin and the following review is her story: Normally a product containing 2.5% Retinol serum would be way too strong for my skin to handle and I would be red, peeling and inflamed after just one use, but this is a very well-balanced out product.  The Argon oil and CoQ 10 are extremely soothing, and the niacinamide, which has been proven to be very effective against rosacea, acne, and possibly even acne scars, let alone wrinkles, all seem to work together to negate any negative effects the strength of the retinol may have against irritating my skin.  I&#x27;m sure the addition of the hyaluronic acid also helps allow the additional hydration of the skin keep away the redness and flakiness that such a strong retinol would normally cause.  So in the end you get the best of all worlds; very effective wrinkle reduction and reduced hyperpigmentation from the high-dose retinol, the soothing anti-acne/anti-rosacea properties of the niacinamide, moisturizing of the argon oil and hyaluronic acid,  the antioxidant effects of the CoQ10 and green tea, and all the other ingredients that I have not listed. For me personally, this is the exact combination I need.  I&#x27;m at that unfortunate stage in life where I&#x27;m developing my wrinkles while still fighting acne.  And not just the slight, new lines around my eyes that one would consider cute, and the occasional little bump that could be hidden with concealer, but actual real crows feet, deep lines between the brows, and problematic acne in the T-zone as well as both cheeks.  To be able to treat both my acne and my wrinkles with one product is nothing short of a miracle.  I almost wish I had the guts to treat one side of my face and not the other so that I could post pictures to show how effective the product really is, but I&#x27;m only willing to go so far for the sake of an Amazon review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I was just rubbing tangerine scented water into my face. No change whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product! Am 60 years old, have been using it since January, and really can tell the difference. Bought the serum, eye gel and face lotion for my sister, who is also using and loving it. Is extremely affordable!! Absolutely love it and will continue to use. Lasts forever!</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and I noticed that my lines are diminishing, I have always wanted to get botox, but even after a week using this stuff, I can tell I won&#x27;t need to. It&#x27;s a great product and I have used clinique, Este lauder and lancome for years, spending hundreds of dollars. This product is better than anything I have ever used and it is inexpensive. Truly grateful</li>
            <li> This is a nice, light serum that absorbs well and has ingredients that are clinically proven to help wth various skin issues.  Wears nicely under makeup.</li>
            <li> I like it!  I have used it for a couple weeks and have not experienced any irritation.  It has a pleasant odor.</li>
            <li> This product stated clearing up my dark spits really Quick</li>
            <li> Using it nightly with no issues to my fairly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Loving this serum for my face. I have acne prone areas around my jaw line and this stuff has mimimized breakouts.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have particularly high hopes when ordering this serum, but was pleasantly surprised with how effective this product is in getting rid of age spots on my face and hands. I love how quickly it absorbs into my skin. I&#x27;m  very pleased with the excellent performance of this serum and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> Seller was great...just trying the product now...so far I like it</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use in conjunction with my daily moisturizer/ uv protestant. Slight citrus aroma, not sticky or greasy. My daughter even told me I didn&#x27;t need foundation and that my skin was &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34;.That is proof of its results for me!</li>
            <li> As soon as the Product arrive I tried it. The sensation was fine at first but the problem came when I put it on my skin. It&#x27;s like my face had became&lt;br /&gt;cardboard, I could not smile or move my face  naturally. So, obviously  it was very unpleasant, disagreeable. Moreover, it seemed sticky or something like that and with no positive result on my face at all.&lt;br /&gt; My feedback is not positive at all. could you tell me how I can give you back the product and benefit of your guarantee satisfied or money back.hing like and I didn&#x27;t use a lot of product. I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nota : Nothing to say about communication and advice  Theses were great.</li>
            <li> This product absorbs instantly into the skin.  There is absolutely no greasiness and it has not broken me out at all.  It only takes a drop or two for my face so the product is lasting.  I will absolutely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product for review.  *sighs* where to start? I&#x27;ll try to be brief.  I didn&#x27;t like this product because of the effect it had on my skin - same thing can be said about the moisturizer as well.  The formula was a bit runnier than other serums I&#x27;ve used in the past, but it smelled wonderful and didn&#x27;t tingle at all.  However, within the first week, I broke out &#x3D;0(. I was afraid to use it again, but chugged along because sometimes my skin will break out when I try something new, but these didn&#x27;t go away.  I still have some breakouts around my forehead, but because I&#x27;ve been using their mask, it&#x27;s helped so much.  I have also started using some other products that have been extremely helpful (from the same folks) so I&#x27;m stoked about that.  Ugh...I wanted to love this so badly because I really do like the company, but I have to be honest when something doesn&#x27;t work. Maybe next time...</li>
            <li> The serum is great. Has a light citrusy smell, that is energizing. its not sticky and dries quickly for makeup application. I also notice an improvement in my skin after a week, its glowing almost. Def would recommend.</li>
            <li> This product has exceeded my expectations. I have used many retinol products and this is by far the best i have tried. Hyperpigmentation is improving and overall tone. I will definately be reordering this product</li>
            <li> The highest retinal I have found out there! Feels great on my skin and absorbs well leaving skin feeling moisturizers and silky. Will definitely keep using... On second bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mum and she likes it!</li>
            <li> Would have liked o know that it has a floral odor or scent, or a mix of floral and orange.  I prefer orderless.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not BAD, it just isn&#x27;t orderless.</li>
            <li> Great function, cost less! Good choice!</li>
            <li> I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PROUDUCT AND EYE GEL FOR ALL 4 OF MY SISTERS AND THEY HAVE THANKED ME CONSTANLY IM SO HAPPY I FOUND THESE PROUDUCTS 5 STAR AND I DONT GIVE THAT RATING EASY!!!</li>
            <li> noticed smoother skin within 1 week...love this!</li>
            <li> This product delivers! I have received compliments on my skin and have seen a marked reduction of fine lines. My skin is brighter and looks healthier!</li>
            <li> Made my face break out so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Tried a couple of this type serums and this one may actually be working. Got two age spots that seem to be lightening and a blood blister that&#x27;s been on my lip for years that seems to be shrinking.  This serum is easy to apply and is non greasy and doesn&#x27;t haze my vision like some of the others.</li>
            <li> I am certainly enjoying this product. I&#x27;ve used the serum along with the InstaNatural Retinol Moisturizer and though I have only used it for about 3 weeks, my skin is brighter and my lines  are diminished. I&#x27;ve also received compliments which I really did not expect. The serum goes on well under makeup and has a pleasant smell of oranges. It&#x27;s not oily at all.  So far I have totally enjoyed the InstaNatural line of products.  The customer service is excellent and very personal as well! Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the one and only product I have ever tried that really works. Co-workers started asking what I was using. The wrinkles are disappearing. I am 60 years old. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful with retinol due to my skin.  I was a little nervous but thought I&#x27;d try it out to see how it worked on my skin.  So far I haven&#x27;t seen any vast differences BUT I am happy that I have had no problems using it on my skin which is a HUGE plus!&lt;br /&gt;So far I really like it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results.  I do not use it daily.</li>
            <li> retinol products are very important to exfoliate dead skin and let the younger skin be on surface.. I started to use instanatural retinol serum a week ago daily at night.. All I have to say is the amazing result I notice on my face.. I apply few drops of Insatnatural retinol serum along with my night cream and Voila ! I wake up the second day with the smoothest silky skin ! I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> SHOULD NOT HAVE EXPECTED MIRACLES.</li>
            <li> Use it daily and found that I have experienced firming on a continuing basis.</li>
            <li> Best Stuff! It really glows my skin.</li>
            <li> I am totally GLOWING!!! and it smell nice. I use it twice a day (daytime and at night)</li>
            <li> hi I am still in the process of trying  your product that your letting try for free for my review. I love anything that will help with the wrinkles around my eyes in the bags. So I will write another review in the next couple weeks thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used products with Retinol in them for years, as well as various other products containing hyaluronic acid, and Vitamins C and E.  But I&#x27;ve never used one product that had ALL these in it.  I was thrilled to purchase at a promotional price in order to evaluate it and share my opinion.  I&#x27;ve used this serum for a couple of weeks, and am totally satisfied with the results I&#x27;m seeing.  My skin is soft, and I&#x27;m not experiencing any breakouts.  I have not noticed any flushing or redness.  I let my skin dry completely (20 to 30 minutes) after washing, before I apply the serum.  After my skin absorbs the serum, I apply my usual moisturizer/sunscreen.</li>
            <li> excellente product. I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> works great, quick results. did not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few weeks now.  A little goes a long way.  I really like the variety of strong antioxidants and natural ingredients in this product.  The serum goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, smells great (light and citrusy), makes my skin feel softer and more radiant.</li>
            <li> Love this serum! It&#x27;s my new favorite!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this almost daily as part of my morning routine. I am on my second bottle and I am still closely monitoring the effects.  I have noticed my skin is softer, particularly below my eyes where my cheeks begin. I absolutely do like the product.</li>
            <li> I have been washing with raw honey and then using the Retinol serum for a few weeks and my complexion has improved drastically. My face isn&#x27;t covered in angry red pimples anymore. It helped to dry out existing acne and fix any scar discoloration. It is also pretty hydrating so I don&#x27;t need to wear a moisturizer at night. I will definitely be reordering.</li>
            <li> I can say that this product really did it&#x27;s job of instantly tightening the skin around my eyes and fading/preventing hyperpigmentation from acne scars. But it failed to lighten my upper lip melasma. Maybe it needs to be used in junction with a derma roller to really penetrate the skin.</li>
            <li> This is an update to my previous review posted shortly after purchasing the Retinol serum.  I have now been using this for 2 months, and I am absolutely amazed at the difference in my skin.  No longer do I have that baggy under-eye look.  my skin is so smooth now. I use this 2x a day, during my morning routine &amp; again at night before my moisturizer.  A little bit goes a long way, and what a difference it makes!  If you are on the fence with ordering this product, give it a try! For me, it was a gradual difference, not immediate. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other InstaNatural products and have been very pleased with them. This one hasn&#x27;t dissapointed me yet. I like the smell of it. A little goes a long way. My skin looks great after using it. I use it in the evening after washing my face followed by the retinol moisturizer. If you are looking for a good retinol serum you&#x27;ll be very happy with this one.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple weeks and my skin feels like it&#x27;s glowing and looking fresh. This retinol serum is just what I needed to get me out of the winter slump. I apply this product every night before bed and I have had no problems with it causing breakouts or anything. I have found that this item makes my skin feel so great the next morning.</li>
            <li> Irritated my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am very excited with the results I am seeing in only 2ish weeks of using!  The smell is very yummy too!  I imagine that it will last quite a while because I use about 6 drops for my very dry face.  I cannot wait to try more of their products!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this serum because I have been trying to improve my skin&#x27;s health. I am only 25 but, after years of playing softball and long summers of swimming, I have fine lines around my eyes and forehead from squinting at the sun. I wasn&#x27;t too sure what to expect but the results I have seen have been nothing but positive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that I always do when trying a new product is smell it. This smells citrusy and is very pleasant. If you&#x27;re worried about it lingering or being too strong, you should know that it fades quickly and is not overpowering.  I applied this after getting out of the shower and noticed that it did make my skin a little flushed and tingly. I have super sensitive skin and it was nothing that alarmed me. My skin was not use to this type of product and it quickly adjusted and I had no problems after one week. I applied it at night so it faded by morning. This will make your skin feel very tight. That means it&#x27;s working! That is what it is supposed to do. If for some reason your skin feels too tight, apply a light moisturizer and it should subside. It has definitely helped my skins health and after a month I can tell a huge change in the tightness around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;*I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> Great product ,fast delivery</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my sister to send it to another country, she is happy and 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a really good serum I am on my second bottle and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Could not expect more, especially for the price. I have noticed that with the other products in this line that the skin is definitely looking better and I was good about using some very expensive products.  Almost 60 and although I have some health problems, I saw a new doctor who looked twice at my paperwork and commented that I looked much younger than my age when he was going over my overall health summary. (no I have never had botox or similar product used on me)</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Retinol Serum plus Astaxanthin - InstaNatural is becoming a household name around here and my family is reaping the benefits as I let my sisters try EVERYTHING!! We have been using InstaNatural skin care line this past year as I switched over to all natural products.  I had not tried the Retinol and being in my 50&#x27;s I&#x27;ll take all the help I can get! I did notice a difference in my skin texture after a few weeks as old skin sloughed off and new finer pored skin emerged.  I plan on continuing to use the Retinol as a regular part of my daily - weekly skin care program. Thanks to getting it on a promo to try and review I can say I will be replacing this as soon as I get low.  Good regular price for a lot of product and don&#x27;t forget a little bit does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the results from using this product.  My skin does look more youthful and brighter. The only downside is the bottle is rather small. Not sure if I&#x27;d order it again. Can get costly</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful! Seems to work well on my forehead wrinkles</li>
            <li> Its smell good and it feel great on my skin</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  I am a 58 year old Afican American woman is sensitive oily skin.  Until recently, I had monthly professional facials which cost about $125.  I get the same results with this serum.</li>
            <li> I actually have several of InstaNatural&#x27;s products and have been happy with them all.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!  A llightweight serum that cleared my skin almost like magic. My skin texture is much nicer, and I have a glow even without makeup.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum. It truly seems to be doing what retinol is supposed to do, that is increase cell turn over. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see real results on my fine lines yet but hopefully at the very least, it will stave off any further lines for a while.  I do think I may be using it too often, as my face has become a bit dry. I may try it every other night and also find a better moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin feels wonderful!  You may get a little red and flaky, but that goes away. If it is too noticeable or bothersome, cut down the use to a few times a week instead of every day. The redness will go away. I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle. I ordered more yesterday.Your skin will feel a little tighter and softer. This will also diminish pores.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen the a difference yet.</li>
            <li> I was waiting to see results before I posted any reviews.  I was scared to use this serum because its Retinol however. I&#x27;m happy I did. My pores are smaller and my skin looks resilient. I have also purchased other products from InstaNatural because of the results I got from this serum.  I only use it once at nights only, no sensitivity which is great.</li>
            <li> I love it. But be sure to screw the top on.  Since it is a squeeze top, I never twisted the top on - I knocked it over and the entire bottle spilled.</li>
            <li> Very nice serum.  InstaNatural products are awesome. I use this serum in the morning and at night and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  Love it!  It has retinol and vitamin C which gives it dual purpose!  The company sends follow up emails to be sure you are happy with their product and offers suggestions on the best way to use it. Delivery was fast and item was well packaged.  Great service!</li>
            <li> So far so good, need more time...</li>
            <li> Smells really nice and feels refreshing/toning but I can&#x27;t say I noticed a difference in wrinkle or dark spot reduction.</li>
            <li> This product works amazing!!! I was using Roc (which is also a good product) but i love this because of the vitamin C and hydrolyonic acid It really works clarifying your skin and reducing wrinkles, VERY SATIFIED with product! On my second bottle!</li>
            <li> No issues, arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> Love it!  My skin looks smooth and healthy!</li>
            <li> This serum is effective especially after I use my micro-needling instrument. I have noticed that my face is fuller and my wrinkles are less visible. I love the scent. It&#x27;s rejuvenating.  My moisturizer is way more effective after using this serum. I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Good product and pricing</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell, but it doesn&#x27;t overly dry, yet seems to be working on some brown spots. Has a pleasant orange smell. Dries clean, so you can add whatever moisturizer you want.</li>
            <li> this product is as good as some other serums many times the cost.  just bought a $300 serum that says it has human  stem cells and it is not half as good!!  save your money and go with this brand.</li>
            <li> I had juvederm last summer, and of course, tgecrests dwindled over time. This serum has given me the same results for much, much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it because it features the key ingredients if my favorite Rodan and Fields products for a much lower price. I am very pleased! For the price, it is worth the chance; I&#x27;d recommend it it anyone.</li>
            <li> To preface this entire review, I was using the Skinceuticals Vitamin C serum, and it&#x27;s over 100 bucks, so this was a serious step down in terms of price.  I was REALLY hoping that the quality would be there and that I would get that tightening feeling, smaller pore appearance and overall glow that the Skinceuticals product provided, but it&#x27;s just not there.  I haven&#x27;t seen any real difference in my facial skin, and I am using it faithfully on a daily basis for the past 2 weeks.  For the price, I also decided to use this product on my neck and décolletage, and I am noticing a slight difference there.  This is only the second Vitamin C product I&#x27;ve ever used, so I am giving it an OK--it didn&#x27;t cause a breakout, it smells good, and I am noticing a slight difference on my neck...hopefully this review helps</li>
            <li> I can feel my face feel better right away. Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I cannot say that this has done what it claims to do. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is good and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It works. I love the product and its slightly orange-y smell.  Use it at night. After one month I really do look better. People notice.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! I use the serum with a derma roller, as well as during the day, and have seen fantastic results!! My skin is so much tighter, brighter, firmer and it has changed my entire face! I hated my smile lines and was told it was from fat loss and couldn&#x27;t be helped much but they are literally gone! I would say the results are probably in conjunction with the derma roller though so I would recommend getting both! I will definitely continue getting this product!</li>
            <li> Better than they have at my plastic surgeons office</li>
            <li> I actually think; it has made my lines above nose  less noticeable.  I don&#x27;t think it is wishful thinking.  It smells nice and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Smells great, like orange. Absorbs easily. Makes a noticeable difference!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product!!! I mainly use it under my makeup and it gives my skin a beautiful glow. When I want to go out without makeup on, I&#x27;m always complimented by how great my skin look. Best of all, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it. Only a few drops is enough and it last a long time! As you&#x27;ve probably noticed in my previous emails, I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; person. I don&#x27;t really care for products that have weird smells. Even if its a good product, if the smell is bad, it will keep me from purchasing the product again. However, this product smells so refreshing. I can put this on and make a run to the grocery store without having to worry about smelling awkward.</li>
            <li> I held off to review this product until I had used it for a few months. The reason I purchased it was because I was dealing with adult acne around my mouth and chin over a lengthy period of time. I had tried different make-up and sensitive skin soap/ face lotion products. Nothing seemed to help. I used this serum day and night for the first 2 months. At first I really enjoyed how firm it made my skin feel and it seemed to help the acne a little bit. I am now finishing up my third bottle and now only use it in the morning because my face has completely cleared up. I get the odd little pimple, but nothing like the mess and irritation I experienced before. I was also bad at picking at my face and this product has done a wonderful job reducing my blemish scars. Definitely recommend! On a side note - I like a company that personally e-mails to give me specific instructions and inquires about my satisfaction with the product. Great product and company.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this serum.  My skin looks better than it ever has.  Combined with the day and night lotion and I&#x27;m glowing !</li>
            <li> I am a retinol 2.5% fan and I am a InstaNatural fan so this was a no-brainer for me. Having used retinol products before, I can tell you you will not see immediate results but the results will come with continued use. My skin has smoothed out incredibly well and I have a dewy glow (and that is no exaggeration).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vitamin C is a nice touch but I would&#x27;ve been just as happy without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SETAF provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
            <li> Absorbs fast! Love it.</li>
            <li> This product is great!</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  The first week was fantastic--I thought it tightened up my skin amazingly and for someone who is 70 that is saying something.  After 2 or so weeks I started to get some reddened areas which I realized was because I was too liberal with the application--and like I mentioned, I have very fair thin freckly 70 year old skin so I stopped for several days and have now backed off a little on the amount I use and everything is back on course.  My skin feels so smooth.  I let it dry for a minute or two after appllying and then add moisturizer.  I will definitely reorder when this runs out.</li>
            <li> Not impressed, saw no difference in my facial complexion.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, has really helped my skin around my eyes look younger</li>
            <li> Very good, but you can&#x27;t go at the sun when you are using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a few weeks and my skin looks brighter and feels smoother.  I love the smell and how the product sinks into my skin and then slowly tightens it.  I have not had any peeling like I experienced with other retinol products.  I highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li> I, absolutely, love this product. I&#x27;m so happy to have found it!</li>
            <li> I am always on a quest to find a good skin repairing regiment to help with the Dry and Rough skin. I have been testing out products from Instanatural due to the natural ingredients that they use. I feel more comfortable using safer products on my skin.  I came across a bottle of Age-Defying Retinol Serum. What attracted me to this product is that it’s suppose to not only help repair your skin it also stimulate new healthy skin. Which is exactly what I am looking for. After one use my skin was softer I didn’t feel that roughness. My overall appearance was good because of the moisture and my skin felt tighter.  The actual product is not sticky and it does adsorb quickly. It didn’t have that flakiness once it was dry. Some moisturizer then to dry flaky leaving an appearance of a thin whitish film, I didn’t have that with this product, the scent is refreshing and soothing. A little drop goes a long way! It definitely gave me results and I saw improvement after just one use.</li>
            <li> I really like to use beauty serums on my facial skin.  The all do such wonderful things to help keep my skin dew and fresh looking. Retinol Serum is one of my go to products as nothing is better than retinol to smooth out the edges.  This serum is jam packed with Vitamin C as well as Hyaluronic Acid which by the way is wonderful on it&#x27;s own let alone used in conjunction with Retinol and Vitamin C.  The serum goes on right after I wash my face in the morning, it is not tacky and absorbs fairly quickly.  I give all products that I put on my skin about 3 minutes to absorb fully before going to any next steps.  I also use an additional moisturizer with sun screen as well.  No problems wearing it under my make up.  I would recommend this product and I was happy to receive the product for my 100% honest opinion.  It works well for me.  I see that my fine lines and wrinkles are much smoother and my overall skin tone feels tighter and brighter.</li>
            <li> great product.  Seems to work very well.  Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> First, this product smell so good ! Smells like orange very refreshing ! I just got it a week ago, I&#x27;m using it evey night before go to bed mostly on my neck. I have notice my neck feels so smooth and a little tighter. I love it so far.  I&#x27;m gonna keep using it and hopefully this can reduce the rings I have on my neck.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little under a month and feel like this in combination with the Vitamin C serum is improving my skin on my face and will continuing using this product!</li>
            <li> Love the way it&#x27;s smoothing my skin and helping my aging face and neck! My skin soaks it up and you only need a little! Deep \\&quot;smile\\&quot; lines are disappearing, under eye lines and frown lines too! I don&#x27;t even need blush anymore! My  skin is getting more youthful! That&#x27;s definitely something to smile about! This is a brand you can trust! I can&#x27;t wait to try all of their items!</li>
            <li> I am always on the hunt for the best products! I was looking for a product to help with my sagging skin. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet. Within two days of using it, I can see that the skin around my jawline has tighten up and there&#x27;s definition in my cheeks. Then I saw that you can use it around you eyes. I tried that last night and this morning noticed that the dark circles are slowing diminishing. I love this product! It does exactly what it claims. Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it. I am definitely happy I recieved this product to review!</li>
            <li> This is a healthy product that is for the face, neck and hands. It is one that you have to squeeze out and half a syringe is all you need. It has a nice smell of vit c. This is a great one to have for fighting and helping with the anti aging process. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! I can tell my skin looking like it is having a glow from this product.</li>
            <li> This Retinol Serum is an amazing product. It absorbs into my skin quickly and does not feel heavy or greasy. It has a light and wonderful scent that reminds me of citrus. This serum goes on easily with the dropper! My skin feels healthier and brighter after using it for only two weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased the vitamin C and hyaluronic acid serum and am very happy with it - so far. I think it is the best serum so far so I decided to shop for more instanatural products. This one concerns me. Niacinamide is a &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34; molecule which is stable at higher pH. Vitamin C (or the stable phosphate salt derivative used here) is stable at pH 3-7 (L-ascorbic acid stability pH is 3.5-5.0). Mixing the 2 - as in this serum - will quickly oxidise the vitamin C and render the Niacinamide, nicotinic acid. Oxidised vitamin C is pro-oxidant and nicotinic acid is an inactive irritant. Therefore, I&#x27;m hesitant of this serum.</li>
            <li> This serum has a very pleasant citrus aroma and a nice fluid consistency. The more I use it, the happier my skin looks. At the age of 60, my face has gained some wrinkles and drooping, and I do see some improvement in the short time I&#x27;ve been using the InstaNatural Retinol Serum (about 2 weeks).  Between my age, long work hours and some medical issues/treatments my skin has had a lot to deal with and I&#x27;m very pleased with the effects of this serum.  Dark spots seem to be fading and the deepest wrinkles are less noticeable. Some mornings when I wake up and look in the mirror I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised - my face seems a little brighter and less tired than usual. I haven&#x27;t had any negative issues with breakouts (which have sometimes been a problem in the past) or sun exposure.  I started using Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair SPF 30 as a moisturizer around the same time I began using this serum (may help with sun exposure), and I&#x27;m happy with the regimen.  I also use Watts Beauty Moisturizing Serum which seems to be especially effective for under-eye circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the InstaNatural serum morning and night, and it absorbs quickly so that other products (moisturizer and makeup) can be applied soon after with no problem.  Other reasons that fed into my decision to purchase this, besides the high ratings, were that it&#x27;s made in the USA and cruelty free. And the price is very reasonable for a product of this quality!</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> Although I have not been using the serum very long I have seen a softening in some deeper forehead wrinkles.  I will keep using this and hope to keep seeing improvement.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: compensation for this review was in the form of the Retinol Serum via Brandbacker &amp; InstaNatural, but opinions are all mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The retinol serum had a citrus smell, but I eventually got over it. And tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have rather sensitive skin- but it&#x27;s clear (I&#x27;ve never had an issue with acne or anything like that- and yes, I know I&#x27;m lucky), so I listened to the bottle. With Retinols, you have to go slow in order to prevent dryness, skin sensitivities, and the like. I use the serum at night, every night. Over a period of a week, I noticed that I was starting to break out. I figured it was because of the serum, so I decreased the usage to every other night. It didn&#x27;t work. So I tried every three nights. My face was still breaking out, and I was starting to realized that my upper cheeks were raw- something I&#x27;d never encountered with a skincare item before. Sure if the weather had been blistering cold and windy the entire time I was using it, I could have blamed my rawness and super sensitivity on that. I didn&#x27;t want to blame it on the product. Trust me.</li>
            <li> My skin feels tight and wrinkle free. The serum absorbs fast. The dropper makes it easy to apply and not use too much. It perks your skin up nicely. I don&#x27;t notice a smell to it so it&#x27;s perfect for using at night or in the morning. It&#x27;s even done wonders for my complexion, I feel like my pores are super clean!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product , will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> This serum contains 2.5% retinol, 20% Vitamin C and 10% Hyaluronic Acid. Trust me you do not want to use a hyaluronic or Vitamin C serum without Retinol. It makes such a difference. This will instantly make your skin feel tighter. I didn&#x27;t have any breakouts when using it.(Now that I&#x27;ve gotten lazy and haven&#x27;t been using anything my skins a mess). This makes my skin firmer, clearer, brighter. I do not have noticable wrinkles, but from other reviews I&#x27;ve read this product is great for prevention of wrinkles as well as for existing wrinkles. I love Insta Natural products if you don&#x27;t already know!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure how these other ppl had results like they&#x27;re saying they did, but I didn&#x27;t notice a bit of any change.&lt;br /&gt;  I opened it infront of a friend, smelled it, we both agreed it smelled like I just opened a jug of tropicana grapefruit juice, even has a foggy appearance to it like grapefruit juice....look at the label, there&#x27;s grapefruit juice in it, I say &amp;#34;hell with it&amp;#34; and take a swig, low and behold-grapefruit juice. I bought a $23 one ounce bottle of grapefruit juice! Seriously-go to the supermarket and smear grapefruit juice across your face, it will save you money!</li>
            <li> The serum is what I expected, but directions on the bottle are really, really small... you almost need a magnifying glass to read them.</li>
            <li> When I applied this to my skin, I noticed a slight tingle, and redness where all of my blemishes were. Surprisingly this hydrating formula simultaneously works to soften blemishes, clear pores and remove dirt, grime and dead facial skin with a wondrous combination of Witch Hazel, Salicylic Acid and Glycolic Acid. Although it extracted dirt from my pores, it did not overly dry out my face. Definitely worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received free for review purposes</li>
            <li> This product I used for a straight week and a half, thought I would notice some peeling from the retinol but didn&#x27;t. My problem is that I try so many products at the same time, when I do notice a difference, I&#x27;m not sure which one it was😝</li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely, not greasy or smelly - noticed a difference immediately!</li>
            <li> I like using this with the retinol cream. You can&#x27;t have enough retinol, right? Dark circles are also a huge issue I have and this really helps me out a lot! I always seem to have a hard time sleeping, so that&#x27;s why I get my dark circles. This really helps with them and I&amp;#34;m glad I was able to review this for InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> very nice . my skin is renewed</li>
            <li> Delicate texture that can be used alone or mix with cream.  Not harsh and I have sensitive skin.  Holds moisture in my skin.  Skin tone and texture  getting smoother. Don&#x27;t need a lot of it so should last a while.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I will reorder</li>
            <li> I really like this.  Makes my skin feel really good.</li>
            <li> This product is great! After about a week I noticed my moisturizer was actually being absorbed into my face again. At my age, that hasn&#x27;t happened for a long time. My skin is smoother and less fine lines. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Really love this product works great</li>
            <li> Feel the wrinkles leaving with this. Goes on smooth and easy. Your skin feels so soft and tight. I apply it morning and night to get the best effects of this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little confused about the color of this serum. The picture shows that it is like a white color and the item I received is orange. Can someone help me</li>
            <li> Love this Stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;I had parentheses around my mouth, they are just about non-existent, skin glows, I&#x27;m 48 and Fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Instanatural:)</li>
            <li> The serum was sticky, and made my face uncomfortable when I put it on.  Had a nice smell, but overall I only used this 2 times and replaced it already with a different product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products from InstaNatural and I have to say, this one is one of my favorites. I use it daily and have been seeing noticeable results. I have wrinkles that I&#x27;m trying to get rid of, and I can see a big difference. The lines aren&#x27;t as prominent and I feel like I have healthier skin. My skin feels like it&#x27;s in much better condition, and I feel a lot younger.</li>
            <li> seems to tighten skin - don&#x27;t know if the retinol is the strength that is stated or if my skin is just adjusted to retinol from using Neutrogena retinol - thought this retinol would be stronger than Neutrogena, but don&#x27;t know - like the product for the vitamin c</li>
            <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;Like homemade Botox&lt;br /&gt;No do not recommend for sensitive skin though&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.facebook.com/TheOneLifetoLiveNaturalist.health</li>
            <li> I am 34, ops, 35 years old with normal skin and wrinkles around eyes that get really noticeable when I smile. I did some reading and there are few things that can slow down wrinkles progress and some of them are botox and retinol. I choose retinol any day.&lt;br /&gt;This retinol smells lovely, like delicate orange and it is orange in color. It spreads nicely on the face (I put it all over face and neck). Soon after it dries skin fells little tight, but not too much, not uncomfortable. Then my wrinkles are very not visible. I like this because of good, natural ingredients, because it feels good and because I know it helps my skin fight years...I don&#x27;t think this is a magical wrinkle eraser, but I don&#x27;t think that there is such thing anyways..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at night for a few weeks and I honestly thought I saw a difference the first day.  A friend commented that my makeup looked so good after just two days of use.  I am sp pleased, I will definitely buy this again.  I&#x27;m also going to start using it in the morning.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This product really does work. It is great that there are still products out there that actually perform as promised.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I do like the product.  I am impressed that you would offer a money back guarantee while not having to return item, that speaks volumes of your company’s character.  That fact alone will warrant my purchasing another bottle from you in the very near future.  Companies like yours are rare.  Keep doing what you are doing and you will continue to succeed tremendously.</li>
            <li> no results at all , very watery and thin. dissappointed..</li>
            <li> I used this product while I was on fertility drugs, in the past I have had horrible acne with medicated cycles. This not only kept my skin clear but it helped fade some acne scars from previous treatments. I think this is great for anyone 30+! Its gentle yet extremely effective! Perfection as always with this company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Retinol is a anti-aging must for me, a regular part of my beauty routine. I like that this serum also contains vitamin E and Hyaluronic Acid. I like putting this directly on my new pillow wrinkle on the side of my nose and on my brow furrow. Leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized and softens the appearance of wrinkles. It has a nice natural pleasant scent. Not sticky, greasy, stinky or harsh. You can feel the active ingredients working. I also like that its organic and made in the USA. I received a complimentary bottle for giving my honest opinion and review.</li>
            <li> Feels nice and clean on your face.</li>
            <li> This is very good and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Love it. I love every product I have tried from Instanatural. I will never go back to the overly advertised aging products. These are 100% better. Just wish the bottle was bigger!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the way this serum makles my skin feel after application, no adverse affects. Great promotional price as well.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Great product. Very nice changes to my skin&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this serum! I apply this serum twice a day (morning and night) right after I have cleansed my face. The serum consistency is on the lighter side (not watery), however you can tell that there is a good concentration of ingredients infused into it. There is no oily residue left on the skin after application and I have noticed that my skin (face and neck) just soaks it up like a sponge.  I will be repurchasing this serum from now on - I honestly have no need to look for another serum.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the no questions asked when trying to return this item.  I gave this product a complete try - using it as instructed (which turned into once daily as it left my skin red and tingly), but because I went to once daily, by time I had used it completely (in order to give it a full chance to work) when I tried to return it because it didn&#x27;t work at all, I was told - &amp;#34;This item no longer eligible for returns&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this based on the excellent reviews AND the return policy.  I was seriously disappointed in both</li>
            <li> I have only used for a little while, but my skin certainly seems to look better! Nice consistency and no sticky residue. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> One of the best thing I bought all year. I don&#x27;t even use this everyday mybe once or twice a week and I&#x27;ve notice discoloration begin removed, under eye wrinkles are disappearing fast. I&#x27;m in love with this serum. This will make u look younger for sure. If u looking for the fountain of youth look no further.. Thank u for the email u sent me when I bought this product. Great great company</li>
            <li> Works great for me .... seeing improvement!</li>
            <li> I had a few skin tags on my face and one of them for years. After only using the serum for 2 weeks the skin tags started peeling off. I&#x27;m waiting to see what else happens.</li>
            <li> Love this, my skin feels and look great</li>
            <li> The serum is clear and has a citrus scent which goes away after you apply it.  It absorbs quickly and easily and makes my skin feel smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product to review and this is my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> This product does relax wrinkles when I first put it on. I learned to let it dry completely before applying moisturizer. But at the end of the day, the wrinkles are back. Unlike the implications and other reviews, there is NO long term &amp;#34;fixing&amp;#34; the problem , it is simply a temporary solution.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to help not hinder. This is giving me blemishes beyond belief.</li>
            <li> Great product, very refreshing, I use it before I put on makeup and it is amazing!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I tried the Healthy wise serum and Insta Natural is so much better! Is thicker, the smell is great and you can feel how your face texture change almost inmediately</li>
            <li> I loved this product... I unfortunatly couldn&#x27;t use it any more than a few times because I dropped it on my bathroom floor. But it&#x27;s fragrance was so nice and it tightened my face when I put it on.</li>
            <li> I feel the skin become refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;Invest for the skin. Will be repurchased.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I definitely feel like I have smoother, more younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. It&#x27;s full of quality natural ingredients. Makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li> Great serum.  Love the citrus scent, refreshes my skin and gives me a youthful glow.  I love that is 3-in-1 Retinol-Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid -- the Trifecta for Optimal Skin</li>
            <li> i love face oils and this one is no different.  feels nice on the skin without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Hoping it would be better. I don&#x27;t think its really doing anything.</li>
            <li> Good for aging oily skin!</li>
            <li> Great smell, amazing texture and, most importantly, great results after 2 weeks of using the serum! It was worth ordering it and paying extra for  currency conversion and shipment to Canada. I am definitely going to repurchase it!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Goes on a bit sticky but dries well.  Be sure to use sunscreen when going outdoors.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this retinol serum.  It was a great value besides!  As I get older I realize how important it is to take good care of your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I should experiencing. I thought this would help with my dark spots, haven&#x27;t notice any fading. I do know that overtime, I&#x27;ll be able to tell if it is doing anything for fine lines and wrinkles. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month, so perhaps by month 2, I should began seeing results. I will update :)</li>
            <li> Retinol won&#x27;t make the wrinkles go away, but hopefully it will keep the new ones at bay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this to my Phillip  Thomas Roth because it&#x27;s a bit thicker and goes on much more easily and evenly. The PTR is nearly watery, and slips around everywhere. I apply this nightly and with the Vit C serum in the morning, I have seen a renewed, noticeably freshness to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will def be adding to my permanent routine.</li>
            <li> I cannot rave enough about the products from InstaNatural! Their formulations only include the best, highest quality ingredients, and they do exactly what they claim!&lt;br /&gt;After reading many skincare books, and listening to a dermatologist on the radio, I&#x27;ve keyed in to the word Retinol.  It&#x27;s such an important part of your skincare regimen when you hit your late 20s/early 30s and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;This little Retinol serum is age defying, and is supercharged with antioxidants-- everything I could possibly want!&lt;br /&gt;My skin has been more radiant since I&#x27;ve implemented this serum into my routine. It&#x27;s hard to know just how it&#x27;s protecting from free radicals, since those are invisible, but the air quality where I live is not great, it&#x27;s still the height of winter, and the wind chill alone can sting your face. So, with this on my side, I feel good about my chances!</li>
            <li> I love the smell, smells like grapefruit and I have got a lot of compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am very happy InstaNatural Retinol serum, when I started to use this product my face had some red blotches but after using product for 3 weeks there is no redness and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Need to do some serious skin correcting? This is the product you need. Retinol serum is terrific for discoloration, brown spots, uneven skin...it&#x27;s really doing the job. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> so far has not improved at all my melasma&lt;br /&gt;which can be recaltrant and resilient</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks of daily use on sensitive skin, I have felt no pain, dryness, redness or other unpleasantness as I&#x27;ve experienced with other unfamiliar skin care products. I feel it may be too soon to see any kind of miraculous changes in the quality of my skin but I feel it is a beneficial addition to the healthy skin care routine I am trying to maintain. The package was good, the product arrived promptly and in good condition, especially considering I am currently residing overseas. Overall I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very nice and I already see an improvement in my skin.I would recommend this&lt;br /&gt;to anyone at any age over 30.Andrea Scott</li>
            <li> Been using for 2.5 weeks.Good on sensitive skin because it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts nor sting when applied even to skin that has been irritated, but it goes on smooth, cool and non-oily and skin feels refreshed.Wear with sunscreen though in day. It sloughs off skin that causes dullness as you use it but does it gently enough that skin does not appear dry and flaky but a with a little more glow as you continue to use daily. You can exfoliate with this product.</li>
            <li> I had tried another retinol based product a few years ago and had a bad reaction to it so I was a bit skeptical about trying another one.  Let me tell you this product worked like a charm... no issues!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it 2x a day for several weeks.  My skin is noticeably smoother and clearer.  I have had a white spot on the side of my nose for the past 2 years and within 1 week, it started shrinking.  It is now half it&#x27;s size and the only change in my facial care was adding this serum.&lt;br /&gt;I love this light, citrus scent serum.</li>
            <li> Cant really see any change. I use it every day and want to feel that im doing a good thing for my skin&lt;br /&gt;  but dont really see any change or improvement</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few Insta Natural products in the past and one thing I have to say about this brand is that it never disappoints. I love this serum because it really works wonders on the fine lines that I have on the sides of my nose. My bottle is almost empty because I have been religiously using it, and I can see the improvement on my fine lines. I absolutely love this serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for consumers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> This retinol serum was sent to me for review purposes. My first impression when I opened it was very appealing because the scent is very citrusy. I decided to test it on my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; because this area as we get older will tend to sag as well. So the serum was not thick at all and  absorbed in the skin very nicely without a sticky residue. In order for me to fully review this product it can take like 6 months because a little goes a long way! But know that retinol is very famous to combat the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> I have been using the serum for three weeks now and love the results. My skin is glowing and wrinkles appear reduced.</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied with this product. It makes my skin soft and smooth. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with both this serum and InstaNatural&#x27;s retinol moisturizing cream. Together, they provide a terrific base for my makeup without being so heavy as to cause a breakout. I love that I have found a good skincare regimen to slow down the aging process as my skin is just starting to show signs of aging - losing elasticity and fine lines. Retinol helps with these problems so I will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. It smells good and feels light on my skin. It makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Leave skin very smooth</li>
            <li> I would use this product again loved it</li>
            <li> I have plenty of Retinol creams but this Retinol serum from InstaNatural is different! I have sensitive skin and most Retinol products make my skin feel like I constantly have a healing sunburn. This one however, is super gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I use it at night and then apply a super moisturizing night cream over it. The serum absorbs quickly so I don&#x27;t have to wait forever to apply the night cream. With all Retinol products , sunscreen is a must. I haven&#x27;t seen any changes in my skin yet but I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks. Retinol is clinically proven to help with signs of aging with long term use so I&#x27;m sure with continued use i will see signs.</li>
            <li> It is best product. very effective.</li>
            <li> Serum feels like silk on your skin, very nice!  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any changes but will write more in a month.</li>
            <li> This Retinol Serum has been great.  No irritation, burning or flaky skin. Mild fresh scent. Easy squeeze dropper to dispense.  I squeeze onto my fingers and apply to neck and facial areas.  So far so good.  Really loving this product and InstaNatural has been great with follow-up with any questions and/or concerns.</li>
            <li> Just ordered my second serving of this product - I&#x27;m sooo fortunate to have stumbled on this supplier!!! LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after extensive comparison of available skin serums, and am very pleased with it. I noticed results within a few days of using it only at night. The surface of my skin was softened and pores reduced noticably. In the areas that my makeup tends to go cakey because of dryness and skin surface issues, this product has really made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;8 drops covers my entire face, so this will last a long time, even with using it day and night&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again when I do rum out.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting this to do much or anything at all to my skin (I&#x27;m not usually one to believe anti-aging claims), but this thing is pretty amazing---however, for a different purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive, clogged, acneic skin and this has helped improve my complexion. Pimples are reduced, redness is reduced, skin is brighter, softer, smoother. It&#x27;s amazing. I use it with the Vitamin C Toner and Retinol Cream Moisturizer and it has done wonders for my skin. Will repurchase!</li>
            <li> I love this serum! I am a medium brown skinned African American woman. I had a bad reaction to some makeup I purchased over the summer that left me with dark spots on one side of my face. I have been using the serum for 2 weeks and have seen fantastic results with the quality of my skin. The dark spots are about 80% gone and the texture of my skin is very soft and smooth. Would recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> As usual I am not disappointed with the results from an InstaNatural product!  The packaging as always reflects the wonderful ingredients inside the bottle!  Packed with goodness to help blemishes, clear pores and clean your skin all over.  Witch Hazel, Salicylic Acid and Glycolic Acid as well as other ingredients and it is nice and silky smooth, it goes on easily and feels SO good without leaving a residue on your skin.  This really does a great job of firming up your skin and giving it that healthy glow and at the same time is helping to reduce wrinkles and age spots, even uneven skin or scars!  Love this product, and used with other InstaNatural products you can have that perfect skin you desire :)  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> I really really love this product. Wish it was a bit cheeper on postage! :( but well worth it. smells amazing and makes my skin fell flawless. and doesn&#x27;t burn like retinol usually does! SHe&#x27;s a keeper :)</li>
            <li> My skin got very dry after using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week and I really like the fresh look it gives my face. I do feel that I look younger after using it, but that may be my imagination.</li>
            <li> so far seems to be helping.  Will keep using and most likely will buy again</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Hi, you products are excellent!!!!  Unfortunately for me they have not done much for my wrinkles or skin. All is based on my age and the desert damage of my skin. Your products are in no way responsible for the condition of my skin, I have done it all to myself. The issues I have mentioned should have been discussed with you. I am not in the least expecting any money back, I want to continue with the applications and maybe somewhere it will change.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the opportunity to try your ant iaging formulas.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely Pat Tofflemoyer</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but have been using it for coumple of weeks, not every night, and am already seing benefits. My skin more hydrated, clear, pores smaller, birghter skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very thin serum with a light citrus aroma.  I like the dropper type dispenser as I can have as little or as much as I need.  Half a droppers worth of serum completely covers my face and neck.  You have to work quickly though since the serum is so thin.  It absorbs quickly. My skin is soft and hydrated.  I have some sun spots on my cheek that have definitely lightened.  Can&#x27;t exactly say if it is from this serum or a combination of InstaNatural products as I use their whole line of products!</li>
            <li> This serum is great so far, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week in combination with the retinol moisturizer and my skin is softer and brighter and has even helped clear up some breakouts. I love it!</li>
            <li> using this product for only a few days, but-I can already see a difference in my elasticity and vibrancy.</li>
            <li> I like it so far.  I think my skin tone &amp; texture are improving .  Only time will tell  I am still using it &amp; I am not quite sure yet what the benefits are.  I like the texture and feel of it.  I will keep using it</li>
            <li> The instaNatural products seem to be what they claim. I gave it 4 stars because I feel that it could provide better results than what I&#x27;ve seen so far. But I will keep using and find out how it performs in the end.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days but I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and I am amazed at how much improvement I have seen.  I use about 4 drops every morning after washing my face and follow-up with moisturizer with at least 30 SPF.  Not only does my skin appear smoother but also I have fewer blemishes.  I was able to buy the product at a reduced cost and will be buying it again in the future even without a discount.</li>
            <li> For 60 year old skin, mine is not too bad.  I bought this product to help prevent it from looking older if I can help it.  This product has all the important ingredients to help slow down the skin&#x27;s aging process.  I also use it on the tops of my hands.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely thrilled with InstaNatural Retinol Serum. Indeed, the reason I purchased this serum was because it contained not only Retinol, but also Vit. C and Hyaluronic Acid. I am very happy with the outcome of my skin being soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Great serum , feels good on skin and is nourishing I would totally recommend this</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything about this product really. I have VERY sensitive skin when it comes to products with Retinol, but I though I would give it a shot. It burned my face after 3 applications. BUT I will say that I e-mailed the company and they are great!!!  They apologized for the product burning my face and sent me another product for FREE!  That speaks volumes about InstaNatural and their customer service!</li>
            <li> Yahoo, love this product...  Something that finally works...  Lots of damage (67 yrs young) to correct, but see differences in just over a week.  Looking forward to better skin with use.</li>
            <li> Great product working as well as I expected will order again</li>
            <li> I have loved this product since the day I tried it.  I am starting to get fine lines and wrinkles and with this product, I could see a difference within just a few days!  And my skin is ultra sensitive and no issues.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have tried and reacted to many different Retinols creams, lotions, and serums. This Is one with more &amp;#34;Bang for your Buck&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;All of the high quality ingredients act with synergy to give me the effect I wanted in little time. I live in a climate with dramatic seasons and I tried this one in the dead of winter when the weather is the coldest and driest. This is by far the most gentle serum with retinol I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I do not have to purchase a expensive Vitamin C serum which I have done for years, this is the one to try.&lt;br /&gt;Being in my 50&#x27;s, these are ingredients I can not go with out to take care of my aging skin. Nice product to use at night,but gentle enough for daytime.</li>
            <li> Over time, both men and women will start to develop an aged appearance from the following signs:&lt;br /&gt;- Deep Wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;- Fine Lines&lt;br /&gt;- Dark Circles&lt;br /&gt;- Sun Damage&lt;br /&gt;- Hyperpigmentation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Age-Defying Retinol Serum has an abundance of antioxidants and nutrients that will help your face feel firm, youthful and renewed.&lt;br /&gt;- Packed with 2.5% of Retinol that protects against free-radical damage, helps reverse the appearance of sun damage and the telltale signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;- Powerful antioxidants that trap moisture to prevent future loss so you can enjoy a more youthful appearance with firmer, plumper skin.&lt;br /&gt;- A versatile serum that can be worn under makeup and is also friendly to sensitive skin for daily use, day or night.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this serum.  The price was a amazing as were the other reviews.  So why not try it?  It&#x27;s really a great product. I use it at night only, as my skin is quite sensitive, though after a bit--I will apply during the day as well.  I would definitely be into trying more of these products, as they are straight forward, a great price point, and you actually see the results.  My skin looks refreshed and awake, which is the goal!</li>
            <li> I am a new fan!  I have been using this for less than a full week and am already seeing improvement in &amp;#34;smoothing out&amp;#34; deep wrinkles.  I came across this product by accident, and decided to try it based on the positive reviews, and the fact that the company promises a refund if you are not satisfied.  I realize that refund policies are not always honored, but with Amazon&#x27;s return policies and the risk of negative feedback online, I felt confident in ordering it.  Am I ever pleased with my purchase!  Truthfully, I really thought the price was too cheap for it to be any good  (maybe, I should not write that because they will raise the price)!  It feels very soothing on my skin, and I have noticed that it even quickly heals minor blemishes, which was not a stated benefit.  At first, I was concerned that it might irritate my skin because of some of the feedback, but that is not the case - and, I do have very sensitive skin.  I don&#x27;t know how much the wrinkles with continue to &amp;#34;smooth out&amp;#34; but I will definitely keep using it to give it time to work its magic.  I intend to try some of their other products that might benefit my skin.  When I finish this first bottle, I will update this review with the results that I have, or have not, had.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been really careful, picky to choose what to put on my face . I have almost used all top line Cosmatic brands from swiss, Japan and USA. I&#x27;ve to say higher price normally guarantees good quality including  fancy packaging , but doesn&#x27;t necessary mean always work since everyone has different concerns. So after I&#x27;ve heard so Much good about retinol and vitamin c serum from DR. Ozi Oprah show and other beauty sources, I decided to give a try ... I&#x27;ve been used this serum for about 2 weeks . I couldn&#x27;t tell a very noticeable difference which is normal because any products need 2/3 months to see a result. And no Cosmatic products are magic unless plastic surgery !! I&#x27;m still very happy with it , it&#x27;s so easy to absorb , smell great like orange . And the company sent you email regarding all the instructions which is very nice ! Somehow I feel my dark spots are getting lighter , stil need more time to see but I could tell my skin overall is slowly turning brighter , i am buying again and definitely recommend this products to my family and friends .</li>
            <li> I definitely wouldn&#x27;t call this a serum. It&#x27;s very watery. I&#x27;ve been using it only for a week and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. All of the paid 5 star reviews make me very skeptical. I wonder how much of the ingredients listed are actually in the bottle for only $20.</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful Retinol serum. It works great, have been using it for a month, day/night, and at 53 years old I can see improvements in fine lines, especially around eyes, forehead. I highly recommend using with a JeNu if you have one to make the product even more beneficial to work.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I have very dry sensitive skin I was on accutane about 4 years ago. I have been using this for about 5 days at night only, no irritation has occured. I had a very very minor initial breakout that lasted less than 24 hours. That being said after accutane I am not prone to acne at all just f.y.i. My skin is already looking more smooth and vibrant. I will update in a month.</li>
            <li> I think that my skin became brighter and freshness, pink color after 14 days from the use of this serum !&lt;br /&gt;I will wait 1 month and see what happens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: in the evening i also use homemade serum (coconut oil,olive oil,vitamin E oil)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 22/8/2015&lt;br /&gt;My skin now tighten 40% for just 1 month of used !! this is a great serum really , I hope that anyone uses it and the price is excellent, thank you InstaNatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: i also used before go to bed: combination of coconut oil, jojoba oil, vitamin E oil, olive oil mixed together</li>
            <li> Absolutely excellent, won&#x27;t find a better price for a serum of this quality anywhere.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for approx. 2 weeks both in the evening and morning on cleansed skin and have already noticed a difference in my skin texture and I have been looking with a critical eye because I have bought so many other serums in the past which promised results but they never delivered.  It is so refreshing to find a honest ethical company that really cares about trying to improve our skin at an affordable price because they know how important it is to feel good about yourself and having great skin is a good start.  I can&#x27;t wait to try more of their wonderful products.</li>
            <li> Been using 3 months now with no results on age spots or wrinkles.  I am not sure it does anything, but i am still willing to give it 2-stars.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have been using it now for several months. I use it just after I wash my face (Purpose liquid soap). I use a moisturizer with sunscreen during the day and just the serum at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice the serum has helped my skin regain some of its suppleness and also helped soften the skin both visibly and to the touch. Wrinkles around the eyes appear diminished and finer. The same goes for the frown lines on my forehead as well. I am not familiar with whatever the general alleged benefits of retinol serums are and am only speaking of this particular product. I have been told my skin looks more youthful and vibrant in appearance. And at 47, I&#x27;ve often been mistaken for 37 - without makeup. It doesn&#x27;t turn back the clock, but it definitely diminishes the texture by smoothening the surface and gives skin a healthy glow. Its not oily or heavy and when it dries there is no product sheen left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To apply I fill the dropper and tilt my head and squeeze a bit on my cheeks one at a time and spread it around to my nose area, forehead, and over my eyes (with them closed). I have never experienced any burning or tingling but should say that I had been using a glycolic acid cream at night for many years before I switched to this product. First time users may want to use it once a day just to see how their skin feels afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is somewhat milky/tawny in color and very watery. It may seem as if you applying nothing to your skin but if you give it time, you will most certainly notice the tone and texture of your skin improving.</li>
            <li> It seems to work ok, but no noticeable improvement to discoloration.</li>
            <li> Younger looking, soft skin..ok..will not remove deep wrinkles.</li>
            <li> my wife and i have used this product for about 6 months and the results are unbelievable! has really smoothed the skin on our face, while removing dark spots and small wrinkles. will continue using this product and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> After using for approximately a month, I can say I love it!  I have tried expensive retinol products before that were too irritating to my sensitive skin.  I can use it twice a day and feel it has improved the appearance of my skin, both reducing fine lines and evening out my skin tone.  I just ordered another bottle to avoid running out!  I have been satisfied with a few other products from Instanatural as well. After using benzoyl peroxide products for years to avoid breakouts, I have been able to stop and my skin has not been breaking out!  Thank you :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any kind of serum because I honestly didn&#x27;t like the smell of them and how many harsh and often time acidic chemicals they include. I was happy to see that this serum smelled like citrus and didnt contain as many chemicals as other comparable serums. I&#x27;ve just started using it in addition to the mud mask but I am eager to see the long term results.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on a Thursday and it was at my door step the next day!!!  This product feels like it gives your face a kiss every time you use it.  It smells delightful and goes on smooth with a refreshing clean feel.  I would buy it again just for the great experience I have had with using it and with the company.  The company was very interested in my review and did an awesome job following up with me.  They even offer me free product for being a customer.  How much better can it get!!</li>
            <li> Do not use! This product caused an allergic reaction all over my face including painful blisters and dry patches around my mouth and eyes. Please read ingredients carefully. NOT safe for sensitive skin!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very strong serum. Not sure it did what it claim to do, had to quit using it after about two weeks, because it gave me a chemical burn on my forehead and cheek area which after three weeks has still not completely healed. I&#x27;m afraid it may leave last thing redness.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week now and so far I like it. It has what I would describe as a nice orange peel scent which reminds me of my citrus scented oils. I feel it makes my skin brighter in combination with the other InstaNatural Skincare products I have also been using such as the dead sea mask and moisturizer. I feel the price is reasonable and was fortunate enough to try it for free to review through BrandBacker. It comes in a dropper which they recommend applying a few drops on your fingertips before lightly smoothing over your face in upward circular motions after using a cleanser and toner. It does feel a bit sticky afterwards, but once it dries that sticky feeling goes away.</li>
            <li> I use a vit c and retinol everyday....so thought this would be perfect.  Smells like oranges but not a string odor.  I like it.  Fine lines are fading....age spots gone.</li>
            <li> Great Price Great Product Great Service !!! What more could i say thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I have terrible skin, post-children. I&#x27;ve been to multiple dermatologists and it&#x27;s determined to be &amp;#34;hormonal acne.&amp;#34; Drs want to put me on medication but I don&#x27;t want to take it. I&#x27;ve explored nearly any and everything. I wasn&#x27;t hopeful that this would help, but it&#x27;s made a big difference in my overall complexion and skin troubles. Because my skin is sensitive, I have to only use it at night and occasionally skip nights or it irritates it, but I could see a difference just after a few days. Great product.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this! Why would you put yourself through red, flaky skin on your face with a more aggressive form? Use this regularly. My only wish is that I would have found it years ago!</li>
            <li> This serum has completely reset my skin. I had perfect skin up until I had my son 5 years ago. Since then its been a nightmare trying to get it back under control. From acne, to dark spots and over production of oil. I use this religiously twice a day and when I look in the mirror I can&#x27;t believe that after hundreds of products, I have finally found the one that is showing 100% promise of getting my skin back to flawless, poreless, baby smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I love using Mud Masks.  Unfortunately they don’t like me.  I have very sensitive skin so I have to be careful with what I put on my skin.  Especially my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found though that all natural facial masks do work the best for me though.  I rarely have a reaction to those.  When I heard about this promotion the mask sounded promising.  Here is some information about the Dead Sea Mud Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to InstaNatural, “InstaNatural’s Dead Sea Mud Mask is an all-natural detoxifier and purifier that comes from the renowned and sacred Dead Sea. More than a million visitors each year flock to this extraordinary body of water in the Mediterranean, which contains many minerals beneficial to the skin, such as magnesium, sodium, bromine, potassium and calcium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first open the Mud Mask, it is very cold and will feel cold to your face.  After 10 – 15 minutes of drying on your face, use a warm washcloth and wash the mask off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was a bit red but that quickly went away and my face felt tighter, very smooth and had a nice glow to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the serum and the retinol moisturizer too.  My face has been clearer the last week then it has been in a long time.  The moisturizer is not greasy and a little bit goes a long long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a new addition to your facial routine and are looking for an all natural face mask, then definitely check out InstaNatural’s Dead Sea Mud Mask, Retinol Moisturizer and Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Moms it’s really hard to fit spa time in let alone Mommy time so what’s great about the Mud Mask is that you can pamper yourself at home!  We also used it on our hands and feet.  They felt nice and smooth afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Product provided for free for testing purposes.”</li>
            <li> First impression of this product, I noticed the citrus-y scent, that is enough for me to mentally confirm this product does contain a form of vitamin C in it. It has a watery texture but it moisturizes once it touches the skin, which I find quite amusing. It absorbs quickly and gives your skin a glow but does not leave an oily residue, my face appears matte, but with a slight glow, it is not oily, neither is it dry or tight. this serum works great for those with combination skin and those with oily skin. I love this serum and I have been using it during the daytime especially when I do not want to look oily and it works great for my oily-combination skin. I also noticed this product does do what it says, my skin has been glowing ever since. I had an acne breakout, in the middle of my forehead, I picked at it and it left a scab, but after daily use, my scab healed faster and the scar turned very light brown to almost non-existent, all this over a week!. This product definitely works!!  -Oreleona [Product provided for free for testing purposes]</li>
            <li> thanks for the product. I am using it</li>
            <li> Great serum for night use.  I use it in combination with the retinol cream at night.  My skin has improved visibly in texture and tone.  I am 59 and my fine lines and wrinkles have reduced after a couple of weeks using these products.  Really great prices for very good products.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks so much clearer and tighter since I&#x27;ve been using this product. Ive tried a lot of products, and this is the best in my opinion. It is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smoother but dry.  I just use moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li> This is good. My wife love it.</li>
            <li> Great retinol serum.  I have had no breakouts and my skin has been looking health and great since I have been using it daily.</li>
            <li> Very good deal for such a high quality product. instaNatural has a new fan. I have ordered more of their line already;</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS INSTANATURAL RETIONAL SERUM BEFORE GO TO BED.  THIS SERUM WORKING GOOD FOR ME.  MY EYE WRINKLE REDUCED.  THANKS I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS FREE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and can tell it&#x27;s got Vit C in it but don&#x27;t really see any improvements. It&#x27;s been about a month. I will keep using.</li>
            <li> Makes skin super soft. Not sure how much it&#x27;s reversed aging but feels great under moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Great results. Fast shipping. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I don;t know if I&#x27;ve seen any significant changes in my skin after using this, but my skin hasn&#x27;t gotten worse or anything so I guess this is just a nice product for maintaining your skin health. Hey you might get better results than I did, maybe my skin type doesn&#x27;t need these ingredients. I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s, oily skin and moderate acne.</li>
            <li> I had another brand of retinol serum,that made my skin a little irritated,so I was not sure if I should this at all,but I gave it a try my skin was not itchy,was not red,my skin actually loved this brand,j was very pleased with the outcome .My skin was soft had a glow.Very good for your skin with a lo tv of benefits, and a lot of ingredient that is excellent for your skin,I am very happy.I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK.</li>
            <li> I use this serum along with InstaNatural Eye Gel, and the bag&#x27;s underneath my eyes have been reduced by 50%!!!! At night, I first apply Retinol Serum and let dry; then apply Eye Gel for maximum results.  I&#x27;m totally in love with this product for it has exceeded my expectations.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days, but I seem to notice evening of skin color. Also, it seems to be helping with my acne prone skin during this humid summer.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks. At 68 I was developing deep wrinkles around my mouth &amp; it seems to be helping. hopefully, I  will continue to see improvement as the product is very affordable.</li>
            <li> Product works really well.  Evens out my skin and clears up acne.  Smells fantastic, like real orange extract.  I use it under Oz Naturals Retinol Moisturizer (you will need a moisturizer with the serum).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok... don&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
            <li> This may be my favorite serum of all!  Actually, favorite face product - I use it twice a day (there are days I haven&#x27;t gotten around to it, but generally I use it at least once a day).  I have NO negative effects from this.  In fact, I was shocked to see that in just a few days I was seeing my deeper wrinkles disappear, my skin tone is even, the pores are minimal, the texture of my skin is baby-bottom smooth, my neighbors have even commented on how great I look!  It&#x27;s reduced those nagging bags (from lack of sleep) that I get in the morning to nearly nothing - I love this product! The dropper is wonderful, this is very lightweight and spreads really well.  There&#x27;s a refreshing slight scent of citrus while applying it - not a heavy smell at all and dissipates right away.  A half-dropper will cover my entire neck and face so this will last a long time. I&#x27;m so happy to have found this!  No irritation was noticed at all, even when I had to work in the sun for an entire week.  (But, that was an emergency situation, please follow their recommendations carefully!) Two thumbs up and more than 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I use this first, then apply the InstaNatural moisturing cream. I really like their products. I am older so I need lots of help for my skin. My complexion looks so much brighter and my skin tone has evened out. Great products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m loving the results.  My lines around my mouth and eyes are gradually getting less noticeable.  The product itself is light, nothing sticky or oily, and it absorbs quickly, and there is no lingering smell.  I will definitely continue to use this daily!</li>
            <li> I freakin&#x27; love this serum.  Smoothes out one&#x27;s complexion like whoa and supercharges with powerful antioxidants like vitamins C and E.  I like applying it on my face and neck!  Pat it in for a minute or two for full absorption.  BTW, this product offers mad hydration with moisturizing ingredients like hyaluronic acid and organic jojoba oil, and it smells like heaven.  Hashtag citrusy scents FTW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. It really works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sikha</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about three weeks and grew a big zit a few days ago. I&#x27;m not sure if this caused it - have used other products from Instanatural with no problems. Could be that the zit is caused by something else, but I&#x27;m still putting this product on hold for a while to see it really is the culprit.</li>
            <li> Works amazing! My skin feels tighter, and smooth. Love the citrus scent!</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. Doesn&#x27;t irritate or aggravate my sensitive skin. Great purchase!! I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I received this for free and used it with the Instanatural Retinol Moisturizer. My skin felt so soft afterwards and the softness lasts as well. Giving it 3 stars because I prefer Instanatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum (4 stars). This product smells like oranges which I personally love but the smell fades for anyone worried about it.</li>
            <li> I like this product and it does make a difference.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SERVICE.VERY GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Gets absorbed into the skin almost immediately but needs additional moisturizer over it. Does not burn around the eye area at all since it gets absorbed into skin without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a gift for my mother. She has been using it for a few weeks now and has nothing but wonderful things to say. She said it works really well.  Excellent. product!</li>
            <li> Let me just say this is my second time ordering and i just love this serum its the best retinol ive ever tried and most defiantly worth every penny!! And i will keep ordering when im done i just fell inlove with this bottle!makes me look younger and more glowing!</li>
            <li> Very happy with product !</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product, my skin is smooth, and not irritated, so much so that I would like to re-order.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, really good.</li>
            <li> I use this 3-4 times a week (at night before bed) and I see vast improvements.  My fine lines seems to have gone away.  Love this product and I love how there is also vitamin c in it.  Will continue to buy this</li>
            <li> i put this on after a quick rinse of rose water. the gel has a great slip and glides on easily and absorbs instantly. I sometimes get a slight blush but it quickly subsides. my skin feels soft and plump afterwards. if I neglect to do this in the morning, my skin is dry and dull. love this stuff</li>
            <li> Ordering another bottle of this magic potion!</li>
            <li> A very good serum......I love it</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t been using it that long, but hoping to see a difference in a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> Thank you. I finally found something that works on my skin. Great product.</li>
            <li> This product has me my face look so nice</li>
            <li> Thicker than other serums, goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> This product is great!&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
            <li> I think this product helps my skin.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I do like the way my skin feels, and I love the scent - citrusy. However, after using it for approximately a month, I&#x27;m afraid my 72 year old &amp;#34;weathered&amp;#34; skin is beyond repair! That&#x27;s not to say that maybe a younger woman, say in her 40&#x27;s could benefit from this serum if she started the regimen now. I will, however, continue using it!</li>
            <li> This product is great, I am almost finished with my first bottle. Has a great citrus smell, feels smooth on my face and doesn&#x27;t dry it out. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> The serum seems to have really smoothed out the fine lines. I&#x27;ve taken care of my skin for most of my life, so it wasn&#x27;t in really terrible shape. I would highly recommend giving this product a try.</li>
            <li> Not, satisfied with this product, it make me breakout on my face</li>
            <li> I have only been using this about a month. I use it each evening and morning. It goes on smoothly and easily. I can&#x27;t say I have seen any difference yet, but I don&#x27;t expect to this soon. It&#x27;s certainly worth a try.</li>
            <li> Beautiful. Love it. My face is different. Looking youthful.</li>
            <li> Been using it for 2 weeks, good so far!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than two weeks and I have not noticed any changes at all. I will continue with treatment until I have used it all since I paid for it and it isn&#x27;t causing me to break out or any other negative reactions.</li>
            <li> Super quick delivery and packaged well.  I love this product for skin &amp;#34;repair.&amp;#34;  It has made a huge difference in the fine lines and wrinkles.  As well as making my skin smoother and pores smaller.  I love that it is all natural!</li>
            <li> This 2.5% Retinol serum with 20% Vitamin C offers a double punch. Both of these are part of my skin care routine for a long time. I usually stop using Retinol during winter drying months and when weather gets too hot in summer. This serum has Vitamin C and E along with Hyaluronic acid and organic Jojoba oil that provides hydration and moisture to skin. It even outs the complexion, keep pores clear and also removes dead skin cells. It contains Witch Hazel, Salicylic Acid and Glycolic Acid that leaves skin radiant. I am sure I can keep using this in the summer months as well since it doesn’t dry my skin and it doesn’t peel like with the use of other retinol products. Always use a good SPF in the morning. Another winner product from InstaNatural.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my sin is dulling as I am getting older also from getting less sleep because of either kids or staying up late working on schoolwork or house work. I started using this retinol serum and am starting to notice a small difference. I will update the more I use this product!! So far so good &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF SMELLS AMAZING</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
            <li> I use this product at night underneath my moisturizer. I have noticed a visible difference in my skin. It is more even toned and has reduced fine lines, especially underneath my eyes. I would highly recommend this to anyone that is considering the much costlier dermatologist options. This does not replace a derm, I see one often. But this serum is less costly than their proprietary products with the same results. Use daily, twice a day. It can&#x27;t do what Botox and fillers do, but it does even skin tone, and reduce fine lines, which gives a more youthful appearance. I don&#x27;t work for this company or have any relationship other than as a consumer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been approximately 16 days that I have used the Retinol serum and I haven&#x27;t seen a significant difference. I do believe it&#x27;s still premature to see a difference since it does take four to eight weeks for the old epidermis to completely slough off and be replaced.  I will write another review at three months of use.  Just would like to follow up on the results.  After using this product for exactly 2 months, I am happy to report that I did see an improvement on the health of my skin.  I used the Retinol Serum and the Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer 20% Facial Lotion both made by InstaNatural. I found the combination of these two facial creams and hydrating myself appropriately (8 glasses of water a day) significantly improve the health of my skin. I personally liked the Vit C Cream Moisturizer 20% facial lotion better than the Retinol Serum.</li>
            <li> Feels great after a shower and as a pre moisturizer. I tried a couple different serums and this one doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky or smell unpleasant. A couple drops and your good to go for your face and neck.</li>
            <li> I received a promotional sample and I have mixed feelings on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;-Makes my skin feel softer and I thought it made it look a little smoother.&lt;br /&gt;-Not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;-It smells very citrus-y.  It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell spa-ish which is what I usually expect.  The smell most closely resembles Goo-Gone.  The smell doesn&#x27;t linger too long, so not a big concern.&lt;br /&gt;-While I thought my skin looked a but nicer... it wasn&#x27;t a noticeable difference.  No one commented on my skin, no one noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So ultimately -- while I thought it did have a positive effect on my skin, it wasn&#x27;t dramatic enough to add it to my regular beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> So far so good thankful</li>
            <li> We received this product for free from InstaNatural, the review is our own. My wife has enjoyed all of the InstaNatural products she has used. If you are looking at this, you are trying to get rid of wrinkles, spots or rough aged skin. My wife tried this product and she noticed softer skin after the first use. You only use a little, it goes a long way and makes your skin look and feel younger. If you have the chance to looker younger and have healthier skin, take the chance, you will be glad you did. The product is reasonable and is guaranteed to work for you. This vitamin c /retinol serum works good for my wife and i&#x27;m sure it will work good for you. The things I like better with InstaNatural is they list all their ingredients and they give you directions how to use the product. It is great to know what you are putting on your skin and how to do it correctly. If you go to the picture, you can click on it and see all of the ingredients yourself. My wife is happy to use natural products that do not harm her skin. She is always excited when another great product from InstaNatural comes in the mail.</li>
            <li> I like that this age-defying Retinol Serum can be used around your eyes, on your face, and your neck. I like being able to use one product on multiple areas. It works for fading blemishes and this seems to be more of a problem the older I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent and that it doesn&#x27;t burn or cause redness. I have been applying in on spots for the last couple of weeks to see if I could lighten the aging issues. My skin is softer and it seems easier to apply my lotion and foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product can cause redness if used too often or on sensitive areas. Once a day seems to be the perfect usage for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this item was purchased by me with a promotional code, gift card or online coupon.. I would order it again.</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter, it is softer, my fine lines are less noticeable and I swear my skin is glowing!! I have been using the  OZ Naturals Retinol Serum for 2 weeks and I am in love with it! I&#x27;m so glad I was able to review this. Now my issue is which serum do I put on at night, ha what a terrible problem to have right? :)</li>
            <li> I was amazed!  I have very sensitive skin and it worked great.  I have bought so many anti wrinkle creams that did not work I was Leary about the Retinol.  My wrinkles are less noticeable and my skin soft and supple.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Have enjoyed using this serum.  I do love InstaNatural products, and have had only good experience with their products. Yes retinol products are great anti-aging products, but this serum is great for anyone wanting better skin. In the past I would only use retinol products at night, but I can use this product in the morning and at night. Instanatural Retinol serum hydrates my skin, and helps my skin to retain that moisture. Noticed that my skin looks younger, and fresher. Oh this serum has an amazing citrus scent.  My skin just drinks up this serum. Let me share with you a few of the key ingredients: 2.5% retinol, 20% vitamin c, 10% hyaluronic acid &amp; fruit &amp; plant acids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I apply the serum to clean, dry skin. Use about 4 small drops to cover my face &amp; neck. I gently pat it into for at least two minutes with the tips of my fingers. This ensures that serum full absorbs. Would recommend anyone of any age using this serum. Yes it&#x27;s an age defying serum, but it&#x27;s just amazing skin care for anyone wanting healthier looking skin. Do wish that this serum was a bit thicker, but that just a minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did receive this product for free in exchange for an honest &amp; fair review. The thoughts in this review are my own.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural: Age Defying Retinol Serum; Supercharged Antioxidant Blend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is part of their serum collection. You get a combination of ingredients that deliver youthful and radiant skin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera Base (no H20 fillers here)&lt;br /&gt;2.5% Retinol&lt;br /&gt;20% Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;10% Hyaluronic Acid&lt;br /&gt;Fruit and Plant acids&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;Witch Hazel&lt;br /&gt;Organic Jojoba oil&lt;br /&gt;Green Tea&lt;br /&gt;Pink Grapefruit Essential oil&lt;br /&gt;Willow Bark&lt;br /&gt;All products at InstaNatural are made in the USA and never animal tested&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application- Wash your face and gently pat dry. Being that this is a serum and a very light formulation, you usually apply this product after a toner and before applying a moisturizer. Always keep in mind the easy rule of applying skincare products in the order they are formulated, from thinnest first to heaviest being your last. This allows the products to absorb quickly and also allows your skin to reap the product&#x27;s full benefits by creating a moisturizing barrier. I lightly dabbed my problem areas like under eyes, forehead, middle of eyebrows, and neck area. You can opt to apply a thin layer all over your skin or just target the zones you feel need the most attention. Keep in mind this is a retinol based product, so you have to keep sensitivity in check and any sun exposure (always use sunscreen). You can use the serum twice a day with your skincare regimen, unless you spot redness and/or peeling, which then you would use once daily or until you find the time schedule that works best for your skin (i.e. every other day if you continue to experience sensitivity).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to Expect- I tested the product for 3 weeks. The product comes in a dark amber colored glass bottle, which keeps oxidation down to a minimum. The dropper allows the user to use what is needed without wasting or over dispensing. The serum is light in texture but closer to a gel versus being watery. This means you are not chasing the product around and it stays where applied. I started using the Retinol Serum once a day and after day three, I moved up to applying once in the day and once at night. This was my way to make sure I did not have red skin during the holidays. Due to the antioxidant blend and also the vitamins, I noticed a quick plumping from the vitamin C, which smoothed out my face nicely before applying moisturizers and make-up. The retinol is definitely present, as I did see the turnover and newer (better looking) skin rather quickly. I don&#x27;t mind quick results and neither will you!  I did like that any scars or discoloration from previous blemishes (acne scars) are a thing of the past and this serum provided the quickest &amp;#34;scar turn-around&amp;#34; so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from InstaNatural.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.

            <li> I have used half of the bottle already and can already tell I am never going to be without this stuff. I was recommended to try Retinol serums when I went to get a facial to clear up my acne. It has already helped clear out my pores and those pimple I get are healing by the next day after using this retinol at night. I can&#x27;t believe it has worked so well for my skin. 25 and still have acne like I was 13.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it u can smell the Vic c and feel it working it&#x27;s awesome first time I tried there products n love the, will be a returning customer interested to try other products</li>
            <li> I was hoping this was oily. Its not. But is good brightened. I still need my vitamin world retinal cream as a night time moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I am in my mid 20s and always have acne, sunburn, wind burn, etc. I have fair skin and it is very sensitive. I put this on my face once every other day. I can definitely tell a huge difference in my skin. It has more glow, more clarity, and is very soft. This is amazing and everyone should buy it! You will not regret it!</li>
            <li> I have been using InstaNatural Age Defying Retinol Serum for a few weeks now and am very happy with the results so far.  I am able to use it every evening with no irritation.  No redness, burning or peeling!  Even my husband keeps mentioning how beautiful and smooth my skin looks.  And ladies you know if your husband says something it&#x27;s working!  I will continue to use this serum, as it also contains my two other favorite skincare products Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid, and will definitely be trying other InstaNatural&#x27;s products.  I am excited to see what results I achieve over the next few months.</li>
            <li> I am using this in conjunction with the InstaNatural Retinol Moisturizer Cream and I am seeing positive results after one week. My smile lines are looking less apparent and becoming filled. My skin looks a lot smoother than before where the InstaNatural Retinol Serum is helping to absorb more of the InstaNatural Retinol Moisturizer Cream into my skin as opposed to using the moisturizer alone. I didn&#x27;t experience any skin irritation from using this product. It didn&#x27;t increase oil production or shine for my oily skin type. This does absorb quickly into the skin after application, which I love!    *Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Good product. Feels good, smells good. Right price....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it but a couple of weeks, but I can see a difference; however, anyone with sensitive skin might need to be careful since it has hydraulic acid as an ingredient.  If so, I would only use it once a day.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use the Retinol Moisturizer and Serum during the day. Use them at night, before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my face at nights and I love the amazing turn my skin has taken. The result was so surprising that my husband got himself a bottle. The Serum is potent and powerful so you only need to apply a little and work it into the skin. It will help with acne scars and hyperpigmentation because it encourages cell turn over-removing dead skin and repairing damaged cells. Your new skin will be very sensitive so you will need to protect your skin from the sun and harsh whether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was sent this product to try out and review. I have written a more detailed review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> This product came to me in the mail completely frozen and cracked !!</li>
            <li> Works well. I did notice an improvement in overal skin texture as well as acne scare fading.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 InstaNatural products for my daughter wanting to try less toxic options for her cystic acne. After a month of use her acne has not disappeared entirely but it is greatly improved. I think if she would use it more dilegently it would be even better. After getting an email from the company , i wrote back asking if there were more appropriate products for her acne. They suggested the Niacenamid serum but I will need to order it directly from them since it is not carried by Amazon. So far I am excited by these products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Argan oil from Insta-Naturals for a couple of years and decided to try this serum after reading an article about the anti-aging ingredients to look for in skincare products such as retinol, hylauranic acid, vitamin C, etc. and I am very satisfied with it. I&#x27;m 46 and I have been using Retin-A about three times a week for years and I use this serum on alternate nights and during the day and I have noticed an improvement in the texture and brightness of my skin. It seems to help my skin retain moisture which plumps up fine lines and reduces flakiness. I love the light, fresh orange scent and the way the serum is completely absorbed by my skin. It isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy, making it perfect for oiler skin types and it&#x27;s great under day or night cream for dry skin. It is a good product at a good price from a company I trust and I recommend it and will repurchase. I have no affiliation with Insta-Naturals and my customer experience has been fantastic.</li>
            <li> This product has a light citrusy fragrance that I like. I use this along with the InstNatural Retinol cream for my night time routine. It has helped with fine lines and wrinkles, mainly under my delicate eye area. I am a side sleeper and have found that I&#x27;m getting deep creases around my left eye, so I figured I should start being diligent about applying products to that area.</li>
            <li> Very good. very sweet smell. It is working good to skin. I want to reorder.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much softer and I&#x27;ve noticed less fine lines. Doesn&#x27;t try out my sensitive skin. Will definitely continue to use this, love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Awesome serum! Recommend to all my friends! I didn&#x27;t give a five star because I believe it should last for more than 30 days</li>
            <li> Great serum, little strong on the retinol</li>
            <li> I had been suffering from severely flaky, dry, dull skin for weeks (thanks, Winter).  In addition, in the mirror one morning I noticed that I was frowning at myself.  When I relaxed my face, the frown lines stayed.  It was time to address both.  So I ordered a retinol serum from InstaNatural, and just 4 weeks later my skin is amazing!  No more flakiness, the dullness has gone, and though the frown lines are still there, I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;ll soon be minimized.  This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It made my skin feel firm and smooth. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff! Feels ok on skin, absorbs quickly. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. Haven&#x27;t noticed an amazing difference, but skin does appear to be tighter. I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product along with the retinol moisturizer at night and I am not a huge fan of either product.&lt;br /&gt;This serum does absorb fast and I am hearing great things, so i&#x27;m sure it does work with some skin types, I just haven&#x27;t had that privilege of seeing great results. I wish I could say better things about this serum because I am a HUGE InstaNatural fan, I have most of their line. I have been using this for about 2-3 weeks so far, i&#x27;m going to give this a few more weeks and see if I can have a better opinion.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user of this product and was a little skeptical based on some of the reviews. This is not a paid review, I am a 48 year old woman and I LOVE the results of this product.  I have tried many expensive skincare products that claim to give a youthful glow and reduce lines. I switched over to using this InstaNatural Retinol Serum in the morning and night along with Olay ProX Anti-Aging moisturizer.  Great results after the first week!  It seems that in the last 5 years my skin has also become more sensitive and has occasionally either broken out or had a rash when I tried a new product. Not this time!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
