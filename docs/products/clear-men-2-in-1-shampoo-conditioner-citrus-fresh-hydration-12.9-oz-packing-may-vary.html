            <li>And, did I mention the delicious, invigorating aroma?!</li>
            <li>We were all quite impressed with how it worked.</li>
            <li>But of the 2 in 1 products, this one seems to be one of the best.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>so he&#x27;s happy to continue using it.</li>
            <li>Smells and works great to prevent flaking.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice for men</li>
            <li>Very nice lathering ability and</li>
            <li>Both of us love are impressed with the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>But best of all, I love the citrus scent.</li>
            <li>I loved the fragrance of this one.  </li>
            <li>I find that if I use this in rotation with a tea tree oil product and a coal tar product, it helps control the dandruff and still leaves my hair looking good.  </li>
            <li>My husband tends to have problems with product build up in his hair but this 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner does a good job of thoroughly cleaning his hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably best for those with mild dandruff.</li>
            <li>I am also impressed that my hair feels more natural and (best of all) has reduced the amount of dandruff I have.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the thickness of the foam that remained on the surface of my hair while I rubbed and massaged my head.</li>
            <li>So refreshing!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It felt nice and a bit cooling, from the tea tree oil and mint</li>
            <li>Kind of like the lemon scent in lemon pledge, without the waxy smell.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get that nice, silky finish when rinsing out so on occasion</li>
            <li>This is a nice shampoo for when our scalps are a bit dry--even for every day use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing works as well as Nizoral for me, but this one has a nice scent and conditioner.</li>
            <li>husband really liked the scent as well.</li>
            <li>I initially liked that it doesn&#x27;t smell like a a prescription turned into shampoo.</li>
            <li>Packaging wise, I like the top.</li>
            <li>That alone makes this nice.  </li>
            <li>H&amp;S. I&#x27;ll be honest -</li>
            <li>My husband has used it for a month and really liked it.</li>
            <li>It controls dandruff as good (or better?)</li>
            <li>I’m just as clean and leave smelling great-</li>
            <li>This shampoo/conditioner is his favorite because of the great citrus scent, which not too strong as to be overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and I love the citrus scent.</li>
            <li>Very pleased, will make this my regular choice for shampoo/conditioner--which is the best sort of review I guess.</li>
            <li>The citrus scent is fresh and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>the scent is pleasant and fresh without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>For some reason I kept coming back to Head and Shoulders - which I&#x27;ll opening admit probably isn&#x27;t the greatest shampoo in general nor have I found it does the greatest job.</li>
            <li>Both of these have been excellent at controlling my dandruff once it had been aggravated enough from lack of attention.</li>
            <li>Okay (3-stars)</li>
            <li>I have upgraded to 5 stars after using it for many months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think that if I continue to use it, I may not have to admit that I have dandruff any more.  </li>
            <li>In fact, baring any change in things, i plan on buying more of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Head and Shoulders has been a staple in our bathroom for more years that I&#x27;ll ever admit to.</li>
            <li>The shampoo works great at keeping dandruff issues under control and the citrus fragrance is a real pleasure to smell.  </li>
            <li>The smell is also a lot better.</li>
            <li>This product has a nice light citrusy scent to it, and lathers well.</li>
            <li>It was perfect for short hair as a conditioning agent, and controlled dandruff</li>
            <li>I will always remain convinced that separate shampoos and conditioners work better than a 2 in 1 product.  </li>
            <li>, Citrus Fresh Hydration\\&quot; is a very good shampoo/conditioner that works well on my dry scalp, and smells great.</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job cleaning the hair and adding softness and</li>
            <li>This particular shampoo gives a very nice lather.</li>
            <li>The citrus is not heavy, but it does stick around and my hair smelled great all day.  </li>
            <li>It smells kind of fresh, minty, citrus-y, with a background touch of rosemary.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice any hydrating of the scalp, but I really loved the citrus scent.</li>
            <li>All in all, it is just a good product that works very well.</li>
            <li>The citrus smell is somewhat strong, but I like it a lot.</li>
            <li>He loved this product and highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>and it was fine, but I did use a conditioner afterwards</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is one of the very best Clear products thus far!</li>
            <li>I think if you have dry, processed or damaged hair a conditioner is always better, but for hair that is already healthy this is a good pick.</li>
            <li>When you use this shampoo it has a light mens cologne scent combined with lemon.</li>
            <li>Overall a good brand and product and competitive in price to most of the mens products out there.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to control how much comes out and close it easily.</li>
            <li>Very fresh and innervating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how there is not merely a \\&quot;hint\\&quot; of citrus but a full blast of it.</li>
            <li>This product does a great job of hydrating his dry scalp so it doesn&#x27;t itch.</li>
            <li>The smell is very pleasing to the the whole family (that&#x27;s an amazing feat right there!).</li>
            <li>(I did have fly-aways everywhere, and could have benefited from some smoothing serum after using this, which is why I&#x27;m only giving it a 4.)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been quite impressed with this brand overall.  </li>
            <li>like I was walking through an orange grove, the same wonderful aroma that I got used to growing up in Southern California.</li>
            <li>My hair feels more soft, smooth, and manageable.  </li>
            <li>pleased, and I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>It is like someone is crushing fresh lemons right over</li>
            <li>(The strength of the scent is especially worth noting because I have found other CLEAR shampoos to be overly strong so this is a nice improvement.)  </li>
            <li>The scent is great – not overpowering, but far better than the typical medicated shampoo.</li>
            <li>that I tried two versions of this shampoo - Ocean Mineral and Citrus Fresh.</li>
            <li>I’m finding it to be just as effective as brands such as H&amp;S in controlling dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely one of our favorite scents in the CLEAR line of 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioners.</li>
            <li>Fresh Hydration&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clear Citrus Fresh Hydration shampoo for men passes that test.</li>
            <li>Of all of the scents I have used of the clear product line, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>As most of the Clear Men Scalp shampoos, it comes out of the bottle looking like Elmer&#x27;s Glue All.</li>
            <li>This dandruff shampoo works better than the other more well known brand.</li>
            <li>As far as cleansing he loved how it lathered and how it left his hair -- Clean, but soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to use a separate conditioning process to get my hair right.</li>
            <li>This shampoo lathers nicely, rinses our easily, doesn&#x27;t leave our hair heavy, stringy or dull-looking.  </li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to the traditional medicinal-smelling dandruff shampoos (such as H&amp;S).</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a fun shampoo, and my hair came out clean, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Clear Men Scalp &amp; Hair Citrus Fresh Hydration 2 in 1 Shampoo &amp; Conditioner is specially designed to control dandruff symptoms at the source and lock in hydration from the first wash.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t explain it other that it&#x27;s a fresh, clean, slightly manly scent, but not overpowering like some of the more popular products out there right now.</li>
            <li>think it is funny to review a product like shampoo.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of CLEAR products because they really clean your hair and scalp without stripping it and drying it out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have sulfur/tar in it, the active ingredient is  Pyrithione zinc, which is effective for controlling dandruff.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different shampoo brands and never found anything that really works well.</li>
            <li>As much of the review is identical, I am posting the first one below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other Clear shampoos, and I thought they were good</li>
            <li>This CLEAR branded anti-dandruff 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner is a refreshing and satisfying product for use once or twice a week (you shouldn&#x27;t use the same anti-dandruff product on a daily basis).</li>
            <li>Other than that - a very nice product that keeps your scalp relatively hydrated.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and leaves no citrusy scent behind, which is good for those who don&#x27;t want to smell like lemons in a crowd full of roses.  </li>
            <li>It adds a nice enhancement without overwhelming you with a fake lemon odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I got a chance to try out the CLEAR versions (Ocean Mineral and Citrus Fresh), I decided to take a chance on a brand that I had not tried before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>because it did work reasonably as a shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the conditioner is light enough to rinse out well.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really follow you out of the shower, and he&#x27;s a guy that doesn&#x27;t like a lot of scent.</li>
            <li>really I did,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I like Clear Citrus Fresh Hydration and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>They are making effective, affordable, everyday products.</li>
            <li>The contents imply this is a more natural product then standard shampoos, but I can not verify that.  </li>
            <li>My husband has tried other Clear products and liked them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is useful to note that the CLEAR brand has a decent pedigree (it&#x27;s from Unilever) - since I try not to experiment with chemicals from companies that I do not trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have found that, for my hair, this works better then other anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>suds were loose and I had to use a good bit on my very long hair.  </li>
            <li>The next morning my scalp still felt really clean.</li>
            <li>However, that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s made for, so after a few weeks I&#x27;ve found my hair to be in great shape, the minor dandruff I was experiencing has gone away.  </li>
            <li>This Clear Men Scalp &amp; Hair Shampoo was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>products arrived in decent packaging, and arrived safely with a little piece of cellophane tape to prevent spills.</li>
            <li>your scalp needs a little more attention, the professionals on The Doctors television show suggest lathering on the product, completing the rest of your shower routine and then rinsing.</li>
            <li>I’ve come to like this way of showering so much that I just use Clear as a body wash instead of a separate soap.</li>
            <li>It is pretty much the \\&quot;Irish</li>
            <li>The conditioner part of the shampoo does leave your hair with fewer tangles than a normal shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Even though, I don&#x27;t have a huge dandruff problem, I like to use dandruff shampoos to avoid flakes on my dark colored clothing.</li>
            <li>Not so with CLEAR!</li>
            <li>If it continues to perform as well as it has been, we may be just ditching the H&amp;S and going totally CLEAR!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this products and also the CLEAR Ultra Shea products!</li>
            <li>Of course I noticed the first time he used it because it had a scent completely different to what he had been using.</li>
            <li>reason why I think it is funny, is because it is such a subjective product.</li>
            <li>When in truth, someone else&#x27;s opinion may be exactly the oposite and it 100% valid for them in the same way your opinion is 100% valid for you.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried all the scents and types that H&amp;S has come out with over the years as well as other brands of dandruff shampoos that have hit the market, but we always continue to return to the original</li>
            <li>with nearly all Clear products, the lather is thick, the product rinses out with ease, and my hair was left gorgeous.</li>
            <li>when I added the [[ASIN:B00HSNWXVQ CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner]] to our assortment of shampoo, conditioner and body washes in the shower, he didn&#x27;t even notice.  </li>
            <li>I tried Clear.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner</li>
            <li>CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair</li>
            <li>Clear Men with Bio-Nutrium 10, a blend of 10 nutrients and botanical actives including ginseng, tea tree, and mint, helps prevent and control recurrence of itching and flaking associated with dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not so masculine that a woman will hesitate to use it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural scent.  </li>
            <li>got this shampoo/conditioner for my son because he&#x27;s at the age where he&#x27;s too old for fruity shampoos and needs something because he sweats and sometimes gets dandruff in his hair.</li>
            <li>I haven’t liked the thin shampoos or body washes.</li>
            <li>It would appear that leaving these products on your head a bit longer could mean better results for those who suffer from dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It left my hair extra-shiny, clean, and soft root to tip, and did not weigh it down, though it did look and feel like it had been conditioned.  </li>
            <li>2 in 1 products go too heavy on the conditioner for me, and leave my hair feeling less than fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Left my hair manageable and soft, but not too soft.  </li>
            <li>The one thing I desire the most in a men’s shampoo is a thick lather that will allow me to shampoo only once instead of having to apply, rinse, reapply and rinse again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our household is a big fan of Clear!</li>
            <li>The active ingredient is 1% of Pyrithione Zinc (plenty of other similar dandruff shampoos use this) and utilizes a blend of 10 other botanicals and nutrients that makes for a pleasing shampoo that lathers quickly even in small amounts and has a crisp, refreshing scent that lingers for a couple of hours afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it also has a flat end on the other side for conventional top dispensing.  </li>
            <li>This is my second time reviewing clear shampoo.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t hopeful about CLEAR especially since it had conditioner in it.</li>
            <li>With Clear I squeeze out a portion and whatever is left after putting some in my hair, I use as a body wash.</li>
            <li>I like the additional natural ingredients such as ginseng, tea tree, and mint to help rehydrate my scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li>The thick lather is the primary selling point for me.</li>
            <li>It never really cleared up my dandruff, and after a few tries, I had to retreat to my old standbys - which worked their magic, and cleared things up for</li>
            <li>This shampoo does clean hair, but it leaves the hair feeling limp with no body, so it&#x27;s not recommended for men (or women) with long hair.  </li>
            <li>differences between this one and the previous review is because the first one was the regular version vs this being the &amp;#34;Citrus</li>
            <li>I have a similar complaint with many other 2-in-1 products where the conditioning effect doesn&#x27;t quite satisfy.</li>
            <li>I have previously used much stronger formulations including the nuclear strength versions of Nizoral and Head+Shoulders.</li>
            <li>This is a gentle dandruff shampoo with a slight citrus scent.</li>

            <li> The shampoo works great at keeping dandruff issues under control and the citrus fragrance is a real pleasure to smell.  </li>
            <li> The smell is also a lot better.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice light citrusy scent to it, and lathers well.</li>
            <li> It was perfect for short hair as a conditioning agent, and controlled dandruff</li>
            <li> I will always remain convinced that separate shampoos and conditioners work better than a 2 in 1 product.  </li>
            <li> , Citrus Fresh Hydration\\&quot; is a very good shampoo/conditioner that works well on my dry scalp, and smells great.</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job cleaning the hair and adding softness and</li>
            <li> This particular shampoo gives a very nice lather.</li>
            <li> The citrus is not heavy, but it does stick around and my hair smelled great all day.  </li>
            <li> It smells kind of fresh, minty, citrus-y, with a background touch of rosemary.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any hydrating of the scalp, but I really loved the citrus scent.</li>
            <li> All in all, it is just a good product that works very well.</li>
            <li> The citrus smell is somewhat strong, but I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> He loved this product and highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> and it was fine, but I did use a conditioner afterwards</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one of the very best Clear products thus far!</li>
            <li> I think if you have dry, processed or damaged hair a conditioner is always better, but for hair that is already healthy this is a good pick.</li>
            <li> When you use this shampoo it has a light mens cologne scent combined with lemon.</li>
            <li> Overall a good brand and product and competitive in price to most of the mens products out there.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to control how much comes out and close it easily.</li>
            <li> Very fresh and innervating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how there is not merely a \\&quot;hint\\&quot; of citrus but a full blast of it.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job of hydrating his dry scalp so it doesn&#x27;t itch.</li>
            <li> The smell is very pleasing to the the whole family (that&#x27;s an amazing feat right there!).</li>
            <li> (I did have fly-aways everywhere, and could have benefited from some smoothing serum after using this, which is why I&#x27;m only giving it a 4.)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been quite impressed with this brand overall.  </li>
            <li> like I was walking through an orange grove, the same wonderful aroma that I got used to growing up in Southern California.</li>
            <li> My hair feels more soft, smooth, and manageable.  </li>
            <li> pleased, and I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> It is like someone is crushing fresh lemons right over</li>
            <li> (The strength of the scent is especially worth noting because I have found other CLEAR shampoos to be overly strong so this is a nice improvement.)  </li>
            <li> The scent is great – not overpowering, but far better than the typical medicated shampoo.</li>
            <li> that I tried two versions of this shampoo - Ocean Mineral and Citrus Fresh.</li>
            <li> I’m finding it to be just as effective as brands such as H&amp;S in controlling dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely one of our favorite scents in the CLEAR line of 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioners.</li>
            <li> Fresh Hydration&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clear Citrus Fresh Hydration shampoo for men passes that test.</li>
            <li> Of all of the scents I have used of the clear product line, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> As most of the Clear Men Scalp shampoos, it comes out of the bottle looking like Elmer&#x27;s Glue All.</li>
            <li> This dandruff shampoo works better than the other more well known brand.</li>
            <li> As far as cleansing he loved how it lathered and how it left his hair -- Clean, but soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to use a separate conditioning process to get my hair right.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers nicely, rinses our easily, doesn&#x27;t leave our hair heavy, stringy or dull-looking.  </li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to the traditional medicinal-smelling dandruff shampoos (such as H&amp;S).</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a fun shampoo, and my hair came out clean, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Clear Men Scalp &amp; Hair Citrus Fresh Hydration 2 in 1 Shampoo &amp; Conditioner is specially designed to control dandruff symptoms at the source and lock in hydration from the first wash.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t explain it other that it&#x27;s a fresh, clean, slightly manly scent, but not overpowering like some of the more popular products out there right now.</li>
            <li> think it is funny to review a product like shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of CLEAR products because they really clean your hair and scalp without stripping it and drying it out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have sulfur/tar in it, the active ingredient is  Pyrithione zinc, which is effective for controlling dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different shampoo brands and never found anything that really works well.</li>
            <li> As much of the review is identical, I am posting the first one below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Clear shampoos, and I thought they were good</li>
            <li> This CLEAR branded anti-dandruff 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner is a refreshing and satisfying product for use once or twice a week (you shouldn&#x27;t use the same anti-dandruff product on a daily basis).</li>
            <li> Other than that - a very nice product that keeps your scalp relatively hydrated.</li>
            <li> It lathers well and leaves no citrusy scent behind, which is good for those who don&#x27;t want to smell like lemons in a crowd full of roses.  </li>
            <li> It adds a nice enhancement without overwhelming you with a fake lemon odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I got a chance to try out the CLEAR versions (Ocean Mineral and Citrus Fresh), I decided to take a chance on a brand that I had not tried before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> because it did work reasonably as a shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the conditioner is light enough to rinse out well.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really follow you out of the shower, and he&#x27;s a guy that doesn&#x27;t like a lot of scent.</li>
            <li> really I did,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I like Clear Citrus Fresh Hydration and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> They are making effective, affordable, everyday products.</li>
            <li> The contents imply this is a more natural product then standard shampoos, but I can not verify that.  </li>
            <li> My husband has tried other Clear products and liked them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is useful to note that the CLEAR brand has a decent pedigree (it&#x27;s from Unilever) - since I try not to experiment with chemicals from companies that I do not trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found that, for my hair, this works better then other anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> suds were loose and I had to use a good bit on my very long hair.  </li>
            <li> The next morning my scalp still felt really clean.</li>
            <li> However, that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s made for, so after a few weeks I&#x27;ve found my hair to be in great shape, the minor dandruff I was experiencing has gone away.  </li>
            <li> This Clear Men Scalp &amp; Hair Shampoo was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> , I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> products arrived in decent packaging, and arrived safely with a little piece of cellophane tape to prevent spills.</li>
            <li> your scalp needs a little more attention, the professionals on The Doctors television show suggest lathering on the product, completing the rest of your shower routine and then rinsing.</li>
            <li> I’ve come to like this way of showering so much that I just use Clear as a body wash instead of a separate soap.</li>
            <li> It is pretty much the \\&quot;Irish</li>
            <li> The conditioner part of the shampoo does leave your hair with fewer tangles than a normal shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Even though, I don&#x27;t have a huge dandruff problem, I like to use dandruff shampoos to avoid flakes on my dark colored clothing.</li>
            <li> Not so with CLEAR!</li>
            <li> If it continues to perform as well as it has been, we may be just ditching the H&amp;S and going totally CLEAR!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this products and also the CLEAR Ultra Shea products!</li>
            <li> Of course I noticed the first time he used it because it had a scent completely different to what he had been using.</li>
            <li> reason why I think it is funny, is because it is such a subjective product.</li>
            <li> When in truth, someone else&#x27;s opinion may be exactly the oposite and it 100% valid for them in the same way your opinion is 100% valid for you.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried all the scents and types that H&amp;S has come out with over the years as well as other brands of dandruff shampoos that have hit the market, but we always continue to return to the original</li>
            <li> with nearly all Clear products, the lather is thick, the product rinses out with ease, and my hair was left gorgeous.</li>
            <li> when I added the [[ASIN:B00HSNWXVQ CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner]] to our assortment of shampoo, conditioner and body washes in the shower, he didn&#x27;t even notice.  </li>
            <li> I tried Clear.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner</li>
            <li> CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair</li>
            <li> Clear Men with Bio-Nutrium 10, a blend of 10 nutrients and botanical actives including ginseng, tea tree, and mint, helps prevent and control recurrence of itching and flaking associated with dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not so masculine that a woman will hesitate to use it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural scent.  </li>
            <li> got this shampoo/conditioner for my son because he&#x27;s at the age where he&#x27;s too old for fruity shampoos and needs something because he sweats and sometimes gets dandruff in his hair.</li>
            <li> I haven’t liked the thin shampoos or body washes.</li>
            <li> It would appear that leaving these products on your head a bit longer could mean better results for those who suffer from dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It left my hair extra-shiny, clean, and soft root to tip, and did not weigh it down, though it did look and feel like it had been conditioned.  </li>
            <li> 2 in 1 products go too heavy on the conditioner for me, and leave my hair feeling less than fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Left my hair manageable and soft, but not too soft.  </li>
            <li> The one thing I desire the most in a men’s shampoo is a thick lather that will allow me to shampoo only once instead of having to apply, rinse, reapply and rinse again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Our household is a big fan of Clear!</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is 1% of Pyrithione Zinc (plenty of other similar dandruff shampoos use this) and utilizes a blend of 10 other botanicals and nutrients that makes for a pleasing shampoo that lathers quickly even in small amounts and has a crisp, refreshing scent that lingers for a couple of hours afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it also has a flat end on the other side for conventional top dispensing.  </li>
            <li> This is my second time reviewing clear shampoo.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t hopeful about CLEAR especially since it had conditioner in it.</li>
            <li> With Clear I squeeze out a portion and whatever is left after putting some in my hair, I use as a body wash.</li>
            <li> I like the additional natural ingredients such as ginseng, tea tree, and mint to help rehydrate my scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li> The thick lather is the primary selling point for me.</li>
            <li> It never really cleared up my dandruff, and after a few tries, I had to retreat to my old standbys - which worked their magic, and cleared things up for</li>
            <li> This shampoo does clean hair, but it leaves the hair feeling limp with no body, so it&#x27;s not recommended for men (or women) with long hair.  </li>
            <li> differences between this one and the previous review is because the first one was the regular version vs this being the &amp;#34;Citrus</li>
            <li> I have a similar complaint with many other 2-in-1 products where the conditioning effect doesn&#x27;t quite satisfy.</li>
            <li> I have previously used much stronger formulations including the nuclear strength versions of Nizoral and Head+Shoulders.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle dandruff shampoo with a slight citrus scent.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, and I have a minor case of dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> Due to lots of outdoors activities such as hiking, swimming, and cycling, my scalp gets really dry and irritated, after repeated shampoo and blowdrying.  </li>
            <li> Once the hair is dry the scent doesn&#x27;t linger and isn&#x27;t too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner makes my hair feel not as dry, and doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy like some conditioning products.</li>
            <li> with any medication, I am loth to extrapolate their effectiveness from just my single experience - but for me it rated at-most an</li>
            <li> even like the bottle -- you can position it upside down without it toppling over to ensure you get every last bit of the shampoo before tossing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can stand it upside down so that you can get out the last bit of shampoo.</li>
            <li> Conditioner always seems to weigh my hair down and make it flat and greasy looking by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> After one week&#x27;s use, I noticed less dry scalp, itchiness, and flakes.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo&#x27;s texture feels vaguely medicinal, but it lathered on strongly even with our hard water, and I did not feel any lingering itchy residue after it had been washed</li>
            <li> Other than fragrance differences, they had identical effects on my scalp.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~A_E~</li>
            <li> Not that we both have to use the same product (we hardly ever do), but we both have to like the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> other half of the battle is how it lathers, how it weighs down the hair and how shiny it looks on the hair.  </li>
            <li> You can also leave it upside down without worrying about it all coming out when you want to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t weigh the hair down and after a month, seems to keep those unsightly flakes under control as well.</li>
            <li> I think--just that statement--is usually half our battle with shampoos and body washes.  </li>
            <li> I do also like the slight citrus scent.</li>
            <li> The Citrus Fresh hydration has a very faint citrus lemony scent.  </li>
            <li> I like to use 2 in 1 shampoos, because I am lazy.</li>
            <li> Usually shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Usually it&#x27;s a matter of whats on sale in the biggest bottle; so</li>
            <li> And the gels always seem to have clumps that slide off to the shower floor and make it dangerously slick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t either, but there haven&#x27;t been any negative effects</li>
            <li> I feel so weird saying</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an all in one shampoo.  It smells like oranges with a herbal note thrown in. It&#x27;s very nice for men but it&#x27;s not so masculine that a woman will hesitate to use it.  It&#x27;s a natural scent.  It&#x27;s not overly strong.&lt;br /&gt;The suds were loose and I had to use a good bit on my very long hair.  It felt nice and a bit cooling, from the tea tree oil and mint I think.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have sulfur/tar in it, the active ingredient is  Pyrithione zinc, which is effective for controlling dandruff.  I didn&#x27;t have a bi of itch and that held for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair extra-shiny, clean, and soft root to tip, and did not weigh it down, though it did look and feel like it had been conditioned.  (I did have fly-aways everywhere, and could have benefited from some smoothing serum after using this, which is why I&#x27;m only giving it a 4.)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been quite impressed with this brand overall.  They are making effective, affordable, everyday products.</li>
            <li> The fragrance?! It is unreal! So refreshing! I love how there is not merely a \\&quot;hint\\&quot; of citrus but a full blast of it. It is pretty much the \\&quot;Irish Spring\\&quot; of shampoos -- this product will WAKE YOU UP! It is like someone is crushing fresh lemons right over your head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with nearly all Clear products, the lather is thick, the product rinses out with ease, and my hair was left gorgeous. And, did I mention the delicious, invigorating aroma?! Superb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your scalp needs a little more attention, the professionals on The Doctors television show suggest lathering on the product, completing the rest of your shower routine and then rinsing. It would appear that leaving these products on your head a bit longer could mean better results for those who suffer from dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the very best Clear products thus far! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I like to use 2 in 1 shampoos, because I am lazy. Even though, I don&#x27;t have a huge dandruff problem, I like to use dandruff shampoos to avoid flakes on my dark colored clothing. I&#x27;ve tried other Clear shampoos, and I thought they were good shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried this one, don&#x27;t be put off by the citrus scent. When you use this shampoo it has a light mens cologne scent combined with lemon. Kind of like the lemon scent in lemon pledge, without the waxy smell. It makes for an invigorating shower and I like the way it smells. Once the hair is dry the scent doesn&#x27;t linger and isn&#x27;t too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fun shampoo, and my hair came out clean, soft and manageable. The next morning my scalp still felt really clean. I am happy with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have previously used much stronger formulations including the nuclear strength versions of Nizoral and Head+Shoulders. Both of these have been excellent at controlling my dandruff once it had been aggravated enough from lack of attention. When I got a chance to try out the CLEAR versions (Ocean Mineral and Citrus Fresh), I decided to take a chance on a brand that I had not tried before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is useful to note that the CLEAR brand has a decent pedigree (it&#x27;s from Unilever) - since I try not to experiment with chemicals from companies that I do not trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my experiences were mixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both products arrived in decent packaging, and arrived safely with a little piece of cellophane tape to prevent spills. The shampoo&#x27;s texture feels vaguely medicinal, but it lathered on strongly even with our hard water, and I did not feel any lingering itchy residue after it had been washed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the overall strength of neither version quite worked for me. It never really cleared up my dandruff, and after a few tries, I had to retreat to my old standbys - which worked their magic, and cleared things up for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any medication, I am loth to extrapolate their effectiveness from just my single experience - but for me it rated at-most an It&#x27;s Okay (3-stars) because it did work reasonably as a shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note that I tried two versions of this shampoo - Ocean Mineral and Citrus Fresh. Other than fragrance differences, they had identical effects on my scalp.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~A_E~</li>
            <li> I loved the fragrance of this one.  The citrus is not heavy, but it does stick around and my hair smelled great all day.  Usually shampoo and conditioner 2 in 1 products go too heavy on the conditioner for me, and leave my hair feeling less than fresh and clean.  Not a problem with this one, the conditioner is light enough to rinse out well.  Left my hair manageable and soft, but not too soft.  I find that if I use this in rotation with a tea tree oil product and a coal tar product, it helps control the dandruff and still leaves my hair looking good.  I&#x27;ll stick with the rotation, it seems to work for me.</li>
            <li> This CLEAR branded anti-dandruff 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner is a refreshing and satisfying product for use once or twice a week (you shouldn&#x27;t use the same anti-dandruff product on a daily basis). The active ingredient is 1% of Pyrithione Zinc (plenty of other similar dandruff shampoos use this) and utilizes a blend of 10 other botanicals and nutrients that makes for a pleasing shampoo that lathers quickly even in small amounts and has a crisp, refreshing scent that lingers for a couple of hours afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only nitpick with this product is the conditioner aspect. I have a similar complaint with many other 2-in-1 products where the conditioning effect doesn&#x27;t quite satisfy. You don&#x27;t get that nice, silky finish when rinsing out so on occasion I&#x27;ve had to use a separate conditioning process to get my hair right. Other than that - a very nice product that keeps your scalp relatively hydrated.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I are using this shampoo/conditioner.  Both of us love are impressed with the fragrance.  I think--just that statement--is usually half our battle with shampoos and body washes.  Not that we both have to use the same product (we hardly ever do), but we both have to like the fragrance.  It smells kind of fresh, minty, citrus-y, with a background touch of rosemary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other half of the battle is how it lathers, how it weighs down the hair and how shiny it looks on the hair.  This shampoo lathers nicely, rinses our easily, doesn&#x27;t leave our hair heavy, stringy or dull-looking.  Thumbs up from both of us!  This is a nice shampoo for when our scalps are a bit dry--even for every day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a dandruff-control shampoo, which acts like, smells like, lathers like, a regular 2-in-1 shampoo.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Inhad my brother try this product. He has dandruff and often complains about his shampoos. He loved this product and highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> Nothing works as well as Nizoral for me, but this one has a nice scent and conditioner. It&#x27;s probably best for those with mild dandruff.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to the traditional medicinal-smelling dandruff shampoos (such as H&amp;S). The scent is great – not overpowering, but far better than the typical medicated shampoo. Very nice lathering ability and I’m finding it to be just as effective as brands such as H&amp;S in controlling dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair a bit dryer than a non-medicated combo shampoo/conditioner, but nothing that I would consider to be problematic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even like the bottle -- you can position it upside down without it toppling over to ensure you get every last bit of the shampoo before tossing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased, and I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both tried this shampoo. I didn&#x27;t really notice any hydrating of the scalp, but I really loved the citrus scent. Very fresh and innervating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband really liked the scent as well. It doesn&#x27;t really follow you out of the shower, and he&#x27;s a guy that doesn&#x27;t like a lot of scent. As far as cleansing he loved how it lathered and how it left his hair -- Clean, but soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely one of our favorite scents in the CLEAR line of 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioners.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is not a picky person when it comes to buying shampoo.  Usually it&#x27;s a matter of whats on sale in the biggest bottle; so when I added the [[ASIN:B00HSNWXVQ CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner]] to our assortment of shampoo, conditioner and body washes in the shower, he didn&#x27;t even notice.  Of course I noticed the first time he used it because it had a scent completely different to what he had been using. I can&#x27;t explain it other that it&#x27;s a fresh, clean, slightly manly scent, but not overpowering like some of the more popular products out there right now. As for hydrating effects, he said he hasn&#x27;t noticed any change in feel and when I run my fingers through it I don&#x27;t either, but there haven&#x27;t been any negative effects so he&#x27;s happy to continue using it. As for myself, I used it in a pinch once and it was fine, but I did use a conditioner afterwards so it didn&#x27;t leave it&#x27;s manly scent on me. Overall a good brand and product and competitive in price to most of the mens products out there.</li>
            <li> This is my second time reviewing clear shampoo. As much of the review is identical, I am posting the first one below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The differences between this one and the previous review is because the first one was the regular version vs this being the &amp;#34;Citrus Fresh Hydration&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Largely, there is no use difference. they work identically. I have found that, for my hair, this works better then other anti-dandruff shampoo. I do also like the slight citrus scent. It adds a nice enhancement without overwhelming you with a fake lemon odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have short hair and only use enough to be the same size as a quarter, I find that a bottle lasts 5 months. Yes, that is with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a personal perspective, I highly recommend this. I have upgraded to 5 stars after using it for many months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------ORIGINAL REVIEW---------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is funny to review a product like shampoo. I want to say that up front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I think it is funny, is because it is such a subjective product. I my opinion it is like reviewing a color and trying to prove the merits it has over another color. When in truth, someone else&#x27;s opinion may be exactly the oposite and it 100% valid for them in the same way your opinion is 100% valid for you. So with that I review this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dandruff. I feel so weird saying that... and yet it is so liberating. I have tried many different shampoo brands and never found anything that really works well. For some reason I kept coming back to Head and Shoulders - which I&#x27;ll opening admit probably isn&#x27;t the greatest shampoo in general nor have I found it does the greatest job. But for some reason that is what I kept going back to when others didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried Clear. I initially liked that it doesn&#x27;t smell like a a prescription turned into shampoo. The contents imply this is a more natural product then standard shampoos, but I can not verify that.  I am also impressed that my hair feels more natural and (best of all) has reduced the amount of dandruff I have. Packaging wise, I like the top. It is very easy to control how much comes out and close it easily. You can also leave it upside down without worrying about it all coming out when you want to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about a week or so. I think that if I continue to use it, I may not have to admit that I have dandruff any more.  In fact, baring any change in things, i plan on buying more of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why only 4 stars? Well, it hasn&#x27;t totally got rid of my dandruff, though that may not be an overnight process. I&#x27;ll come back in a month or so and update this review and if things change i&#x27;ll rerate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: As I stated at the beginning, you need to try this for your self. You impressions of it may differ from mine.</li>
            <li> My husband has tried other Clear products and liked them.  This shampoo/conditioner is his favorite because of the great citrus scent, which not too strong as to be overpowering.  This product does a great job of hydrating his dry scalp so it doesn&#x27;t itch.</li>
            <li> When I poured this out and massaged it onto my head I felt, really I did, like I was walking through an orange grove, the same wonderful aroma that I got used to growing up in Southern California. That alone makes this nice.  However, that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s made for, so after a few weeks I&#x27;ve found my hair to be in great shape, the minor dandruff I was experiencing has gone away.  Very pleased, will make this my regular choice for shampoo/conditioner--which is the best sort of review I guess.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders has been a staple in our bathroom for more years that I&#x27;ll ever admit to. We&#x27;ve tried all the scents and types that H&amp;S has come out with over the years as well as other brands of dandruff shampoos that have hit the market, but we always continue to return to the original H&amp;S. I&#x27;ll be honest - I wasn&#x27;t hopeful about CLEAR especially since it had conditioner in it. Conditioner always seems to weigh my hair down and make it flat and greasy looking by the end of the day. Not so with CLEAR! We were all quite impressed with how it worked. It didn&#x27;t weigh the hair down and after a month, seems to keep those unsightly flakes under control as well. The smell is very pleasing to the the whole family (that&#x27;s an amazing feat right there!). If it continues to perform as well as it has been, we may be just ditching the H&amp;S and going totally CLEAR!</li>
            <li> Smells and works great to prevent flaking.</li>
            <li> The one thing I desire the most in a men’s shampoo is a thick lather that will allow me to shampoo only once instead of having to apply, rinse, reapply and rinse again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear Citrus Fresh Hydration shampoo for men passes that test. I was very pleased with the thickness of the foam that remained on the surface of my hair while I rubbed and massaged my head. The citrus scent was not objectionable. This product is a shampoo and conditioner with an anti-dandruff agent (zinc). It contains a blend of 10 nutrients including ginseng, tea tree and mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product claims include that it will hydrate the scalp and restore the moisture balance of your scalp. I find these claims too subjective to measure so will not make any judgment either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like Clear Citrus Fresh Hydration and would buy it again. The thick lather is the primary selling point for me.</li>
            <li> The Citrus Fresh hydration has a very faint citrus lemony scent.  The shampoo works great at keeping dandruff issues under control and the citrus fragrance is a real pleasure to smell.  Of all of the scents I have used of the clear product line, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle dandruff shampoo with a slight citrus scent. If your dandruff is severe you might need a stronger shampoo.  The conditioner part of the shampoo does leave your hair with fewer tangles than a normal shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself, functions well. You can stand it upside down so that you can get out the last bit of shampoo.</li>
            <li> Due to lots of outdoors activities such as hiking, swimming, and cycling, my scalp gets really dry and irritated, after repeated shampoo and blowdrying.  This Clear Men Scalp &amp; Hair Shampoo was exactly what I needed.  This shampoo comes with the now standard bottom dispenser but it also has a flat end on the other side for conventional top dispensing.  The citrus scent is fresh and pleasant.  I like the additional natural ingredients such as ginseng, tea tree, and mint to help rehydrate my scalp and hair.  After one week&#x27;s use, I noticed less dry scalp, itchiness, and flakes.  My hair feels more soft, smooth, and manageable.  I&#x27;ll definitely consider buying this shampoo in the future.</li>
            <li> This dandruff shampoo works better than the other more well known brand. My husband has used it for a month and really liked it. The smell is also a lot better. Our household is a big fan of Clear!</li>
            <li> I haven’t liked the thin shampoos or body washes. And the gels always seem to have clumps that slide off to the shower floor and make it dangerously slick. With Clear I squeeze out a portion and whatever is left after putting some in my hair, I use as a body wash. I’ve come to like this way of showering so much that I just use Clear as a body wash instead of a separate soap. I’m just as clean and leave smelling great- its as if I used an after shave or cologne.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner, Citrus Fresh Hydration\\&quot; is a very good shampoo/conditioner that works well on my dry scalp, and smells great. My hair is dry, and I have a minor case of dry scalp.  CLEAR Men Scalp and Hair 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner makes my hair feel not as dry, and doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy like some conditioning products. The citrus smell is somewhat strong, but I like it a lot. I haven&#x27;t noticed any flakes, and it works as well as the leading dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve used. All in all, it is just a good product that works very well. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This particular shampoo gives a very nice lather. It controls dandruff as good (or better?) than the name brand my husband traditionally uses. But best of all, I love the citrus scent. Recommended.</li>
            <li> My husband tends to have problems with product build up in his hair but this 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner does a good job of thoroughly cleaning his hair. It lathers nicely and I love the citrus scent.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice light citrusy scent to it, and lathers well. It was perfect for short hair as a conditioning agent, and controlled dandruff well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does clean hair, but it leaves the hair feeling limp with no body, so it&#x27;s not recommended for men (or women) with long hair.  It lathers well and leaves no citrusy scent behind, which is good for those who don&#x27;t want to smell like lemons in a crowd full of roses.  As most of the Clear Men Scalp shampoos, it comes out of the bottle looking like Elmer&#x27;s Glue All.</li>
            <li> Clear Men Scalp &amp; Hair Citrus Fresh Hydration 2 in 1 Shampoo &amp; Conditioner is specially designed to control dandruff symptoms at the source and lock in hydration from the first wash. Clear Men with Bio-Nutrium 10, a blend of 10 nutrients and botanical actives including ginseng, tea tree, and mint, helps prevent and control recurrence of itching and flaking associated with dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this shampoo/conditioner for my son because he&#x27;s at the age where he&#x27;s too old for fruity shampoos and needs something because he sweats and sometimes gets dandruff in his hair. I am a fan of CLEAR products because they really clean your hair and scalp without stripping it and drying it out. I would recommend this products and also the CLEAR Ultra Shea products! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I will always remain convinced that separate shampoos and conditioners work better than a 2 in 1 product.  But of the 2 in 1 products, this one seems to be one of the best.  It does a pretty good job cleaning the hair and adding softness and the scent is pleasant and fresh without being overpowering.  (The strength of the scent is especially worth noting because I have found other CLEAR shampoos to be overly strong so this is a nice improvement.)  I think if you have dry, processed or damaged hair a conditioner is always better, but for hair that is already healthy this is a good pick.</li>
