            <li>Very nice product, exceed my expectations.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very easy to transfer brushe, making it a very good family shared teeth cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>Good performance for a good price</li>
            <li>and it just stops working, to be fair</li>
            <li>Good item both for price and the way it works</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>I had a Pursonic Toothbrush before that I loved.  </li>
            <li>, However I do have to say that it&#x27;s not quite as good as the one I had before</li>
            <li>The 3 speeds are also good.</li>
            <li>It is well made and does a good job.</li>
            <li>Great product, top quality with all the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>nice, works well, and</li>
            <li>Comes with nice supply of spare brushes.</li>
            <li>The replaceable head falls off so easily!</li>
            <li>I would go for a better brand, this one doesn&#x27;t seem to be reliable.</li>
            <li>We love this toothbrush set.</li>
            <li>I love the timer, love the product.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t leave it off the charger for more than hour without it dying.</li>
            <li>could be more powereful.</li>
            <li>I find this toothbrush to be even better than the Braun that I had.  </li>
            <li>The buttons on it are more &amp;#34;inner&amp;#34; placed on this toothbrush, and the fact that it comes with 12 brush heads, makes it even easier than having to go to the drugstore to find replacements.</li>
            <li>Love the power, brush size,great to get around all teeth in looks and prices</li>
            <li>I love it, I hope I can find brush head replacements.</li>
            <li>It seems to me after years of using a oral b that the brissels should be shorter and stiffer for a better cleaning.</li>
            <li>You should be able to use a toothbrush for a couple months without going thru 4 brushgeads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to go shopping for another more reliable product</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Awesome better than expected</li>
            <li>Works great and a lot cheaper than my old sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It oscillating needs to be more powerful!</li>
            <li>There are three power setting and easy to change that</li>
            <li>Plenty of power and recharges very quickly.</li>
            <li>This one will do fine</li>
            <li>great item,ur teeth feel like u just came back from the dental hy and had ur teeth</li>
            <li>Whenever I tried the button it would flash in a sequence that I thought might be a warning light, so I tried looking for documentation to help troubleshoot, but no dice.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>but so far so good over all.</li>
            <li>This one really cleans my teeth and 12 HEADS!!!</li>
            <li>The timer is very useful</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a pain to clean</li>
            <li>good produce only thing I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>I would like to return for a full refund.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only good for the garbage.</li>
            <li>it will turn off automatically when I&#x27;m using it for 30 seconds even when the battery is full of charge</li>
            <li>other than that its great.</li>
            <li>more gentile action than another electric toothbrush that I have</li>
            <li>The 3 different settings of brushing is really nice (clean/sensitive/massage).  </li>
            <li>So far, all in all, I love this set up and for the price, it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li>The motor goes up and down speed wise and sometimes just goes off while in use.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>But...... when I first bought it I could leave it off the charger (if I traveled or just forgot) and it would work a couple days.</li>
            <li>Buy a sonicare my last one died after more than two years of use.</li>
            <li>As my son said with his first use-</li>
            <li>While I am not completely disappointed by this high powered rotary brush, it is not as ultra high powered as I had hoped</li>
            <li>It is powerful enough for me on the clean setting.  </li>
            <li>but I think I expected a bit more</li>
            <li>Really wanted to stay with this brand</li>
            <li>I really like the notification feature</li>
            <li>transaction, will buy from again &amp; would recommend to others, Thanks</li>
            <li>Some people have complained about that - but to me it&#x27;s a good idea.</li>
            <li>cleaned.price is much better than the other rechargeable i had .</li>
            <li>Must clean each tooth from the gum line extensively.  </li>
            <li>I tried letting it sit for a full charge, replacing the brush head, and thoroughly cleaning it multiple times (since what else is there to do?</li>
            <li>Worked great for a few months, then won&#x27;t hold a charge, even after careful cleaning.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for value and quality.</li>
            <li>other reviews that lead me to buy this in the first place are pretty positive, so maybe I just got one that&#x27;s defective.</li>
            <li>I needed a new oscillating toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I also do not care at all for the very soft brissels.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a freaking tooth brush, not a computer!), but it just kept acting more and more weird.</li>
            <li>I love everything about it- high power, small dock, extra heads.</li>
            <li>COMPLETELY QUIT WORKING....</li>
            <li>and I just would like it to be a bit stronger so that I don&#x27;t have to restart the three minute cycle of brushing a second time to feel like it has really done the job.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel like I just had a professional cleaning done.</li>
            <li>so you know to switch areas and how much of the 2 minutes is left.</li>
            <li>but it was no secret that this doesn&#x27;t have that extra bit like other brands do.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because the brushes need to be replaced every month because they loose sturdiness and get too soft.</li>

            <li> There&#x27;s nothing in the accompanying manual about what their light signals might mean, even though they do different things that really suggest they DO mean something.</li>
            <li> Its defective the motor keeps running from sometimes fast to slow to not running at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are the same stiffness / hardness of any other battery or electric tooth brush out there.</li>
            <li> This is was not a new.  </li>
            <li> The PURSONIC S330 did not have the power I expected.</li>
            <li> had other toothbrush Intellisonic, sucked.</li>
            <li> Not powerful in comparison to Rotadent</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy, not worth it.</li>
            <li> Shipping under the warranty is charged to the consumer so almost not worth the time and cost to get it replaced.</li>
            <li> This WAS semi-powerful until less than one month in when it broke...</li>
            <li> I had it for less than 5 months and it just stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I had this product for less than three months.  </li>
            <li> I still think it doesn&#x27;t hurt to share though, since it WAS pretty lame!</li>
            <li> Those that say the brush head bristles are to soft are wrong.</li>
            <li> but now it is dead.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> but I do have really hard water.</li>
            <li> The speed on it is slow and it gave out within 4 months....</li>
            <li> &amp; it is already broken</li>
            <li> broke and failed to turn on after 3 months of use - brush quality was poor - and the pulse mode was weak</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE!!</li>
            <li> you will made a big mistake!!it&#x27;s will automatic running at toninigt terrible!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, I had another brand it lasted 3 years, this model lasted 35 days then stopped working, very disappointed</li>
            <li> a bad product.and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite disappointed but based on others</li>
            <li> The brush case doesn&#x27;t stay on and the toothbrush base doesn&#x27;t have any cover or protective device.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s why I hate it.</li>
            <li> It comes with 12 x 4 color coded brush heads and a see-through cover to cover the brush heads, which goes on the charger along with the base.  </li>
            <li> Worthless!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is terrible, it has not performed up to expectations.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> good produce only thing I don&#x27;t like is while brushing your teeth the head part comes off. other than that its great.</li>
            <li> Good performance for a good price</li>
            <li> Great product, top quality with all the bells and whistles. Enough brushes to last a life time or close to. Would buy again..</li>
            <li> Not powerful in comparison to Rotadent but then again Rotadents quality has declined. Great for kids.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift for my son!</li>
            <li> This broke with in six months.</li>
            <li> This product is one I would reccomend to anyone. Bought this one for 4 kids of age 7 to 17 each with different tooth/mouth needs. Perfect for each.</li>
            <li> It gets two stars, one for each month it worked.  It quit and won&#x27;t take a charge now. I would go for a better brand, this one doesn&#x27;t seem to be reliable.</li>
            <li> more gentile action than another electric toothbrush that I have</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product</li>
            <li> Those that say the brush head bristles are to soft are wrong. They are the same stiffness / hardness of any other battery or electric tooth brush out there. The timer is very useful so you brush the required 2 minutes the dentist recommends. There are three power setting and easy to change that with just a push of the button. The big bonus here is that you get any were from 3 to 4 years of brush replacement heads included and its rechargeable so you never have to buy batteries. Highly recommended for value and quality.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush burned out.  This is was not a new.  Must have been refurbished.  Worthless!!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome better than expected</li>
            <li> this has already died on me</li>
            <li> When you apply pressure to your teeth it stops running.</li>
            <li> great item,ur teeth feel like u just came back from the dental hy and had ur teeth cleaned.price is much better than the other rechargeable i had .</li>
            <li> I needed a new oscillating toothbrush. Although it cleans well, it takes about 5min to do it. Must clean each tooth from the gum line extensively.  It oscillating needs to be more powerful!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, I had another brand it lasted 3 years, this model lasted 35 days then stopped working, very disappointed</li>
            <li> The PURSONIC S330 did not have the power I expected. While I am not completely disappointed by this high powered rotary brush, it is not as ultra high powered as I had hoped</li>
            <li> Totally awesome! had other toothbrush Intellisonic, sucked. This one really cleans my teeth and 12 HEADS!!!</li>
            <li> broke and failed to turn on after 3 months of use - brush quality was poor - and the pulse mode was weak</li>
            <li> We love this toothbrush set. It gives you that feeling like you just left the dentist&#x27;s office. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because the brushes need to be replaced every month because they loose sturdiness and get too soft. Also, it is cumbersome to travel with. The brush case doesn&#x27;t stay on and the toothbrush base doesn&#x27;t have any cover or protective device.</li>
            <li> Malfunctioned on the 5th month.  Customer Service for getting a replacement under the warranty is like looking for a needle in a haystack.</li>
            <li> I love the timer, love the product.  Very happy with it</li>
            <li> This product is terrible, it has not performed up to expectations. I had hoped to get thru the summer with it but now the on/off button is intermittent. I would like to return for a full refund. Please let me know how to do this.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Great deal.  Thank  you</li>
            <li> The speed on it is slow and it gave out within 4 months....do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Four months and it just stops working, to be fair it did not work all that well even when it was working. So now I have a $40 manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Good item both for price and the way it works</li>
            <li> nice, works well, and i like that i have replacement brushes! But...... when I first bought it I could leave it off the charger (if I traveled or just forgot) and it would work a couple days. Now after a year... I can&#x27;t leave it off the charger for more than hour without it dying. It&#x27;s also a pain to clean but I do have really hard water. So I&#x27;m torn on it. It&#x27;s good but I think I expected a bit more</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Works great and a lot cheaper than my old sonic toothbrush. Update July 1, 2015 COMPLETELY QUIT WORKING....NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE!!</li>
            <li> Have only used this toothbrush for not even 90 days &amp; it is already broken it will not charge. The lights don&#x27;t even come on.</li>
            <li> This WAS semi-powerful until less than one month in when it broke...</li>
            <li> I had it for less than 5 months and it just stopped working.  It was great while it worked but now it is dead.  It should have lasted longer than 5 months.</li>
            <li> could be more powereful.</li>
            <li> I bought 4, one for each of my children. Three of the four are all working properly. One, however, is no longer holding a charge. I need to have it returned and exchanged.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t working around 3 months don&#x27;t chioce you will made a big mistake!!it&#x27;s will automatic running at toninigt terrible!</li>
            <li> I had a Pursonic Toothbrush before that I loved.  Really wanted to stay with this brand and I am happy with the price that I paid, However I do have to say that it&#x27;s not quite as good as the one I had before but so far so good over all. This one will do fine and I just would like it to be a bit stronger so that I don&#x27;t have to restart the three minute cycle of brushing a second time to feel like it has really done the job.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My teeth feel like I just had a professional cleaning done. I really like the notification feature so you know to switch areas and how much of the 2 minutes is left.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Worked great for a few months, then won&#x27;t hold a charge, even after careful cleaning. Don&#x27;t buy, not worth it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this toothbrush.  Comes with nice supply of spare brushes.</li>
            <li> Excellent tooth brush! Plenty of power and recharges very quickly. Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Tried to return this item which is not working properly. The motor goes up and down speed wise and sometimes just goes off while in use.&lt;br /&gt;Very inconsistent and annoying,&lt;br /&gt;Wrote to the seller voicing my dissatisfaction  &amp;#34;The thing is defective&amp;#34;  and I was told I cannot return it because it is a health product and it cannot be returned. What?  they want to sell it to someone else? Its defective the motor keeps running from sometimes fast to slow to not running at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally dumbfounded at their attitude and response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a bad product.and it seems I&#x27;m stuck with it. It&#x27;s only good for the garbage.</li>
            <li> I find this toothbrush to be even better than the Braun that I had.  The buttons on it are more &amp;#34;inner&amp;#34; placed on this toothbrush, and the fact that it comes with 12 brush heads, makes it even easier than having to go to the drugstore to find replacements.</li>
            <li> it will turn off automatically when I&#x27;m using it for 30 seconds even when the battery is full of charge and I have to keep turning it back on every 30 seconds so that&#x27;s why I hate it.</li>
            <li> I used this toothbrush for the first time this past weekend. While it does the job, it seems &amp;#34;rougher&amp;#34; than my last electric toothbrush. I will probably opt for a different brand when it is time to replace it.</li>
            <li> The item work great,&lt;br /&gt;Excellent transaction, will buy from again &amp; would recommend to others, Thanks</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I would buy it again</li>
            <li> great product very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> I had this product for less than three months.  Bought in march and in june I charged the toothbrush.  I went to use it.  It wouldn&#x27;t stop vibrating until the battery totally discharged.  Now it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Buy a sonicare my last one died after more than two years of use. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I thought oh great 12 brushheads. Well I get to throw nine out!!</li>
            <li> Great product at an affordable price!</li>
            <li> This item is very attractive all around.  It comes with 12 x 4 color coded brush heads and a see-through cover to cover the brush heads, which goes on the charger along with the base.  The 3 different settings of brushing is really nice (clean/sensitive/massage).  It is powerful enough for me on the clean setting.  The color is very attractive also.  The included 12 brush heads is a very nice bonus.  So far, all in all, I love this set up and for the price, it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li> Bought this toothbrush about a month ago and it already stopped working. Shipping under the warranty is charged to the consumer so almost not worth the time and cost to get it replaced. Stay away from this product...</li>
            <li> It stopped working about 2 months after I bought it. It would go on for a second, then stutter and stop. Whenever I tried the button it would flash in a sequence that I thought might be a warning light, so I tried looking for documentation to help troubleshoot, but no dice. There&#x27;s nothing in the accompanying manual about what their light signals might mean, even though they do different things that really suggest they DO mean something. I tried letting it sit for a full charge, replacing the brush head, and thoroughly cleaning it multiple times (since what else is there to do? It&#x27;s a freaking tooth brush, not a computer!), but it just kept acting more and more weird. I finally gave up and put it back in its box, at which point it turned on and wouldn&#x27;t stop until it ran through the charge. I thought someone was trying to drill through my wall until I remembered I had put it back in the box in the closet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reviews that lead me to buy this in the first place are pretty positive, so maybe I just got one that&#x27;s defective. I still think it doesn&#x27;t hurt to share though, since it WAS pretty lame!</li>
            <li> Love the power, brush size,great to get around all teeth in looks and prices</li>
            <li> I love it, I hope I can find brush head replacements.</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush ever&lt;br /&gt;would buy from this seller again</li>
            <li> I think it works properly but I do not like the timer shutting off before I am through. I also do not care at all for the very soft brissels. It seems to me after years of using a oral b that the brissels should be shorter and stiffer for a better cleaning. I would not buy another one. After using this for a couple mounths I threw it in the trash. The brush heads quit working soon after changing them. You should be able to use a toothbrush for a couple months without going thru 4 brushgeads. What an absolute waste of money.</li>
            <li> The motor burnt out after 5 months.  Guess I&#x27;ll have to go shopping for another more reliable product</li>
            <li> As my son said with his first use- it feels like you just went for a cleaning- it&#x27;s very easy to transfer brushe, making it a very good family shared teeth cleaning brush. The 3 speeds are also good. Love it</li>
            <li> Very nice product, exceed my expectations.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush does not work. Toothbrush heads keep popping off when you turn it on.  Tried almost all the heads and they had the same issue.</li>
            <li> The replaceable head falls off so easily! I love everything about it- high power, small dock, extra heads.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in May 2015 and worked perfectly.  Now it&#x27;s August and it stop working at all.  Don&#x27;t recommend....</li>
            <li> Great while it lasted... I purchased this for my 9yo daughter and was very happy with it until yesterday.  We&#x27;ve had the product about 4.5 months and it just gave out. I&#x27;m quite disappointed but based on others reviews contacting the seller will be of no help.</li>
            <li> It is well made and does a good job. I personally would have preferred a larger head but it was no secret that this doesn&#x27;t have that extra bit like other brands do. I don&#x27;t mind at all that it hesitates when you are supposed to switch mouth quardrants. Some people have complained about that - but to me it&#x27;s a good idea.</li>
