            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I have grown to love the smell, and look forward to using this every day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I am absolutely in love with Andalou Naturals products.</li>
            <li>I will be able to tell more after using it for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>love this body lotion.</li>
            <li>Love this body lotion.</li>
            <li>and I only have wonderful things to say about it.</li>
            <li>It is simply magical.</li>
            <li>I am now looking on Amazon for more of the Andalou products for aging skin.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy and lovely in application.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and moisturizes well with a light scent that&#x27;s really nice!</li>
            <li>I love the lotion however the top pump keeps falling off and can&#x27;t be easily opened/closed.</li>
            <li>I love that it is cruelty-free, gluten free, and</li>
            <li>I have a problem with scents being too strong.</li>
            <li>A light pleasant scent with a high degree of moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This lotion has a light fragrance.</li>
            <li>Wish they had been available when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>Not strong or headache-inducing, just perfect.</li>
            <li>It has a nice gentle smell when you first apply it</li>
            <li>This stuff smells good enough to eat, but I wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lotion.</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on nicely and I can resume activity within a minute or so after application; it doesn&#x27;t leave any grease residue and keeps my mature skin well moisturized, including my feet and elbows.</li>
            <li>Good smell, but I johoba oil and a little olive oil to make it more moist.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes my hands, absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>and it dissipates quickly after application (</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>Smells a bit sweet but dissipates pretty quick.</li>
            <li>But I think it&#x27;s worth every dime.</li>
            <li>You can see the change right away.</li>
            <li>Hands down my FAVORITE face wash!</li>
            <li>We live in a golden age of skin care products.</li>
            <li>I like the texture, the fact that it soaks in straight away, and soothes my winter skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Smell is not too overpowering, absorbs pretty fast, skin feels moisturized and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells nice, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This is my new face wash!</li>
            <li>By far, this has become one of my favorite lotions; enough so it has become the only lotion I use since I found it about 3-4 years ago.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought the scent might be too fruity, like a cream-scicle, but the scent becomes more subtle over time.</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle of lotion at a local health food store because it was on sale and my normal product was out of stock.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>but it can only be applied a certain number of times per day.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and creamy but not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin completely and does not leave your skin feeling greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>In just a few days, I was able to notice a difference in my skin, especially my hands ( I am 58 years old).  </li>
            <li>Would purchase the product again because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I alternate every other day with use of my own custom mixed lotions with added essential oils to stretch the Andalou out longer.</li>
            <li>It beats out my previous name brand lotions and I feel its well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I am a 61 year old woman with dry hands.  </li>

            <li> Love the mandarin vanilla smell!  Rubs in well and love that it has a great EWG rating which means non-toxic and good for your largest organ on your body (SKIN).  Vote with your dollars!</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin and smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a light fragrance. I have a problem with scents being too strong. This is refreshing.  My skin feels very soft and not at all greasy. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Does not leave you greasy either.</li>
            <li> Perfect product.  Amazing.  Just so nice!  You can see the change right away.</li>
            <li> tried every cruelty free lotion around--this is the best</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good enough to eat, but I wouldn&#x27;t. HA!</li>

            <li> We live in a golden age of skin care products. I have tried everything from expensive department store brands to drug store brands and they are all fabulous! Wish they had been available when I was a teenager. Hooray for science!&lt;br /&gt;However, I am absolutely in love with Andalou Naturals products. I bought my first bottle of lotion at a local health food store because it was on sale and my normal product was out of stock. So glad I did! It is by far the best lotion I have ever used. My skin has never looked healthier! Granted, it is pricey and that can be a deal breaker for some. But I think it&#x27;s worth every dime. I alternate every other day with use of my own custom mixed lotions with added essential oils to stretch the Andalou out longer.</li>
            <li> I love the lotion however the top pump keeps falling off and can&#x27;t be easily opened/closed.</li>

            <li> I went to our local health food store &amp; asked if they had a product to ease the symptoms of eczema.  My daughter suffers from it on her hands &amp; eyelids and the itch is tormenting.  She has a topical prescription for it from the Dermatologist but it can only be applied a certain number of times per day.  She reserves these times for morning &amp; bedtime.  In between, this lotion has been wonderful. She handles money and change and we think that the daily and constant exposure to nickel at work caused the eczema to begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sales clerk at Roots Market in my town recommended it and my daughter loves it and says that it eases the eczema on her hands.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> love this body lotion. I have been using it for several years. Very refreshing and seems to moisturize well.</li>
            <li> Hands down my FAVORITE face wash! Scent is nice and not over powering. My face looks smoother, fresher. This is my new face wash!</li>

            <li> I have been using this lotion for over a month and I only have wonderful things to say about it. I work at an archives with a lot of paper and until I found this Andalou lotion, I couldn&#x27;t find a product that could help my hands recover. It is simply magical. It moisturizes my hands, absorbs quickly and it has none of the bad chemicals. Plus it smells nice, but not overwhelming. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lotion.</li>
            <li> I am a 61 year old woman with dry hands.  I have tried many products and this one works the best for me.  So soothing.  It has a very light fresh fragrance.  I am now looking on Amazon for more of the Andalou products for aging skin.</li>

            <li> Good smell, but I johoba oil and a little olive oil to make it more moist.  Would purchase the product again because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
