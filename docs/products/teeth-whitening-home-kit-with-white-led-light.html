            <li>Glad that this product is on amazon.</li>
            <li>I found the mouthpieces easy to use, and they are comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>Yeah you have this goop in your mouth and the trays don&#x27;t really fit</li>
            <li>People I have to say it works and the price is fabulous.</li>
            <li>The led light didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>the led light never worked again after the first time</li>
            <li>really well I saw a difference within the first day of use!</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t even use more than twice of the medication because the first day i thought my body has never been introduce to this product that is why i am experiencing this headaches (severe)and tooth aches but the second time</li>

            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>fast delivery, Gel too abrasive.</li>

            <li>Worked pretty fast, not harsh.</li>
            <li>Also the black light comes in handy if you have pets and are looking for hidden &amp;#34;messes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sort of skeptical on how effective that part of it is, but have used the system with and without the light and can tell a difference.</li>
            <li>Came with everything, came quick, giving 4 stars because the teeth whitening pen had enough for one use and stopped working.</li>
            <li>If you buy this product you should prepare for headaches at night and teeth pain at the same at night when sleeping .i couldn&#x27;t sleep the first day i used this product</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums and was concerned this would feel like some type of torture device for war crime confessions...</li>
            <li>I was surprised</li>
            <li>I had 2 tubes that were old and crystallized.  </li>
            <li>It has made my teeth sensitive after about a week of initial use.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have sensitive gums and was concerned this would feel like some type of torture device for war crime confessions... I was surprised when I found this not only was painless but totally works. I don&#x27;t use it daily but I find one use every two weeks and my teeth are surprisingly whiter. Yeah you have this goop in your mouth and the trays don&#x27;t really fit but all in all it works and for the price who will argue! Also the black light comes in handy if you have pets and are looking for hidden &amp;#34;messes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Works ok. Complicated directions. The print is too small.</li>
            <li> Definately see a difference on my teeth.. i use it once a week and they went from baby yellow to peaarly white</li>
            <li> My teeth have never been so white!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t follow reviews .This product works but not a 100% teeth whitening.If you buy this product you should prepare for headaches at night and teeth pain at the same at night when sleeping .i couldn&#x27;t sleep the first day i used this product is doing you more good than harm .severe headache and tooth pain jeez it is so painful .i couldn&#x27;t even use more than twice of the medication because the first day i thought my body has never been introduce to this product that is why i am experiencing this headaches (severe)and tooth aches but the second time it was worse .So i stop using it .They have quality items in the package which is not in the image .its a good company tho,</li>
            <li> Works really well I saw a difference within the first day of use!</li>
            <li> Works very well I ruined my tray I like the results by just brushing with gel</li>
            <li> The bleach works well.  I had 2 tubes that were old and crystallized.  Ask about manufacturing dates before purchase.  Other sellers will provide that information if this one can not.</li>
            <li> Amazin works in 2-3 days!!! I dedd buy again and i just ordered one for my brother</li>
            <li> fast delivery, Gel too abrasive. Use carefully or your gums will hurt.. Teeth trays very generic</li>
            <li> With one us my husband notice a big difference and asked me to buy him one</li>
            <li> Sort of but the led light never worked again after the first time so i stopped using it i would really like a refund!</li>
            <li> This product did not work after using as directed &amp; even increasing the number of usages to 2 times per day. I burned my gums turning them white for 10 minutes, but I saw no difference in my teeth. The good news is that it arrived on schedule.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work, but am happy with the product. I&#x27;m not very good at doing things regularly, multiple times a day, so I ended up doing just once a day most days with this. I found the mouthpieces easy to use, and they are comfortable to wear. I question how well a battery powered blue led light works - it looks like something you&#x27;d get at the dollar store. I&#x27;m sort of skeptical on how effective that part of it is, but have used the system with and without the light and can tell a difference. Not a bright white blind you when I&#x27;m smiling across the room difference, but enough to get rid of coffee stains and brighten things up naturally.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t mention anything on the box but, this is not for use with dogs.&lt;br /&gt;Just so you know.  I think it&#x27;s for humans only.</li>
            <li> No results for me at all.. I have tried the crest whiting kit, but it only made my gum white and sting while this one didn&#x27;t do anything didn&#x27;t even make my gums white. If it works for some people great. Since it beats the price when you get from a dentist which is over hundred dollars. I&#x27;m starting think my teeth aren&#x27;t made for whiting.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work like they said it would!</li>
            <li> People I have to say it works and the price is fabulous. My teeth look so good now</li>
            <li> Came with everything, came quick, giving 4 stars because the teeth whitening pen had enough for one use and stopped working. Will update with pictures in a week or so!</li>
            <li> I can see the change instantly. Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Just using it as directed. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty fast, not harsh.</li>
            <li> works like a charm...arrived ontime  and is working find</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with led light even though it said it does packing is completely different from pictures the picture are completely inaccurate and the case for the trays are empty in other words i have no trays so I cannot use the item I paid for and a little tid bit the instructions are confusing tiny and inaccurate also don&#x27;t believe the picture either</li>
            <li> Works as advertized.  I am 61 and a long time coffee drinker as well as smoker. (smoke very little these days, but still...)  It has made my teeth sensitive after about a week of initial use.  Now I just use it every 2 or 3 days to maintain the whitening.  Will be ordering more gel soon.</li>
            <li> The led light didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Received everything listed in a nice sealed retail box. I am following the instructions and already getting results. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of gimmicks and such before without getting the results that they say you&#x27;ll get, but I can say that after a week of using the kit, my teeth have gotten whiter by a noticeable amount. It&#x27;s incredible! Glad that this product is on amazon.</li>
