    <ol>
            <li>It smells simply wonderful!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li>The product is AWESOME when it DOES work, but after the nosel breaks, you can&#x27;t use it any more...issue with Pravana packaging...</li>
            <li>Best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>manufacturer is awesome, by the way.</li>
            <li>In spite of this, it is still the best Ive ever used and increases the volume of my hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s especially good for volumizing, but unnatural feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price, but I&#x27;m not all about buying things over and over because of faulty packaging.</li>
            <li>Really great product, I always keep a bottle on hand.  </li>
            <li>I loved it when it worked.</li>
            <li>It smells good too.</li>
            <li>Love it and the company is great.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this product!</li>
            <li>I have fine blond hair which shows oil easily, and this has been the best product I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>The scent of this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I am kind of upset because my hair salon charged me $21 for this defective product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A new bottle would be awesome!!!</li>
            <li>Ok, I had to edit this one.</li>
            <li>most of the time.</li>
            <li>It felt more like</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything and will never be able to get any more out.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for a long time and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>: This dry shampoo is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This product is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Other than that, its a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>It is important to keep it off of the scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken off the top, run hot  Water over it, soaked it</li>
            <li>I take the sprayer top off and rinse it in hot water then blow on it to get the product out.  </li>
            <li>Works great as a shampoo on second day hair or as a texturizer on freshly washed hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried approximately 7 different brands, and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>and I tried hers and loved it instantly, so</li>
            <li>So I ended up with two full cans that I cant use.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, I have two full cans I can not use.</li>
            <li>It smells great and allows me to wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li>Great product, well worth the price over other brands for the smell alone!</li>
            <li>The top easily comes off and pushes right back on after cleaning it.</li>
            <li>am not crazy about the scent either...</li>
            <li>i prefer the spray bottles over the powder as I find them easier to use as I am pretty &amp;</li>
            <li>The first time it worked ok, but the second time and thereafter, it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It brushes out and certainly is easier on my hair and breathing than hair spray.</li>
            <li>My new bottle can&#x27;t get here soon enough :)</li>
            <li>Regardless of what they&#x27;re listing as ingredients, I found this to be very drying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also did not seem to help with my hair oil as much...</li>
            <li>It works for my style (long, wavy, full in back and top).</li>
            <li>I can remove the top of the sprayer and run hot water through it to improve the output but it is still not adequate, not to mention a hassle.</li>
            <li>My first bottle stopped spraying after only two uses, and when I contacted them about it, they sent me another one right away.</li>
            <li>Initially I was pleased, minimal white residue that was easy to brush away.</li>
            <li>I like this product mainly for it&#x27;s volume and scent on my non-hair wash days</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does work really well, as far as controlling oil, and odor.</li>
            <li>From the first use, the nozzle was clogged and barely sprayed at all.</li>
            <li>I love that this dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair new life on the &amp;#34;second day&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It took me a couple of months to report it because I only needed to use the product once a week and the first time</li>
            <li>It stops spraying with more than half of the product left in the bottle.</li>
            <li>2 stars b/c with more than half the bottle left, it has clogged.  </li>
            <li>I only use it for special occasions or when my hair is particularly flat from oils.</li>
            <li>however, these are the pitfalls of dry shampoos, right?  </li>
            <li>I am on my 3rd bottle and i have not had that experience; all of my bottles I was able to get to as empty as possible.</li>
            <li>Almost like a urinal cake with a hint of old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>I have thinning hair, and Pravana makes it look thick and healthy without smelling like spray paint.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with dry shampoo, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it</li>
            <li>i will most likely try some other dry shampoos to compare.</li>
            <li>so I used the other can, which worked the first time as well.</li>
            <li>It did a nice job of adding volume even though my hair is thick and heavy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to trying some new dry shampoos!</li>
            <li>My hairdresser and a lot of other reviews remark that this product will get to half way full and then will not spray anymore.</li>

            <li> This stuff is awesome...best dry shampoo for dark hair, no white residue</li>
            <li> I still have half a can of this left!?!?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, but the packaging is terrible.</li>
            <li> Bottle cap broke only a few times into using it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn your hair grey, or dull the color, like other dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> People complained that it quits spraying after several uses.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it would tone down the scent.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and this worked well on it.</li>
            <li> The problem is, it&#x27;s an aerosol can of harsh, drying chemicals.</li>
            <li> It does create a bit of a messy or beachy look so that can be a benefit or not depending on your hair.</li>
            <li> Waste of money for a few uses.</li>
            <li> The main issue I have with this product is it smells SOOO weird!</li>
            <li> The ingredients in the product are prone to clogging the small opening where the spray comes out.</li>
            <li> I seriously cant use it..</li>
            <li> it does have a scent and it creates a tacky consistency, which isn&#x27;t bad necessarily.</li>
            <li> My son has very thick hair and when he doesn&#x27;t wash well (or at all)</li>
            <li> Sad :</li>
            <li> Not only do they sell defective products, but the customer service is horrible.</li>
            <li> a hair spray gone wrong.</li>
            <li> canister is horrible, as others have noted.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Edit: Ok, I had to edit this one. It&#x27;s a great product, but the packaging is terrible. I seriously cant use it.. Last time I bought a bottle, I only got ONE use out of it. It&#x27;s a great price, but I&#x27;m not all about buying things over and over because of faulty packaging. Sad :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original: This dry shampoo is the best I have ever used. It smells great and allows me to wash my hair every other day. It is drying, but that wears off for me after I wash it. I have fine blond hair which shows oil easily, and this has been the best product I&#x27;ve found. The only gripe- there was about a quarter of the product left in the bottle when the aersol ran out, leaving me with a bottle that I couldnt use! Other than that, its a wonderful product. My new bottle can&#x27;t get here soon enough :)</li>
            <li> I received compliments on my \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; when I was using this.  It smells simply wonderful!  The problem is, it&#x27;s an aerosol can of harsh, drying chemicals. Regardless of what they&#x27;re listing as ingredients, I found this to be very drying.</li>
            <li> Really great product, I always keep a bottle on hand.  Works great as a shampoo on second day hair or as a texturizer on freshly washed hair.  My only issue is it smells kinda chemically.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with dry shampoo, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;It does work really well, as far as controlling oil, and odor. My son has very thick hair and when he doesn&#x27;t wash well (or at all) it has an odor to it. I sprayed this on his head, and even the next day, it smelled fresh.&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon is unbeatable...$4?? I am kind of upset because my hair salon charged me $21 for this defective product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;The canister is horrible, as others have noted. From the first use, the nozzle was clogged and barely sprayed at all. I probably used it about 5 times before it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;I am not crazy about the scent either...it&#x27;s a bit strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to trying some new dry shampoos!</li>
            <li> This product is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried approximately 7 different brands, and this is by far the best. It doesn&#x27;t turn your hair grey, or dull the color, like other dry shampoos. It volumizes. It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser and a lot of other reviews remark that this product will get to half way full and then will not spray anymore. I am on my 3rd bottle and i have not had that experience; all of my bottles I was able to get to as empty as possible. i prefer the spray bottles over the powder as I find them easier to use as I am pretty &amp;#34;hair challenged&amp;#34; most of the time.</li>
            <li> A stylist friend of mine uses this and I tried hers and loved it instantly, so I bought a bottle for myself. After only 2 uses, the sprayer stopped working. I can remove the top of the sprayer and run hot water through it to improve the output but it is still not adequate, not to mention a hassle.</li>
            <li> I purchased two cans of Pravana Dry Shampoo and both cans ended up defective, specifically, the nozzle thing you press to make spray come out did not spray in a mist, rather it comes out like a squirt and then not at all. So I ended up with two full cans that I cant use. The first time it worked ok, but the second time and thereafter, it didn&#x27;t. It took me a couple of months to report it because I only needed to use the product once a week and the first time, it worked, the second time, it didn&#x27;t so I used the other can, which worked the first time as well. The third time, neither worked and I think I waited a couple of weeks afterwards to contact the seller. I was basically told, there is nothing they can do because the return period had expired. Meanwhile, I have two full cans I can not use. I will never buy from this seller again. Not only do they sell defective products, but the customer service is horrible.</li>
            <li> The main issue I have with this product is it smells SOOO weird! Almost like a urinal cake with a hint of old lady perfume. And it never went away! I applied it to my hair and even two hairs later I could smell it when I turned my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also did not seem to help with my hair oil as much... It felt more like a hair spray gone wrong.</li>
            <li> It does&#x27;nt smell anything like Lilac as advertised. There is nothing in it. Just Alcohol and some mediciny cabinet odor. It&#x27;s a piece of s..t.</li>
            <li> I still have half a can of this left!?!? I loved it when it worked. I can&#x27;t get the product to come out now. I&#x27;ve taken off the top, run hot  Water over it, soaked it, I can&#x27;t think of anything else to do. A new bottle would be awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I have bought this same product three times and every time the nosel for the spray breaks. It stops spraying with more than half of the product left in the bottle. The product is AWESOME when it DOES work, but after the nosel breaks, you can&#x27;t use it any more...issue with Pravana packaging...</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome...best dry shampoo for dark hair, no white residue</li>
            <li> I like this product mainly for it&#x27;s volume and scent on my non-hair wash days (I only wash it every 2 days). It&#x27;s just the texture I can&#x27;t stand. So when I use it I just try to not touch it because it feels too matte or dry and isn&#x27;t pliable. I only use it for special occasions or when my hair is particularly flat from oils. It does create a bit of a messy or beachy look so that can be a benefit or not depending on your hair. It works for my style (long, wavy, full in back and top).</li>
            <li> I love that this dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue. Best one I&#x27;ve ever used. I could do without the chemical smell, but we can&#x27;t have everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer is awesome, by the way. My first bottle stopped spraying after only two uses, and when I contacted them about it, they sent me another one right away. A+ customer service.</li>
            <li> Love it and the company is great.  This stuff is amazing. I have used it for a long time and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo gets rid of all the oil in my hair and one application keeps the oil from coming back for days. It smells good too. The one caveat to this is that the hair does get a little too dry if you use too much. I use the Bamboo oil micromist on the ends to counteract this. In spite of this, it is still the best Ive ever used and increases the volume of my hair.</li>
            <li> as a dry shampoo, it works well and does not leave a white residue at all. I just wish it would tone down the scent. it does have a scent and it creates a tacky consistency, which isn&#x27;t bad necessarily. it&#x27;s especially good for volumizing, but unnatural feeling. would i get it again? i will most likely try some other dry shampoos to compare.</li>
            <li> My stylist recently gave me a small trial bottle of Pravana Fresh dry shampoo. I fell in love with this product! Gives my hair new life on the &amp;#34;second day&amp;#34;. I have thinning hair, and Pravana makes it look thick and healthy without smelling like spray paint. The scent of this stuff is amazing. Nothing chemical about it. Great product, well worth the price over other brands for the smell alone!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have long thick hair and this worked well on it. It did a nice job of adding volume even though my hair is thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> Initially I was pleased, minimal white residue that was easy to brush away. A bit over-drying, leaving my hair feel like straw...however, these are the pitfalls of dry shampoos, right?  2 stars b/c with more than half the bottle left, it has clogged.  I&#x27;ve tried everything and will never be able to get any more out.  Waste of money for a few uses.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  People complained that it quits spraying after several uses.  I take the sprayer top off and rinse it in hot water then blow on it to get the product out.  Works fine.  I have had the same problem with other dry shampoo product and hairsprays.  The ingredients in the product are prone to clogging the small opening where the spray comes out. The top easily comes off and pushes right back on after cleaning it.</li>
            <li> Bottle cap broke only a few times into using it</li>
            <li> I use this for body and it works. It is important to keep it off of the scalp. It brushes out and certainly is easier on my hair and breathing than hair spray.</li>
