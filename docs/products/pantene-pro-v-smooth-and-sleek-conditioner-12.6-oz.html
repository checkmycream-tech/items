    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>this is definitely a wonderful option and improvement.</li>
            <li>Please note that this conditioner works as it&#x27;s best after you use</li>
            <li>in all... if you don&#x27;t expect smoothing miracles, it&#x27;s a great conditioner.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my daughter and she says it works great on her hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a great scent, &amp; feels like silk (no kidding here) when putting it in your hair.  </li>
            <li>I was very impressed at the smooth look and feel it gave my hair.&lt;br /&gt;there</li>
            <li>and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>I loved the fragrance of this conditioner, and it did seem to help with the frizzies.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it now every night for 2 weeks and am very pleased  with the results.</li>
            <li>In the end I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase &amp; would definately buy this again.</li>
            <li>I found when I used more than that it takes forever to wash it out!  </li>
            <li>I really liked this product it gets the job done</li>
            <li>It smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Still, this conditioner works well and has a nice clean &#x27;conditioner&#x27; smell, which is nice.</li>
            <li>My wife had me try this product, and its significantly better than many of the conditioners I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I love their scent.</li>
            <li>It is considered safe...</li>
            <li>My hair feels silkier and smoother, too, which I love.</li>
            <li>No matter what your favorite is, you always need to rotate products to avoid product buildup.</li>
            <li>My hair did stay more \\&quot;calm\\&quot; although this could be because of the buildup that Pantene is known for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With that said, if you don&#x27;t want to buy both, I think the conditioner would be a better</li>
            <li>and I have found it to be much better than Pert Plus.  </li>
            <li>truly lives up to its name and controls frizzys and makes them smooth again!</li>
            <li>I have tried many conditioners looking for ones that keep the frizz to a minimum but does not come off too greasy and &#x27;Pantene Pro-V Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy to Smooth Conditioner&#x27; really seems to be doing a great job.</li>
            <li>I think you will find it does a pretty good job for the price without an over powering scent.</li>
            <li>Anyway, for five bucks a bottle, this is a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>Great scent and leaves your hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s good that you don&#x27;t need as much, it lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I have noticed with using this Pantene product I have been able to drop the second conditioning treatment because this product leaves my hair nicely condtioned, without over doing it, on its own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have something with a more classic smell.    </li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance, which is a bonus for us guys that may not be comfortable smelling like flowers.    </li>
            <li>Wow, I was really impressed with this new shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Is the difference hugely noticeable?  </li>
            <li>I started using Pantene products years ago because I found a lot of the cheap products either caused my hair to split at ends or caused it to be frizzy.</li>
            <li>When I got the chance to review this conditioner and the accompanying shampoo, [[ASIN:B003JA5OJA Pantene Pro-v Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy To Smooth Conditioner, 12.6-ounce</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B003JA3KSW Pantene Pro-v Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy To Smooth Shampoo, 12.6-ounce (Pack of 6)]].  </li>
            <li>I had tried every straightener, frizz control out there and nothing worked well, until I tried Pantene Pro-V Frizzy to Smooth</li>
            <li>I know this because of the scent; it&#x27;s nice and relaxing and makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting free hair care without paying the high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>conditioner actually does a really good job.</li>
            <li>It is packed full of chemicals</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s surprising is that I haven&#x27;t had to use as much conditioner as I normally do.  </li>
            <li>Frankly because this product isn&#x27;t unique in what it does but it certainly is pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curling hair that loves to get frizzy in the humidity and it gets more and more frizzy as the day wears on.  </li>
            <li>On hot humid days my hair was the bane of my existence!</li>
            <li>The conditioner didn&#x27;t help much with it, but works just as good as what I normally use (much cheaper brand).    </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and manageable, and I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I do not color or treat my hair in anyway, and rarely use a blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a decent shampoo with a nice smell, it leaves the hair feeling smooth, untangles easily and works fine - like most other shampoos.    </li>
            <li>so I do get frizzies looking hair if not styled right.</li>
            <li>I also have the original Pantene Pro-V Ice Shine Conditioner which is from the older formulas.    </li>
            <li>I used the new Pantene Pro-V Medium-Thick Frizzy to Smooth Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The scent of this new formula is light and pleasing.</li>
            <li>With all of the thunder and lightening storms we have had over the last few weeks, I have had an excellent chance to test out this conditioner vs the mother nature induced frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perhaps after a few more uses, the product will build up and prevent more frizzies.  </li>
            <li>Well, my girlfriend has very straight hair and we tried it on her</li>
            <li>This is a good conditioner and it helps a little with the frizzies.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, though nowhere near as potent or long lasting as the original Pantene products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is not intense scent to it so for people who don&#x27;t do well with scented hair products this would work nicely.</li>
            <li>The hair actually curled up more and made my hair a living nightmare.</li>
            <li>Every hair stylist I&#x27;ve been to has always told me to steer away from products that list alcohol among the first ingredients, Pantene being among them.    </li>
            <li>I recently purchased another brand to compare this product to, but have not been able to try it yet.</li>
            <li>If that happens, I&#x27;ll be sure to come back and update my review</li>
            <li>I used Pantene for many years when I was younger but haven&#x27;t tried it in years.</li>
            <li>I like this conditioner - really!  </li>
            <li>I use a light layer of this new Pantene formula as a leave-in conditioner for an hour and it really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair super smooth, and a little bit heavier -- a good thing for the frizz, not so much if you&#x27;re trying to sneak in an extra day between washes.</li>
            <li>Certainly it is a good thing to be able to have one step conditioning at a price that is mid-range, so not all that expensive.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just the fact that I switched to a different conditioner, but it feels like my hair is more moisturized without getting that oily feeling from having too much residue from the conditioner in it?    </li>
            <li>It is a good conditioner that I would recommend if you need a good conditioner to make your hair soft and a little less frizzy.</li>
            <li>The consistency is smooth, feels like a proper mixture of conditioner and lotion.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair and this product, like all Pantene products I have used, is very luxurious.</li>
            <li>This product made my hair feel clean and soft, perhaps a little more manageable.  </li>
            <li>It rinses off quickly and cleanly and has a subtle fragrance similar to hand soap (it&#x27;s not floral or fruity which is nice for men).  </li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my hair easy to comb which is a feat since it is also long.</li>
            <li>I typically have very thick &amp; frizzy so am always on the look out for the next best thing when it comes to shampoos, I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot &amp; am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>but I do not find it particularly better than the ingredients in other conditioners.</li>
            <li>But, it also seemed to weigh my hair down more and cause it get oily much faster.  </li>
            <li>As with any product, buying in bulk without trying it out first is a risk, but I have been pleasantly surprised and would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>The stuff I was using before (which is still Pantene, just a different variety) had this overpowering fruity smell which got old pretty quick.</li>
            <li>So far the best I&#x27;ve found is Herbal Essences \\&quot;Dangerously Straight.\\</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it several times and the smell and ease with which I am able to brush my hair with the shampoo/conditioner combination definitely encourages me to recommend the product to others!</li>
            <li>I use Pantene all the time and see no reason to try the high priced items sold in beauty salons when it works so well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>This new formula helps tame the frizz, better than the original formula, but the frizz is not completely gone.  </li>
            <li>&quot; However I&#x27;m always looking for something new.</li>
            <li>Pantene seems to come out with a \\&quot;new formula\\</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try to remember to update my review if I have any new hair discoveries...</li>
            <li>The conditioner is nice and thick so the amount you put into your hands all makes it up to your hair and there is no waste from the conditioner dripping, or running, between your fingers.</li>
            <li>Does well in detangling hair, and it might be more economical than other Pantene conditioners since less is needed.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work well enough for me, and I have some pretty unruly hair.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical that this product would be any better, but my hair is definitely softer and more manageable than with Aussie.  </li>
            <li>I usually condition my hair twice, once with a regular hair condtioner and then again with a more intense conditioning product.</li>
            <li>conditioner itself is very thick and coats my hair nicely (unlike some cheaper conditioners I&#x27;ve used).  </li>
            <li>I would have a hard time buying Pantene products and not having that smell that I so love.  </li>
            <li>although its very humid at the moment, will definitely continue using!</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, and does tend to frizz.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, flowing, and manageable.    </li>
            <li>and it tames/untangles it well and leaves it silk and soft.</li>
            <li>only real thing to note is that you don&#x27;t need a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>As far as the frizzy to smooth promise, I can not honestly say that I noticed a marked difference between this product and my normal conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have long wavy hear and gets a little frizzy easily.    </li>
            <li>Lately I&#x27;ve noticed, after having a baby, that my hair has split ends and is basically not glistening like when I was pregnant - go figure!  </li>
            <li>So far, I actually think I might notice a difference?</li>
            <li>To be blunt, this product doesn&#x27;t work any better or any worse than cheaper</li>
            <li>I would say only a little more than any other conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair that gets dry when I work out and need to shower more than once a day.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Pantene Pro-V for the past few years and have enjoyed how it leaves my hair soft, but there was always the frizz factor.   </li>
            <li>Since my hair is coarse, I was pleasantly surprised to find this actually does make it feel softer.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is THICK, so you really want to keep from adding too much to your hair...</li>
            <li>First let me start by telling you a little about my hair.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is only moderately frizzy than it may work well for you, but I have a hard time believing that without applying product after conditioning, anyone&#x27;s hair would be smooth.  </li>
            <li>After about 3 weeks of using it (once every other day) I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference from my regular shampoo - which isn&#x27;t specific to frizz.   </li>

            <li> As with any product, buying in bulk without trying it out first is a risk, but I have been pleasantly surprised and would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> The stuff I was using before (which is still Pantene, just a different variety) had this overpowering fruity smell which got old pretty quick.</li>
            <li> So far the best I&#x27;ve found is Herbal Essences \\&quot;Dangerously Straight.\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times and the smell and ease with which I am able to brush my hair with the shampoo/conditioner combination definitely encourages me to recommend the product to others!</li>
            <li> I use Pantene all the time and see no reason to try the high priced items sold in beauty salons when it works so well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> This new formula helps tame the frizz, better than the original formula, but the frizz is not completely gone.  </li>
            <li> &quot; However I&#x27;m always looking for something new.</li>
            <li> Pantene seems to come out with a \\&quot;new formula\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to remember to update my review if I have any new hair discoveries...</li>
            <li> The conditioner is nice and thick so the amount you put into your hands all makes it up to your hair and there is no waste from the conditioner dripping, or running, between your fingers.</li>
            <li> Does well in detangling hair, and it might be more economical than other Pantene conditioners since less is needed.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work well enough for me, and I have some pretty unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this product would be any better, but my hair is definitely softer and more manageable than with Aussie.  </li>
            <li> I usually condition my hair twice, once with a regular hair condtioner and then again with a more intense conditioning product.</li>
            <li> conditioner itself is very thick and coats my hair nicely (unlike some cheaper conditioners I&#x27;ve used).  </li>
            <li> I would have a hard time buying Pantene products and not having that smell that I so love.  </li>
            <li> although its very humid at the moment, will definitely continue using!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, and does tend to frizz.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, flowing, and manageable.    </li>
            <li> and it tames/untangles it well and leaves it silk and soft.</li>
            <li> only real thing to note is that you don&#x27;t need a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> As far as the frizzy to smooth promise, I can not honestly say that I noticed a marked difference between this product and my normal conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hear and gets a little frizzy easily.    </li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve noticed, after having a baby, that my hair has split ends and is basically not glistening like when I was pregnant - go figure!  </li>
            <li> So far, I actually think I might notice a difference?</li>
            <li> To be blunt, this product doesn&#x27;t work any better or any worse than cheaper</li>
            <li> I would say only a little more than any other conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that gets dry when I work out and need to shower more than once a day.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Pantene Pro-V for the past few years and have enjoyed how it leaves my hair soft, but there was always the frizz factor.   </li>
            <li> Since my hair is coarse, I was pleasantly surprised to find this actually does make it feel softer.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is THICK, so you really want to keep from adding too much to your hair...</li>
            <li> First let me start by telling you a little about my hair.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is only moderately frizzy than it may work well for you, but I have a hard time believing that without applying product after conditioning, anyone&#x27;s hair would be smooth.  </li>
            <li> After about 3 weeks of using it (once every other day) I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference from my regular shampoo - which isn&#x27;t specific to frizz.   </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re in the pool a lot and the chlorine makes my hair frizzier than normal - normal being thick with a halo of frizz!&lt;br</li>
            <li> is certainly not an all natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> flat, so the fly-away frizz is gone.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I have thick hair, but there&#x27;s only so much that topical agents can do.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pantene Pro-V&#x27;s Frizzy to Smooth conditioner is supposed to work, in conjunction with the matching shampoo, to tame frizzy thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been washing my hair daily (due to swimming daily)</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the commercial.  </li>
            <li> I rarely use Pantene products (read: not since the 90&#x27;s), so I&#x27;m not familiar with how well their products usually perform.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However it is very, very thick, so thick that it seems like I had to use more of it to do the same job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of Pantene.</li>
            <li> It goes a long way.    </li>
            <li> it can take a long time to rinse all of it out</li>
            <li> My hair is long, so I don&#x27;t wash it every day.  </li>
            <li> It works well on long hair.  </li>
            <li> but I have long, curly hair</li>
            <li> It is not thin, and not too thick either.    </li>
            <li> This stuff feels thick going on and really seems to penetrate.  </li>
            <li> For the first day, my hair was a little less frizzy, but by the second day, I had to wet it down again and add product as the frizzies returned.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other conditioners, but this one actually does make a difference.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair lie flat, not straight, but</li>
            <li> personally tend to swap between Herbal Essences and Pantene about every other bottle, so I am no stranger to Pantene products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this over any other Pantene product - the extra cost doesn&#x27;t seem to bring anything to show for it.</li>
            <li> However, once dry there is no greasy feel to the hair.</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair and recently started having trouble with dryness and split ends.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been in the sun a lot lately, so decided  to try this new product.  </li>
            <li> Well, I decided to switch it up and try this stuff, since I have pretty thick hair which tends to get outta control if it gets dried out.     </li>
            <li> I have very thick, very long, and very wavy hair for a man, so I&#x27;m always looking for shampoos or conditioners that can straighten my hair</li>
            <li> Either way, neither product prevented frizzing and they actually made my hair a tangled mess.    </li>
            <li> I am not an expert on conditioner, but I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands.  </li>
            <li> I have long curly hair down to my waist.</li>
            <li> In fact it actually FELT a little rougher then after using the other Pantene products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never noticed a difference from one to the other...</li>
            <li> /&gt;4) I didn&#x27;t find that my hair was any smoother to the touch then when using the Herbal Essenses or other Pantene.  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m not sure that I would spend extra money on this line of products, but I certainly didn&#x27;t find anything wrong with them.  </li>
            <li> For daily use this conditioner does work well to help &#x27;tame&#x27; the split ends without being too heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> unlikely though because I&#x27;m not one to spend much time thinking about my hair products.    </li>
            <li> you have shorter hair, you can use less and this isn&#x27;t so expensive then, but for longer hair, I think it&#x27;s a tad bit too much for the amount you&#x27;ll need.</li>
            <li> Keeps the frizz down, and the curl is softer.  </li>
            <li> Conclusion:  a typical conditioner.</li>
            <li> I will, however, give the Pantene products credit for making my hair feel softer than my previous shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that is about 6 inches long.  </li>
            <li> and I have long thick often unrudly hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried hair products that cost between $3 and $60 with so little difference.  </li>
            <li> so do not know if the heavy look would turn into a greasy one if you don&#x27;t wash it for a couple of days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Pantene conditioner has a fragrance with fruity tones...almost like green apple.</li>
            <li> I use conditioner a few times a week to help control my hair or moisturize my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Also, I discovered years ago that the cheaper conditioners would cause me to have small cysts on my head, but I&#x27;ve never had that problem with pantene items.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been spending a lot of time in the pool, which usually damaged my hair, but no problems there, either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using some OTHER Pantene Pro-V conditioner for a while, but I&#x27;ve been waiting to run out because I am not really happy with the effects of using that conditioner vs. just using a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner (I use Head and Shoulders).    </li>
            <li> With me, it was horrific, but with her, it actually gave her the effect she normally looks for in hair products that are supposed to add body.    </li>
            <li> Still if this is your hair type and you have frizz issues, you might at least want to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair, I mean THICK.  </li>
            <li> Curly hair isn&#x27;t usually shiny, but when I use it, it does!  </li>
            <li> It is hard to control in any weather and worse in the summer.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair and this conditioner does wonders.  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t put any product in my hair after washing it, it still gets a little crazy and frizzy, but the Pantene helps a tad.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, thie shampoo does not hold up under fire.</li>
            <li> Alright, I feel weird typing about how my hair feels and smells, so...</li>
            <li> It was painful trying to get all the snarls out post shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to think what it would have been like WITHOUT the conditioner.</li>
            <li> The conditioner helped somewhat, but this was one of the worst shampoo experiences of my life.</li>
            <li> For people like myself who have medium-thick hair and are looking for something to get the curls and friz out, do NOT try this or you will regret it horribly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I started using Pantene products years ago because I found a lot of the cheap products either caused my hair to split at ends or caused it to be frizzy. I have very thick hair and I&#x27;ve been in the sun a lot lately, so decided  to try this new product.  Since my hair is coarse, I was pleasantly surprised to find this actually does make it feel softer. I&#x27;ve been using it now every night for 2 weeks and am very pleased  with the results. Also, I discovered years ago that the cheaper conditioners would cause me to have small cysts on my head, but I&#x27;ve never had that problem with pantene items. I use Pantene all the time and see no reason to try the high priced items sold in beauty salons when it works so well. I&#x27;ve tried some of them along the way and can&#x27;t tell any difference between them.</li>
            <li> I started using this conditioner with the advent of swimming season. We&#x27;re in the pool a lot and the chlorine makes my hair frizzier than normal - normal being thick with a halo of frizz!&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner actually does a really good job. I was very impressed at the smooth look and feel it gave my hair.&lt;br /&gt;there are a couple of things that make it different from the regular pantene conditioners - it does leave a coating that you can feel when you are doing the final rinse. However, once dry there is no greasy feel to the hair. I have been washing my hair daily (due to swimming daily) so do not know if the heavy look would turn into a greasy one if you don&#x27;t wash it for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;This is certainly not an all natural conditioner. It is packed full of chemicals and I know that some people are steering away from that. However, if you are using Pantene conditioners and having a problem with frizz this is definitely a wonderful option and improvement.</li>
            <li> I have hair that is fairly typical of an older woman and I need a conditioner that helps keeps the frizz that comes with hair coloring and loss of moisture under control. I have tried many conditioners looking for ones that keep the frizz to a minimum but does not come off too greasy and &#x27;Pantene Pro-V Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy to Smooth Conditioner&#x27; really seems to be doing a great job. There is not intense scent to it so for people who don&#x27;t do well with scented hair products this would work nicely. I usually condition my hair twice, once with a regular hair condtioner and then again with a more intense conditioning product. I have noticed with using this Pantene product I have been able to drop the second conditioning treatment because this product leaves my hair nicely condtioned, without over doing it, on its own. Certainly it is a good thing to be able to have one step conditioning at a price that is mid-range, so not all that expensive. The conditioner is nice and thick so the amount you put into your hands all makes it up to your hair and there is no waste from the conditioner dripping, or running, between your fingers. Not a lot needs to be used, about a fifty cent sized amount and you are good to go. I recommend this product for hair that has problems with dryness and frizziness. I think you will find it does a pretty good job for the price without an over powering scent.</li>
            <li> My wife had me try this product, and its significantly better than many of the conditioners I&#x27;ve used.  Works well although its very humid at the moment, will definitely continue using!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of Pantene. I love their scent. I have coarse hair and recently started having trouble with dryness and split ends. I&#x27;ve started using heavier conditioners to help with moisturizing weekly. For daily use this conditioner does work well to help &#x27;tame&#x27; the split ends without being too heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> This Pantene conditioner has a fragrance with fruity tones...almost like green apple. It is a heavier conditioner than some...using Behentrimonium Chloride...which penetrates the hair and is proposed to leave residues within the hair shaft after rinsing which combat frizziness.  It is considered safe...but I do not find it particularly better than the ingredients in other conditioners. One must just experiment with heavier or lighter formulas to find what you prefer for your hair. Conclusion:  a typical conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have think, wavy, course hair.  It is hard to control in any weather and worse in the summer.  I have tried other conditioners, but this one actually does make a difference.  It makes my hair lie flat, not straight, but flat, so the fly-away frizz is gone.  My hair feels silkier and smoother, too, which I love.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very long, and very wavy hair for a man, so I&#x27;m always looking for shampoos or conditioners that can straighten my hair so I don&#x27;t have to resort to a straightening iron. So far the best I&#x27;ve found is Herbal Essences \\&quot;Dangerously Straight.\\&quot; However I&#x27;m always looking for something new. When I got the chance to review this conditioner and the accompanying shampoo, [[ASIN:B003JA5OJA Pantene Pro-v Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy To Smooth Conditioner, 12.6-ounce (Pack of 6)]] I jumped at the chance.      Unfortunately, thie shampoo does not hold up under fire. In fact, instead of unfrizzing my hair, it turned my head into a giant mass of snarls and knots. The hair actually curled up more and made my hair a living nightmare. The conditioner helped somewhat, but this was one of the worst shampoo experiences of my life. It was painful trying to get all the snarls out post shower. I&#x27;d hate to think what it would have been like WITHOUT the conditioner. Either way, neither product prevented frizzing and they actually made my hair a tangled mess.    With that in mind, you&#x27;re probably wondering why I didn&#x27;t give this a one star. Well, my girlfriend has very straight hair and we tried it on her and it actually gave her hair body. So on two different people the shampoo and conditioner did the opposite of what it was supposed to. With me, it was horrific, but with her, it actually gave her the effect she normally looks for in hair products that are supposed to add body.    So take note Pantene - rebrand who is supposed to get this conditioner, and you have a winner. For people like myself who have medium-thick hair and are looking for something to get the curls and friz out, do NOT try this or you will regret it horribly.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works, but it doesn&#x27;t work miracles. Pantene seems to come out with a \\&quot;new formula\\&quot; every 6 months or so. I&#x27;ve never noticed a difference from one to the other... I think this is just another repackaging of their same \\&quot;Sleek and Silky\\&quot; variety that was out before this one. It works the same.</li>
            <li> Every hair stylist I&#x27;ve been to has always told me to steer away from products that list alcohol among the first ingredients, Pantene being among them.    I&#x27;ve tried hair products that cost between $3 and $60 with so little difference.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I have thick hair, but there&#x27;s only so much that topical agents can do.  Like others, I&#x27;ve not noticed any difference in the end result with this conditioner.  What&#x27;s surprising is that I haven&#x27;t had to use as much conditioner as I normally do.  It goes a long way.    This has a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; scent to it...not flowery or perfumey.  Does well in detangling hair, and it might be more economical than other Pantene conditioners since less is needed.  No matter what your favorite is, you always need to rotate products to avoid product buildup.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product along with the matching shampoo for the last several weeks.  My hair is naturally curly, and does tend to frizz.  With all of the thunder and lightening storms we have had over the last few weeks, I have had an excellent chance to test out this conditioner vs the mother nature induced frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally tend to swap between Herbal Essences and Pantene about every other bottle, so I am no stranger to Pantene products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have noticed about this shampoo/ conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;1) The conditioner is THICK, so you really want to keep from adding too much to your hair... it can take a long time to rinse all of it out (Yes I made this mistake)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The scent is nice, though nowhere near as potent or long lasting as the original Pantene products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) My hair did stay more \\&quot;calm\\&quot; although this could be because of the buildup that Pantene is known for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) I didn&#x27;t find that my hair was any smoother to the touch then when using the Herbal Essenses or other Pantene.  In fact it actually FELT a little rougher then after using the other Pantene products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion - I&#x27;m not sure that I would spend extra money on this line of products, but I certainly didn&#x27;t find anything wrong with them.  I would have a hard time buying Pantene products and not having that smell that I so love.  Still if this is your hair type and you have frizz issues, you might at least want to give this a try.  It&#x27;s no miracle but it can help a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using some OTHER Pantene Pro-V conditioner for a while, but I&#x27;ve been waiting to run out because I am not really happy with the effects of using that conditioner vs. just using a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner (I use Head and Shoulders).    Well, I decided to switch it up and try this stuff, since I have pretty thick hair which tends to get outta control if it gets dried out.     So far, I actually think I might notice a difference? Maybe it&#x27;s just the fact that I switched to a different conditioner, but it feels like my hair is more moisturized without getting that oily feeling from having too much residue from the conditioner in it?    Anyway, for five bucks a bottle, this is a pretty good deal. Seems to work well enough for me, and I have some pretty unruly hair. I&#x27;ll try to remember to update my review if I have any new hair discoveries... unlikely though because I&#x27;m not one to spend much time thinking about my hair products.    Still, this conditioner works well and has a nice clean &#x27;conditioner&#x27; smell, which is nice. The stuff I was using before (which is still Pantene, just a different variety) had this overpowering fruity smell which got old pretty quick. It&#x27;s nice to have something with a more classic smell.    Alright, I feel weird typing about how my hair feels and smells, so... that&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair and this conditioner does wonders.  Keeps the frizz down, and the curl is softer.  Plus, I even have some shine to my hair.  Curly hair isn&#x27;t usually shiny, but when I use it, it does!  My hair is long, so I don&#x27;t wash it every day.  When I don&#x27;t wash, I simply run some of the contitioner through my hair while I&#x27;m in the shower, and rinse.  My hair is soft and manageable, and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> First let me start by telling you a little about my hair.  I have thick wavy hair that is about 6 inches long.  The only products I use are leave-in conditioner and gel.  I do not color or treat my hair in anyway, and rarely use a blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pantene Pro-V&#x27;s Frizzy to Smooth conditioner is supposed to work, in conjunction with the matching shampoo, to tame frizzy thick hair.  Does it do that?  I would say only a little more than any other conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  If I don&#x27;t put any product in my hair after washing it, it still gets a little crazy and frizzy, but the Pantene helps a tad.  Is the difference hugely noticeable?  No, but it is something.  If your hair is only moderately frizzy than it may work well for you, but I have a hard time believing that without applying product after conditioning, anyone&#x27;s hair would be smooth.  I will, however, give the Pantene products credit for making my hair feel softer than my previous shampoo and conditioner I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner itself is very thick and coats my hair nicely (unlike some cheaper conditioners I&#x27;ve used).  It rinses off quickly and cleanly and has a subtle fragrance similar to hand soap (it&#x27;s not floral or fruity which is nice for men).  I used both the conditioner and shampoo so if you notice two very similar reviews for these products, that&#x27;s why.  With that said, if you don&#x27;t want to buy both, I think the conditioner would be a better buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... if you don&#x27;t expect smoothing miracles, it&#x27;s a great conditioner.</li>
            <li> My rating: 4.5 stars  I used the new Pantene Pro-V Medium-Thick Frizzy to Smooth Conditioner.  I also have the original Pantene Pro-V Ice Shine Conditioner which is from the older formulas.    SCENT/AROMA: The scent of this new formula is light and pleasing. Not overbearing at all.    CONSISTENCY: The consistency is smooth, feels like a proper mixture of conditioner and lotion.  It is not thin, and not too thick either.    I have been using Pantene Pro-V for the past few years and have enjoyed how it leaves my hair soft, but there was always the frizz factor.   This new formula helps tame the frizz, better than the original formula, but the frizz is not completely gone.  I use a light layer of this new Pantene formula as a leave-in conditioner for an hour and it really makes a difference.  It leaves my hair soft, flowing, and manageable.    I recently purchased another brand to compare this product to, but have not been able to try it yet. I will update this review afterwards.  Highly recommended.  4.5 out of 5.</li>
            <li> After about 3 weeks of using it (once every other day) I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference from my regular shampoo - which isn&#x27;t specific to frizz.   I have long wavy hear and gets a little frizzy easily.    The conditioner didn&#x27;t help much with it, but works just as good as what I normally use (much cheaper brand).    Overall it&#x27;s a decent shampoo with a nice smell, it leaves the hair feeling smooth, untangles easily and works fine - like most other shampoos.    I cannot recommend this over any other Pantene product - the extra cost doesn&#x27;t seem to bring anything to show for it.</li>
            <li> I am not an expert on conditioner, but I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands.  I have thick wavy hair that gets dry when I work out and need to shower more than once a day.  Aussie conditioner has been my mainstay for quite a while and I have found it to be much better than Pert Plus.  I was skeptical that this product would be any better, but my hair is definitely softer and more manageable than with Aussie.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance, which is a bonus for us guys that may not be comfortable smelling like flowers.    As with any product, buying in bulk without trying it out first is a risk, but I have been pleasantly surprised and would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Please note that this conditioner works as it&#x27;s best after you use [[ASIN:B003JA3KSW Pantene Pro-v Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy To Smooth Shampoo, 12.6-ounce (Pack of 6)]].  Great scent and leaves your hair soft and manageable.  It works well on long hair.  It has a \\&quot;stand-up\\&quot; shape bottle for your convenience.</li>
            <li> Hey, it&#x27;s conditioner. It does the job it is supposed to do and it does it well. That&#x27;s all I expect from conditioner--conditioning. As far as the frizzy to smooth promise, I can not honestly say that I noticed a marked difference between this product and my normal conditioner. This happens not be a big deal at all since all I expect out of conditioner is--you guessed it--conditioning, nut I thought I would pass that along nonetheless. I am a longtime Pantene user and will continue to be going forward.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair feel clean and soft, perhaps a little more manageable.  As for the frizzies it says to fight, I don&#x27;t know that it made that big of a difference.  For the first day, my hair was a little less frizzy, but by the second day, I had to wet it down again and add product as the frizzies returned.  Perhaps after a few more uses, the product will build up and prevent more frizzies.  If that happens, I&#x27;ll be sure to come back and update my review</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair down to my waist. On hot humid days my hair was the bane of my existence! It would frizz and be out of control, my only hope was to put it in a ponytail and deal with it. I had tried every straightener, frizz control out there and nothing worked well, until I tried Pantene Pro-V Frizzy to Smooth Conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;It truly lives up to its name and controls frizzys and makes them smooth again!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter and she says it works great on her hair. She is over 18 .</li>
            <li> This is a good conditioner and it helps a little with the frizzies. I have wavy hair so I do get frizzies looking hair if not styled right. This conditioner makes my hair easy to comb which is a feat since it is also long. It is a good conditioner that I would recommend if you need a good conditioner to make your hair soft and a little less frizzy. I have to use styling products like a spray gel to get my hair to not have any frizzy look.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was really impressed with this new shampoo.  It&#x27;s got a great scent, &amp; feels like silk (no kidding here) when putting it in your hair.  I typically have very thick &amp; frizzy so am always on the look out for the next best thing when it comes to shampoos, I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot &amp; am glad I did.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the commercial.  They advertise that you&#x27;re supposed to wake up in the morning without the frizzy do.  I kinda assumed this was BS from the get go &amp; therefore am not being uber critical, but there you have the 4 stars.  In the end I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase &amp; would definately buy this again.</li>
            <li> I used Pantene for many years when I was younger but haven&#x27;t tried it in years. I really liked this product it gets the job done and I have long thick often unrudly hair and it tames/untangles it well and leaves it silk and soft. I will definetly continue to use Pantene for sometime, but I switch up my shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners often as to not let my hair become to use to any one thing...give this one a try girls ;o)</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and this product, like all Pantene products I have used, is very luxurious. One of the things I noticed immediately was how creamy the consistency was. It seemed to take a bit longer to wash out of my hair, but did leave my hair calmer. I&#x27;ve used it several times and the smell and ease with which I am able to brush my hair with the shampoo/conditioner combination definitely encourages me to recommend the product to others!</li>
            <li> There are plenty of conditioners on the market, but none to my knowledge that target hair by thickness and texture.  This stuff feels thick going on and really seems to penetrate.  Made my hair super smooth, and a little bit heavier -- a good thing for the frizz, not so much if you&#x27;re trying to sneak in an extra day between washes.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, I mean THICK.  During the summer I keep it short up off my shoulders.  Lately I&#x27;ve noticed, after having a baby, that my hair has split ends and is basically not glistening like when I was pregnant - go figure!  I rarely use Pantene products (read: not since the 90&#x27;s), so I&#x27;m not familiar with how well their products usually perform.  I just know I like this conditioner - really!  It smells nice.  It&#x27;s thick.  It rubs in well.  When washed out I feel the smoothness.  I even see the smoothness.  I&#x27;ve been spending a lot of time in the pool, which usually damaged my hair, but no problems there, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize until after I received this product that it&#x27;s the same one my hairstylist uses.  I know this because of the scent; it&#x27;s nice and relaxing and makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting free hair care without paying the high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real thing to note is that you don&#x27;t need a lot of it.  Try about a grape size in your hand and rub it into your hair and comb it through.  I found when I used more than that it takes forever to wash it out!  But that&#x27;s good that you don&#x27;t need as much, it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I loved the fragrance of this conditioner, and it did seem to help with the frizzies.  But, it also seemed to weigh my hair down more and cause it get oily much faster.  After just one day, my hair looked shiny and greasy.  I&#x27;d rather go with Pantene&#x27;s regular conditioner, and use a spray on frizz reducer.  I finished the bottle, but probably would not use it again.</li>
            <li> If this product does as advertised, that is smooths out frizzy hair to allow for easier styling, why did I give it only 4 and not 5 stars?  Frankly because this product isn&#x27;t unique in what it does but it certainly is pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curling hair that loves to get frizzy in the humidity and it gets more and more frizzy as the day wears on.  I use conditioner a few times a week to help control my hair or moisturize my scalp.  To be blunt, this product doesn&#x27;t work any better or any worse than cheaper ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it is very, very thick, so thick that it seems like I had to use more of it to do the same job.  I followed the direction to run my fingers through my hair to spread it throughout evenly but I have long, curly hair and it still took quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have shorter hair, you can use less and this isn&#x27;t so expensive then, but for longer hair, I think it&#x27;s a tad bit too much for the amount you&#x27;ll need.</li>
