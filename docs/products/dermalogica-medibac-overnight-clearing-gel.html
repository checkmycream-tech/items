            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this product from the beauty supply store and it works so much better than the cheaper products out there.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and the Dermologica product line.  </li>

            <li>The ingredients make it sound so effective</li>
            <li>This is an excellent topical acne product!  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a top of the line product!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely great adult acne treatment.</li>
            <li>But I have been able to manage that with an oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Bought almost a year ago and still going strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure magic!</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Hopefully my face is nice and clear again:)</li>
            <li>I got this because of full pores.</li>
            <li>and I use the full line.</li>
            <li>Its always nice to find a good price when needed in hard times.</li>
            <li>and it clears it up quickly.  </li>
            <li>It feels very gentle and is helping along with my dermalogica medibac face wash, to rid me of my acne!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely effective, especially as a daily/nightly preventative lotion.  </li>
            <li>I could tell the product was fresh because of the expiration date.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the cost as I no longer need laser spot removal as I thought.</li>
            <li>It helps to keep my skin clear and I love the texture.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I put it on overnight on the day I got it, and I woke up the a fresh face.</li>
            <li>Something is not quite right with the product I recieved from this shipper.</li>
            <li>particular product is my favorite, as it actually makes a significant difference</li>
            <li>and i started trying so many different kinds of acne products.</li>
            <li>I use a q-tip to apply and never use the same q-tip more</li>
            <li>After having the drugstore competition salycylic acid product turn a funny color, I bought this.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ll apply it at the first sign of a breakout and have found that it reduces the size and healing time of the pimple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It actually brought out more breakouts than before</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>This product gets rid of the breakout issue pretty much overnight.</li>
            <li>pure night lightening cream&lt;br</li>
            <li>recommend this product and would certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>Thanks Dermalogica!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When used in conjunction with the Clearing Skin Wash, it really works.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even really wear makeup anymore.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works</li>
            <li>Thanks Geo Marketing and Amazon.</li>
            <li>I applied this nightly on my whole face and still broke out significantly the same as before using this product.  </li>
            <li>At first, it felt like this gel was doing what it claims it will do - clear up acne.  </li>
            <li>I cant live without this product!</li>
            <li>am using this product along with a bunch of other dermatologica products for my everyday routines and can honestly say I am seeing great results, but am not sure if they can be attributed to this particular product or the whole suit of them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old (58) and still get facial acne on my extremely oily skin; this controls it well and is supposed to have ingredients good for oily skin, too.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend trying this out.</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This works gently but thoroughly to clear up acne.</li>
            <li>It clears up most pimples over a few days of treatment.</li>
            <li>This product last for a long time, a little bit goes a long way, best value.</li>
            <li>I have been using the entire medibac line for nearly eight months, and I can say it is worth sticking it out for results.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend went from ugly to amazing!!</li>
            <li>Non drying, clear, doesn&#x27;t cause peeling or redness.  </li>
            <li>This Overnight Clearing Gel is not supposed to clear up anything &amp;#34;overnight&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Then i stopped getting it completely.</li>
            <li>I have tried almost everything they have for adult acne.</li>
            <li>(I frequently break in this area)</li>
            <li>This product was a life saver for a thirty year old who was experiencing adult acne.</li>
            <li>I use it nearly every night after cleansing.</li>
            <li>I was professionally trained on dermatological,  this does get rid of acne  </li>
            <li>and so far it does have some proven effects and hope that continues.  </li>
            <li>It was drying for my 17 year old son&#x27;s acne skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is also very sensitive and dry, and this is the first product that has made a significant difference without stripping my skin raw.</li>
            <li>Would recommend over other leading brands and really is worth the money</li>
            <li>It clears up acne without drying or redness, and you don&#x27;t need much of it, so the product lasts a long time (One bottle lasted 4 months for me, and I use it daily).  </li>
            <li>but after giving this product a chance on multiple occasions, more than I actually should have, I can say that this product made my skin worse.</li>
            <li>Although I would recommend all other Dermalogica products this one just didn&#x27;t live up to my standards.</li>

            <li> Although I would recommend all other Dermalogica products this one just didn&#x27;t live up to my standards.</li>
            <li> The only down side I might see with anything in this line, is that my skin has appeared to have dried out a little more.</li>
            <li> After my pregnancy I developed a lot of dark spots and sebum production seems to have increased resulting in lots of outbreaks in the t zone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li> The first few weeks with the product I experienced terrible break outs, but once they resolved my skin changed entirely.</li>
            <li> Goes through instantly, doesn&#x27;t sting, doesn&#x27;t stink, doesn&#x27;t dry (even around the eyes).</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s keeping my pores clearer, generally speaking, minimizing them you might say, but I&#x27;ve been in a mega breakout ever since on the other hand.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out unlike other pimple cream.</li>
            <li> However I can&#x27;t say with certainty that this project is all that much different from other salicylic acid products, but it does seem to work</li>
            <li> In 2015 My skin changed a lot due to hormones, and this was no longer enough to keep up with it.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using this line for a long time!</li>
            <li> well I doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin.</li>
            <li> It did dry out my skin, but it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li> The product I received is NOT new.</li>
            <li> It seems watered down and doesn&#x27;t smell or feel same on my skin as product I purchased at retail stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is due to this product, or that I began using a new makeup line.</li>
            <li> Now i only break out very occasional and its usually because i forget to wash my face.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have struggled with acne since very early adolescence.</li>
            <li> I have had acne since puberty and have tried everything under the sun; Proactiv, Neutrogenia, and regular ol&#x27; Ivory soap just to name a few.  </li>
            <li> Not very effective for already inflamed blemishes in my opinion, so use regularly not after the fact to stop bumps before they happen.  </li>
            <li> I already use the other Dermalogica products, and had just been holding out on this one because of the price.  </li>
            <li> The Gel loosens up blackheads and other buildup so it can be washed away.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that effect could be lasting</li>
            <li> active moist (</li>
            <li> My skin is not perfect now, but the type of acne has changed (cystic to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;), and the frequency is much much less often.</li>
            <li> Pricey, pricey--my only complaint.</li>
            <li> This product did not harm my skin but it also did not seem to do much help as compared to products that are significantly less expensive (Burts Bees Acne Serum, for example).  </li>
            <li> I have notice that it cuts the healing time in half.</li>
            <li> I have used proactiv previously because that clears breakouts well.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have a pungent smell that can be typical of some acne products.  </li>
            <li> This is the thing that turned my skin around from pigmented acne prone mess port partum to what it used to be.</li>
            <li> The little pimples were 90% gone.</li>
            <li> the once since some of the reviews said that it can cause it to be worse if you reuse the same q-tip-- as it spreads bacteria.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I vary my skin care routine a lot to keep my skin &amp;#34;guessing&amp;#34; and this is one of the items I use a few nights each week.</li>
            <li> redness is gone immediately and does not feel harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> I use it during the night if there are any breakouts or signs of them, and usually I&#x27;m getting results in 1-2 nights.</li>
            <li> Weird shiny container and different consistency.</li>
            <li> I saw this on a beauty awards list, and was searching for something to get rid of my random tiny pimples, and a bit of redness on one cheek.</li>
            <li> I only have small breakouts now when I previously had chicken pox on my face.</li>
            <li> (I confused it with another Dermalogica order from another seller).  </li>
            <li> I will keep buying this till I die and they will have to pry it from my cold, dead hands</li>
            <li> Very expensive, difficult to squeeze product out and didnt work for me.  </li>
            <li> I freaked out a little because cystic acne is horrible</li>
            <li> The .5% solution just wasn&#x27;t cutting it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry, seller!  </li>
            <li> If I go to bed with really bad break outs, I put this on my face</li>
            <li> Clears skin and helps with bad acne.</li>
            <li> wish i had this when i was a teenager with bad skin.</li>
            <li> I have really bad painful acne when I go to sleep.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It does not dry out unlike other pimple cream. Works well if you need to reduce redness and swelling. Good</li>
            <li> I am 17 and as a teenage girl i get acne. Before i started using this i had alot of break outs and i began to get cystic acne. I freaked out a little because cystic acne is horrible and i started trying so many different kinds of acne products. I ended up getting a prescription one, but i still broke out alot. After using this for like 3 days all my acne was gone. Then i stopped getting it completely. Now i only break out very occasional and its usually because i forget to wash my face. I highly recommend this my skin is always perfect now.</li>
            <li> If I go to bed with really bad break outs, I put this on my face and I wake up in the morning so very pleased. I have really bad painful acne when I go to sleep. Just put a dab of this on and I go to bed knowing it&#x27;ll be diminished both in pain and redness by morning.</li>
            <li> Works great and fast. I used it when I was o erotica seas and it cleared me up</li>
            <li> This is not a miracle product but it definitely helps. The last 4 years I have had moderate acne. I have tried almost everything they have for adult acne. I have found a regime that seems to be working and this is included. I use this every night as a spot treatment. I use a q-tip to apply and never use the same q-tip more the once since some of the reviews said that it can cause it to be worse if you reuse the same q-tip-- as it spreads bacteria. I have notice that it cuts the healing time in half. It does take the redness out as well. I would recommend this for anyone suffering from acne.</li>
            <li> After having the drugstore competition salycylic acid product turn a funny color, I bought this.  I already use the other Dermalogica products, and had just been holding out on this one because of the price.  It&#x27;s definitely effective, especially as a daily/nightly preventative lotion.  Non drying, clear, doesn&#x27;t cause peeling or redness.  Not very effective for already inflamed blemishes in my opinion, so use regularly not after the fact to stop bumps before they happen.  Pricey, pricey--my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dermalogica products for 7 years now and love all of their products except for this one. I was recommended to it when I went to a Dermalogica skin bar with acne concerns around my chin (I frequently break in this area) but after giving this product a chance on multiple occasions, more than I actually should have, I can say that this product made my skin worse. After using the product as directed on the bottle I would wake up every morning with even more breakouts in the area I applied it to. Although I would recommend all other Dermalogica products this one just didn&#x27;t live up to my standards.</li>
            <li> Helps prevent breakouts when you can feel the starting under the surface.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great adult acne treatment. I use it during the night if there are any breakouts or signs of them, and usually I&#x27;m getting results in 1-2 nights.</li>
            <li> I wish I had this when I was younger, in my teens.  Now I keep it for when I get a breakout and it clears it up quickly.  Great for overnight treatment.</li>
            <li> This product was a life saver for a thirty year old who was experiencing adult acne. I keep it on hand for those occasional breakouts.This product last for a long time, a little bit goes a long way, best value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this product from Amazon.  I like it, it works, I have no complaints.  I like Dermalogica because it&#x27;s on of the more respected skin care brands on the market used by professionals.  However I can&#x27;t say with certainty that this project is all that much different from other salicylic acid products, but it does seem to work well I doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I just left seller feedback that should have been 5 stars, not 4 (I confused it with another Dermalogica order from another seller).  I&#x27;m so sorry, seller!  This product was NOT mailed in a bubble mailer; it was in a sturdy box and arrived intact.  I could tell the product was fresh because of the expiration date.  It&#x27;s good stuff.  I&#x27;m old (58) and still get facial acne on my extremely oily skin; this controls it well and is supposed to have ingredients good for oily skin, too.  You can be confident ordering this product from this seller.</li>
            <li> UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay folks...this is the big kahuna. This is the thing that turned my skin around from pigmented acne prone mess port partum to what it used to be. I use this every day, sometimes twice a day all over, under moisteurizer, BB cream etc. Goes through instantly, doesn&#x27;t sting, doesn&#x27;t stink, doesn&#x27;t dry (even around the eyes). I will keep buying this till I die and they will have to pry it from my cold, dead hands cause I will need it in the afterlife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLDER REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this product along with a bunch of other dermatologica products for my everyday routines and can honestly say I am seeing great results, but am not sure if they can be attributed to this particular product or the whole suit of them. After my pregnancy I developed a lot of dark spots and sebum production seems to have increased resulting in lots of outbreaks in the t zone. All these issues have been satisfactorily addressed. Here is my routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning&lt;br /&gt;Wash with DM essential cleaning solution&lt;br /&gt;DM oil control lotion&lt;br /&gt;Murad rapid age spot serum AND DM c12 bright serum&lt;br /&gt;Either DM dynamic skin recovery moisteurizer or DM active moist (the former if i feel a bit dry)&lt;br /&gt;DM total eye care&lt;br /&gt;Makeup as usual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evening&lt;br /&gt;DM wash&lt;br /&gt;DM daily microfoliant&lt;br /&gt;Murad and c12 serums&lt;br /&gt;DM pure night lightening cream&lt;br /&gt;DM total eye care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every week I use a DM sebum clearing mask&lt;br /&gt;Every two weeks or as needed I use a chemical peel, followed by DM power recovery masque to restore moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Map15 generator dust mixed with moisteurizer as needed but rarely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are massive. Well worth the cost as I no longer need laser spot removal as I thought.</li>
            <li> I got this because of full pores. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really working. I think it&#x27;s keeping my pores clearer, generally speaking, minimizing them you might say, but I&#x27;ve been in a mega breakout ever since on the other hand. We&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li> Product i received in mail was not the same as the product I purchased at the dermalogica store. Weird shiny container and different consistency.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this sitting in my medicine cabinet and when my skin started breaking out I figured I had nothing to lose. After applying it just one evening,  I noticed improved texture and a reduction in the size and redness of a blemish that was forming. Now I&#x27;ll apply it at the first sign of a breakout and have found that it reduces the size and healing time of the pimple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product and would certainly buy it again. Plus the ease and expedience of Amazon ordering cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> This is in my top 3 favorite items by Dermalogica. I struggle with acne that comes out from under my skin, especially in the cheek area. Nothing worked until I tried this, and finally my problem is solved. Thanks Dermalogica!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying this out.</li>
            <li> Very expensive, difficult to squeeze product out and didnt work for me.  I have used proactiv previously because that clears breakouts well.  I wanted to stick with the same brand for all skincare needs which is why I choose this product.  I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for just about 2 weeks.  At first, it felt like this gel was doing what it claims it will do - clear up acne.  But, I decided to hold off of using it the night before, as the pimple/cyst seemed to be inflamed.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is due to this product, or that I began using a new makeup line.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DIDNT WORK FOR  ME. I USED IT FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW. I AM NOT ORDERING THIS PRODUCT AGAIN. EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT.</li>
            <li> Something is not quite right with the product I recieved from this shipper. It seems watered down and doesn&#x27;t smell or feel same on my skin as product I purchased at retail stores. My face also broke out after using which has never happened with dermalogica product and I use the full line.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Its always nice to find a good price when needed in hard times. Thank you and have a great holiday.</li>
            <li> Must try!!!!!! Clears skin and helps with bad acne. Would recommend over other leading brands and really is worth the money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure magic! Use it at night.&lt;br /&gt;.blemishes gone in the mornimg! Nothing else like it!  ....just get some now!</li>
            <li> I prefer odor-free products, but for some reason this clearing gel just has the prefect tea tree smell, but not over whelming by any means. I vary my skin care routine a lot to keep my skin &amp;#34;guessing&amp;#34; and this is one of the items I use a few nights each week. It helps to keep my skin clear and I love the texture.</li>
            <li> I have had acne since puberty and have tried everything under the sun; Proactiv, Neutrogenia, and regular ol&#x27; Ivory soap just to name a few.  Dermalogica has made a great product. This Overnight Clearing Gel is not supposed to clear up anything &amp;#34;overnight&amp;#34;. This is a product that you put on overnight to help with the cleansing process. The Gel loosens up blackheads and other buildup so it can be washed away. I have found that it does help reduce redness of existing acne. It also doesn&#x27;t have a pungent smell that can be typical of some acne products.  When used in conjunction with the Clearing Skin Wash, it really works. I only have small breakouts now when I previously had chicken pox on my face. This has been a godsend. I don&#x27;t even really wear makeup anymore. I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
            <li> I cant live without this product! I use it nearly every night after cleansing. Bought almost a year ago and still going strong. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Breakout relief for my granddaughter.  This works gently but thoroughly to clear up acne.</li>
            <li> The product I received is NOT new. The cap has been opened. And this item is not eligible for return.</li>
            <li> I was professionally trained on dermatological,  this does get rid of acne  if your acne is severe it will take a bit more time. you may want to purchase the dermatological .acne products and include this with your routine.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything to my breakouts, didn&#x27;t prevent any breakouts from coming out either. It actually brought out more breakouts than before</li>
            <li> This definitely worked for my skin.  It clears up acne without drying or redness, and you don&#x27;t need much of it, so the product lasts a long time (One bottle lasted 4 months for me, and I use it daily).  I used it under my regular moisturizer and my skin didn&#x27;t appear oily.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve using for months.. It works for me. Am getting another big size. Hopefully my face is nice and clear again:)</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. My chin tends to breakout all of the time. This product gets rid of the breakout issue pretty much overnight.</li>
            <li> This has a nice scent. It feels very gentle and is helping along with my dermalogica medibac face wash, to rid me of my acne! This goes on the spots of acne I have and is also helping any scarring I have gotten over time! Thanks for a top of the line product!! Very amazing stuff!!</li>
            <li> It works well! I bought it for my boy friend and he likes it. I tried it as well and it is good!</li>
            <li> I bought this product from the beauty supply store and it works so much better than the cheaper products out there. i would highly recommend. wish i had this when i was a teenager with bad skin. now i would use for the occasional breakouts. redness is gone immediately and does not feel harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using the entire medibac line for nearly eight months, and I can say it is worth sticking it out for results. I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have struggled with acne since very early adolescence. My skin is also very sensitive and dry, and this is the first product that has made a significant difference without stripping my skin raw. My skin is not perfect now, but the type of acne has changed (cystic to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;), and the frequency is much much less often. The first few weeks with the product I experienced terrible break outs, but once they resolved my skin changed entirely. The only down side I might see with anything in this line, is that my skin has appeared to have dried out a little more. But I have been able to manage that with an oil free moisturizer. Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product is my favorite, as it actually makes a significant difference overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****UPDATE******&lt;br /&gt;2015: In 2015 My skin changed a lot due to hormones, and this was no longer enough to keep up with it. The .5% solution just wasn&#x27;t cutting it so I had to go back to using 2% that you can buy under just about every OTC brand. I post this because I struggled for several months thinking it was just the product that stopped working for me. It took a view visits to the doctor to figure out what was going on. So if you use this and see that it is no longer working you might need to schedule a check up with your doctor.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works</li>
            <li> My girlfriend went from ugly to amazing!! JK. Product works well and delivery on time. Thanks Geo Marketing and Amazon.</li>
            <li> Was trying this out and so far it does have some proven effects and hope that continues.  Not sure if that effect could be lasting</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, I&#x27;m turning 40 maybe that&#x27;s why</li>
            <li> Stops acne in it&#x27;s tracks.  I sometimes wear it under my foundation if I feel I&#x27;m going to have a break out.</li>
            <li> This is the best acne product I have used. It clears up most pimples over a few days of treatment.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and the Dermologica product line.  My skin looks and feels so much better.  It did dry out my skin, but it&#x27;s supposed to.  As of 8/2014, I&#x27;ve been using Dermologica products for about 6 weeks.  I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference in my skin.  I look forward to using this line for a long time!</li>
            <li> It was drying for my 17 year old son&#x27;s acne skin.</li>
            <li> This product did not harm my skin but it also did not seem to do much help as compared to products that are significantly less expensive (Burts Bees Acne Serum, for example).  I applied this nightly on my whole face and still broke out significantly the same as before using this product.  The ingredients make it sound so effective but yet I didn&#x27;t see results.  At the price, I definitely would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. I saw this on a beauty awards list, and was searching for something to get rid of my random tiny pimples, and a bit of redness on one cheek. This was a pricier that what I choose to spend on a product, but well worth it. I put it on overnight on the day I got it, and I woke up the a fresh face. The little pimples were 90% gone. Today is the third day and there is only one tiny pimple. Soooooo happy - I will have a clearer complexion by the end of the week. I put a tiny dot on the pimples under my makeup in the morning. I recommend this product for anyone who has stubborn pimples and who has tried everything thing there is out there.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent topical acne product!  Apply after cleansing the face. Topical gel.  Highly recommend!!</li>
