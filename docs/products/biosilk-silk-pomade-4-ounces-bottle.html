            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Adds a nice light shine to the hair and of course the fragrance is so CLEAN  and TO DIE FOR,  </li>
            <li>excellent product to add depth to hair without weighing it down would tell friends about it and of course where I purchased it</li>
            <li>The silk pomade is the perfect hair product because it smooths out frizz without making it too heavy.</li>
            <li>I love the pomade most likely because I love the brand as well.</li>
            <li>It hold my hair up well if I use a lot more than I normally would have in the polish.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for course thick hair and areas that have high humidity.  </li>
            <li>One of the best I tried but still not ideal.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is how I&#x27;m supposed to use it, but it works very well used in this way!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many pomades over the years and this is definitely the best--keeps my hair silky and straight for days!  </li>
            <li>First time I purchased this and never again.</li>

            <li>difficult to find but was very happy to have, ordered four, this should last me for the rest of the year...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Use just a small amount, just like most of the products in this line.</li>
            <li>A soft hold to the hair while maintaining the hairs softness.</li>
            <li>Some of it had leaked out of the container, there was no inner seal there, and the product was old, old, old.  </li>
            <li>how much I put on my hair, a little to much and hair look oily.</li>
            <li>I have short to medium curly hair and this strengthens the hold of the natural curls.</li>
            <li>I have natural curls in my hair and the way it is styled it allows me to just put mousse in my hair, let it dry, and then I can pick it into a style.  </li>

            <li> It will last long time</li>
            <li> and it leaves your hair sticky...not good :(</li>
            <li> With age my hair gets dry and sometimes frizzy.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know if I finish it until it will dry.</li>
            <li> it is lite ,not sticky,but i need to be very careful  </li>
            <li> This hair product is not at all like my previous purchase</li>
            <li> I thought this item was less liquidy.</li>
            <li> Putting a little (the size of a dime), on my hand, rubbing my hands together, and then rubbing it through my hair takes away the dryness.  </li>
            <li> Because I use so little, it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> The product was absolutely no good.  </li>
            <li> This product was a mess when it came all dirty and it melt within time, it sucks...</li>
            <li> be wary I used this on my child</li>
            <li> It is impossible to blend and it sticks like globs in my hair.  </li>
            <li> The stuff is awful.</li>

            <li> The product was absolutely no good.  Some of it had leaked out of the container, there was no inner seal there, and the product was old, old, old.  The seller was very nice though and refunded my purchase price immediately.</li>
            <li> This hair product is not at all like my previous purchase</li>
            <li> I thought this item was less liquidy. I don&#x27;t understand the difference between my former silk &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34; and the silk &amp;#34;pomade&amp;#34;. It hold my hair up well if I use a lot more than I normally would have in the polish. It makes it look kind of greasy though. Maybe there is a difference between silk polish and pomade?</li>
            <li> A soft hold to the hair while maintaining the hairs softness. Adds a nice light shine to the hair and of course the fragrance is so CLEAN  and TO DIE FOR,  LOVE IT, will be a repeat buyer of this product.</li>
            <li> This puts a silky shine on your final style. Use just a small amount, just like most of the products in this line. I have short to medium curly hair and this strengthens the hold of the natural curls.</li>
            <li> I love the pomade most likely because I love the brand as well. It smells great! Thank you. Keep it up!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Biosilk; however I though I was buying the Biosilk Polish not the Pomade.  The Pomade is good, not the best smell.  I am using it, but it&#x27;s for more sculpured hair.  I wanted the polish for a sleeker look.  Biosilk is a great product even the oil is great and smells good too.</li>
            <li> I love this it works wonderful on days that I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair.  I put this in and can style and go. be wary I used this on my child and she was allergic and had gotten burns all over her head. make sure you check the ingredients.</li>
            <li> difficult to find but was very happy to have, ordered four, this should last me for the rest of the year...lol? Once you are done styling your hair, take a dime/nickel size amount in your palm and rub/spread together them &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34; your hair with it, all over or just in choice areas? leaves it shiny and silky.</li>
            <li> I discovered Biosilk Silk Pomade a couple of years ago at my hairdressers.  With age my hair gets dry and sometimes frizzy.  I have natural curls in my hair and the way it is styled it allows me to just put mousse in my hair, let it dry, and then I can pick it into a style.  Putting a little (the size of a dime), on my hand, rubbing my hands together, and then rubbing it through my hair takes away the dryness.  It helps me to style my hair as well.  When I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair, I rub some pomade into my hair and it refreshes it.  I don&#x27;t know if this is how I&#x27;m supposed to use it, but it works very well used in this way!  Because I use so little, it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many pomades over the years and this is definitely the best--keeps my hair silky and straight for days!  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for course thick hair and areas that have high humidity.  Takes away frizz and makes hair shine.</li>
            <li> This product was a mess when it came all dirty and it melt within time, it sucks...and it leaves your hair sticky...not good :(</li>
            <li> excellent product to add depth to hair without weighing it down would tell friends about it and of course where I purchased it</li>
            <li> Great shine...Excellent frizz tamer!</li>
            <li> it is lite ,not sticky,but i need to be very careful  how much I put on my hair, a little to much and hair look oily. It will last long time and I don&#x27;t know if I finish it until it will dry. And it smells nice. One of the best I tried but still not ideal.</li>
            <li> First time I purchased this and never again. The stuff is awful. It is impossible to blend and it sticks like globs in my hair.  I gave it one star because otherwise Amazon won&#x27;t let me post my review. It doesn&#x27;t deserve even one star.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else on my hair. They don&#x27;t sell this in salons local to my area anymore, so I&#x27;ve started ordering it through Amazon. The silk pomade is the perfect hair product because it smooths out frizz without making it too heavy. I won&#x27;t use anything else. I love it.</li>
            <li> this is such a blessing. it is better  and healthier than the regular hair gel</li>
