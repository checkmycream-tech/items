            <li>great quality and exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>They are so soft (better than my BareMinerals brushes).  </li>
            <li>They feel soft on your skin and spread everything smoothly and evenly on your face.</li>
            <li>at first I was soo scared</li>
            <li>The price made me very cautious, but don&#x27;t let that fool you!</li>
            <li>BIG THANKS :) (Y)</li>
            <li>The hairs on them were super soft before and after washing &amp; drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really wanted to use them.</li>
            <li>real test of course was in how well they worked on a face.</li>
            <li>tu get it because I thought it wuldnt b real...</li>
            <li>Work nicely, just small.</li>
            <li>because of the highly recommend reviews ... can&#x27;t wait to try them and give you a full review with actual stars !</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t know why I expected full size brushes, these are about the size of eyeshadow brushes), but I didn&#x27;t read about them too thoroughly!</li>
            <li>Lucky for me because I had a prom makeup job later that evening</li>
            <li>I washed these brushes right away &amp; not a single hair was shed.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li>I know you maybe be a little a sceptical about these brushes cuz they are so cheap!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this review once I wash them a few times, and use them a bit more.</li>
            <li>Very soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new at using professional makeup brushes so it would have helped if there was information included with brushes explaining which brushes are used for foundation, liquid, etc.</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li>They were really soft..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how crappy my old brushes were until I used these.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of buying these because the price was so good</li>
            <li>I was quite skeptical about ordering these brushes because of the low price, but I honestly can say at 1st use, I am pleasantly surprised!!!</li>
            <li>These brushes are unbelievably soft, they do not shed (yet), they are comfortably firm, they do not smell, and the brushes do what they&#x27;re supposed to better than expected!</li>
            <li>These are so short so even though the bristles are soft, powder has a tendency to stay in globs.  </li>
            <li>I did not use the other two brushes on this job but will certainly find use for them soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So soft and smooth and thick!</li>

            <li> I would highly recommend these brushes. They are very soft and do a great job with liquid blush or liquid foundation. They feel soft on your skin and spread everything smoothly and evenly on your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these brushes couple days ago , and I purchased for another set of them today ( Eyeshadow Blending set ) because of the highly recommend reviews ... can&#x27;t wait to try them and give you a full review with actual stars !&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got my Kabuki brushes .. they are beyond amazing and the quality is just like Sigma or MAC brushes , I highly recommend these set and I&#x27;ve already ordered another set for eye makeup ... BIG THANKS :) (Y)</li>
            <li> great quality and exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical about ordering these brushes because of the low price, but I honestly can say at 1st use, I am pleasantly surprised!!! I ordered these brushes in the wee hours of the am on a Wednesday last week and they were on my doorstep Friday afternoon (thanks amazon Prime)!!! Lucky for me because I had a prom makeup job later that evening and I really wanted to use them. Upon opening, there was no awful plastic/chemical/factory smell like with many of the pre-packaged brush sets. I washed these brushes right away &amp; not a single hair was shed. The hairs on them were super soft before and after washing &amp; drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real test of course was in how well they worked on a face. And they did not disappoint! The flat-topped kabuki brush blended my liquid foundation like a charm and the angled kabuki worked beautifully for blush and bronzer application. I did not use the other two brushes on this job but will certainly find use for them soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how they&#x27;ll hold up over time but, long story short, I WILL be ordering another set or two while I can get them at this steal of a price!</li>

            <li> They are so nice and soft and don&#x27;t seem to be falling out yet. They do have a plastic-y smell though.</li>
            <li> I know you maybe be a little a sceptical about these brushes cuz they are so cheap! But they are amazing! I would say that they are dupes to sigma brushes. I absolutely love them! Will purchasing more for my kit</li>
            <li> Definitely smaller than expected (I don&#x27;t know why I expected full size brushes, these are about the size of eyeshadow brushes), but I didn&#x27;t read about them too thoroughly! Work nicely, just small.</li>
