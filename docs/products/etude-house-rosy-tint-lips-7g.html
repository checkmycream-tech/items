            <li>Everything was perfect!!!</li>
            <li>Beautiful colour!</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful just perfect</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with etude house products, and this one is a very good product in terms of coverage.</li>
            <li>Color wise</li>
            <li>The packaging was very cute and it smelled like roses.</li>
            <li>It felt very smooth putting on, too!</li>
            <li>Nice smell and nice color, good costumer service</li>
            <li>I love this lip tint!</li>
            <li>it is kind of like a nude color with a hint of pink/red.</li>
            <li>The color was a bit lighter than I thought but it was so nice.</li>
            <li>but the product is nice</li>
            <li>Honestly, it reminds me a lot of the Kat Von D</li>
            <li>Nice nude color, creamy application.</li>
            <li>The color of this product is excellent and appears to be very natural.</li>
            <li>Nice color though :)</li>
            <li>id say its more warm/brown than pictured though it&#x27;s consistency is nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say I&#x27;m very impressed with the color of this product, and it covers my original lip color very well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, because the product lacks pigment, you can see through your lips no matter how many coats you apply (I did 3x).  </li>
            <li>many colours and the texture of this is lovely</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color and super easy to apply.</li>
            <li>, I cover it with lip balm and that works fine :)</li>
            <li>and i really enjoyed the free samples that came with it.</li>
            <li>The color had way to much orange in it for being called tea rose.  </li>
            <li>Its rubs off easy but applying it is fun</li>
            <li>Honestly, the only thing that could make this lip product better is if it were designed to stay on for 12 hours.</li>
            <li>I own KVD in Lolita (a dusty rose, more cool toned), and I would much rather use Etude House Rosy Tint in Tea Rose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my new favorite lip products.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not get five stars is because the color was so close to my own u</li>
            <li>Overall, I like the color, although I&#x27;m unsure if I would buy this kind of product again</li>
            <li>The color is great, it&#x27;s easy to apply, and it came earlier than expected~</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised at how quick this order came in!</li>
            <li>First off, they&#x27;re both matte lip products.</li>
            <li>Secondly, Etude House Rosy Tint is more moisturizing than KVD.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more and in different colors!</li>
            <li>It smells faintly of roses, and is a lovely neutral, pink rose color with warm tones.</li>
            <li>Only con is that it comes off easily.</li>
            <li>I lov ethat korean lip colours fit every possible skin tone, they have ao</li>
            <li>, I dont believe it really sticks as well as advertised, its very natural looking and can wipe off a bit</li>
            <li>This color, &#x27;tea rose&#x27; is very plain, beige rosy color and doesn&#x27;t give a pop of color.  </li>
            <li>The top of the applicator is covered by a round felt tip.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not made for precise application, i.e. the edges near the cupid&#x27;s bow, so I needed a lip liner.  </li>
            <li>The color is nice but does not stay on long enough and makes my lips very dry.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause me any irritation and I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It comes completely off with a swipe of a napkin or eating.  </li>
            <li>Because my lips were naturally darker</li>
            <li>I expected a more nude or neutral color but it has a slightly orange tint.</li>
            <li>This color has a very natural look.&lt;br /&gt;Products came quickly earlier than promised.</li>
            <li>wouldnt recommend it to those who arent very steady with their hands, the applicator is a spongey type and you can accidentally smear it in the wrong place quite easily.</li>
            <li>i expected the color to turn out the same way, but to my surprise, I got a very close color to the one on the swatch</li>
            <li>I would recommend to put on some moisturizer lip balm first because if you have dried lips it will accentuate it.</li>

            <li> Long lasting color!</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it is really hard to apply because the container is super hard and you have to constantly apply it because it isn&#x27;t a lip tint  &amp;#62;-&amp;#60;.</li>
            <li> Because the finish is so dry, it accentuates all the lines on my lips.  </li>
            <li> I really like the color because is very subtle and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed by this product, and surprised because I love Etudehouse lip products.  </li>
            <li> It does feel a little dry</li>
            <li> My only other complaint was that the formula dries my lips a little bit</li>
            <li> So if you like subtle color definitely buy this.</li>
            <li> but I just apply a little bit of chapstick over it.</li>
            <li> Right there is bad, since it&#x27;s not cheap at $10.  </li>
            <li> This one is an utter fail.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too hard to &amp;#34;squeeze&amp;#34; the stain out of this tube.  </li>
            <li> A bit late</li>
            <li> Not that I will be using this up entirely, but I imagine it&#x27;s gonna be impossible to get all of the product out.  </li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s very thick and a bit hard to spread.  </li>
            <li> You have to sqeeze SO hard to get anything to come out!</li>
            <li> The tube is very thick plastic, so it&#x27;s difficult to get the product out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to apply and blend out.  </li>
            <li> The texture is uncomfortable and dries out my lips.  </li>
            <li> I hate this thing.  </li>

            <li> The color of this product is excellent and appears to be very natural. Its rubs off easy but applying it is fun so I don&#x27;t mind (:</li>
            <li> MY FAV EVER ITS MATTE AND PERF</li>
            <li> The packaging was very cute and it smelled like roses. It felt very smooth putting on, too! The only reason I did not get five stars is because the color was so close to my own u can not tell I&#x27;m wearing it. And it does not look like that in the pictures!</li>
            <li> I really like the color because is very subtle and it is kind of like a nude color with a hint of pink/red. So if you like subtle color definitely buy this. It doesn&#x27;t cause me any irritation and I have really sensitive skin. I would recommend to put on some moisturizer lip balm first because if you have dried lips it will accentuate it. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it is really hard to apply because the container is super hard and you have to constantly apply it because it isn&#x27;t a lip tint  &amp;#62;-&amp;#60;.</li>

            <li> Everything was perfect!!! The color is great, it&#x27;s easy to apply, and it came earlier than expected~</li>
            <li> A bit late but the product is nice</li>
            <li> I expected a more nude or neutral color but it has a slightly orange tint. It is not too noticeable and it is like the picture but it was not what I was expecting. Nice color though :)</li>
            <li> ...it&#x27;s a stain/tint.....I do use a colored gloss over to finish off the color and keep my lips moist. This color has a very natural look.&lt;br /&gt;Products came quickly earlier than promised.</li>
            <li> I hate this thing.  It is sold as a &#x27;tint&#x27; but has no staying power whatsoever.  It comes completely off with a swipe of a napkin or eating.  The product is a cream to powder.  It comes out of a squeezy tube as a cream, and as it hits your lips, it turns powdery.  It&#x27;s difficult to apply and blend out.  The tube is very thick plastic, so it&#x27;s difficult to get the product out.  Not that I will be using this up entirely, but I imagine it&#x27;s gonna be impossible to get all of the product out.  Right there is bad, since it&#x27;s not cheap at $10.  The top of the applicator is covered by a round felt tip.  It&#x27;s really not made for precise application, i.e. the edges near the cupid&#x27;s bow, so I needed a lip liner.  Because the finish is so dry, it accentuates all the lines on my lips.  The texture is uncomfortable and dries out my lips.  I have to put a lip balm over it, which then transfers the color off the lip and on the lip balm.  This color, &#x27;tea rose&#x27; is very plain, beige rosy color and doesn&#x27;t give a pop of color.  Also, because the product lacks pigment, you can see through your lips no matter how many coats you apply (I did 3x).  I&#x27;m very disappointed by this product, and surprised because I love Etudehouse lip products.  This one is an utter fail.</li>
            <li> I love this lip tint! It smells faintly of roses, and is a lovely neutral, pink rose color with warm tones. Honestly, it reminds me a lot of the Kat Von D Double Dare matte lipstick. I own KVD in Lolita (a dusty rose, more cool toned), and I would much rather use Etude House Rosy Tint in Tea Rose. First off, they&#x27;re both matte lip products. Secondly, Etude House Rosy Tint is more moisturizing than KVD. KVD leaves my lips chapped in an hour or two. I can wear the Rosy Lip for several hours by itself and it will keep my lips hydrated. Lastly - it does smell like roses! KVD has no scent. Honestly, the only thing that could make this lip product better is if it were designed to stay on for 12 hours. It&#x27;s one of my new favorite lip products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with etude house products, and this one is a very good product in terms of coverage.

            <li> The color is beautiful just perfect and i really enjoyed the free samples that came with it.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and nice color, good costumer service</li>
            <li> It is darker than I thought. Also it&#x27;s very thick and a bit hard to spread.  Not buying it again.</li>
            <li> Nice nude color, creamy application.</li>
            <li> The color is nice but does not stay on long enough and makes my lips very dry.</li>
            <li> This product is put in the strangest container. You have to sqeeze SO hard to get anything to come out! Like, invest in a paint sqeezer. Its so off putting. Color wise id say its more warm/brown than pictured though it&#x27;s consistency is nice. It tastes rather vile though.</li>
            <li> Long lasting color! It does feel a little dry, I cover it with lip balm and that works fine :)</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color and super easy to apply. Only con is that it comes off easily. I plan on buying more and in different colors!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too hard to &amp;#34;squeeze&amp;#34; the stain out of this tube.  They need to make it easier to apply.  The color had way to much orange in it for being called tea rose.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colour! I lov ethat korean lip colours fit every possible skin tone, they have ao many colours and the texture of this is lovely</li>
