            <li>I love how srurdy these nails are compared to the others I have tried.</li>
            <li>Got them earlier than planned and they are a great quality!</li>
            <li>but i was okay with that.</li>
            <li>The shipping take a lite bit more time but its ok</li>
            <li>I love how they turned out after I did my nails.</li>
            <li>I love to wear them without any nail polish as well.</li>
            <li>It would be better if we could chose the color.  </li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>and you get to say you did them yourself. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got these and</li>
            <li>Oh love the cable tie though.</li>
            <li>You get so many nails if one cracks it can easily be replaced.</li>
            <li>Perfect! Came in pretty quickly and I did receive the clear &amp; I love them!</li>
            <li>They came faster than expected and are awesome!</li>
            <li>I was able to find the sizes I need, cut and file them down to size and they paint so great!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to shape.</li>
            <li>These nails are easy to apply, easy to clip and easy to paint.  </li>
            <li>Strong.</li>
            <li>but if you get a good nail clipper and nail files they are fine its also nice that they are so long because you can shape them anyway</li>
            <li>Hard to beat, plus its alot of fun creating your own designs,  and its awesome when women compliment your nails</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great overall!</li>
            <li>I just tried them on and they fit like a charm.</li>
            <li>Even got my free cable tie.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just not flexible to fit your nail.</li>
            <li>They are super strong too.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get these and use them instead off Kiss nails or another product like that.</li>
            <li>i ordered these a while ago and got them a good two weeks later.</li>
            <li>Good luck to you in future sales.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>The nails are full length which</li>
            <li>and but other than that the nails are good to work with</li>
            <li>They are just the right thickness.</li>
            <li>Arrived promptly, in very easy to open packages.</li>
            <li>The nails are long enough to be able to cut, file, and shape them to your exact desired look, and they are very strong!  </li>
            <li>They are strong but still feel natural on.</li>
            <li>It is an ok product and cheap, nothing from the other word.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used cheap $1 Store nail glue and they stick on just fine, for a long time.</li>
            <li>So these work pretty well.</li>
            <li>Thanks NiceEshop!</li>
            <li>they are pretty durable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>For the simple reason being I love Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love them and would recommend purchasing them if you like the look of long nails.</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty fast too considering it came from China came before the estimated date.</li>
            <li>They file down nicely as well.</li>
            <li>Other than that they work great, cant really complain about them considering the low price.</li>
            <li>I got the clear ones luckily though</li>
            <li>I went to the dollar store and got super bright glitter and nail stripper in all different colors, all in all I spent around 10$ on a complete nail kit to do just about any design you can imagine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a lot of nails for your money , but would have preferred to pick my own colors , great buy for little money  for a self starter on learning how to do false nails</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t going to break unless you apply some real force.</li>
            <li>These nails are very flimsy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to do much filing.</li>
            <li>you so much for all you have done for me.</li>
            <li>Since they were &amp;#34;full coverage&amp;#34; and not tips, i was ready to paint, glue on, and go..</li>
            <li>(I was not &amp;#34;biting&amp;#34; it like I bite my real nails) and it literally just started to peel away from the rest of the nail...</li>
            <li>These nails are cheap and last about maybe 2 days.</li>
            <li>I only use them for when I break my own nails, so they will last me forever.</li>
            <li>The ones I got were the full cover white.</li>
            <li>but they are decent for the price you pay</li>
            <li>I keep them super short too.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the way my nails look naturally</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to get the clear.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for clear full tips &amp; I received white.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the process of painting my second pair right now.</li>
            <li>5 of the bags fit my nails and the other five</li>
            <li>I love that the sizes were clearly marked and packaged separately in little reclosable baggies.</li>
            <li>The nails come in a ziplock bag essentially, which is then filled with the nails in smaller baggies and numbered according to the nail size number.</li>
            <li>The sides of my thumbs are always the first to go, then my middle fingers.</li>
            <li>I chose clear.  </li>
            <li>I like I wish I could pick which ones I wanted because I wanted clear</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t want the clear</li>
            <li>Im used to receiving the clear nails</li>
            <li>I received the clear nails within the estimated time.</li>
            <li>I ordered the one in the picture they were suppose to be clear nails</li>
            <li>I purchased this item hoping that I would get clear</li>
            <li>I was hoping to receive the clear nails</li>
            <li>I recieved them early and I recieved the yellow-ish color.</li>
            <li>I wanted the natural ones</li>
            <li>, I received the &#x27;natural&#x27; which was what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>but a motorized nail file ([[ASIN:B009VD3KUE Professional Pen-Shape Pen Shaped Electric Nail Art Manicure Pedicure Drill File with 5 Bits]]) helps a lot.</li>
            <li>I am thoroughly satisfied with how thick they feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone who is looking for good fake nails to do nail art on or paint nail polish on.</li>
            <li>the smallest 0-3 are very large to large for me to use (I have petite small hands)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty rough with my hands and these nails don&#x27;t chip/break.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still happy with the white ones, they ship in a small padded envelope and come in 10 small clear bags(all put in one big clear bag) with numbers on each 0-9, 0 is the biggest size and 9 is</li>
            <li>They are separated by sizes into smaller baggies inside a larger bag, which makes it very convenient.</li>
            <li>I wanted the clear ones and didn&#x27;t see an option to choose what you wanted from the Amazon page, so I contacted the seller directly and they allowed me to choose my color (clear, white ,or yellow)...</li>
            <li>about 2 or 3 weeks after i ordered them, I got the white ones i was hoping for clear</li>
            <li>these fake nails are exactly what I expected they would be, I received the white, they fit as expected, they stay on, they are not too flimsy BUT they do crack easily if they have to much pressure put on them, that is the only down side.</li>
            <li>I wore a pair for maybe 2 days, the first day one cracked in half</li>
            <li>If you want to cut them down use scissors that will keep them from splitting but be gentle</li>
            <li>However, in the seller&#x27;s bio, it clearly stated that it was coming standard shipping from Hong Kong, so it was to be expected.  </li>

            <li> but I&#x27;m still happy with the white ones, they ship in a small padded envelope and come in 10 small clear bags(all put in one big clear bag) with numbers on each 0-9, 0 is the biggest size and 9 is</li>
            <li> They are separated by sizes into smaller baggies inside a larger bag, which makes it very convenient.</li>
            <li> I wanted the clear ones and didn&#x27;t see an option to choose what you wanted from the Amazon page, so I contacted the seller directly and they allowed me to choose my color (clear, white ,or yellow)...</li>
            <li> about 2 or 3 weeks after i ordered them, I got the white ones i was hoping for clear</li>
            <li> these fake nails are exactly what I expected they would be, I received the white, they fit as expected, they stay on, they are not too flimsy BUT they do crack easily if they have to much pressure put on them, that is the only down side.</li>
            <li> I wore a pair for maybe 2 days, the first day one cracked in half</li>
            <li> If you want to cut them down use scissors that will keep them from splitting but be gentle</li>
            <li> However, in the seller&#x27;s bio, it clearly stated that it was coming standard shipping from Hong Kong, so it was to be expected.  </li>
            <li> they did chip a few times but im pretty rough with my hands.</li>
            <li> so I wear the full cover false nails.</li>
            <li> The largest size (0) is big enough to cover my big toe (which is pretty massive) and the smallest (9) is a little too small for my pinky finger.</li>
            <li> They came earlier than expected, I also requested white (they were for my 21st)and to my delight</li>
            <li> The nails came divided by size and were properly packed...not a single nail was damaged!  </li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail 10 days earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> The color though is not exactly clear but have a whitish hue to it.</li>
            <li> I like to use these nails to practice nail designs and to wear and they are very long just a warning</li>
            <li> these we not clear they are dull white color.</li>
            <li> I am pretty clumsy and tend to slam my hand into hard objects a lot.</li>
            <li> Other than that they work just find.</li>
            <li> I had to replace them every other day.</li>
            <li> it was definitely not the &amp;#34;operator&amp;#34; if I could give a negative rating I would.</li>
            <li> I file mine down a lot which takes some time</li>
            <li> The quality of the nails surpasses any other brand I&#x27;ve used before, even Kiss!  </li>
            <li> you want to round, square, oval,</li>
            <li> These nails have saved me from countless broken nails.</li>
            <li> Sadly, for me, these are sooooo thin and almost flexible that they split like my real nails</li>
            <li> Not sure what I need with a cable tie though.</li>
            <li> This is not my first type of press on nails, those there were the flimsiest :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really satisfied w/ the product, but I still use it.</li>
            <li> It kinda seems like all the effort for 2 days though is pointless.</li>
            <li> they are way less than 500 false nails</li>
            <li> These break very easily, I&#x27;ve broken them doing everyday activities like typing on my work computer and etc.</li>
            <li> i hate so much.</li>
            <li> They are super thin and literally broke, split in half, peeled, and worst of all glue would not keep them on whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing I can say about this is that it took every bit of six weeks to reach me.  </li>
            <li> I just hate waiting that long for anything :</li>
            <li> Random color</li>
            <li> sad..</li>
            <li> i like that, if i ever run out of my 500 fake nails</li>
            <li> For an at home do it yourself fake nail.</li>
            <li> Any customers complaining about what color they received is just silly.</li>
            <li> I got these in the mail a few days ago, everyone is complaining about getting a random color, but in the description it says random!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase fake nails anywhere else!  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They came faster than expected and are awesome! All the sizes came and they are perfect for doing nail designs :) I love them and would recommend purchasing them if you like the look of long nails.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail 10 days earlier than expected. I got the white tips. I am thoroughly satisfied with how thick they feel. They aren&#x27;t going to break unless you apply some real force. The largest size (0) is big enough to cover my big toe (which is pretty massive) and the smallest (9) is a little too small for my pinky finger. I will be using these nails to make claws for my Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> I got 10 bags of nails Numbered 1-10 on each bag. 5 of the bags fit my nails and the other five didn&#x27;t. But that&#x27;s great because they may fit clients or friends nails if not your own. They can also be used to practice on. I designed and glued these nails on, and they lasted 3 weeks before one chipped. AMAZING! Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I like that the nails cover the hole nail but: he shopping is slowI still have Nat gotten the order at all or no were it is.</li>
            <li> I recieved them early and I recieved the yellow-ish color. But I painted over them so its not visible. They&#x27;re great overall!</li>
            <li> Great for the price! They are just the right thickness. I only use them for when I break my own nails, so they will last me forever. Very happy to get so many for this price! They are separated by sizes into smaller baggies inside a larger bag, which makes it very convenient. The ones I got were the full cover white.</li>
            <li> These nails are very flimsy. I am allergic to acrylic so I wear the full cover false nails. These break very easily, I&#x27;ve broken them doing everyday activities like typing on my work computer and etc. I wish Kiss or GlinLA sold nails that were a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I love how srurdy these nails are compared to the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I wanted the natural ones but i got white. Oh well it does the job and people allways compliment me on how my nails look once i finish designing them. So these work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase fake nails anywhere else!  The only bad thing I can say about this is that it took every bit of six weeks to reach me.  However, in the seller&#x27;s bio, it clearly stated that it was coming standard shipping from Hong Kong, so it was to be expected.  I just hate waiting that long for anything :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nails themselves are spectacular!  I wanted the clear ones and didn&#x27;t see an option to choose what you wanted from the Amazon page, so I contacted the seller directly and they allowed me to choose my color (clear, white ,or yellow)...I chose clear.  I was very impressed that they allowed me to do that!  The quality of the nails surpasses any other brand I&#x27;ve used before, even Kiss!  The nails are long enough to be able to cut, file, and shape them to your exact desired look, and they are very strong!  I&#x27;m pretty rough with my hands and these nails don&#x27;t chip/break.  The nails came divided by size and were properly packed...not a single nail was damaged!  I&#x27;ll definitely be using these nails again.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted to try these out and she loves them.  Got them earlier than planned and they are a great quality!</li>
            <li> they look really great. they did chip a few times but im pretty rough with my hands. i would deff buy again.</li>
            <li> This is an update of my earlier review. My package finally arrived!! I just tried them on and they fit like a charm. I didn&#x27;t have to do much filing. The color though is not exactly clear but have a whitish hue to it. Other than that they work just find. Thanks NiceEshop!</li>
            <li> i ordered these a while ago and got them a good two weeks later. they are great. i recieved the off white colored nails since you dont get to choose but i was okay with that. there definitely want 500 of them but there was a good amount.  i do recommend them to anyone, they are a great product</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly enough however these nails are garbage. They are super thin and literally broke, split in half, peeled, and worst of all glue would not keep them on whatsoever.  Being a nail technician for 15+ years it was definitely not the &amp;#34;operator&amp;#34; if I could give a negative rating I would.</li>
            <li> It is an ok product and cheap, nothing from the other word. The shipping take a lite bit more time but its ok</li>
            <li> greeting&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for all you have done for me. Good luck to you in future sales.&lt;br /&gt;Have a nice rest of the day&lt;br /&gt;goodbye</li>
            <li> The nails are full length which I like I wish I could pick which ones I wanted because I wanted clear but oh well. If you want to cut them down use scissors that will keep them from splitting but be gentle or they still my split but they are decent for the price you pay</li>
            <li> Excellent price, super fast turn around. I got the item just days after I ordered it, via USPS. Random color, I received the &#x27;natural&#x27; which was what I was hoping for. Even got my free cable tie. Not sure what I need with a cable tie though. The nails come in a ziplock bag essentially, which is then filled with the nails in smaller baggies and numbered according to the nail size number.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these and use them instead off Kiss nails or another product like that. Since they were &amp;#34;full coverage&amp;#34; and not tips, i was ready to paint, glue on, and go.. Sadly, for me, these are sooooo thin and almost flexible that they split like my real nails i hate so much. I had them on 3 days and 3 cracked at them end... I keep them super short too. I know another one which I touched with my teeth (I was not &amp;#34;biting&amp;#34; it like I bite my real nails) and it literally just started to peel away from the rest of the nail... This is not my first type of press on nails, those there were the flimsiest :( sad.. I guess I will have to go back to to the drug store brands if I want them to stay on....</li>
            <li> I was looking for clear full tips &amp; I received white. I&#x27;m not really satisfied w/ the product, but I still use it.</li>
            <li> So there were mixed reviews on this I really don&#x27;t like the way my nails look naturally and I can&#x27;t afford to get them done all the time so I figured if start doing glue on nails and painting them and I think these nails work great! A lot of people said they cracked or broke but I&#x27;ve had them on for about a week now and they are still on so I have no complaints and when I&#x27;m out I will buy again cuz they&#x27;re the best I&#x27;ve gotten so far. Shipping was pretty fast too considering it came from China came before the estimated date.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want the clear</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but now I need to find someone who knows how to put them on me! Lol</li>
            <li> they are way less than 500 false nails im dissapointed at that and but other than that the nails are good to work with</li>
            <li> the product is good and they are what i was expecting its a good product and for a good price</li>
            <li> Im used to receiving the clear nails but i received the white ones. They work just as well. And came on date promised.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Came in pretty quickly and I did receive the clear &amp; I love them! Great! And I received a blue cable tie which, let&#x27;s face it... I won&#x27;t use... my dog chews on it so I guess he got a chew toy out of it. This is a must buy!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, was worth it and fit my nails perfectly. I love how they turned out after I did my nails.</li>
            <li> I got these nails about 2 or 3 weeks after i ordered them, I got the white ones i was hoping for clear but I&#x27;m still happy with the white ones, they ship in a small padded envelope and come in 10 small clear bags(all put in one big clear bag) with numbers on each 0-9, 0 is the biggest size and 9 is the smallest 0-3 are very large to large for me to use (I have petite small hands) I like to use these nails to practice nail designs and to wear and they are very long just a warning but if you get a good nail clipper and nail files they are fine its also nice that they are so long because you can shape them anyway you want to round, square, oval, pointed, so i like that, if i ever run out of my 500 fake nails i know where i&#x27;ll be re-ordering!! I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone who is looking for good fake nails to do nail art on or paint nail polish on.</li>
            <li> I received the clear nails within the estimated time. These nails are very nice. They are strong but still feel natural on. They file down nicely as well. I have been wearing mine for three days now and have cleaned house in them and they still look great!</li>
            <li> They came earlier than expected, I also requested white (they were for my 21st)and to my delight it&#x27;s what I received! they are pretty durable. Definitely intend to buy these all the time. Id recommend them to my girlfriends, And anyone who&#x27;d rather pay 4$ instead of 20-30$ GOOD BUY, Thank you!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! Will be ordering from again. Arrived promptly, in very easy to open packages. I love that the sizes were clearly marked and packaged separately in little reclosable baggies. I was able to find the sizes I need, cut and file them down to size and they paint so great!!! I love to wear them without any nail polish as well. Great find and buy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to get the clear.  It would be better if we could chose the color.  Even if the price goes up just a bit.</li>
            <li> I got these in the mail a few days ago, everyone is complaining about getting a random color, but in the description it says random!!!! I got the clear ones luckily though and I just love them :D!</li>
            <li> I should give it one star but these nails look absolutely beautiful and real when applied correctly. I was a cashier at a supermarket and they would break and chip often. I had to replace them every other day. Also, whenever i was out of the shower you can feel the water that got in from under them. They&#x27;re just not flexible to fit your nail.</li>
            <li> i tried removing them with nail polish remover, and the nail itself melted! it was everywhere and wouldn&#x27;t come off my nails!!!!!!! I want my money back</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a lot of nails for your money , but would have preferred to pick my own colors , great buy for little money  for a self starter on learning how to do false nails then this product is for you</li>
            <li> Love these. Easy to shape. Strong. Got compliments on them. I rounded mine. If I could attach a picture I would.</li>
            <li> These were not the nails I ordered.I ordered the one in the picture they were suppose to be clear nails these we not clear they are dull white color.I was very disappointed.For the simple reason being I love Amazon.</li>
            <li> These nails are easy to apply, easy to clip and easy to paint.  They stay on even when I work in the garden</li>
            <li> I decide to give this review was that it came in nice package and there was no damage to the product. Works for what I got it for.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item hoping that I would get clear but I ended up getting the white. They are good to practice putting 3d nail designs on.</li>
            <li> For an at home do it yourself fake nail. flawless</li>
            <li> these fake nails are exactly what I expected they would be, I received the white, they fit as expected, they stay on, they are not too flimsy BUT they do crack easily if they have to much pressure put on them, that is the only down side. They wont stay perfect for more than a day before they crack. The sides of my thumbs are always the first to go, then my middle fingers. Other than that they work great, cant really complain about them considering the low price. You get so many nails if one cracks it can easily be replaced. Definitely satisfied&lt;br /&gt; Any customers complaining about what color they received is just silly. These nails are for painting yourself and doing an at home nail kit rather than spending 50+$ on acrylics or 8$ on store bought glue on ones. For an at home nail kit these are prefect, no matter what color you receive. Its going to be covered with polish anyway so why complain. I went to the dollar store and got super bright glitter and nail stripper in all different colors, all in all I spent around 10$ on a complete nail kit to do just about any design you can imagine. Hard to beat, plus its alot of fun creating your own designs,  and its awesome when women compliment your nails and you get to say you did them yourself. :)</li>
            <li> I love these nails! There are a bunch of sizes to pick from. Nail polish covers them flawlessly. They are super strong too. I am pretty clumsy and tend to slam my hand into hard objects a lot. These nails have saved me from countless broken nails. I&#x27;ve used cheap $1 Store nail glue and they stick on just fine, for a long time. I file mine down a lot which takes some time but a motorized nail file ([[ASIN:B009VD3KUE Professional Pen-Shape Pen Shaped Electric Nail Art Manicure Pedicure Drill File with 5 Bits]]) helps a lot. I&#x27;m so glad I got these and will buy them again.</li>
            <li> These nails are cheap and last about maybe 2 days. I cant complain about the price. I wore a pair for maybe 2 days, the first day one cracked in half so I replaced it. The second day one started cracking at the end and my thumb one wouldn&#x27;t stay on. I just took them all off. I&#x27;m in the process of painting my second pair right now. It kinda seems like all the effort for 2 days though is pointless. Good for the money, just expecting better I guess.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to receive the clear nails but they ended up sending me white. Not only that they are quite big for my nails but they will do I guess. Oh love the cable tie though.</li>
