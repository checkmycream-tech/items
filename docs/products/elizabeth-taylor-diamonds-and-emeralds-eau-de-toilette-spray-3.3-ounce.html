            <li>My mom was really happy with ir</li>
            <li>So happy I found this perfume.</li>

            <li>Please keep shipping to Canada, my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li>BUT IT&#x27;S BEEN OUT OF PRODUCTIONS FOR A DECADE OR MORE</li>
            <li>, I STILL LOVE IT EVEN THO</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>This is pretty in the beginning with some flowers: gardenia, jasmine, rose &amp; barely-there tuberose.  </li>
            <li>DELIVERED MARCH 25, 2015, FANTASTIC SHIPPING.  </li>
            <li>nice smell with reasonable price</li>
            <li>This scent doesn&#x27;t smell like the original scent...</li>
            <li>The original scent I put on and It would last all day.</li>
            <li>White Diamonds is my favorite, but Emeralds would be a close second.</li>
            <li>This smells really dated to me; a mature woman in the 1990&#x27;s would have worn this</li>
            <li>I AGREE WITH OTHERS THAT IT IS OLD AND LOSING STRENGTH</li>
            <li>Regular fragrance does not last for long, I did not really like, despite the nice presentation box and bottle.</li>
            <li>I put this scent on and could barely smell it and by the time I left the house it couldn&#x27;t be smelt at all</li>

            <li> This is pretty in the beginning with some flowers: gardenia, jasmine, rose &amp; barely-there tuberose.  But they all disappear in to the ether in less than 30 minutes.  Then you have patchouli &amp; that is about it.  This smells really dated to me; a mature woman in the 1990&#x27;s would have worn this but now it&#x27;s pass&amp;eacute;.  I really do not care for this fragrance.  This may be a victim of reformulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very weak fragrance &amp; the patchouli barely lasts a couple hours on my skin.</li>
