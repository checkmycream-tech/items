            <li>This is one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used leaves my hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful on the hair, makes it soft, manageable, and protects when styling.</li>
            <li>I had a leave-in conditioner that I loved years ago that is no longer available.</li>
            <li>I have been using it, along with the shampoo for over a year and can&#x27;t find anything out there that works better for my kind of hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair but with lots of it.</li>
            <li>One day I was in a hair product aisle at the store bemoaning all of the many choices for hair products and the fact that I couldn&#x27;t find a suitable leave-in conditioner and a woman suggested the product to me.  </li>

            <li>This really is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>:) Irma</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li>Nice and light</li>
            <li>Love the product.. but 10 oz came in at 5 bottles of 2 oz each..</li>
            <li>This is even better.  </li>
            <li>I had searched and tried many others in the interim until I discovered</li>
            <li>For me, it would definitely work best as a conditioner you use in the show and wash out.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it, it  give my hair more  volume .</li>
            <li>Since ordering this product, I have fallen in love and use this product every day.</li>
            <li>&amp;#60;3 i also love buying</li>
            <li>she loved it so much!</li>
            <li>It smells great and it does make my hair feel really soft but in no way did it provide any volume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really that good.  </li>
            <li>I like the original miracle 10 better than the lite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never heard of this product line until my Zumba Instructor (and licensed cosmetologist) recommended the original leave-in conditioner, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Makes styling easy</li>
            <li>but I feel so strongly about this product that I am taking the time to do so.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that I had a constant battle with fly aways and static.  </li>
            <li>I went with the Lite version of this leave in conditioner since I have fine hair, lots of it, but it&#x27;s fine and easily gets product build up.</li>
            <li>Nice smell and good alternate for the original conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have slightly fine, oily, curly hair</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair and this product</li>
            <li>I would be willing to try the one for blond hair since I have highlights, but will likely purchase whichever one I find to be the best value for the money when I need to repurchase.</li>
            <li>The shampoo was fine.  </li>
            <li>This gave my fine hair no volume whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t go as far as to say miracle, but it is the best product I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>Prefer the original but opted for the lighter on recommendation of my hairdresser since my hair is fine.</li>
            <li>This does a good job, not as heavy for sure.</li>
            <li>I was happy with both of those, but I think that the Lite better suits my fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>It works great and leaves a shine but doesn&#x27;t wiegh my hair down.</li>
            <li>This product is great, it conditions the hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I like the one in the blue bottle much better!  </li>
            <li>and I love th way it lets my natural wave show through!</li>
            <li>and I gotta say it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my thin hair</li>
            <li>I love to run my fingers through my soft silky hair.  </li>
            <li>Although it is pricey, worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Great product and half price compared to ULTA!</li>
            <li>I like how this makes my hair silky, smooths fly aways (although not quite as much as I thought it might from other reviewers) and overall adds a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling soft and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>It smells good, keeps my hair soft and shiny, and doesn&#x27;t add extra weight to my greasy hair.</li>
            <li>This is great for thin hair that needs light conditioning.</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>The price of it would turn many people away because hey, you can grab something from the local drugstore and be done with it.  </li>
            <li>depending on how much you use!</li>
            <li>I love the light version because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my curls down, and still detangles and conditions.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great for fine thin hair!</li>
            <li>This lasts for a good few months!  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much of this to condition your whole head.  </li>
            <li>My absolute fav</li>
            <li>This spray really helps it to feel and look smoother.  </li>
            <li>This is the real product.</li>
            <li>Really help with detangling as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Is it really a &amp;#34;Miracle&amp;#34;?  </li>
            <li>but it works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Bought the conditioner with Keratin and am much happier.</li>
            <li>Recently switched over to the &amp;#34;lite&amp;#34; version since I swear they changed the formula of the original.</li>
            <li>This is the only hair product I can&#x27;t live without for light, shiny manageable hair.</li>
            <li>It does not weigh my hair down and eliminates that static cling that comes in the winter.</li>
            <li>but most leave my hair feeling weighted down.</li>
            <li>We live in Florida- between the sun, humidity and swimming, we need all the help we can get!</li>
            <li>It really works on my natural curly hair very well.  </li>
            <li>Also, it leaves my hair very soft!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing it.</li>
            <li>perfect for my thin hair--not too heavy for it</li>
            <li>Even as a leave in conditioner, it definitely is light as it does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>I tried the non-lite version which was good but a little too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, and maintains volume all day.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>After switching to &amp;#34;It&#x27;s A 10&amp;#34; that problem diminished considerably.  </li>
            <li>I found that this product was a little heavy as a leave-in conditioner on my super fine,</li>
            <li>I fill a very small sized travel bottle that has a spray top</li>
            <li>I use it as a thermal protector, and it&#x27;s light enough it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look greasy on day 2.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and does not weigh my hair down.</li>

            <li> This really is fantastic!  I have shoulder length dirty blond hair that is NOT thick but I have a fair amount of hair.  You don&#x27;t need much of this to condition your whole head.  I fill a very small sized travel bottle that has a spray top and I only used 3/4 of the bottle for a 10 day trip!  I spray about 4 pumps into my palm and massage into wet hair after shampooing.  I get it wet and massage again to fully incorporate it and it couldn&#x27;t be softer - but it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down or get greasy.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used leaves my hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li> This product is light and smells great.  Leaves your hair feeling soft and easy to comb.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells good, keeps my hair soft and shiny, and doesn&#x27;t add extra weight to my greasy hair.</li>
            <li> I like the original miracle 10 better than the lite. Has a nice smell</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I got a great deal on Amazon and I&#x27;m happy!  :) Irma</li>
            <li> This is a 10!  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Does a terrific job with detangling. Does not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> Must have! My absolute fav</li>
            <li> Wife loves this stuff and 50% less than locally</li>
            <li> I have very fine frizzy hair.  It&#x27;s damaged from being colored.  This spray really helps it to feel and look smoother.  I won&#x27;t go as far as to say miracle, but it is the best product I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> Great product and half price compared to ULTA!</li>
            <li> I give it an 11.  It&#x27;s really that good.  I leave it in past the recommended time and I gotta say it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I started using this stuff last year and I really like it! My hair is very thin and this product does not weigh it down at all. I spray it on everyday whether I style my hair or not. It also really helps to detangle it when I am just out of the shower, as my well water can be a bit hard.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair but with lots of it. Makes my hair so soft and manageable. Makes styling easy</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my thin hair</li>
            <li> My one and only leave in conditioner. Stylist recommended to me for my thin long hair and it&#x27;s a must for me now to keep split ends and frizzies away all day. Weightless and smells amazing. You&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; leave in conditioners. I like them all but Volumizing Leave-in Lite is the best for the fine, over-heat-styled hair. I apply generously every day, even though I wash my hair only every other day (or two sometimes).</li>
            <li> Recently switched over to the &amp;#34;lite&amp;#34; version since I swear they changed the formula of the original. This does a good job, not as heavy for sure. Seems to be a good choice for summer.</li>
            <li> This is the real product. It is wonderful on the hair, makes it soft, manageable, and protects when styling. I am addicted. Much less expensive than at the salon.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair. It works great and leaves a shine but doesn&#x27;t wiegh my hair down. Really help with detangling as well.</li>
            <li> Seems to work as well as the regular version without weighing my hair down.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is great, it conditions the hair without weighing it down. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have slightly fine, oily, curly hair and this is the best product I have ever used on my hair. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or leave an oily residue, and it still makes my hair manageable! My mom even tried to steal it the last time she came to visit she loved it so much!</li>
            <li> If you have processed hair you have to buy this product,  It is a little expensive but last a long time and is really worth it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my thin hair and it smells great. Nice and light so my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down by it, and people often compliment me on how soft my hair feels.</li>
            <li> I like the one in the blue bottle much better!  Bought this one in error.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair from frizzing without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Love the product.. but 10 oz came in at 5 bottles of 2 oz each..</li>
            <li> Miracle spray indeed! perfect for my thin hair--not too heavy for it</li>
            <li> It really works on my natural curly hair very well.  Other products didn&#x27;t do the trick.  I&#x27;m very pleased and will order it again. I recommend it to all the lady&#x27;s with curly hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff saved my hair.  I cannot go a day without it.  I have fine hair that I had a constant battle with fly aways and static.  After using this product, I have no more problems.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky.  My hair feels soft, and maintains volume all day.  I am in love!</li>
            <li> After shampoo and conditioning, a few spritz on damp hair and my hair will dry soft and shiny. Even as a leave in conditioner, it definitely is light as it does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item having used this product before with wonderful results. When I received the purchase I noticed minuscule  difference in the printing of the labels. Upon unscrewing the cap I noticed a chemical-y smell that my previous bottle did not have. I also noticed that the formula was extremely watered down. I am returning this item and only buying this product from verified sellers only.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and good alternate for the original conditioner. Prefer the original but opted for the lighter on recommendation of my hairdresser since my hair is fine. It works well but doesn&#x27;t tame as much.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner!  I put it on after using the Shampoo and have towel dried my hair....a few spritz goes a long way.  I them use whatever volumizing product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I tried the non-lite version which was good but a little too heavy for my hair. So this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Speedy shipping, excellent product!</li>
            <li> It does make the hair shiny .</li>
            <li> My kid turned me on to It&#x27;s a 10. I use it every day now.</li>
            <li> Amazing leave-in conditioner. I have fine, curly hair and this product is the best! It is very lightweight and does not weigh my hair down. Also, it leaves my hair very soft! I am so happy to have found this. I have always loved It&#x27;s a 10 products and this does not disappoint. I highly recommend purchasing it. This conditioner is now on my list of must haves!</li>
            <li> I had a leave-in conditioner that I loved years ago that is no longer available. This is even better.  I love to run my fingers through my soft silky hair.  I had searched and tried many others in the interim until I discovered It&#x27;s a 10 Leave-In Miracle Conditioner.  One day I was in a hair product aisle at the store bemoaning all of the many choices for hair products and the fact that I couldn&#x27;t find a suitable leave-in conditioner and a woman suggested the product to me.  I went home, read my trusty Amazon reviews and placed an order.  At a later time, there was a discussion at work about hair products and almost all of the women raved about It&#x27;s a 10 Leave In except one who hadn&#x27;t tried it and she planned to try it. I guess I should have asked them about leave-in conditioners a long time ago.  At least I wasn&#x27;t the last to discover it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the regular and the one with Keratin.  I was happy with both of those, but I think that the Lite better suits my fine, thin hair.  I think the fragrance may be a little lighter.  I found this 10 ounce product to be the best buy I could find.  I would be willing to try the one for blond hair since I have highlights, but will likely purchase whichever one I find to be the best value for the money when I need to repurchase.</li>
            <li> I found that this product was a little heavy as a leave-in conditioner on my super fine, color treated hair.  For me, it would definitely work best as a conditioner you use in the show and wash out.  I am still deciding if this line of volumizing products are the best for my hair.</li>
            <li> Smooths tangles in my fine hair like magic! Great product!</li>
            <li> Great value for this large bottle of It&#x27;s a 10 Lite. I use this leave in conditioner on my daughters (4, 6 &amp; 10) as well as myself, and it&#x27;s fantastic!! It never leaves my hair feeling greasy or flat. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is great for thin hair that needs light conditioning.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best tangle spray for kids---- we have purchased every kind, and this is the keeper.... Although it is pricey, worth every penny.  It also helps to manage damaged hair.  We live in Florida- between the sun, humidity and swimming, we need all the help we can get!</li>
            <li> My wife uses it says it is great</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  Love it.  The content of this is not the same as previously purchased.  It has an odor and feels badly in my hair.  Will not be using it.  The shampoo was fine.  It is a great product.</li>
            <li> Having thin limp hair this is the conditioner for me.  It does not weigh my hair down and eliminates that static cling that comes in the winter. Some products worked but my hair seemed to needed to be washed the next day. Not with this product- it is a very light coating.  Two sprays in my palm is all I need!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I can use it and not have greasy hair. It leaves my hair soft and silky. If I straighten it, it doesn&#x27;t bring the curl back.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> Very nice, detangles and help condidtion</li>
            <li> The sprayer in the bottle would not bring out the liquid. I tried everything to fix it and nothing worked so I sent it back and didn&#x27;t reorder. Was too afraid the next one wouldn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! It works wonders for my hair and I love th way it lets my natural wave show through! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for fine thin hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using It&#x27;s a 10 for years.  This lite version is great for fine hair.  It untangles and protects when I use a flat iron.  This is the only hair product I can&#x27;t live without for light, shiny manageable hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin, poker straight hair and this product is amazing!  All I need is a few sprays after towel drying my hair and it combs through leaving my hair conditioned with shine and added volume.  One bottle this size lasts a very long time because you use such a small amount.  My hair is color treated so it needs conditioner but most leave my hair feeling weighted down. This stuff really is great!  I have been using it, along with the shampoo for over a year and can&#x27;t find anything out there that works better for my kind of hair.  I&#x27;m not one of those people who writes reviews especially for something as ordinary as hair products but I feel so strongly about this product that I am taking the time to do so.  The price of it would turn many people away because hey, you can grab something from the local drugstore and be done with it.  I spend a lot of money coloring my hair and I decided that it&#x27;s become an investment.  Before I switched to this product had been loosing a lot of hair.  After switching to &amp;#34;It&#x27;s A 10&amp;#34; that problem diminished considerably.  Is it really a &amp;#34;Miracle&amp;#34;?  I don&#x27;t think so but it works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Does not work for me.  Unfortunately this product does not work as advertised for my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never heard of this product line until my Zumba Instructor (and licensed cosmetologist) recommended the original leave-in conditioner, and I love it. I use it as a thermal protector, and it&#x27;s light enough it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look greasy on day 2. A little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Love it, it  give my hair more  volume .</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.  Bought the conditioner with Keratin and am much happier.</li>
            <li> Always a fan of it&#x27;s a 10. Nothing comes close to making my hair softer. I&#x27;ve wasted money when trying to give other products a chance but lesson learned, stick to what you know!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about ordering this product, but It&#x27;s a 10 products had so many raving reviews, I finally decided to give one a try. I went with the Lite version of this leave in conditioner since I have fine hair, lots of it, but it&#x27;s fine and easily gets product build up. My hair is also highlighted so a little dryer since I started highlighting it. Since ordering this product, I have fallen in love and use this product every day. I am now on my third bottle. One bottle lasts me a couple months. I like how this makes my hair silky, smooths fly aways (although not quite as much as I thought it might from other reviewers) and overall adds a nice shine. I traditionally have only used conditioner in the shower, but the leave-in conditioner concept is growing on me because I can tailor it to my hair&#x27;s need on any given day.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product. This gave my fine hair no volume whatsoever. It smells great and it does make my hair feel really soft but in no way did it provide any volume. In fact it did the opposite, leaving my hair flat with no body.</li>
            <li> My favourite product ever! it smells delicious! &amp;#60;3 i also love buying It&#x27;s A 10 online because they sell the bigger bottles! In the stores they sell the smaller bottles that almost look like the sample bottles or something. This lasts for a good few months!  depending on how much you use!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a must have. I love the light version because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my curls down, and still detangles and conditions.  A must have</li>
