            <li>the smell is fantastic and the same as before nothing change , that makes me happy!!!</li>
            <li>I smelled it once, and it was very sweet and smelled like it was old.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>she loved it so much she bought some for her sister.</li>
            <li>i loved the smell so much i always get compliments</li>
            <li>awesome price!I am actually giving it to my 14 yr old niece who will love it!</li>
            <li>It smells like cheap detergent.  </li>
            <li>My 28-year old daughter picked this one and once she opened it and sprayed it on, instantly loved it.  </li>
            <li>this perfume smells almost like the original i grew up with.  </li>
            <li>so I was delighted to see Colors was still available - but would it still smell the same?</li>
            <li>I was quite excited to get this in, but was quickly displeased when I smelled it.  </li>
            <li>Smells good but could last longer...</li>
            <li>to receive and open it seems of good quality wine in a box well protected.</li>
            <li>like a teenager..came quickly..</li>
            <li>This was one of my favorite perfumes back in college and for $10 I am happy for the trip down memory lane :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of a flowery, spicy oriental - but not overpowering or heavy at all - just light and lovely.</li>
            <li>fresh..</li>
            <li>I wanted to give a special gift to my wife, but did not have much budget, until I found this.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume because it had good reviews, however, when I got it and sprayed a little bit on</li>
            <li>I received it on time with some surprising  little extras just in time for christmas a friend gave  me this perfume as a gift</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s inexpensive, and has a fresh sent, much unlike the designer perumes on the market.</li>
            <li>Sadly, it is not what I remember.  </li>
            <li>it is the most low Price I bouth</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been around for a long time and many people have never tried it.</li>
            <li>When all is said and done, after it dries down a bit, it still smells like the old Colors that I knew and loved.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula or if my tastes have just changed that much, but it smells very manly to me.</li>
            <li>Also I didn&#x27;t like the smell much.</li>
            <li>thanks amazon.. to sell it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a retro perfume kick lately - scents I loved in high school and college (1987 - 1991 era)</li>
            <li>my younger sister recently said, \\&quot;i love that perfume</li>
            <li>It has a juvenile aroma and it can use it daily, the aroma is pleasant and durable.</li>
            <li>We got this thinking it would be like the Colors we had in High School.</li>
            <li>Its a stronger scent that fades into a entirely soft very enticing scent.</li>
            <li>and frankly I like the new green bottle better.</li>
            <li>It arrived brand new in the box.  </li>
            <li>What I think the problem is, is that this perfume is just old!  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s the same exact scent you remember and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>Used to wear this all the time in the early 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>As far as I know, this scent was discontinued by Benetton quite some time ago so these bottles that we are purchasing now have to be quite old.  </li>
            <li>It has that alcohol smell that old perfumes get over time.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is slightly different than I remember (it was clear as I recall with a blue cap and &amp;#34;Colors&amp;#34; in primary colors) but the same shape</li>
            <li>I use it since I&#x27;m 13 years old.</li>
            <li>thanks, every things it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;i wish visit your products next time.</li>
            <li>The package was open, not packed like a new product is.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought 3 bottles and only two had product in them (one bottle were totally empty).</li>

    <ol>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances of all time. Sweet and youthful, always pleasant, never overpowering. I am a lifelong fan. (And so is my husband, who loves my Colors.)</li>
            <li> Used to wear this all the time in the early 90&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t like the smell now. I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula or if my tastes have just changed that much, but it smells very manly to me.</li>
            <li> Not the same as when you bought it as a teen. Stinky! I threw it away.</li>
            <li> I started using this 30some years ago. my younger sister recently said, \\&quot;i love that perfume you&#x27;re wearing\\&quot;. so i bought her some as a gift. i bought myself another and one for my son&#x27;s girlfriend and she is 28. she loved it so much she bought some for her sister. it&#x27;s been around for a long time and many people have never tried it. it&#x27;s inexpensive, and has a fresh sent, much unlike the designer perumes on the market. try some, i guarantee you&#x27;ll be satisfied.....d.toni, in baltimore.</li>
            <li> I had this perfume when i was a teenager, I loved the scent and remembered good times, I had to purchase this again as an adult and its still awesome!</li>
            <li> Purchase this product more than ones. My friend love the smell.The first time I bought 3 bottles and only two had product in them (one bottle were totally empty). Try to contact the supplier and no reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Martin Els</li>
            <li> I love this perfume for women.  I have not been able to find it since 1992.  It smells fantastic and I am very pleased to be wearing it again.  Thanks for the quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I love it, is so affordable that i use this fragrance instead of the body splash from Victoria or Bath and Body works.&lt;br /&gt;Its a long lasting.</li>
            <li> Have been using this perfume since 1989. There are no words to describe how much I love it, I don&#x27;t know what I would do if the company ever discontinue marketing this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume because it had good reviews, however, when I got it and sprayed a little bit on I was truly disappointed.  It smells like cheap detergent.  I don&#x27;t think it is supposed to smell this way but it sure does stink.  I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> In others&#x27; reviews people are saying that they changed the formula for this perfume.  What I think the problem is, is that this perfume is just old!  As far as I know, this scent was discontinued by Benetton quite some time ago so these bottles that we are purchasing now have to be quite old.  It has that alcohol smell that old perfumes get over time.  When all is said and done, after it dries down a bit, it still smells like the old Colors that I knew and loved.  This was one of my favorite perfumes back in college and for $10 I am happy for the trip down memory lane :)</li>
            <li> wore this long ago, scent very different today, did not like it.. smells like lemon pledge</li>
            <li> I was quite excited to get this in, but was quickly displeased when I smelled it.  It smells more like a men&#x27;s cologne.  This is not the Colors perfume I remember from the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Ohhh, this is not the Colors we all loved and remember.  This smells like rubbing alcohol (literally).  Sadly, it is not what I remember.  There is very little fragrance in this bottle.  Avoid if you can.  You get what you pay for here.</li>
            <li> choose this rating, because I think it&#x27;s great the processes to bring the product in good condition to my mailbox</li>
            <li> I loved this scent in the 1990&#x27;s and I love it today. Thank you.It arrived promptly and was wonderful to get.</li>
            <li> Smells good but could last longer...</li>
            <li> Excelente quede complacido con el producto, proximamente espero poder seguir realizando compras de este estilo, gracias por todo, Feliz Año</li>
            <li> I wanted to give a special gift to my wife, but did not have much budget, until I found this. It is a fragrance that she loves, so she&#x27;s indulged at a low price.</li>
            <li> The package was open, not packed like a new product is. Also I didn&#x27;t like the smell much. Too heavy and nauseating.</li>
            <li> I gave this EDT to my 14 year-old daughter and she loved. It has a juvenile aroma and it can use it daily, the aroma is pleasant and durable. Their friends have liked it. I recommend it</li>
            <li> We got this thinking it would be like the Colors we had in High School. NOPE this smells like baby oil and pine needles.  Gave it to my younger brother.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.  The perfume is 100% authentic.  It arrived brand new in the box.  5 stars!</li>
            <li> This is definitely a send back for me. I smelled it once, and it was very sweet and smelled like it was old.&lt;br /&gt;I love the Colors by B for Men....but this fragrance is not fresh like I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> my husband got this for me after using it more than 10 year s ago.I still love it its a great fragrance at a great price....keep it up AMAZON</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a retro perfume kick lately - scents I loved in high school and college (1987 - 1991 era) so I was delighted to see Colors was still available - but would it still smell the same? At $12 I was curious to find out. Good news on this one because it does! This lovely scent is so delightful. it&#x27;s kind of a flowery, spicy oriental - but not overpowering or heavy at all - just light and lovely. The bottle is slightly different than I remember (it was clear as I recall with a blue cap and &amp;#34;Colors&amp;#34; in primary colors) but the same shape and frankly I like the new green bottle better. Order with confidence - it&#x27;s the same exact scent you remember and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> to receive and open it seems of good quality wine in a box well protected. The number of stars not complete because I have not completely exceeds my expectations</li>
            <li> THIS Benetton is my favorite since many years ago, im happy i found it again the smell is fantastic and the same as before nothing change , that makes me happy!!!</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS AND HAVE DIFFICULTY FINDING IT IN THE STORES. IT HAS A VERY UNIQUE FRAGRANCE AND PEOPLE COME UP TO ME AND ASK ME WHAT I AM WEARING 1</li>
            <li> I received it on time with some surprising  little extras just in time for christmas a friend gave  me this perfume as a gift a few years ago it finished i loved the smell so much i always get compliments so I said let me try Amazon  and see if they have it and also if it will smell the same and to my surprise they do have it and it does smell the same OOH THANK YOU AMAZON</li>
            <li> I love this  Eau de toilette sparay.. for ever I used this. thanks amazon.. to sell it... it is the most low Price I bouth</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume!! I recommend it! I use it since I&#x27;m 13 years old. And the price is really good!</li>
            <li> This is a good refreshing fragrance within this price. The only problem is it doesn&#x27;t last very long. The delivery was quick &amp; package was in very good condition.</li>
            <li> very good product, excellent fragrance</li>
            <li> My daughter worse this a lot in her teens. Its a stronger scent that fades into a entirely soft very enticing scent.</li>
            <li> 20 or so years ago this perfume was all the rage.  I bought a bottle last year for our family Christmas grab-bag.  My 28-year old daughter picked this one and once she opened it and sprayed it on, instantly loved it.  So, at this price I figured I&#x27;d purchase another one for the 2012 Christmas grab-bag.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume looking for a specific scent, and this one had one of what I was looking for listed; for the inexpensive price, I decided to check it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived on time, no damage to the Colors box nor perfume bottle.  I just do not like the scent, but it deserves a good rating because everything else was great.</li>
            <li> smells just like i remember..fresh..like a teenager..came quickly..intact..awesome price!I am actually giving it to my 14 yr old niece who will love it!</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve used it for years along with Fendi for Woman. Very pleasant ( and sexy)</li>
