            <li>No harmful chemicals and smells great.</li>
            <li>I use it ever morning after my shower and my skin is great.</li>

            <li>Happily, it does fade in 20 minutes</li>
            <li>It goes on great</li>
            <li>LOVE Bronners lotions and products!!  </li>
            <li>The wonderful orange and lavender scents aren&#x27;t too strong, but just a hint of the flavors.  </li>
            <li>It hydrates perfectly, its light &amp; leaves skin feeling fully moisturized.</li>

            <li>This fragrance is a more pleasant one than the other, more woodsy one (green bottle) but it&#x27;s still a bit strong and...hippie-ish?</li>
            <li>HOWEVER it is an excellent moisturizer for hands, body, feet, not really great for face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a sticky and strange feeling lotion.</li>
            <li>I ordered the same lotion in the patchouli and lime - it just arrived and now I don&#x27;t know which I like better.  </li>
            <li>It kind of made me think a little when I read some of the profits from the sell of this product are earmarked towards prisoner re-integration.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very drying</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really smell that lavender much but</li>
            <li>and it does not seem to absorb very well at all.</li>
            <li>But just from the water content alone, you&#x27;ll surmise-correctly-that it&#x27;s not going to hydrate very well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to have a lotion that is not filled with chemicals.</li>
            <li>This is my new lotion, without a doubt.</li>
            <li>GMO free and actually formulated for human health-</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion is soooo soft!  </li>
            <li>will stick to clothes is donned within 5 minutes of application, allow to dry first!</li>
            <li>It is a thin lotion, so it goes a long way and does a great job.</li>
            <li>It smells nothing like what I&#x27;ve bought of this scent directly from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and instead has a chemical smell to it.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell but I feel that with diligent daily use I may even be able to avoid this dry cracked skin in the future.</li>
            <li>far as lotions go, I&#x27;m pretty let down.</li>
            <li>I use a small amount with a special serum on face at night and no rash or irritation.  </li>
            <li>I used it a few times fresh out of the shower and after shaving my legs - a couple hours later I still felt greasy and also gritty from bits of dust or lint having attached to the lotion and onto my skin - yuck - it never seems to absorb for me.</li>

            <li> I personally found the lotion to be high on the lavender scent and was not able to detect the orange scent at all.</li>
            <li> The only other item</li>
            <li> have to rub in and let dry</li>
            <li> Do you have dry skin even after you put lotion on.</li>
            <li> (note some dry skin is an allergy).</li>
            <li> I was hopeful that it would provide some relief to my dry winter hands.</li>
            <li> but it does nothing for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Next time before you send out it please tight the lid and check your product.</li>
            <li> .it is thinner than I expected</li>
            <li> the bottle came only wrapped in plastic wrap and had been jostled around enough in the box that a few pumps of lotion were dispersed - a lot stayed in the plastic wrap, but some also got out into the box and all over my other items, was very messy, and wasteful of the product as well.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using- a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> For much of winter, and almost the entire month of March, I have had painful dry cracked skin on both of my thumbs.</li>
            <li> My hands felt very dry after a few minutes of application.  </li>
            <li> for both:&lt;br /&gt;The star rating was high, but there were enough dissenters to prepare me for the possibility of disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and a half and will continue.</li>
            <li> the bottle had been opened slightly this</li>
            <li> Less patchouli (though you&#x27;ll still get plenty of patchouli with this one).</li>
            <li> I put some on my hands and tried to let my cat smell them, even she wouldn&#x27;t come within a few inches.  </li>
            <li> Does not leave a thick film like some heavy lotions.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awfully watery, so maybe as a breezy touch-up in hotter, more humid climates it has its place.</li>
            <li> This is not a very good lotion.  </li>
            <li> the lotion is overflow out from the bottle, the bottle lid was loose and the bottle was dirty.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not good for cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> Thin liquid, unpleasant smell, and not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is thin and watery-</li>
            <li> disappointed, as we use other bronners products without complaints.</li>
            <li> Product is counted just came out, but the process is complicated, use this time</li>
            <li> And yes, as a lotion, I found this highly disappointing.</li>
            <li> I washed the bottle 3 times:(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The smell of the lotion is also terrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Use it as a palmate and lotion.</li>
            <li> This is not a very good lotion.  It&#x27;s very drying and it&#x27;s not good for cracked skin.  My hands felt very dry after a few minutes of application.  The smell of the lotion is also terrible.  You can definitely smell the alcohol.  I put some on my hands and tried to let my cat smell them, even she wouldn&#x27;t come within a few inches.  The only other item she&#x27;s had that reaction to is nail polish, and that&#x27;s saying something.  I would recommend that you purchase the item in-stores and get a sniff for yourself.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s growing on me... at first the scent seemed very strong but when i smell it on another person it smells good so i assume it is not overbearing. it&#x27;s nice to have a lotion that is not filled with chemicals. I don&#x27;t really smell that lavender much but the orange it&#x27;s self has a very fresh scent. after washing my face at night i apply this lotion and it is not greasy which i LOVE.</li>
            <li> Best lotion out there. No harmful chemicals and smells great.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lotions work wonder on my skin, it&#x27;s one of my favorite brands.</li>
            <li> When I received the product I find the lotion is overflow out from the bottle, the bottle lid was loose and the bottle was dirty. I washed the bottle 3 times:( Next time before you send out it please tight the lid and check your product.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years; great product and safe for human use</li>
            <li> It smells nothing like what I&#x27;ve bought of this scent directly from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and instead has a chemical smell to it. I question the authenticity of the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Grandmother and now she swears by it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> the scent is overpowering.  it&#x27;s quite sticky too.  HOWEVER it is an excellent moisturizer for hands, body, feet, not really great for face.  have to rub in and let dry otherwise it&#x27;s too tacky for most tastes.  also the scent is overpowering.  will stick to clothes is donned within 5 minutes of application, allow to dry first!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I use it ever morning after my shower and my skin is great. I didn&#x27;t think I would like the orange and lavender together but its a nice scent. I doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy either. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and a half and will continue. I also ordered the citrus bar soap to go along with it and it great too. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I personally found the lotion to be high on the lavender scent and was not able to detect the orange scent at all. I also found it to have a greasy feel to it and it does not seem to absorb very well at all. I used it a few times fresh out of the shower and after shaving my legs - a couple hours later I still felt greasy and also gritty from bits of dust or lint having attached to the lotion and onto my skin - yuck - it never seems to absorb for me. I ended up giving the bottle to a friend who likes the lavender scent and doesn&#x27;t have a problem with the feel of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be warned on the packaging - don&#x27;t order this with anything you don&#x27;t want lotion on - the bottle came only wrapped in plastic wrap and had been jostled around enough in the box that a few pumps of lotion were dispersed - a lot stayed in the plastic wrap, but some also got out into the box and all over my other items, was very messy, and wasteful of the product as well. I did report this to them so hopefully they will fix that problem eventually.</li>
            <li> quality lotion herbal hydration of the skin with lavender scent to relax you&lt;br /&gt;please try the peppermint and lavender coconut</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.  Does not leave a thick film like some heavy lotions.  Just helps moisturize.  I use a small amount with a special serum on face at night and no rash or irritation.  I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> .it is thinner than I expected but it is nice and light for warmer weather.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised! Arrived as described. Non-greasy, organic formula was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to getting moisture back to the skin, instead of creamy lotion. Do you have dry skin even after you put lotion on. Try this and you will see the difference, moist skin at last. (note some dry skin is an allergy).</li>
            <li> wife did not like this lotion.  said it made her skin burn when applied.  disappointed, as we use other bronners products without complaints.</li>
            <li> I love just about everything Dr. Bronner&#x27;s makes.  Their soap dries me out a bit, but this lotion was a refreshing change from the Peppermint Lotion.</li>
            <li> I have had an amazing experience with this product. For much of winter, and almost the entire month of March, I have had painful dry cracked skin on both of my thumbs. NOTHING has worked to improve it. I purchased this lotion about 4 days ago- not for use specifically on my thumbs but as a replacement to my more chemical-laden body lotion. I also began to use it on my hands though, and I cannot even believe the improvement!!! I feel like I have watched them heal before my eyes. This is my new lotion, without a doubt. Only time will tell but I feel that with diligent daily use I may even be able to avoid this dry cracked skin in the future. Plus, the skin-nourishing natural and organic ingredients make me feel like I&#x27;m doing something great for my body!! Yes, it is thin and watery- but I don&#x27;t mind it all as I feel it helps me control the amount I&#x27;m using- a little goes a long way. I feel like the bottle will last quite a while- which is great since it isn&#x27;t cheap ;)</li>
            <li> LOVE Bronners lotions and products!!  Bronners&#x27; is a good company both fundamentally and politically speaking.  Buy their stuff!!  GMO free and actually formulated for human health- what a concept these days!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a sticky and strange feeling lotion. Leaves almost soapy residue on your hands.</li>
            <li> Product is counted just came out, but the process is complicated, use this time&lt;br /&gt;Open the bottle had been opened slightly this</li>
            <li> I have tried many of lotions, however this lotion, so far, has its&#x27; own unique feel and scent. OAN:  It kind of made me think a little when I read some of the profits from the sell of this product are earmarked towards prisoner re-integration.</li>
            <li> Thin liquid, unpleasant smell, and not very moisturizing. Not what I was expecting from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s. Oh well, can&#x27;t hit a homerun with everything!</li>
            <li> This lotion is the last lotion you will ever have to buy. It hydrates perfectly, its light &amp; leaves skin feeling fully moisturized. I love the smel as well. Check out my review of this product I love so much @ www.greenmomreviews.com</li>
            <li> The scent of this is spectacular. It is a thin lotion, so it goes a long way and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I use my app \\&quot;Good Guide\\&quot; a lot and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products always receive a very high rating because of their social equity and health awareness.  This lotion is soooo soft!  I love how it smooths across the skin.  The wonderful orange and lavender scents aren&#x27;t too strong, but just a hint of the flavors.  I liked this product so much I ordered the same lotion in the patchouli and lime - it just arrived and now I don&#x27;t know which I like better.  Heck, try them both!  Hooray for Dr. Bronner!</li>
            <li> I purchased two of this brand, and this one had a more pleasant smell (to me). Less patchouli (though you&#x27;ll still get plenty of patchouli with this one). The citric note brightens the patchouli in this version, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True for both:&lt;br /&gt;The star rating was high, but there were enough dissenters to prepare me for the possibility of disappointment. And yes, as a lotion, I found this highly disappointing. This fragrance is a more pleasant one than the other, more woodsy one (green bottle) but it&#x27;s still a bit strong and...hippie-ish? for my taste. Happily, it does fade in 20 minutes or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as lotions go, I&#x27;m pretty let down. It&#x27;s awfully watery, so maybe as a breezy touch-up in hotter, more humid climates it has its place. But just from the water content alone, you&#x27;ll surmise-correctly-that it&#x27;s not going to hydrate very well.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this lotion given the Dr Bronners name. I was hopeful that it would provide some relief to my dry winter hands. Oh my! It goes on great but it does nothing for dry skin. The scent was wonderful though.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the fragrance.  I bought the OrangeLavender and the lotion doesn&#x27;t smell like either.  Fortunately, the smell does not affect the quality of the lotion.</li>
