    <ol>
            <li>This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>- I thought Sugar was the best</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best lip moisturizer product I have found.  </li>
            <li>and I was delighted!</li>
            <li>It does a great job of moisturizing my lips and leaving them shiny.  </li>
            <li>The smell is like pine sol -great for the floor but not something you&#x27;d want on your lips.</li>
            <li>Burts Bees has a lot of great products but this misses the mark.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that i found this product.  </li>
            <li>I  came up with a great tidbit:&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>it glides on very nicely, but the formula doesn&#x27;t sink into my lips like an EOS lip balm would.</li>
            <li>Rhubarb Shimmer is nice also- minty and awesome colored)  :)</li>
            <li>If u r looking for a good lip balm u should try Dr. Hauschka lip care</li>
            <li>I will stick to Burt&#x27;s Bees Rejuvenating Lip Balm with Acai Berry (wears,smells and tastes good...</li>
            <li>/&gt;2) does not smell good at all..</li>
            <li>One of the better ones!</li>
            <li>I love this chap stick!</li>
            <li>Tastes great and is as smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li>so I always have one handy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used tons of lip balms and this is the best by far!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my favorite BB lip balm ever.</li>
            <li>This one is OK though.</li>
            <li>I really love the feel on my lips.  </li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and have used many of them throughout the years.</li>
            <li>the more I used it.</li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;d be awesome, but it was definitely not.</li>
            <li>I guess Burt&#x27;s Bees should have tested this product more thoroughly before putting it out on the market.</li>
            <li>I started using Burt&#x27;s Bees passionfruit lip balm with SPF because I was out in the sun more, and my lips immediately got better.</li>
            <li>one disappoints me the most.</li>
            <li>but i def think this one is better.</li>
            <li>It has a sheen - making it more of an oil than a balm and is colorless and unscented.</li>
            <li>and I hope this information is helpful to you.  :)</li>
            <li>The taste could be better, but isn&#x27;t a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>Like many reviewers this lip balm caused my lips to crack and peel.</li>
            <li>I stopped using the product after 10 days and my lips were mostly recovered 24 hours</li>
            <li>) makes my lips MORE chapped&lt;br</li>
            <li>, she said that this sold the most out of all the burt&#x27;s bees lip balms.</li>
            <li>I have used Burt Bees products for many years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad by any means, but it doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as some of the others.  </li>
            <li>I love this lip balm for the primary reason that I get all the shine of a lip gloss, but none of the stickiness.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve loved absolutely everything I&#x27;ve tried... until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very mild - great for people with sensitive</li>
            <li>Not as good for men because of this particular feature, perhaps,</li>
            <li>At first, it feels very conditioning and great.</li>
            <li>formula contains TWO ingredients recommended by Dr Oz as the ONLY REALLY EFFECTIVE moisturizers for lips: Shea butter AND coconut oil! :)</li>
            <li>It glides on so smoothly and leaves a shine</li>
            <li>so lip balm is an important thing to have.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the original Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm.</li>
            <li>I normally use Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey lip balm, which is pretty good.</li>
            <li>It does not contain sunscreen, so it&#x27;s good for using in the evening or when inside the house and not needing to add additional chemicals or those white barrier sunscreens to one&#x27;s lips!</li>
            <li>and I end up slathering more of this on thinking i just need to give it a chance to really start working.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell but it works very well.</li>
            <li>It dries my lips out rather quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(Honey flavor is gross too, but in a different way)  (the best flavors in my opinion are: Grapefruit, Mango Butter, Mint, Acai Berry, Passionfruit, and Pomegranate!</li>
            <li>As my lips got more chapped I kept applying more Ultra Conditioning lip balm which caused the most painful chapped lips I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I did because after 24 hours of using it, my lips were noticeably softer and after two days they were finally back to normal.</li>
            <li>I like this one because it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of petroleum products in it, and it does a good job of keeping my lips from drying out and cracking and just generally getting really grode.</li>
            <li>but it looks like cheap stuff doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>It comes on smoothly, but it really isn&#x27;t that moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I mention the acai formula here in case someone reading this has a body chemistry similar to my own.</li>
            <li>This is my personal favorite.</li>
            <li>My lips feel smooth, soft, and kissable.</li>
            <li>This is the only lip balm that I have been able to use and it soothes and softens my chapped lips.</li>
            <li>Unlike a lot of balms I have tried, this one actually lasts and seems to penetrate a bit deeper than most.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer actually moisturized and protected my lips better and longer.</li>
            <li>I use it many times a day and have three tubes in different locations</li>
            <li>I am a loyal user of this particular lip balm as it is very moist, not waxy like some.  </li>
            <li>I do like it because it really does moisturize my lips and make them look shiny, but I&#x27;ve noticed it can get pretty greasy on and around my lips,</li>
            <li>This is smooth to put on, and it sinks in pretty quickly so you don&#x27;t have a bunch of muck on your lips forever.</li>
            <li>Its Super moisturizing and the ingredients are Natural  </li>
            <li>Apparently it works great for some people, but for me (like many others), it made my chapped lips far worse...</li>
            <li>I thought it was very conditioning</li>
            <li>The tinted lineup (with honeysuckle) works very well though.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, which might be a plus for some.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it has a very over-whelming scent&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product, but really the lesser known natural products tend to work better.</li>
            <li>It costs a bit more (3.99) than the other Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms I have</li>
            <li>Not any softer than when I use their original beeswax lip balm, but it wasn&#x27;t entirely ineffective.</li>
            <li>So far I like the aveeno one with spf in it and the new all natural neutrogena one that comes in a light gray box.</li>
            <li>This product feels slick and smooth at first, but quickly causes severe drying, peeling, blistering and cracking of lips....</li>
            <li>After having used many many tubes of that, I decided to diversify and try a few other Burt&#x27;s Bees varieties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not subtle, either.</li>
            <li>in oleic acids - ontains a high content of Vitamins A, D, and E.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>And then, all of a sudden, your lips are super super dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Avocado Oil:&lt;br /&gt;Easily absorbed into deep tissue.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is fine.</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about this lipbalm; I find that you have to reapply it very often, as it does not keep the moisture very long.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine if your lips aren&#x27;t chapped at all but do not use it (or any other Burt&#x27;s Bees product) on chapped lips!</li>
            <li>and it leaves my lips feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees products are very natural and can be recommended to almost anyone regardless of skin sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>It felt extremely greasy-- not at all the smooth, soft texture I&#x27;ve come to expect of Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li>Overall it was pretty disapointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>at first I didn&#x27;t know that the balm was aggravating the condition, but it got to the point where the skin around my lips was red and peeling.</li>
            <li>It feels like put butter on your lips at first, but becomes drying after a short time.</li>
            <li>Normally the original Burts Bees with honey or Jack Black&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I keep this in my pocket daily and couldn&#x27;t ask for a better chapstick, it is the only one that truly works for me besides Aquaphor as all the other chapsticks on the market only dry my lips out more.</li>
            <li>I picked this one up thinking the formula would be better for me, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for me!!! :(</li>
            <li>After about 20 minutes, my lips felt more dry than before I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just try a different flavor next time.</li>
            <li>far the biggest deal breaker for me, though, is the smell.</li>
            <li>Europaea (olive) fruit oil:&lt;br /&gt;Consists primarily of the glycerides of the fatty acids linoleic, oleic and palmitic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wear this both during the day over my lipstick for shine and also overnight to keep my lips soft.</li>
            <li>This product is chock full of natural ingredients  - and has actually repaired my dry lips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The original lip balm didn&#x27;t work all too well for me, if anything, it dried out my lips.</li>
            <li>waste of money... stick to the original</li>
            <li>It is not worth the extra money and it also seems to crumble, it does not goon smooth.</li>
            <li>Literally overnight her lips and skin went back to normal.</li>
            <li>This product is no better than mango, or original burt&#x27;s bees lip balm.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, especially with winter approaching.</li>
            <li>The more she used this lip balm, the worse it got.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for the first time about a month ago and have been using it everyday.</li>
            <li>I do not have a problem with any other brand including those with beeswax - just this particular formula of Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>After taking Accutane for acne purposes my skin and lips have always been dry since my natural moisturizers never returned.</li>
            <li>Treats dry, damaged or mature skin and hair.</li>

            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees products are very natural and can be recommended to almost anyone regardless of skin sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> It felt extremely greasy-- not at all the smooth, soft texture I&#x27;ve come to expect of Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> Overall it was pretty disapointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> at first I didn&#x27;t know that the balm was aggravating the condition, but it got to the point where the skin around my lips was red and peeling.</li>
            <li> It feels like put butter on your lips at first, but becomes drying after a short time.</li>
            <li> Normally the original Burts Bees with honey or Jack Black&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I keep this in my pocket daily and couldn&#x27;t ask for a better chapstick, it is the only one that truly works for me besides Aquaphor as all the other chapsticks on the market only dry my lips out more.</li>
            <li> I picked this one up thinking the formula would be better for me, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for me!!! :(</li>
            <li> After about 20 minutes, my lips felt more dry than before I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just try a different flavor next time.</li>
            <li> far the biggest deal breaker for me, though, is the smell.</li>
            <li> Europaea (olive) fruit oil:&lt;br /&gt;Consists primarily of the glycerides of the fatty acids linoleic, oleic and palmitic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wear this both during the day over my lipstick for shine and also overnight to keep my lips soft.</li>
            <li> This product is chock full of natural ingredients  - and has actually repaired my dry lips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The original lip balm didn&#x27;t work all too well for me, if anything, it dried out my lips.</li>
            <li> waste of money... stick to the original</li>
            <li> It is not worth the extra money and it also seems to crumble, it does not goon smooth.</li>
            <li> Literally overnight her lips and skin went back to normal.</li>
            <li> This product is no better than mango, or original burt&#x27;s bees lip balm.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, especially with winter approaching.</li>
            <li> The more she used this lip balm, the worse it got.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the first time about a month ago and have been using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I do not have a problem with any other brand including those with beeswax - just this particular formula of Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> After taking Accutane for acne purposes my skin and lips have always been dry since my natural moisturizers never returned.</li>
            <li> Treats dry, damaged or mature skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long been an enormous fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> For some reason my lips have been unbelievably dry and have been peeling for the last six months</li>
            <li> This balm relieved my seriously dry and winter chapped lips.</li>
            <li> It makes sense that it would feel thinner, since it has less wax and more oil than their other lip balms, but I felt uncomfortable and</li>
            <li> this product, but definitely try out the other lip balms in the line!</li>
            <li> My lips are always dry, of course they need ultra conditioning!</li>
            <li> There are so many ingredients that it&#x27;s impossible to know what is causing the problem</li>
            <li> or so my lips feel very dry</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this particular product!</li>
            <li> This stuff dried my lips out; I constantly had to reapply.</li>
            <li> I am now three days in and i am miserable, going over lunch to buy my good old plain burt&#x27;s to undue the damage.</li>
            <li> Perhaps these results are due to my chemistry.</li>
            <li> The Burt&#x27;s Bees rejuvenation lip balm with acai berry works extremely well for me.</li>
            <li> its creamy and extremely moisturizing...</li>
            <li> I am allergic to almost every brand of chapstick and my lips peel and swell when I use other products.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the gross licorice mixed with old lemons smell- nasty!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my lips seemed drier than usual and thought this would be that little extra something they needed.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Just not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> Far worse than had you not applied anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe it is the natural smell/taste of the Kokum butter that was a little unappealing to</li>
            <li> The texture was bad too, it actually kind of made my lips feel worse-</li>
            <li> It is not like your average chap stick (thick and dry)</li>
            <li> It also smells a little wierd...</li>
            <li> This lip balm made my lips dry out so badly, that it actually caused my lips to crack around the outside and on the corners of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This actually made my chapped lips worse</li>
            <li> feel it left behind.</li>
            <li> Also contains lecithin and unsaturated fatty acids - making it  nourishing and conditioning for skin and hair.</li>
            <li> so, not wanting the two tubes she had to go to waste, I started using it.</li>
            <li> I came onto Amazon to purchase a large supply of this lip balm and i was blown away to find that this had some bad reviews on it.....</li>
            <li> I cannot comment on how long lasting this lip balm is since I tried it only twice and rubbed it off with tissue both times, but I can say it smells so awful.</li>
            <li> I hate that I spent so much only to throw it away</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I truly don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have seriously tried every chap stick out there including Sugar from Sephora $22.00.  </li>
            <li> My daughter had a serious reaction to this lip balm.</li>
            <li> After two days my lips had become incredibly dry and were peeling like crazy.</li>
            <li> but there is something in this formula that can cause serious problems with your lips.</li>
            <li> Not good for me didn&#x27;t like the smell or the greasy</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a weird slick feeling that seems to wick moisture AWAY from your lips rather than moisturizing them.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m totally addicted to Burt&#x27;s Bees lipbalm.</li>
            <li> This lip balm with kokum butter is worse than using nothing at all.</li>
            <li> Makes condition much worse.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> If you can find a sample, I would recommend that then paying $7 for a useless lip balm.</li>
            <li> It was absolutely awful before I finally realized it was the Burt&#x27;s Bees that was making it worse!</li>
            <li> My lips are unfortunately chapped 24/7</li>
            <li> I used this canvassing out in the cold, and I ended up reapplying in between every house, because my lips felt chapped and unprotected.</li>
            <li> I ended up needing to get medicated chapstick because of how bad it got.</li>
            <li> But at the time neither she nor her doctor suspected the lip balm and he prescribed medication for her severely, cracking, painful condition.</li>
            <li> It smells like mosquito repellant, which I absolutely hate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed..</li>
            <li> It was very painful!</li>
            <li> This stuff was terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am a loyal user of this particular lip balm as it is very moist, not waxy like some.  It does a great job of moisturizing my lips and leaving them shiny.  Not as good for men because of this particular feature, perhaps, but I do think the ladies will like it.  It does not contain sunscreen, so it&#x27;s good for using in the evening or when inside the house and not needing to add additional chemicals or those white barrier sunscreens to one&#x27;s lips!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It glides on so smoothly and leaves a shine so it looks like I am wearing gloss. I thought it was very conditioning and it leaves my lips feeling very soft. It costs a bit more (3.99) than the other Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms I have but I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Does not hydrate the lips as it promises. If u r looking for a good lip balm u should try Dr. Hauschka lip care but it&#x27;s expensive about $15 so i tried this product but it looks like cheap stuff doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> Maybe Burt&#x27;s Bees lineup just isn&#x27;t for my chemistry. The original lip balm didn&#x27;t work all too well for me, if anything, it dried out my lips. I picked this one up thinking the formula would be better for me, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for me!!! :( it glides on very nicely, but the formula doesn&#x27;t sink into my lips like an EOS lip balm would. If you can find a sample, I would recommend that then paying $7 for a useless lip balm. The tinted lineup (with honeysuckle) works very well though.</li>
            <li> This lip balm made my lips dry out so badly, that it actually caused my lips to crack around the outside and on the corners of my mouth. It was very painful! I normally use Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey lip balm, which is pretty good. This stuff was terrible. I would NOT recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about this lipbalm; I find that you have to reapply it very often, as it does not keep the moisture very long. Other than that, it is fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the first time about a month ago and have been using it everyday. I do like it because it really does moisturize my lips and make them look shiny, but I&#x27;ve noticed it can get pretty greasy on and around my lips, which is why I took away 2 stars.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve tried.  Tastes great and is as smooth as silk.  I&#x27;ve used tons of lip balms and this is the best by far!</li>
            <li> This is my personal favorite. One of the better ones!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my favorite BB lip balm ever. I think my fave is the honey one. This one is OK though. It&#x27;s not bad by any means, but it doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as some of the others.  I like this one because it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of petroleum products in it, and it does a good job of keeping my lips from drying out and cracking and just generally getting really grode. I live in the desert so lip balm is an important thing to have.  This is smooth to put on, and it sinks in pretty quickly so you don&#x27;t have a bunch of muck on your lips forever. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, which might be a plus for some. I like a bit of sweetness though and I miss it in this.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of this chap stick. It comes on smoothly, but it really isn&#x27;t that moisturizing. It also smells a little wierd... I will stick to Burt&#x27;s Bees Rejuvenating Lip Balm with Acai Berry (wears,smells and tastes good... it also lasts longer). Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but really the lesser known natural products tend to work better. This stuff dried my lips out; I constantly had to reapply. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I cannot comment on how long lasting this lip balm is since I tried it only twice and rubbed it off with tissue both times, but I can say it smells so awful. The smell is like pine sol -great for the floor but not something you&#x27;d want on your lips. I hate that I spent so much only to throw it away but it is just too off putting for me. I bought 4 others at the same time I bought this one since I lose a lip balm about once every 3 days it seems. So far I like the aveeno one with spf in it and the new all natural neutrogena one that comes in a light gray box. Burts Bees has a lot of great products but this misses the mark.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that this balm works well for some folks, but it doesn&#x27;t work at all for me. It dries my lips out rather quickly. Perhaps these results are due to my chemistry. The Burt&#x27;s Bees rejuvenation lip balm with acai berry works extremely well for me. I mention the acai formula here in case someone reading this has a body chemistry similar to my own.</li>
            <li> This product is so creamy, it just glides on.  I really love the feel on my lips.  Burt&#x27;s Bees products are very natural and can be recommended to almost anyone regardless of skin sensitivity.  I always want one in my purse and one at home.</li>
            <li> After taking Accutane for acne purposes my skin and lips have always been dry since my natural moisturizers never returned. I keep this in my pocket daily and couldn&#x27;t ask for a better chapstick, it is the only one that truly works for me besides Aquaphor as all the other chapsticks on the market only dry my lips out more.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and have used many of them throughout the years. I bought this because my lips seemed drier than usual and thought this would be that little extra something they needed. The product is oily but within 15 minutes or so my lips feel very dry and I end up slathering more of this on thinking i just need to give it a chance to really start working.  I am now three days in and i am miserable, going over lunch to buy my good old plain burt&#x27;s to undue the damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long been an enormous fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products. In fact, I&#x27;ve loved absolutely everything I&#x27;ve tried... until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I will say that, by the time it wore off, my lips did feel softer. Not any softer than when I use their original beeswax lip balm, but it wasn&#x27;t entirely ineffective. However, I tossed mine after a couple uses. It felt extremely greasy-- not at all the smooth, soft texture I&#x27;ve come to expect of Burt&#x27;s Bees products. It makes sense that it would feel thinner, since it has less wax and more oil than their other lip balms, but I felt uncomfortable and messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By far the biggest deal breaker for me, though, is the smell. It smells like mosquito repellant, which I absolutely hate. And it&#x27;s not subtle, either. Once I applied it, I felt like I was breathing in a cloud of Off! Deep Woods for the next hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip this product, but definitely try out the other lip balms in the line!</li>
            <li> For some reason my lips have been unbelievably dry and have been peeling for the last six months (yes, I drink A LOT of water). Normally the original Burts Bees with honey or Jack Black&#x27;s lip balms take care of the problem, but they didn&#x27;t work this time. So, I saw this and was drawn to the \\&quot;Ultra Moistuizing\\&quot; part on the packaging and gave it a shot. I&#x27;m so happy that I did because after 24 hours of using it, my lips were noticeably softer and after two days they were finally back to normal. I highly recommend this, especially with winter approaching.</li>
            <li> This actually made my chapped lips worse the more I used it. It was absolutely awful before I finally realized it was the Burt&#x27;s Bees that was making it worse! I ended up needing to get medicated chapstick because of how bad it got. It&#x27;s fine if your lips aren&#x27;t chapped at all but do not use it (or any other Burt&#x27;s Bees product) on chapped lips!</li>
            <li> When I saw this at the store I just had to buy it, I&#x27;m totally addicted to Burt&#x27;s Bees lipbalm. I thought it&#x27;d be awesome, but it was definitely not. The first thing I noticed was the gross licorice mixed with old lemons smell- nasty! The texture was bad too, it actually kind of made my lips feel worse- it&#x27;s a weird slick feeling that seems to wick moisture AWAY from your lips rather than moisturizing them. Made my lips feel flaky like I&#x27;d been licking them all day. Overall it was pretty disapointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Honey flavor is gross too, but in a different way)  (the best flavors in my opinion are: Grapefruit, Mango Butter, Mint, Acai Berry, Passionfruit, and Pomegranate! Rhubarb Shimmer is nice also- minty and awesome colored)  :)</li>
            <li> I guess Burt&#x27;s Bees should have tested this product more thoroughly before putting it out on the market. Apparently it works great for some people, but for me (like many others), it made my chapped lips far worse... at first I didn&#x27;t know that the balm was aggravating the condition, but it got to the point where the skin around my lips was red and peeling. I started using Burt&#x27;s Bees passionfruit lip balm with SPF because I was out in the sun more, and my lips immediately got better. Needless to say, I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this particular product! Just not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> Not good for me didn&#x27;t like the smell or the greasy feel it left behind. I realize this is ultra conditioning but it&#x27;s like putting crisco on your lips-nasty stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the original Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm. After having used many many tubes of that, I decided to diversify and try a few other Burt&#x27;s Bees varieties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one disappoints me the most. At first, it feels very conditioning and great. That lasts about 2 minutes. And then, all of a sudden, your lips are super super dry. Far worse than had you not applied anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I apply this, I&#x27;m in pain until I can find a tube of something else to apply to my lips. This lip balm with kokum butter is worse than using nothing at all. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I came onto Amazon to purchase a large supply of this lip balm and i was blown away to find that this had some bad reviews on it..... I love this chap stick! I&#x27;m so happy that i found this product.  My lips are unfortunately chapped 24/7 and I have seriously tried every chap stick out there including Sugar from Sephora $22.00.  I bought this at Target at the checkout line...----  Its Super moisturizing and the ingredients are Natural  - I thought Sugar was the best but i def think this one is better. It is not like your average chap stick (thick and dry) its creamy and extremely moisturizing...I LOVE IT!!!! highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is no better than mango, or original burt&#x27;s bees lip balm. My son has severe chapped lips and this along with everything else I have tried, it did not solve the problem. It is not worth the extra money and it also seems to crumble, it does not goon smooth. The mango burt&#x27;s bees lip balm works just as well.</li>
            <li> This lives up to it&#x27;s claim of being ultra conditioning! It has a sheen - making it more of an oil than a balm and is colorless and unscented. This product is chock full of natural ingredients  - and has actually repaired my dry lips.&lt;br /&gt;(I truly don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPLICATION:&lt;br /&gt;I choose to apply it before bed so it will nourish my lips while I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In doing my research I  came up with a great tidbit:&lt;br /&gt;This formula contains TWO ingredients recommended by Dr Oz as the ONLY REALLY EFFECTIVE moisturizers for lips: Shea butter AND coconut oil! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRIMARY INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;Cocount oil:&lt;br /&gt;Great for moisturizing - helps serve as a protective layer to retain moisture in skin. Very mild - great for people with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olea Europaea (olive) fruit oil:&lt;br /&gt;Consists primarily of the glycerides of the fatty acids linoleic, oleic and palmitic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHEA BUTTER:&lt;br /&gt;From the nut of the African shea tree (Vitellaria paradoxa). Used in cosmetics as a moisturizer, salve or lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunflower seed oil:&lt;br /&gt;Rich in oleic acids - ontains a high content of Vitamins A, D, and E. Also contains lecithin and unsaturated fatty acids - making it  nourishing and conditioning for skin and hair. Treats dry, damaged or mature skin and hair. Provides moisture and a protective layer to skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avocado Oil:&lt;br /&gt;Easily absorbed into deep tissue. Helps relieve dryness and itching of psoriasis and eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and I hope this information is helpful to you.  :)&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy and God bless!</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm for the primary reason that I get all the shine of a lip gloss, but none of the stickiness. My lips feel smooth, soft, and kissable. The taste could be better, but isn&#x27;t a deal breaker. I believe it is the natural smell/taste of the Kokum butter that was a little unappealing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear this both during the day over my lipstick for shine and also overnight to keep my lips soft. I found that this lip balm healed my lips faster than chap stick, carmex, etc when I ended up with a bout of dry/chapped lips. Thumbs up Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li> Like many reviewers this lip balm caused my lips to crack and peel. As my lips got more chapped I kept applying more Ultra Conditioning lip balm which caused the most painful chapped lips I&#x27;ve ever experienced. I stopped using the product after 10 days and my lips were mostly recovered 24 hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 98 year-old grandmother had a similar reaction. But at the time neither she nor her doctor suspected the lip balm and he prescribed medication for her severely, cracking, painful condition.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) makes my lips MORE chapped&lt;br /&gt;2) does not smell good at all.. it has a very over-whelming scent&lt;br /&gt;3) waste of money... stick to the original</li>
            <li> This product feels slick and smooth at first, but quickly causes severe drying, peeling, blistering and cracking of lips.... I do not reccommend this product. Makes condition much worse.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to almost every brand of chapstick and my lips peel and swell when I use other products. This is the only lip balm that I have been able to use and it soothes and softens my chapped lips. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This balm relieved my seriously dry and winter chapped lips. Unlike a lot of balms I have tried, this one actually lasts and seems to penetrate a bit deeper than most. I don&#x27;t love the smell but it works very well. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I used this canvassing out in the cold, and I ended up reapplying in between every house, because my lips felt chapped and unprotected. Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer actually moisturized and protected my lips better and longer. Go figure.</li>
            <li> It feels like put butter on your lips at first, but becomes drying after a short time. The only way you keep your lips ultra conditioning is to use this product in every 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the recommendation of a store clerk- well not actually a recommendation, she said that this sold the most out of all the burt&#x27;s bees lip balms. I looked at the name and I was delighted! My lips are always dry, of course they need ultra conditioning! So I bought it and the second that I smeared this greasy abomination on my lips, they started to burn. After about 20 minutes, my lips felt more dry than before I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just try a different flavor next time.</li>
            <li> My daughter had a serious reaction to this lip balm. The skin surrounding her lips became red, swollen, and itchy. The more she used this lip balm, the worse it got. Finally I put two and two together and I told her to stop using it. Literally overnight her lips and skin went back to normal. It appears as though she is allergic to beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a beeswax allergy so, not wanting the two tubes she had to go to waste, I started using it. After two days my lips had become incredibly dry and were peeling like crazy. I couldn&#x27;t believe that this all-natural product would cause a problem but as soon as I stopped using it, my lips started healing. I do not have a problem with any other brand including those with beeswax - just this particular formula of Burt&#x27;s Bees. There are so many ingredients that it&#x27;s impossible to know what is causing the problem but there is something in this formula that can cause serious problems with your lips. Into the garbage it goes!</li>
            <li> I have used Burt Bees products for many years.  This is the best lip moisturizer product I have found.  I use it many times a day and have three tubes in different locations so I always have one handy.</li>
