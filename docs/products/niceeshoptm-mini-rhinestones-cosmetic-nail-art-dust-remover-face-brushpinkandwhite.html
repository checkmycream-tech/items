            <li>I love the look.</li>
            <li>I think it is a better brush than many high-end brushes I have bought.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think i would really need but for the price i decided &amp;#34;WTH&amp;#34; well, to my surprise it was great and much better than just trying to wipe away the dust.</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>The bristles are beyond soft and great for applying bronzer.</li>
            <li>It is a great deal for the price and arrived super fast.</li>
            <li>Good little finishing powder brush at a great price.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a bigger duster,this duster is more geared to apply blush not so great for nails</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>and so far so good.</li>
            <li>This works just fine, I use it to clean off the dust after filing and drilling my nails.  </li>
            <li>Very soft, love it!  </li>
            <li>It has a good amount of soft hairs on it and is very pretty.</li>
            <li>its small n perfect</li>
            <li>I love how it feels, soft!.. :)</li>
            <li>it was a great price, took really long to get to me</li>
            <li>Super Stylish, priced right.  </li>
            <li>smaller than it looks, not the softest but works, didnt get the right color, but works great for what I need</li>
            <li>the price was right!</li>
            <li>glad I didn&#x27;t pay to much money.</li>
            <li>still a very pretty color, but if your want it to look just like the picture it does not.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast!  </li>
            <li>it super fun.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this little helper!</li>
            <li>Great little brush.  </li>
            <li>The one I received was not as bright of a pink as the one depicted in the photograph</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so mesmerizing in person.</li>
            <li>but it was totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Love how soft it is.</li>
            <li>I thought that was a really nice touch, since all I had to do was to expand the clear plastic box and and put my new brush inside for safe-keeping.  </li>
            <li>I liked it a lot just took so long to arrive</li>
            <li>, I thought that it was going to be a little bigger, but excellent for the price!</li>
            <li>deal, pretty brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some people dont like the short handle, but I find that it gives me more control.</li>
            <li>Super soft and just the right size.  </li>
            <li>The brush was wrapped in bubble wrap, and the original clear plastic box was collapsed and also enclosed in the bubble-lined envelop.  </li>
            <li>I order a pink one and they send me a red, but the product is great</li>
            <li>Really pretty but too soft to clean off dust fast</li>
            <li>Cute little piece to make my at-home manicures for myself a bit more professional feeling</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller than expected but very nice quality.</li>
            <li>I thought it would have been a little bigger, other wise its made from good material.</li>
            <li>and it is super soft.</li>
            <li>Nice little brush.</li>
            <li>Nice little brush</li>
            <li>This is a nice little brush for removing the dust from my acrylic nail manicures.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice little brush butt</li>
            <li>Nice little brush</li>
            <li>i am very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>REALLY OF</li>
            <li>but it makes up for it by being so soft and useful.</li>
            <li>But I needed a back up blush brush &amp;amp; it was really cheap</li>
            <li>I received it sooner than expected and have ordered it more than one time.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The product of good, however, it was a lot smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li>The product is good but the delivery time is extremely slow.  </li>
            <li>the perfect color of pink and very soft only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how long it took to get to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to use it on my next client</li>
            <li>Other than that its still cute.</li>
            <li>small and handy.</li>
            <li>This one is super short (the pink one) and easy to store.  </li>
            <li>fault particularly</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft, but it does it&#x27;s job!</li>
            <li>I love this little dust brush and cant believe that I never purchased one of these sooner.</li>
            <li>Love this little brush.</li>
            <li>Cute little brush</li>
            <li>I would rather it not be hot pink, but I don&#x27;t really care that much.</li>
            <li>A new staple in my make up bag.</li>
            <li>the brush is mucher smaller than i expected, but its cute</li>
            <li>Very soft.  </li>
            <li>Bristles are very soft and applies my powder evenly.  </li>
            <li>I like the color (but the pink is a little lighter than the picture shows, which is okay), and the brush is super soft.</li>
            <li>I was pleasently surprised that it not only  arrived about 1 week early, but it was also super soft.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a pretty pink, sparkly and soft brush, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Brushes are cheap to produce, so there is no difference between expensive brushes and cheap ones.  </li>
            <li>It is soft and durable .</li>
            <li>I will probably use it on my face instead of my nails, because it is so soft.</li>
            <li>Its so soft.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li>i would of returned it if i didn&#x27;t have to send it so far</li>
            <li>So far no shredding</li>
            <li>Supeer soft.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that I don&#x27;t think it applies very well</li>
            <li>So soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I will say that I initially was hesistant to buy the brush because it was from China &amp;amp; I thought the quality would really suffer.</li>
            <li>it feels too soft to use as a powder brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>NO VERY SMALL AND</li>
            <li>The only negative is i was expecting a pink tipped brush ,like the picture shows, but it is not pink at all its a very bright red.</li>
            <li>I can also use it with my bare minerals makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really soft &amp;amp; has the identical texture of a retractable brush that you might find at any big box store.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is on the small side, bu considering the price it is worth it</li>

            <li> I was just expecting it to be a little bigger...</li>

            <li> I like the brush but its to small</li>

            <li> Perfect size for my daughters make up bag.</li>
            <li> Very, very small. But very cute. I use for decoration. I don&#x27;t think it would hold up against makeup.</li>
            <li> I like this brush when I do my Acrylic/UV nails.</li>
            <li> I like the brush but its to small</li>

            <li> Nice little brush but would like it to be larger for what I use it for. Like the choice of colors.</li>
            <li> I like this brush/product because the brush is very soft, it does a really good job of getting the dust off, and it fits my hand perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this little dust brush and cant believe that I never purchased one of these sooner. Works great, love it</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  Not just for nails but for applying powder &amp; blush.  They don&#x27;t blotch cosmetic on your face, it&#x27;s gradual and goes on very nice &amp; even.  I wash them each use and give them a couple good shakes and they come out almost dry.  My favorite brushes!</li>
            <li> its a great brush, really soft with great texture. I use it to apply blush and it works great! The only negative is i was expecting a pink tipped brush ,like the picture shows, but it is not pink at all its a very bright red. other than that it looks the same as far as everything else goes. still a very pretty color, but if your want it to look just like the picture it does not.</li>
            <li> Handy to have with your acrylic nail kit</li>
            <li> this is very small, my daughter can play with it, everything looks as same as the photo., just that its small., and takes about 3 weeks to get.</li>
            <li> This is just like the picture shown. Small pink decent size, and I love the price as well as the product! I use this for nails but could also be used for blush.It has a good amount of soft hairs on it and is very pretty.</li>

            <li> l love the color. small and handy. It was a little bit smaller than I was expecting it to be but it ended up working out nicely. does the job!</li>
            <li> This is a nice little brush for removing the dust from my acrylic nail manicures. The one I received was not as bright of a pink as the one depicted in the photograph but it still works for what I needed it to do. It helps if you take it out of the package and fluff it a bit before using it, just spreads the bristles out some in order to reach all the dust. Cute little piece to make my at-home manicures for myself a bit more professional feeling lol.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to getting this and when I did get it it was packaged good and came with a coupon and it&#x27;s just as cute as the picture and it&#x27;s so soft</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little brush butt it was way smaller than what I expected. Not to bad for the price though.</li>
            <li> I use mine as a makeup powder brush and I love it. It&#x27;s also impossible to beat that deal for a large sized brush like this.</li>
            <li> I thought this as an April fool&#x27;s joke when i received this brush it&#x27; so darn tiny like its for baby fingers i would of returned it if i didn&#x27;t have to send it so far never ever again i wanted a regular average barber brush but for my nail salon that s why i got the color pink</li>
            <li> Brushes are cheap to produce, so there is no difference between expensive brushes and cheap ones.  This one is super short (the pink one) and easy to store.  Very soft.  I would rather it not be hot pink, but I don&#x27;t really care that much.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a bigger duster,this duster is more geared to apply blush not so great for nails gave it 3 stars for prompt deliver and appearance, just won&#x27;t do as a nail dust brush!</li>
            <li> I love how it feels, soft!.. :)</li>
            <li> the brush I got was very small in size and wasn&#x27;t even PINK!!! glad I didn&#x27;t pay to much money.</li>
            <li> Cute dust remover brush for nail art  or cosmetic face brush.It is small but it is big enough  for your hands</li>
            <li> very good brush, met expectations for the price,would perchase again.&lt;br /&gt;used it to remove dust from my nails.thank you for an excellent transaction.</li>
            <li> the brush is mucher smaller than i expected, but its cute</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than expected but very nice quality.</li>

            <li> Bought it an not really used it for what I bought it for. I dunno I just bought it</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot just took so long to arrive</li>
            <li> This works just fine, I use it to clean off the dust after filing and drilling my nails.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I thought but I still like it.</li>
            <li> SO VERY DISAPPOINTED THIS THING IS SO SMALL I THOUGHT It was regular SIZED NO VERY SMALL AND REALLY OF NO USE I WISH I CAN GET MY MONEY BACK</li>
            <li> Perfect size. Supeer soft. Easy to clean. It is a great deal for the price and arrived super fast. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tiny one so if you need a big one this is not for you but over all I love it</li>
            <li> It looks SO cute. The only thing is that I don&#x27;t think it applies very well but you get what you paid for</li>
            <li> We received this item within the time stated, howerver when it arrived the brush bristles were falling out of it. I did a set of nails and after brushing the nails off there was brush fibers all over the clients hand. Looks like I am returning this item....</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected and poor quality bristles.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for my at-home manicures/pedicures, and it does the job it was intended to do.  Shipping was very fast!  I received this at least 2 - 3 weeks earlier than anticipated, which was a plus.  I really liked the packaging.  The brush was wrapped in bubble wrap, and the original clear plastic box was collapsed and also enclosed in the bubble-lined envelop.  I thought that was a really nice touch, since all I had to do was to expand the clear plastic box and and put my new brush inside for safe-keeping.  Thumbs Up! I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It was smaller that I expected, but does the job.</li>
            <li> The picture is misleading. It&#x27;s waaaaay to small. But I can find another use for it so no worries.</li>
            <li> I like the brush, i brought it to do my nails with but now i want to use it ofr my beautiful skin. Id buy it again, the only bad thing was the lenght of time it took to get to me.</li>
            <li> Way too small! And the bristles fall out all the time.</li>
            <li> Soft and fluffy! Love it!</li>
            <li> Great little brush.  Bristles are very soft and applies my powder evenly.  A new staple in my make up bag.</li>
            <li> Super Stylish, priced right.  I bout it to use as a kabuki brush, but it is a little too long for that.  I use it to dust on my physicians formula brightening powder.  Works well for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Using this lil kabuki for a makeup vanity decoration. It&#x27;s adorable. So soft to the touch. It is small so if your looking for a barber sweeper this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than i expected</li>
            <li> Perfect for cleaning off my acrylic nails when I finish them.  Super soft and just the right size.  So cute with the rhinestones.</li>
            <li> I never did get this in the mail and I was charged for it... what could I do about that</li>
            <li> This has lasted through a few cleanings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good deal, pretty brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it. Will buy another to replace the one I have when it reaches the end of it&#x27;s life cycle.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be bigger, but it does a well job. I give it 3 stars for it being so small .</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with company. Product was lost, communication was not. God bless. Transportation is no  ones fault particularly, good ppl are always cool</li>
            <li> smaller than it looks, not the softest but works, didnt get the right color, but works great for what I need</li>
            <li> The product of good, however, it was a lot smaller than I expected.  It will work though to dust nails.</li>
            <li> I love this brush it is great for brushing nails off. The brush is smaller than I thought in the picture but it makes up for it by being so soft and useful.</li>
            <li> I love the look. I was just expecting it to be a little bigger... Ugh. Wish I would have known..</li>
            <li> I will say that I initially was hesistant to buy the brush because it was from China &amp;amp; I thought the quality would really suffer. But I needed a back up blush brush &amp;amp; it was really cheap so I thought it would work.  I was pleasently surprised that it not only  arrived about 1 week early, but it was also super soft. I twisted the bristles around and yanked a bit to be sure they wouldn&#x27;t flake off and so far so good. It&#x27;s also really soft &amp;amp; has the identical texture of a retractable brush that you might find at any big box store. Some people dont like the short handle, but I find that it gives me more control. Oh, and I will definitely be buying another one  to keep in my purse...</li>
            <li> I like the color (but the pink is a little lighter than the picture shows, which is okay), and the brush is super soft. Love, love, love this little helper!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect makeup brush! The bristles are beyond soft and great for applying bronzer. I think it is a better brush than many high-end brushes I have bought. I received it sooner than expected and have ordered it more than one time. If you are looking for a pretty pink, sparkly and soft brush, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very small!  I thought it would have been a little bigger, other wise its made from good material.</li>
            <li> Really pretty but too soft to clean off dust fast</li>
            <li> Works great for dusting your nails off after filing. Didn&#x27;t think i would really need but for the price i decided &amp;#34;WTH&amp;#34; well, to my surprise it was great and much better than just trying to wipe away the dust.</li>
            <li> Cute little brush, I thought that it was going to be a little bigger, but excellent for the price!</li>
            <li> it was a great price, took really long to get to me but it was totally worth it. I love the color it super fun.</li>
            <li> I got the pink brush, it was well packaged, everything looks in order, SO SOFT. I&#x27;ll put up a picture so you can have an idea of the approximate size.</li>
            <li> I order a pink one and they send me a red, but the product is great I love it...</li>
            <li> Not as pink as it shows</li>
            <li> Perfect... what I imagined. And cute!</li>
            <li> Its much smaller than it appears on the picture. Other than that its still cute.</li>
            <li> The product is good but the delivery time is extremely slow.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Nice little brush but would like it to be larger for what I use it for.  Like the choice of colors.</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s ok I use on my nails</li>
            <li> Love how soft it is. I use it to remove nail dust off my clients nails. I was expecting for it to be a bit bigger but it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> it feels too soft to use as a powder brush.&lt;br /&gt;I would only recommend someone who uses this on nails.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, will get the job done. Was a quite a bit smaller then I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for the money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be that little</li>
