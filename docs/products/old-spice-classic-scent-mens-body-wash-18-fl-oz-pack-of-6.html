            <li>It foams up great and is refreshing as the very essence of the 7 Seas!</li>
            <li>The clean manly scent and clean feeling are great.</li>
            <li>And even better -- they had a box of 6, which made the per-item price cheaper than in the store.  </li>

            <li>Also purchasing in quantity you get a better deal.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness it is available at Amazin!</li>
            <li>YOU GUYS ARE GREAT AND FAST</li>
            <li>I cannot find this item in stores any longer and this is my husbands favorite body wash.</li>
            <li>I got many compliments</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love this body wash.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, love the results...</li>
            <li>The scent is manly and keeps me smelling nice and feeling clean all day.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for old Spice that your father used you wouldn&#x27;t be here today!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>but it works great, and there is no waste or soggy slimy bars in the shower.</li>
            <li>This is the only one that doesn&#x27;t have a real strong, but pleasant smelling scent and yet still gets him clean.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of my OS Original man.</li>
            <li>Great lather and overall my favorite body wash.</li>
            <li>I was very happy when I saw this old spice classic sent online.</li>
            <li>What you see (smell, lol) with Old Spice is what you get; great lather, smooth non-greasy finish, and above all else that fantastic scent.</li>
            <li>My husband is clean and happy to have his Original Old Spice!</li>
            <li>it smells sooo good thanks for the quick shippment im ordering again for my son in laws</li>
            <li>Love the fact that I can purchase this at a reasonable price with home delivery!!</li>
            <li>Nice price, fast shipping</li>
            <li>the smell is great, but I had to deduct a star because it doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li>I can while its available.</li>
            <li>I later tried on amazon and was happy to find the product here.</li>
            <li>What a wonderful smell, brings me back to my childhood when my Dad was getting ready to go out or go to work.</li>
            <li>I have always loved the smell of Old Spice original.</li>
            <li>Thank Goodness for Amazon.com for getting to me the original.</li>
            <li>As usual, Amazon&#x27;s service was excellent.</li>
            <li>Stores will stock some, but not all, of the original scent products.  </li>
            <li>Clean, Fresh, Manly!  </li>
            <li>and he loves the clean feeling he gets</li>
            <li>Clean, manly-scent without being perfume-like.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using Old Spice products for many years.  </li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re a man above the age of 12 and looking for a very good body wash that&#x27;s also a classic and a legend</li>
            <li>I know P&amp;G changed the classic Old Spice scent, but this still smells great.  </li>
            <li>Very comforting and makes me feel safe.</li>
            <li>I was a bit apprehensive because the old spray deodorant did not smell similar at all, but the body wash has that great, spicy, powdery, mildly sweet scent we all know and love.  </li>
            <li>Anyway thank you Old Spice &amp; thank you Amazon for not only delivering this great product, but also improving our love life.</li>
            <li>He really likes the original scent which you can&#x27;t find anywhere!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find it anywhere luckily Amazon has got it in stock.</li>
            <li>It is a translucent blue color which looks very attractive, and it lathers well with a short bristled brush I use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Old Spice classic scent body wash has a pleasant spicy scent.</li>
            <li>I love the Manly classic scent of this product &amp; so does my gf.</li>
            <li>buy and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;metro&amp;#34; like most of the new scents out there these days.</li>
            <li>And of course Amazon had it -- should have looked here first!  </li>
            <li>I love the great classic masculine scent of this product that I remember the same great scent when I was little</li>
            <li>My grandfather really did use it, so the scent brings back pleasant memories.</li>
            <li>Old Spice Classic Scent is a great body wash that has the classic scent.</li>
            <li>Great as a part of an everyday body cleansing routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cannot find this in stores, thanks for having it available on your sight.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it has the smell that is so well known as \\&quot;Old Spice\\&quot;, which I have used for years.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, but I wish it had the \\&quot;8 hour scent technology\\&quot; of the newer Old Spice body washes.</li>
            <li>Makes me smile.</li>
            <li>There are much better body washes out there that have a masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>Love Old Spice.</li>
            <li>Really worth buying through Amazon</li>
            <li>On me its scent is fresh but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Before the last purchase I bought it directly from Old Spice and it always arrived in perfect condition; tops taped shut and each bottle in a sealed plastic bag, bubble wrapped and placed in a well protected master box.</li>
            <li>You get the same great Old Spice scent in this exceptional body gel and it is getting harder to find!</li>
            <li>The price on this is good compared to other body washes and it does help wash away any</li>
            <li>I really love the classic scent of the original Old Spice.  </li>
            <li>wish Old Spice would market the classic original scent much more than they do because it is what got them to where they are today.</li>
            <li>With all the new scents I have never been able to find classic in body wash.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a good body wash from old spice , during my search at local sellers</li>
            <li>It smells precisely like the Proctor and Gamble Old Spice!  </li>
            <li>The CLASSIC IS THE WINNER!!</li>
            <li>I love the classic scent of Old Spice body wash.</li>
            <li>Love Old Spice classic body wash.  </li>
            <li>For some reason they stopped selling it in most stores -- I&#x27;ve checked Target, Walmart, as well as several drug stores and grocery chains.  </li>
            <li>I also love the traditional graphics on this bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon.com was the logical place to find it and order.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ordering this body wash on-line was the easiest way for me to get exactly what I wanted, when I wanted it.</li>
            <li>Very frustrating!&lt;br /&gt;However, Amazon prevails!</li>
            <li>I and my significant other love the spicy scent</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell of Old Spice Original and while my partner and I can&#x27;t find it locally anymore, I insisted we order it.</li>
            <li>That familiar Old Spice jingle now whistles in the background.</li>
            <li>If any one know where to get shaving cream, shaving soap and talc in Old Spice Original, please let me know</li>
            <li>Clean, Manly Sandalwood Scent that made Old Spice poppular.</li>
            <li>reason I gave more than one star is that if you happen to have really oily skin, this actually may work in your benefit.</li>
            <li>It may not have the vitamin&#x27;s and other things(that come in tiny amounts) in it that you might find in the $14.00 body washes, but it does its purpose and it smells great.</li>
            <li>The first order was never delivered and Amazon sent a replacement immediately - very helpful Amazon customer service.</li>
            <li>We have been having trouble finding the original scent and glad we could get it online.  </li>
            <li>The only way this could be better would be if P&amp;G brought the original scent back.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it and like other reviewers haven&#x27;t been able to locate in local stores, so I have had to resort to buying it online.</li>
            <li>This is a Classic!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t really lather up very</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve got to use a whole lot of it</li>
            <li>This comes highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and this gel is gentle and does not strip all the moisture from his skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>Real man&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li>so I bought a whole case.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed the scent of the Old Spice Body Wash but could no longer found it locally.</li>
            <li>My hubby has issues finding the right body wash, his skin is rather sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have always used Old Spice original scent since I was a young man&lt;</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, not a big fan of the new old spice thats trying to compete with the metrosexual axe products.</li>
            <li>Crisp , clean, strong,  masculine and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>You can smell good in a subtle, manly way, without being oppressive to those around you.</li>
            <li>Having hard time finding original scent in the body wash since there are so many new ones out there.</li>
            <li>The smell of the soap is a classic \\&quot;man\\&quot; smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic for a reason, and should be a part of every man&#x27;s scent library.</li>
            <li>For whatever reason the stores in my area never have the classic scent.</li>
            <li>If you use this with the classic deodorant and aftershave, you&#x27;ll smell like an ocean breeze all day.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this classic scent</li>
            <li>No stores in my area carry the Classic Scent.  </li>
            <li>Classic scent.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this about a week ago &amp; have been loving it, for a long time I like most young people only thought Old Spice was for older people in their 50&#x27;s on up, but after ACTUALLY trying it &amp; with the thanks of my girlfriend, I think I finally found what I&#x27;ve been looking for all these years &amp; at a decent price for the bundle.</li>
            <li>Amazon is the ONLY place I could find the original old spice body wash.</li>
            <li>The only stuff he will use and as a woman, I like its clean masculine sent.</li>
            <li>If you really like the old spice smell, get the cologne, and use an unscented body wash that doesn&#x27;t kill your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My Father, My 16 year old son has the high school girls follow him around trying to get close and smell him!</li>
            <li>The odor is absolutely offensive and not the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; Old Spice scent as advertised.</li>
            <li>Old Spice Classic is just that it is a classic.</li>
            <li>This product is available in 18 oz sizes compared to other OS body washes which are 16 oz.</li>
            <li>they will no longer make this either - the new scents - STINK</li>
            <li>their new version of the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; is nothing to write home about -</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find this stuff in stores around where I live so</li>
            <li>Old Spice Classic Body Wash is no longer made.</li>
            <li>Classic scent for us guys who are too old for the fruity body wash out there.  </li>
            <li>The classic old spice scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it costs much more than bar soap  </li>
            <li>If you like the classic scents (and TV commercial featuring Chandler Bing&#x27;s real life Dad)  you will like this.</li>
            <li>Too bad it&#x27;s getting difficult for regular people to find this outside of Amazon, I find it weird that this company is kind of abandoning what made them successful in the first place, but hope they continue making this awesome classic scent.</li>
            <li>Will certainly be ordering again in the near future.</li>
            <li>Hard to find - glad Amazon is carrying it.</li>
            <li>The enduring Old Spice traditional scented body wash is a classic!</li>
            <li>I like its old time fragrence and ability to rapidly suds up.</li>
            <li>I used Old Spice Body Wash for a while.</li>
            <li>After a while I started to notice spots on my skin that were sensitive or irritated.</li>
            <li>and they said Old Spice doesn&#x27;t make it anymore.  </li>
            <li>(Old Spice Body Wash Classic)but</li>
            <li>THERE IS NOTHING LIKE OLD SPICE SCENT FOR &amp;#34;A MAN&#x27;S MAN&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>No wonder Old Spice is like the #1 aftershave in the world.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this in the stores nearby or far, once I ordered and received, quite promptly I must add.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why retailers are not carrying this anymore, but it has disappeared from all shelves near us.  </li>
            <li>Distinctively Old Spice but not over powering.</li>
            <li>If you like the Old Spice scent you&#x27;ll like the wash.  </li>
            <li>old spice started putting out the body wash in this scent I started</li>
            <li>My Son loves Old Spice so I buy the products by the case.</li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t Old Spice stick to the basics that got them where they are?  </li>
            <li>The used to be Old Spice&#x27;s marketing strategy.</li>
            <li>and my father used Old Spice products.  </li>
            <li>It appears to me to be a knock off product as it does not smell like Old Spice and the label on the bottle</li>
            <li>drives the women wild.  </li>
            <li>I love the subtle scent of this compared to the overly sweet, grating scent of other washes.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of my grandfather who used Old Spice products; while maybe not exactly the same formulation as a few decades ago, it is fairly close.  </li>
            <li>This is my usual bodywash; buying it in bulk, getting a discount and not having to leave my house made for an easy sell.</li>
            <li>My local stores no longer stock Classic Scent, so I&#x27;m so relieved when I found Old Spice CS on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Plus the scent is subtle, so by the time I get to work, the scent has faded so the most cranky about scent people won&#x27;t object.</li>
            <li>shall we say manly odors that regular soap sometimes misses, however while this has a decent scent in the shower thats</li>
            <li>Very hard to find this old scent,I bought it for my husband as I love the scent</li>
            <li>would suggest you to consider this product only if you are a big fan of the old spice classic scent .</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of old spice as I used to use old spice classic after shave for a long time..</li>
            <li>Every time I go into my local market or pharmacy there are all these products by Old Spice</li>
            <li>The traditional Old Spice sent continues on in this body wash.</li>
            <li>The last time I tried to order from Old Spice I was referred to Amazon, so I ordered 12 bottles or 2 boxes of 6 each.</li>
            <li>Which is kind of weird smell for your body.</li>
            <li>only need a small amount to clean your body.</li>

            <li> It has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> But it smells kind of like shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It was nice to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and I am very pleased with a product that it make me smell like a horny teenager who bought the hype about new age chick magnet</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s best to layer it with the classic scent deodorant and cologne/after shave.</li>
            <li> this is why it still around because it is that good and will reorder again thanks for a great product</li>
            <li> Fantastic smell and good price for the value.</li>

            <li> and it gets you good and clean.</li>
            <li> It foams up great and is refreshing as the very essence of the 7 Seas!</li>
            <li> The clean manly scent and clean feeling are great.</li>
            <li> And even better -- they had a box of 6, which made the per-item price cheaper than in the store.  </li>

            <li> It is so refreshing to smell.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and evokes questions as to what cologne you are wearing.</li>
            <li> Love this scent....</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>

            <li> What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> It will not burn your sinuses like most men&#x27;s body washes can.</li>
            <li> Thank you, it has been unavailable in South Africa for many years now.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Also purchasing in quantity you get a better deal.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness it is available at Amazin!</li>
            <li> YOU GUYS ARE GREAT AND FAST</li>
            <li> I cannot find this item in stores any longer and this is my husbands favorite body wash.</li>
            <li> I got many compliments</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I love this body wash.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, love the results...</li>
            <li> The scent is manly and keeps me smelling nice and feeling clean all day.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for old Spice that your father used you wouldn&#x27;t be here today!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> but it works great, and there is no waste or soggy slimy bars in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is the only one that doesn&#x27;t have a real strong, but pleasant smelling scent and yet still gets him clean.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of my OS Original man.</li>
            <li> Great lather and overall my favorite body wash.</li>
            <li> I was very happy when I saw this old spice classic sent online.</li>
            <li> What you see (smell, lol) with Old Spice is what you get; great lather, smooth non-greasy finish, and above all else that fantastic scent.</li>
            <li> My husband is clean and happy to have his Original Old Spice!</li>
            <li> it smells sooo good thanks for the quick shippment im ordering again for my son in laws</li>
            <li> Love the fact that I can purchase this at a reasonable price with home delivery!!</li>
            <li> Nice price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> the smell is great, but I had to deduct a star because it doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li> I can while its available.</li>
            <li> I later tried on amazon and was happy to find the product here.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful smell, brings me back to my childhood when my Dad was getting ready to go out or go to work.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the smell of Old Spice original.</li>
            <li> Thank Goodness for Amazon.com for getting to me the original.</li>
            <li> As usual, Amazon&#x27;s service was excellent.</li>
            <li> Stores will stock some, but not all, of the original scent products.  </li>
            <li> Clean, Fresh, Manly!  </li>
            <li> and he loves the clean feeling he gets</li>
            <li> Clean, manly-scent without being perfume-like.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using Old Spice products for many years.  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re a man above the age of 12 and looking for a very good body wash that&#x27;s also a classic and a legend</li>
            <li> I know P&amp;G changed the classic Old Spice scent, but this still smells great.  </li>
            <li> Very comforting and makes me feel safe.</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive because the old spray deodorant did not smell similar at all, but the body wash has that great, spicy, powdery, mildly sweet scent we all know and love.  </li>
            <li> Anyway thank you Old Spice &amp; thank you Amazon for not only delivering this great product, but also improving our love life.</li>
            <li> He really likes the original scent which you can&#x27;t find anywhere!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it anywhere luckily Amazon has got it in stock.</li>
            <li> It is a translucent blue color which looks very attractive, and it lathers well with a short bristled brush I use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Old Spice classic scent body wash has a pleasant spicy scent.</li>
            <li> I love the Manly classic scent of this product &amp; so does my gf.</li>
            <li> buy and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;metro&amp;#34; like most of the new scents out there these days.</li>
            <li> And of course Amazon had it -- should have looked here first!  </li>
            <li> I love the great classic masculine scent of this product that I remember the same great scent when I was little</li>
            <li> My grandfather really did use it, so the scent brings back pleasant memories.</li>
            <li> Old Spice Classic Scent is a great body wash that has the classic scent.</li>
            <li> Great as a part of an everyday body cleansing routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cannot find this in stores, thanks for having it available on your sight.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it has the smell that is so well known as \\&quot;Old Spice\\&quot;, which I have used for years.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, but I wish it had the \\&quot;8 hour scent technology\\&quot; of the newer Old Spice body washes.</li>
            <li> Makes me smile.</li>
            <li> There are much better body washes out there that have a masculine scent.  </li>
            <li> Love Old Spice.</li>
            <li> Really worth buying through Amazon</li>
            <li> On me its scent is fresh but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Before the last purchase I bought it directly from Old Spice and it always arrived in perfect condition; tops taped shut and each bottle in a sealed plastic bag, bubble wrapped and placed in a well protected master box.</li>
            <li> You get the same great Old Spice scent in this exceptional body gel and it is getting harder to find!</li>
            <li> The price on this is good compared to other body washes and it does help wash away any</li>
            <li> I really love the classic scent of the original Old Spice.  </li>
            <li> wish Old Spice would market the classic original scent much more than they do because it is what got them to where they are today.</li>
            <li> With all the new scents I have never been able to find classic in body wash.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a good body wash from old spice , during my search at local sellers</li>
            <li> It smells precisely like the Proctor and Gamble Old Spice!  </li>
            <li> The CLASSIC IS THE WINNER!!</li>
            <li> I love the classic scent of Old Spice body wash.</li>
            <li> Love Old Spice classic body wash.  </li>
            <li> For some reason they stopped selling it in most stores -- I&#x27;ve checked Target, Walmart, as well as several drug stores and grocery chains.  </li>
            <li> I also love the traditional graphics on this bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon.com was the logical place to find it and order.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ordering this body wash on-line was the easiest way for me to get exactly what I wanted, when I wanted it.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating!&lt;br /&gt;However, Amazon prevails!</li>
            <li> I and my significant other love the spicy scent</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of Old Spice Original and while my partner and I can&#x27;t find it locally anymore, I insisted we order it.</li>
            <li> That familiar Old Spice jingle now whistles in the background.</li>
            <li> If any one know where to get shaving cream, shaving soap and talc in Old Spice Original, please let me know</li>
            <li> Clean, Manly Sandalwood Scent that made Old Spice poppular.</li>
            <li> reason I gave more than one star is that if you happen to have really oily skin, this actually may work in your benefit.</li>
            <li> It may not have the vitamin&#x27;s and other things(that come in tiny amounts) in it that you might find in the $14.00 body washes, but it does its purpose and it smells great.</li>
            <li> The first order was never delivered and Amazon sent a replacement immediately - very helpful Amazon customer service.</li>
            <li> We have been having trouble finding the original scent and glad we could get it online.  </li>
            <li> The only way this could be better would be if P&amp;G brought the original scent back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it and like other reviewers haven&#x27;t been able to locate in local stores, so I have had to resort to buying it online.</li>
            <li> This is a Classic!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t really lather up very</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve got to use a whole lot of it</li>
            <li> This comes highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and this gel is gentle and does not strip all the moisture from his skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> Real man&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> so I bought a whole case.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed the scent of the Old Spice Body Wash but could no longer found it locally.</li>
            <li> My hubby has issues finding the right body wash, his skin is rather sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have always used Old Spice original scent since I was a young man&lt;</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, not a big fan of the new old spice thats trying to compete with the metrosexual axe products.</li>
            <li> Crisp , clean, strong,  masculine and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> You can smell good in a subtle, manly way, without being oppressive to those around you.</li>
            <li> Having hard time finding original scent in the body wash since there are so many new ones out there.</li>
            <li> The smell of the soap is a classic \\&quot;man\\&quot; smell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic for a reason, and should be a part of every man&#x27;s scent library.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason the stores in my area never have the classic scent.</li>
            <li> If you use this with the classic deodorant and aftershave, you&#x27;ll smell like an ocean breeze all day.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this classic scent</li>
            <li> No stores in my area carry the Classic Scent.  </li>
            <li> Classic scent.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this about a week ago &amp; have been loving it, for a long time I like most young people only thought Old Spice was for older people in their 50&#x27;s on up, but after ACTUALLY trying it &amp; with the thanks of my girlfriend, I think I finally found what I&#x27;ve been looking for all these years &amp; at a decent price for the bundle.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the ONLY place I could find the original old spice body wash.</li>
            <li> The only stuff he will use and as a woman, I like its clean masculine sent.</li>
            <li> If you really like the old spice smell, get the cologne, and use an unscented body wash that doesn&#x27;t kill your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My Father, My 16 year old son has the high school girls follow him around trying to get close and smell him!</li>
            <li> The odor is absolutely offensive and not the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; Old Spice scent as advertised.</li>
            <li> Old Spice Classic is just that it is a classic.</li>
            <li> This product is available in 18 oz sizes compared to other OS body washes which are 16 oz.</li>
            <li> they will no longer make this either - the new scents - STINK</li>
            <li> their new version of the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; is nothing to write home about -</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this stuff in stores around where I live so</li>
            <li> Old Spice Classic Body Wash is no longer made.</li>
            <li> Classic scent for us guys who are too old for the fruity body wash out there.  </li>
            <li> The classic old spice scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it costs much more than bar soap  </li>
            <li> If you like the classic scents (and TV commercial featuring Chandler Bing&#x27;s real life Dad)  you will like this.</li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s getting difficult for regular people to find this outside of Amazon, I find it weird that this company is kind of abandoning what made them successful in the first place, but hope they continue making this awesome classic scent.</li>
            <li> Will certainly be ordering again in the near future.</li>
            <li> Hard to find - glad Amazon is carrying it.</li>
            <li> The enduring Old Spice traditional scented body wash is a classic!</li>
            <li> I like its old time fragrence and ability to rapidly suds up.</li>
            <li> I used Old Spice Body Wash for a while.</li>
            <li> After a while I started to notice spots on my skin that were sensitive or irritated.</li>
            <li> and they said Old Spice doesn&#x27;t make it anymore.  </li>
            <li> (Old Spice Body Wash Classic)but</li>
            <li> THERE IS NOTHING LIKE OLD SPICE SCENT FOR &amp;#34;A MAN&#x27;S MAN&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> No wonder Old Spice is like the #1 aftershave in the world.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this in the stores nearby or far, once I ordered and received, quite promptly I must add.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why retailers are not carrying this anymore, but it has disappeared from all shelves near us.  </li>
            <li> Distinctively Old Spice but not over powering.</li>
            <li> If you like the Old Spice scent you&#x27;ll like the wash.  </li>
            <li> old spice started putting out the body wash in this scent I started</li>
            <li> My Son loves Old Spice so I buy the products by the case.</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t Old Spice stick to the basics that got them where they are?  </li>
            <li> The used to be Old Spice&#x27;s marketing strategy.</li>
            <li> and my father used Old Spice products.  </li>
            <li> It appears to me to be a knock off product as it does not smell like Old Spice and the label on the bottle</li>
            <li> drives the women wild.  </li>
            <li> I love the subtle scent of this compared to the overly sweet, grating scent of other washes.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of my grandfather who used Old Spice products; while maybe not exactly the same formulation as a few decades ago, it is fairly close.  </li>
            <li> This is my usual bodywash; buying it in bulk, getting a discount and not having to leave my house made for an easy sell.</li>
            <li> My local stores no longer stock Classic Scent, so I&#x27;m so relieved when I found Old Spice CS on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Plus the scent is subtle, so by the time I get to work, the scent has faded so the most cranky about scent people won&#x27;t object.</li>
            <li> shall we say manly odors that regular soap sometimes misses, however while this has a decent scent in the shower thats</li>
            <li> Very hard to find this old scent,I bought it for my husband as I love the scent</li>
            <li> would suggest you to consider this product only if you are a big fan of the old spice classic scent .</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of old spice as I used to use old spice classic after shave for a long time..</li>
            <li> Every time I go into my local market or pharmacy there are all these products by Old Spice</li>
            <li> The traditional Old Spice sent continues on in this body wash.</li>
            <li> The last time I tried to order from Old Spice I was referred to Amazon, so I ordered 12 bottles or 2 boxes of 6 each.</li>
            <li> Which is kind of weird smell for your body.</li>
            <li> only need a small amount to clean your body.</li>
            <li> I was sad to see that there were so many new old spice body washes and the classic was missing.</li>
            <li> lifelong 78 years old dedicated user of  old spice .</li>
            <li> I know Old Spice makes several different scents for a man&#x27;s body wash</li>
            <li> hands down over all the new products Old Spice has tried...</li>
            <li> for the dry skin I have no other issues  about this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> He has tried other products, but unless they stop making this, which I hope they don&#x27;t, because I like the way it smells also, he will only use \\&quot;Old Spice-Classic\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The problem is the stores don&#x27;t order it or create shelf space because they are too busy ordering all of those other metro-sexual scents.</li>
            <li> I feel refreshed after taking bath as the classic scent does stay for a few hours .&lt;br /&gt;Except</li>
            <li> The long lasting scent is unmistakable.</li>
            <li> They said it was because of low sales, which I found odd, because this was the one that was usually gone first.</li>
            <li> Price was about the same as other scents at local stores.</li>
            <li> I was afraid they didn&#x27;t make any more.</li>
            <li> Bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The two boxes were packed in a larger box with minimal packing.</li>
            <li> I like old spice, but don&#x27;t like the alcohol and harsh chemicals in their colognes/after shaves.  </li>
            <li> He loves the Old Spice Classic, but unfortunately for him, we can no longer find it in the supermarket, or big stores like Walmart or Kmart.</li>
            <li> The Old Spice people have expanded their range of products such that all of them, especially the old favorites, are difficult to find in one place.  </li>
            <li> I know the classic scent body wash is hard to find</li>
            <li> This is better because it&#x27;s a lasting fragrance without that bad stuff.</li>
            <li> My son has particularly dry skin</li>
            <li> and now even my 6 year old GRANDSON has the little kindergarten girls liking his smell too!</li>
            <li> SAME AS THE OTHER,  WALMART  HAS ALL THE OTHER  </li>
            <li> wish it had a moisturizer added into the body wash as my skin feels very dry after taking bath.</li>
            <li> This is becoming increasingly difficult to find, if you can find it at all!</li>
            <li> I have gotten quite a few compliments from the ladies on the scent, but only within an hour or so of showering.</li>
            <li> Everything arrived as expected</li>
            <li> is way off center.</li>
            <li> Big box stores are really missing out.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say but to those like me who like matching scents at a discount here you go!</li>
            <li> Bought some other body wash at the grocery store and I regret it.</li>
            <li> After you wash it off and finish your shower, it&#x27;s so faint, and minutes later it will be completely undetectable.  </li>
            <li> Infortunatrly, it is very difficult to find the original scent in body wash.</li>
            <li> why couldn&#x27;t they leave a good thing alone - very disappointed, but I will grab up every case of this</li>
            <li> love the scent, hate how it dries out my skin.</li>
            <li> But its usually cheaper than other body washes.</li>
            <li> The trouble is</li>
            <li> it is difficult to locate in a retail store near our home.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is one of the few colognes and aftershaves that blend with my body&lt;br /&gt;when</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is getting harder and harder to find in the marketplace.</li>
            <li> It smells so bad that I am using it now for toilet cleaning only.</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s what the makers told me, when I questioned why I was having trouble finding their product.</li>
            <li> I usually buy 6-12 bottles at a time.</li>
            <li> From past orders the master box may have been damaged but the packaging inside protected each bottle.</li>
            <li> The price was broken down to $3.89 a bottle for a purchase of six.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find, so stock up</li>
            <li> Hard to improve on this.</li>
            <li> this is hard to find it is faster and easier to order from here and don&#x27;t have to use gas to go to store.</li>
            <li> It is EXTREMELY hard to find in stores, I. Fact I have never found it in stores</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find item.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores and decided it was easier to buy a case from Amazon rather than burn gas shopping for it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my stepfather as this item is really hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> At least Amazon knows they have a problem hopefully they can fix it before I need to order again.</li>
            <li> Where the other stinks are bogus shame</li>
            <li> I am sorry that they decided to stop making this - almost as much as I was sorry they stopped making the body wash hair cleaner shave jell version - too bad</li>
            <li> Poor choice on their part.</li>
            <li> When the box arrived it was in poor condition</li>
            <li> when all else fails, turn to the internet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> The new scents are awful, perfume laden and horrible.  </li>
            <li> Too bad that it is almost impossible to find in retail stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so over powering that it makes you sick and never want to smell it again.</li>
            <li> I HATE WALMRT</li>
            <li> was very disappointed when the stores quit carrying this&lt;br /&gt;product</li>
            <li> Dries the skin terribly.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I like its old time fragrence and ability to rapidly suds up.</li>
            <li> I used Old Spice Body Wash for a while. It has a nice scent. After a while I started to notice spots on my skin that were sensitive or irritated. I realized it might be because of the body wash. I stopped using it and the feeling went away. This stuff can&#x27;t be good for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t really lather up very well-- you&#x27;ve got to use a whole lot of it each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES it. This is the only one that doesn&#x27;t have a real strong, but pleasant smelling scent and yet still gets him clean. He has tried other products, but unless they stop making this, which I hope they don&#x27;t, because I like the way it smells also, he will only use \\&quot;Old Spice-Classic\\&quot;. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this body wash.  For some reason they stopped selling it in most stores -- I&#x27;ve checked Target, Walmart, as well as several drug stores and grocery chains.  Nothing.  So finally I resorted to looking online.  And of course Amazon had it -- should have looked here first!  And even better -- they had a box of 6, which made the per-item price cheaper than in the store.  The smell of the soap is a classic \\&quot;man\\&quot; smell.  Everytime I give my hubby a kiss or hug, I just want to bury my face in his chest and breathe it in.  Very comforting and makes me feel safe.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, not a big fan of the new old spice thats trying to compete with the metrosexual axe products. Can&#x27;t find it anywhere luckily Amazon has got it in stock. I&#x27;m buying two six packs</li>
            <li> I love this product, it has the smell that is so well known as \\&quot;Old Spice\\&quot;, which I have used for years. It&#x27;s a real good body wash! The trouble is Old Spice Classic Body Wash is no longer made. At least that&#x27;s what the makers told me, when I questioned why I was having trouble finding their product. They said it was because of low sales, which I found odd, because this was the one that was usually gone first. It&#x27;s a shame.</li>
            <li> This is the best body wash out there. It may not have the vitamin&#x27;s and other things(that come in tiny amounts) in it that you might find in the $14.00 body washes, but it does its purpose and it smells great. Too bad that it is almost impossible to find in retail stores.</li>
            <li> Classic scent for us guys who are too old for the fruity body wash out there.  Problem is finding it.  This is only place I can locate it.  Tried drug store chain and they said Old Spice doesn&#x27;t make it anymore.  Poor choice on their part.</li>
            <li> This is becoming increasingly difficult to find, if you can find it at all! The enduring Old Spice traditional scented body wash is a classic! You get the same great Old Spice scent in this exceptional body gel and it is getting harder to find! It foams up great and is refreshing as the very essence of the 7 Seas! Is an essential for any man on-the-go! The long lasting scent is unmistakable. I also love the traditional graphics on this bottle. This comes highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Thank Goodness for Amazon.com for getting to me the original. I love this product (Old Spice Body Wash Classic)but I do not understand why it is not in stores? Every time I go into my local market or pharmacy there are all these products by Old Spice I do not care for, nor will I ever buy them. Who ever the CEO is of the company does not know what they are doing. You have a good product that can not be improved on yet we cant find in the stores. what gives?</li>
            <li> Amazon is the ONLY place I could find the original old spice body wash. I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, but I wish it had the \\&quot;8 hour scent technology\\&quot; of the newer Old Spice body washes. If it had that, it would be perfect. The clean manly scent and clean feeling are great. I have gotten quite a few compliments from the ladies on the scent, but only within an hour or so of showering. It seems to fade after a couple hours.</li>
            <li> It smells precisely like the Proctor and Gamble Old Spice!  I was a bit apprehensive because the old spray deodorant did not smell similar at all, but the body wash has that great, spicy, powdery, mildly sweet scent we all know and love.  It is a translucent blue color which looks very attractive, and it lathers well with a short bristled brush I use.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my husbands favorite body wash,</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of Old Spice Original and while my partner and I can&#x27;t find it locally anymore, I insisted we order it. I love the smell of my OS Original man. As usual, Amazon&#x27;s service was excellent.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find this old scent,I bought it for my husband as I love the scent and he loves the clean feeling he gets</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Just ordered the fragrance because of this body wash. Reminds me of Dad. It was well packaged, and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Best shower gel ever.  Period.</li>
            <li> a gift for my husband. it smells sooo good thanks for the quick shippment im ordering again for my son in laws</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and wonder why it is no longer being sold in stores. I hope amazon keeps carrying it.It smells just like my Dad used to. The first order was never delivered and Amazon sent a replacement immediately - very helpful Amazon customer service.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, and now he smells like a man.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  It makes me feel clean and smells awesome.  Reminds me of my grandfather who used Old Spice products; while maybe not exactly the same formulation as a few decades ago, it is fairly close.  You can smell good in a subtle, manly way, without being oppressive to those around you.</li>
            <li> THERE IS NOTHING LIKE OLD SPICE SCENT FOR &amp;#34;A MAN&#x27;S MAN&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is my exclusive body soap.  I know P&amp;G changed the classic Old Spice scent, but this still smells great.  The only way this could be better would be if P&amp;G brought the original scent back.  I buy the 6-packs because it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s an expiration date.  I just stick the box under the sink.</li>
            <li> If you like the classic scents (and TV commercial featuring Chandler Bing&#x27;s real life Dad)  you will like this. With all the new scents I have never been able to find classic in body wash. Price was about the same as other scents at local stores.</li>
            <li> Fantastic smell and good price for the value. The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering but I&#x27;ve still gotten compliments over it, though it doesn&#x27;t lather too well.</li>
            <li> I could not find this product in any store...when all else fails, turn to the internet.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.com was the logical place to find it and order.&lt;br /&gt;The price was the same as any drugstore, including the shipping.</li>
            <li> I love the classic scent of Old Spice body wash. It is so refreshing to smell. It&#x27;s not so over powering that it makes you sick and never want to smell it again. It&#x27;s just a good smell.</li>
            <li> I buy this stuff by the case! 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed the scent of the Old Spice Body Wash but could no longer found it locally. I was glad to find it at Amazon. Clean, manly-scent without being perfume-like. Refreshing and evokes questions as to what cologne you are wearing.</li>
            <li> Love this scent....it is difficult to locate in a retail store near our home.  Love the fact that I can purchase this at a reasonable price with home delivery!!</li>
            <li> I was satified with the timely arrival of this product.  It was a gift and my boyfriend appreciaterd it also.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful smell, brings me back to my childhood when my Dad was getting ready to go out or go to work. Makes me smile.</li>
            <li> lifelong 78 years old dedicated user of  old spice . Where the other stinks are bogus shame you cant find them in stores</li>
            <li> Dries the skin terribly.  There are much better body washes out there that have a masculine scent.  If you really like the old spice smell, get the cologne, and use an unscented body wash that doesn&#x27;t kill your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason I gave more than one star is that if you happen to have really oily skin, this actually may work in your benefit.</li>
            <li> Rating with 5 stars because I like how my husband smells when he uses this.</li>
            <li> The slogan is &amp;#34;If your grandfather didn&#x27;t use this, you wouldn&#x27;t be here&amp;#34;. My grandfather really did use it, so the scent brings back pleasant memories. Plus the scent is subtle, so by the time I get to work, the scent has faded so the most cranky about scent people won&#x27;t object.</li>
            <li> Works great. Love Old Spice.</li>
            <li> What you see (smell, lol) with Old Spice is what you get; great lather, smooth non-greasy finish, and above all else that fantastic scent. It&#x27;s a classic for a reason, and should be a part of every man&#x27;s scent library. Great as a part of an everyday body cleansing routine.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find, so stock up whenever you can. Now would be a good time, perhaps.</li>
            <li> I was very happy when I saw this old spice classic sent online. I was afraid they didn&#x27;t make any more. I was very happy with the quick delivery and good packing of the product.  (I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the swagger scent)</li>
            <li> I was leery about switching from bar soap to a liquid bath soap but now I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;m not sure if it costs much more than bar soap  but it works great, and there is no waste or soggy slimy bars in the shower.</li>
            <li> The classic old spice scent. Hard to improve on this. Great lather and overall my favorite body wash. Hard to find - glad Amazon is carrying it.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re a man above the age of 12 and looking for a very good body wash that&#x27;s also a classic and a legend look no further.</li>
            <li> love this stuff this is why it still around because it is that good and will reorder again thanks for a great product</li>
            <li> Cannot find this in stores, thanks for having it available on your sight. My husband is clean and happy to have his Original Old Spice!</li>
            <li> Excellent, good protector for sweating, is not greasy, my wife loves the scent and feel very cool with their use</li>
            <li> No wonder Old Spice is like the #1 aftershave in the world.  The smell of this body wash is so evocative...fills the bath with olfactory memories!  My son has particularly dry skin and this gel is gentle and does not strip all the moisture from his skin.  We truly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The Old Spice people have expanded their range of products such that all of them, especially the old favorites, are difficult to find in one place.  Stores will stock some, but not all, of the original scent products.  Ordering this body wash on-line was the easiest way for me to get exactly what I wanted, when I wanted it.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Old Spice is just the best body wash for me. I&#x27;ll use it til I no longer need to bathe  :)</li>
            <li> This is  my husband,s favorite body wash and they have stopped selling in the stores.  He was very glad when I found him some.</li>
            <li> I always buy this scent. I buy the 6 pack. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Not much to say but to those like me who like matching scents at a discount here you go! Fantastic!</li>
            <li> this is hard to find it is faster and easier to order from here and don&#x27;t have to use gas to go to store. plus it is cheaper than the store. This is without a doubt the best place to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this in the stores nearby or far, once I ordered and received, quite promptly I must add. I&#x27;m set for a while. It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> Old Spice Classic is just that it is a classic. If it wasn&#x27;t for old Spice that your father used you wouldn&#x27;t be here today!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!  Clean, Manly Sandalwood Scent that made Old Spice poppular.</li>
            <li> Agree with all the 5 STARS! My Grandfather LOVED THIS (BORN 1895) My Father, My 16 year old son has the high school girls follow him around trying to get close and smell him! lol and now even my 6 year old GRANDSON has the little kindergarten girls liking his smell too! This is a Classic!  Clean, Fresh, Manly!  This a WINNER...hands down over all the new products Old Spice has tried...The CLASSIC IS THE WINNER!!</li>
            <li> Bought some other body wash at the grocery store and I regret it. I love the subtle scent of this compared to the overly sweet, grating scent of other washes.</li>
            <li> The price on this is good compared to other body washes and it does help wash away any shall we say manly odors that regular soap sometimes misses, however while this has a decent scent in the shower thats it once rinsed off the scent is gone.</li>
            <li> Old Spice Classic Scent is a great body wash that has the classic scent. It is EXTREMELY hard to find in stores, I. Fact I have never found it in stores and I&#x27;ve looked everywhere. This product is available in 18 oz sizes compared to other OS body washes which are 16 oz. the smell is great, but I had to deduct a star because it doesn&#x27;t last at all. After you wash it off and finish your shower, it&#x27;s so faint, and minutes later it will be completely undetectable.  So it&#x27;s best to layer it with the classic scent deodorant and cologne/after shave. Hopefully they will continue to produce this, for I will keep buying it!</li>
            <li> My hubby has issues finding the right body wash, his skin is rather sensitive. He loves the Old Spice Classic, but unfortunately for him, we can no longer find it in the supermarket, or big stores like Walmart or Kmart. Very frustrating!&lt;br /&gt;However, Amazon prevails! I order the 6 pack and hubby is singing happily away in the shower again!</li>
            <li> We have been having trouble finding the original scent and glad we could get it online.  It was decently priced, not less but not more then in stores.  I don&#x27;t understand why retailers are not carrying this anymore, but it has disappeared from all shelves near us.  The new scents are awful, perfume laden and horrible.  Glad Amazon could save the day.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product and price. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I and my significant other love the spicy scent</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find item.  This was a great transaction.  I was glad to find this product.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason the stores in my area never have the classic scent. I like it, it smells good, by compasion its cheap and it gets you good and clean. What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> Having hard time finding original scent in the body wash since there are so many new ones out there. Problem solved for now. Don&#x27;t have to go to the store either.</li>
            <li> This is my usual bodywash; buying it in bulk, getting a discount and not having to leave my house made for an easy sell.</li>
            <li> I really love this nostalgic sent unlike some of the newer perfume, fooh fooh stuff out there. Real man&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> Old Spice classic scent body wash has a pleasant spicy scent. It will not burn your sinuses like most men&#x27;s body washes can. I have been using this product for several years now. The only place I can find it now is at Amazon.</li>
            <li> But it smells kind of like shaving cream. Which is kind of weird smell for your body. But its usually cheaper than other body washes.</li>
            <li> I am sorry that they decided to stop making this - almost as much as I was sorry they stopped making the body wash hair cleaner shave jell version - too bad they will no longer make this either - the new scents - STINK - hell their new version of the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; is nothing to write home about - why couldn&#x27;t they leave a good thing alone - very disappointed, but I will grab up every case of this I can while its available.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this at any brick and mortar store around. The price was broken down to $3.89 a bottle for a purchase of six. If you use this with the classic deodorant and aftershave, you&#x27;ll smell like an ocean breeze all day.</li>
            <li> Excellent wash performance, FANTASTIC smell.  Distinctively Old Spice but not over powering.</li>
            <li> I am Robert&#x27;s wife and I purchased this body wash for him. He likes it . The only stuff he will use and as a woman, I like its clean masculine sent.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as advertised.</li>
            <li> Thank you, it has been unavailable in South Africa for many years now. Will certainly be ordering again in the near future.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great! Doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;metro&amp;#34; like most of the new scents out there these days. Creates a good lather.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a good body wash from old spice , during my search at local sellers I was sad to see that there were so many new old spice body washes and the classic was missing. I later tried on amazon and was happy to find the product here. I am a big fan of old spice as I used to use old spice classic after shave for a long time..&lt;br /&gt;I , went in for the product and I ordered for 6 of them .&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had a moisturizer added into the body wash as my skin feels very dry after taking bath. I feel refreshed after taking bath as the classic scent does stay for a few hours .&lt;br /&gt;Except for the dry skin I have no other issues  about this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest you to consider this product only if you are a big fan of the old spice classic scent .</li>
            <li> The traditional Old Spice sent continues on in this body wash. Crisp , clean, strong,  masculine and long lasting.  The scent has endured for decades. I have enjoyed using Old Spice products for many years.  Buy now before this product vanishes from shelves and becomes a fond memory.</li>
            <li> If you like the Old Spice scent you&#x27;ll like the wash.  Plus it leaves no film on the shower.  Delivered in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I really love the classic scent of the original Old Spice.  Unfortunately it is getting harder and harder to find in the marketplace.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores and decided it was easier to buy a case from Amazon rather than burn gas shopping for it. This is an excellent product and I am very pleased with a product that it make me smell like a horny teenager who bought the hype about new age chick magnet smells. I want to smell like a grown up.</li>
            <li> My local stores no longer stock Classic Scent, so I&#x27;m so relieved when I found Old Spice CS on Amazon. The scent is manly and keeps me smelling nice and feeling clean all day. Showering is better with it!</li>
            <li> Bottle lasts a long time. And it&#x27;s my favorite scent. You smell like a man. No lavender baloney. Buy it.</li>
            <li> Makes you smell awesome and they bulk deal is nice because I can no longer find this product anywhere. This product will save you from having to buy body wash for years. I believe I am using this still after almost two years.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my stepfather as this item is really hard to find in the stores. Also purchasing in quantity you get a better deal. Really worth buying through Amazon</li>
            <li> I have always loved the smell of Old Spice original. Infortunatrly, it is very difficult to find the original scent in body wash. Thank goodness it is available at Amazin!</li>
            <li> SAME AS THE OTHER,  WALMART  HAS ALL THE OTHER  BUT NOT THE OEM YOU GUYS ARE GREAT AND FAST I HATE WALMRT TO BIG FOR THERE OWN GOOD YOU HAVE TO GET WHAT THEY HAVE OR NOTHING. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. YOU GOT ME HOOKED.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this classic scent</li>
            <li> I ordered this about a week ago &amp; have been loving it, for a long time I like most young people only thought Old Spice was for older people in their 50&#x27;s on up, but after ACTUALLY trying it &amp; with the thanks of my girlfriend, I think I finally found what I&#x27;ve been looking for all these years &amp; at a decent price for the bundle. I love the Manly classic scent of this product &amp; so does my gf. Too bad it&#x27;s getting difficult for regular people to find this outside of Amazon, I find it weird that this company is kind of abandoning what made them successful in the first place, but hope they continue making this awesome classic scent. Anyway thank you Old Spice &amp; thank you Amazon for not only delivering this great product, but also improving our love life.</li>
            <li> I cannot find this item in stores any longer and this is my husbands favorite body wash. Also, comes with a great price!</li>
            <li> I have always used Old Spice original scent since I was a young man&lt;br /&gt;It is one of the few colognes and aftershaves that blend with my body&lt;br /&gt;when old spice started putting out the body wash in this scent I started&lt;br /&gt;using. and it had the same blend with my body I got many compliments&lt;br /&gt;on its fragrance. On me its scent is fresh but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed when the stores quit carrying this&lt;br /&gt;product on the shelves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I found it on line I decided I would purchase it. It was a&lt;br /&gt;great buy and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The slogan on the bottle says it all, &amp;#34;If your grandfather hadn&#x27;t worn it, you wouldn&#x27;t exist.  No stores in my area carry the Classic Scent.  Who are you going to turn to ?  Why Amazon of course.  That familiar Old Spice jingle now whistles in the background.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it and like other reviewers haven&#x27;t been able to locate in local stores, so I have had to resort to buying it online. I usually buy 6-12 bottles at a time. Before the last purchase I bought it directly from Old Spice and it always arrived in perfect condition; tops taped shut and each bottle in a sealed plastic bag, bubble wrapped and placed in a well protected master box. The last time I tried to order from Old Spice I was referred to Amazon, so I ordered 12 bottles or 2 boxes of 6 each. The two boxes were packed in a larger box with minimal packing. When the box arrived it was in poor condition but I thought no problem. From past orders the master box may have been damaged but the packaging inside protected each bottle. I was wrong. Every bottle was leaking from around the tops. Nothing had been done...whoever shipped it just placed two boxes inside a bigger box and shipped it. At least Amazon knows they have a problem hopefully they can fix it before I need to order again.</li>
            <li> Everything arrived as expected</li>
            <li> De gustibus non est disputandum.</li>
            <li> My Son loves Old Spice so I buy the products by the case. He really likes the original scent which you can&#x27;t find anywhere! We get the body wash, shampoo and of course the after shave. Good prices, good product! It came in good time and was packaged well. If any one know where to get shaving cream, shaving soap and talc in Old Spice Original, please let me know</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance.  I like old spice, but don&#x27;t like the alcohol and harsh chemicals in their colognes/after shaves.  This is better because it&#x27;s a lasting fragrance without that bad stuff.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Was what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now.  I like the performance of the product, as well as the scent.  Unfortunately I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  It was nice to find it on Amazon so I bought a whole case.  Why can&#x27;t Old Spice stick to the basics that got them where they are?  I went to the store recently and there had to have been 20 flavors of body wash there.  I told my wife it was like shopping for women&#x27;s shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy.  I don&#x27;t need 20 options for soap.  Just give me the stuff my grandpa used.  The used to be Old Spice&#x27;s marketing strategy.</li>
            <li> I love the great classic masculine scent of this product that I remember the same great scent when I was little and my father used Old Spice products.  I know Old Spice makes several different scents for a man&#x27;s body wash and I have tried them and do NOT like them.  Some smell too flowery. I have to order this product on the internet because I do not see it on the shelf in any drugstores or supermarkets.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this stuff in stores around where I live so it was great to get this, I&#x27;ve always used this, I had to use a different soap for a month or so and my wife couldn&#x27;t stand it!</li>
            <li> love the scent, hate how it dries out my skin.</li>
            <li> It is what is says it is.  Classic scent.  Not too over powering</li>
            <li> I will never, ever purchase this product again. The odor is absolutely offensive and not the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; Old Spice scent as advertised. It smells so bad that I am using it now for toilet cleaning only. It appears to me to be a knock off product as it does not smell like Old Spice and the label on the bottle is way off center. I would not suggest this as a good purchase to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash.</li>
            <li> I know the classic scent body wash is hard to find but it&#x27;s still being made by P&amp;G.  Our Kroger grocery stores sell it and it seems to be the only place I can find it. On occasion Wal-Mart will have it on the shelves but it&#x27;s hit or miss.  The problem is the stores don&#x27;t order it or create shelf space because they are too busy ordering all of those other metro-sexual scents. You can request a store to order products that you don&#x27;t see and sometimes they have no problem doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish Old Spice would market the classic original scent much more than they do because it is what got them to where they are today. It&#x27;s a great scent and the best they have.</li>
            <li> Love Old Spice classic body wash.  Have purchased the multi-packs several times.  Love the scent, love the results...drives the women wild.  Big box stores are really missing out.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> only need a small amount to clean your body.</li>
