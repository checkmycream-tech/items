            <li>Love that it has copper as well as silver and gold.</li>
            <li>This is the nicest fabrication in a nail polish I have ever seen, being that it is so over the top, but yet I can still pull this off with style on any occasion.</li>
            <li>O So fabulous!</li>
            <li>This is better than any of the glitter polish at retail stores.</li>
            <li>and I really love</li>
            <li>I really love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I gave this brand a chance.</li>
            <li>The colors are long-lasting and very unique.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really unique and lovely</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying a couple more bottles right away, to make sure I won&#x27;t run out any time soon.</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish, it is a little clumpy feeling, but it goes on nicely and with a great glossy topcoat</li>
            <li>I was real excited to try this polish looks just like the picture shows,I used two coats of OPI Black Polish and one coat of this over the top ,so pretty on really stands out and have already had people ask me where I bought it from .A 5 star seller fast shipping and packaged good even came with instructions on the best way to remove this.</li>
            <li>Very eye catching polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time buying this brand of nail polish and for the most part I&#x27;m OK with it, but pissed I had to pay $11 when I found some thing like it in Wallgreens for $2.99 right after the PONR in ordering something.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really cool.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was as described.</li>
            <li>One of my new favorite polishes.</li>
            <li>KB Shimmer has a new fan :)</li>
            <li>It comes right off using this method.  </li>
            <li>Only thing I would say is the pricing is more than what we could have gotten in the store</li>
            <li>Lovely over taupe browns or metallics, haven&#x27;t tried over white, but will soon!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the first coat fool you.</li>
            <li>looks amazing thru the black gel.</li>
            <li>Note that it doesn&#x27;t come off easily with remover, just as all larger glitter polish, but it comes off easily using cotton dipped in remover and then fingers covered with foil and left on for about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun, but still classy, very sparkly, and it wears quite well.</li>
            <li>besides the beauty, it is very shiny and glossy.</li>
            <li>Despite the price it is very pretty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very picky and had no expectations buying a polish online.</li>
            <li>it really shines.  </li>
            <li>It is NOT black nail polish with gold flecks, it is more a clear nail polish with a grey tint.  </li>
            <li>I been wanting to order this for a while and finally did a  few weeks ago, this is a amazing nail polish.</li>
            <li>Fantasic; although so glad it is not deep black.</li>
            <li>but I was told by daughter that it wasn&#x27;t something she could find in the stores near us.</li>
            <li>I had many compliments on the polish, even from people who wouldn&#x27;t typically wear black polish.  </li>
            <li>It looks more like a black mess.</li>
            <li>It definitely looks like a professional manicure when I wear it ---</li>
            <li>The beauty of this polish is worth the little bit of extra time it takes to remove it.  </li>
            <li>I wore two coats over a black base, and it was awesome.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty, but invest in kwik dry and be prepared to wait half your life time.</li>

            <li> black not clear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;Three coat of just the polish or one base coat of black and two coats of the polish</li>
            <li> I used a black polish under it and 2 coats of the Band Geek.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it both with and without a black polish undercoat.</li>
            <li> You would need to put this over black nail polish.</li>

            <li> This brightens &amp; blings up ordinary polishes.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-drys very, very, very slow</li>
            <li> You HAVE to do three thin coats if you want it to look like the picture in the description.</li>
            <li> Black Base with copper and gold hexagon glitters with shimmer.</li>
            <li> No need for a black base coat.</li>
            <li> I made sparkly fluffy bunny&#x27;s and cupcakes!!!!</li>
            <li> It was difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> In my bottle the Base to glitter ratio was heavier on the glitter</li>

            <li> AWESOME nail  polish!!!!  I absolutely love this KBShimmer polish in Band Geek.  It&#x27;s incredible looking.  I used a black polish under it and 2 coats of the Band Geek.  It covered nicely and looked gorgeous.  I had many compliments on the polish, even from people who wouldn&#x27;t typically wear black polish.  The gold/copper glitter pieces really stand out and look great with the micro glitter surrounding it.

It definitely looks like a professional manicure when I wear it --- besides the beauty, it is very shiny and glossy.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this! Only thing I would say is the pricing is more than what we could have gotten in the store but I was told by daughter that it wasn&#x27;t something she could find in the stores near us. It arrived quickly and was as described. Would order again if the need arises. 5 STARS :)</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t turn out to look like the model&#x27;s fingers. It looks more like a black mess. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Black Base with copper and gold hexagon glitters with shimmer. In my bottle the Base to glitter ratio was heavier on the glitter so it was just a smidge cunky. But thats alright! Simply Beautiful</li>
            <li> This brightens &amp; blings up ordinary polishes. Lovely over taupe browns or metallics, haven&#x27;t tried over white, but will soon!</li>
            <li> Very eye catching polish. I&#x27;ve used it both with and without a black polish undercoat. It has a brownish/black hue without the undercoat, but beautiful either way!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time buying this brand of nail polish and for the most part I&#x27;m OK with it, but pissed I had to pay $11 when I found some thing like it in Wallgreens for $2.99 right after the PONR in ordering something. Despite the price it is very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;PRO&lt;br /&gt;-good gratuated glitter flecks&lt;br /&gt;-all over coverage&lt;br /&gt;-nice mix of goldish, bronzish, silverish color&lt;br /&gt;CON&lt;br /&gt;-tinted black not clear&lt;br /&gt;-can&#x27;t put over bright colors&lt;br /&gt;-drys very, very, very slow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want to buy this keep in mind it&#x27;s pretty, but invest in kwik dry and be prepared to wait half your life time.</li>
            <li> looks just like the picture.  Stays on a long time</li>
            <li> Beautiful glitter! I wore two coats over a black base, and it was awesome. Loads of glitter, easy application, levels nicely. Got several compliments on it. Love that it has copper as well as silver and gold. Haven&#x27;t tried it on its own, but looks like 3-4 coats would work.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn that much black polish in the past. This one has changed my mind. I got good coverage in 2 coats and the gold glitter looks amazing thru the black gel. One of my new favorite polishes.</li>
            <li> My daughters loved this nail polish....all the products we have purchased from KBSHimmer have been great quality &amp; we will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Fantasic; although so glad it is not deep black. This is the nicest fabrication in a nail polish I have ever seen, being that it is so over the top, but yet I can still pull this off with style on any occasion. Even rockin jeans. O So fabulous!</li>
            <li> I been wanting to order this for a while and finally did a  few weeks ago, this is a amazing nail polish. I&#x27;m in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;Three coat of just the polish or one base coat of black and two coats of the polish it&#x27;s really cool.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to apply.  It doesn&#x27;t come out looking like the picture.  It is NOT black nail polish with gold flecks, it is more a clear nail polish with a grey tint.  You would need to put this over black nail polish.</li>
            <li> This polish is absolutely amazing. I am very picky and had no expectations buying a polish online. This is better than any of the glitter polish at retail stores. No need for a black base coat. 3 layers of color is sufficient. The sparkles don&#x27;t clump and disperse evenly. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish, it is a little clumpy feeling, but it goes on nicely and with a great glossy topcoat it really shines.  I&#x27;ve had so many great compliments and I really love the gold/copper/platinum shine to the glitter.  It&#x27;s really unique and lovely and I can&#x27;t wait to try the others that I bought!</li>
            <li> I really love this nail polish. It looks just like the product photo after two coats. I have a feeling I&#x27;m going to be wearing this a lot.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT&#x27;S ON THE SCREEN IF YOU APPLY 2 COATS IT&#x27;s SO SPARKLY THAT I GET A LOT OF COMPLEMENTS on it.I made sparkly fluffy bunny&#x27;s and cupcakes!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I gave this brand a chance. This is really a gorgeous shade of polish-I purchased three shades from KB Shimmer and my expectations were exceeded. The colors are long-lasting and very unique. Don&#x27;t let the first coat fool you. You HAVE to do three thin coats if you want it to look like the picture in the description. KB Shimmer has a new fan :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful! This one is definately one of my favorites, by itself in 3 coats or just as eyecatching over black. Would definately recommend this color to anyone that enjoys glitter nail polish.</li>
