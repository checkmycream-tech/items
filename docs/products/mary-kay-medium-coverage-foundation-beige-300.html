            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am also really appreciative that this product is sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It was good as always and came quickly as I was going out of town for a week and needed it ASAP</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite foundation</li>
            <li>Great product, very lightweight on your skin doesn&#x27;t feel as if your wearing anything.  </li>
            <li>it goes on smooth and even.....</li>
            <li>product was more than 10 years old</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found other foundation that work as good as Mary Kay has worked.</li>
            <li>The replacement was a much lighter color than the original foundation.</li>
            <li>I have used allot of foundations and Mary Kay gives me a natural, smooth cover with zero skin break outs.</li>
            <li>I have been using this exact same product since 2010, and let me tell you, I have not found a better replacement (and I almost never bother looking because this product works so well for me).</li>
            <li>Thanks, Mary Kay!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I always feel very pressured by sales reps to re-purchase or purchase items I don&#x27;t need, so I don&#x27;t like dealing with them</li>
            <li>I have used Mary Kay products for at least 25 years and have always loved them.</li>
            <li>This color matches my skin tone so perfectly that you can absolutely never tell that I have a &amp;#34;seam.&amp;#34; It is easy to apply, washes off easily, doesn&#x27;t cause my extremely sensitive skin irritation, and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy it icky on my skin (</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for some older foundation  Medium Coverage Foundation Beige 300.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup I have been using it for a little over a year now</li>
            <li>looks natural.  </li>
            <li>I am 57 years old and still have breakouts.</li>
            <li>From what I can tell this product was 10 years old.</li>
            <li>Not exaggerating - 10 years old.</li>
            <li>this foundation is not heavy....</li>
            <li>I get a little nervous ordering make-up online, but the product I received was as good as what I have gotten in the past.  </li>
            <li>and I would much rather purchase online, hassle-free, especially since this product lasts for such a long time!</li>
            <li>If I am reading correctly, the pink cap is way older than the grey one I supposedly ordered.</li>

            <li> Great product, very lightweight on your skin doesn&#x27;t feel as if your wearing anything.  Have used Mary Kay foundation for 23yrs. now &amp; hopefully for 23 more!&lt;br /&gt;Love the product!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Mary Kay!</li>

            <li> product was more than 10 years old</li>
            <li> From what I can tell this product was 10 years old. Not exaggerating - 10 years old.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great price.  No problems using it.  I would buy it again.  I would recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay products for at least 25 years and have always loved them. This medium coverage foundation covers up all my blemishes but isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
            <li> Yes I would recommend this product to anyone... I have been using Mary Kay for about 20 years now and have never had a problem with anything I ever bought from them.... this foundation is not heavy.... it has sunscreen incorporated in it.... it goes on smooth and even..... thank you Mary Kay</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for some older foundation  Medium Coverage Foundation Beige 300. The replacement was a much lighter color than the original foundation. I guess that Mary Kay has changed their colors. This is the only reason it earned 4 stars. The change was nothing to do with the seller.</li>
            <li> It was good as always and came quickly as I was going out of town for a week and needed it ASAP</li>
