            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover blemishes well, but it does even skintone perfectly.</li>
            <li>However, I am VERY happy about this product!</li>
            <li>The color (nude) was perfect.</li>

            <li>Great make up!</li>
            <li>the color will be perfect.</li>
            <li>But, best of all, it provides SPF coverage, which is a must for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>It matched my skin perfectly, covered my blemished (although I must admit, I don&#x27;t have a ton), and didn&#x27;t make my skin oily by the end of the day.  </li>

            <li>Considering I have never tried Neutrogena&#x27;s makeup before, I was actually impressed with the coverage for this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that if I use a foundation brush to apply that I get the best results.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, the coverage is excellent.  </li>

            <li>gives a flawless look.</li>

            <li>but otherwise I find this is a perfect foundation-</li>
            <li>A very good color match as well!</li>

            <li>This is an awesome foundation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>I think this foundation is great!</li>
            <li>I like it, probably the best of the Neutrogena foundations I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>All in all, an excellent product</li>
            <li>I tried this just today &amp; was so impressed!  </li>
            <li>The color match was perfect.</li>
            <li>Best affordable foundation I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel so confident!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, I have very fair skin and sometime finding a shade that works with my skin tone can be tricky - not a problem here - the lightest color worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is very fair and freckled.  </li>
            <li>that is either wears off or runs with my skin type, but this one lasted all day which I found very surprising.  </li>
            <li>Yes, you will still have to blot your t-zone, but this stuff is incredible for the price.</li>
            <li>It brilliantly evened my skin with a lightweight, luminous finish.</li>
            <li>I think Neutrogena did a really good job with this product, I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>I loved it!</li>
            <li>I loved this foundation!</li>
            <li>Good luck finding your perfect shade!</li>
            <li>Blends beautifully and covers everything.</li>
            <li>The Ivory shade works perfect with my fair complexion.</li>
            <li>but it applied beautifully.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;ve now used this product a bunch of times and I am really very pleased with it!</li>
            <li>It gives GREAT coverage</li>
            <li>However, this product works great</li>
            <li>It is great looking on the skin.  </li>
            <li>It lasts for hours and is great for work or a night out.  </li>
            <li>The color looks great on me, and I had to pick a color choice from a website, I did a great job picking the Ivory color.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like it&#x27;s mousturizing my skin while helping it look great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It WAS a great matte finish and didn&#x27;t leave my face looking dewey.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>After trying it, I can say that the primer GREATLY improved the look of this product.</li>
            <li>so I did not get a great color match.</li>
            <li>It is a great foundation</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great on my skin, gives me great coverage and lasts literally all day.</li>
            <li>Even after wearing it all day, I find that my skin is still looking and feeling great.  </li>
            <li>Great coverage.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>With that being said, I&#x27;ve been wearing it at home, and I do think there are some great benefits.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin, and it looked great all day.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of redness, but this works great to cover it</li>
            <li>It works great and feels great, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lasted all day and made my skin look great.</li>
            <li>There are great colors to choose from in order to get the closest match to all skin tones.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is great on my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>This foundation also had some great wear.</li>
            <li>which is great.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll see the promised improved skin in 4-weeks, but the foundation looks great on my skin.</li>
            <li>I began to spread it on my skin and to my surprise it went on great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great find.</li>
            <li>This makes your skin look great.</li>
            <li>The foundation provided great coverage.  </li>
            <li>GREAT perks to have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great foundation to use.  </li>
            <li>I like the slender glass bottle as it&#x27;s attractive</li>
            <li>I wore it for 14 hours yesterday and still had great coverage when I washed it off.  </li>
            <li>Love this makeup!!</li>
            <li>I could not be happier with this foundation and cannot wait to try more Neutrogena products!!</li>
            <li>I love this foundation!!</li>
            <li>This foundation is very nice.</li>
            <li>This covered blemishes very nicely and the color matched rather well on my skin.</li>
            <li>The best way I can describe it is that it feels like I&#x27;m putting very light, silky lotion on my face when I&#x27;m applying it.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>The product is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I have to start by saying this makeup feels AMAZING on!</li>
            <li>I love the color and blended in my blemishes perfectly.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my skin feel and it looks great too!</li>
            <li>The color match was great, but even using it after moisturizer, it made my skin flake and didn&#x27;t look good.</li>
            <li>It provides great coverage that looks even and bright.</li>
            <li>was most impressed by how well the ivory shade matched my skin tone.</li>
            <li>The color is also a great match for my skin, which I owe to the fact that they offer so many great skin tones to choose from.</li>
            <li>so this is a good bargain.</li>
            <li>I received it free to try through BuzzAgent.com and am seriously impressed.  </li>
            <li>Maybe is too soon to write a good review, so I will continue to use it, and see how my skin reacts.</li>
            <li>DID serve as a good primer when I applied eye makeup</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>Looked smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li>This would be a good makeup to use in the summer.</li>
            <li>Over all I think it is a good product.</li>
            <li>Years ago I had a Covergirl lotion/foundation that I loved.</li>
            <li>I think the foundation is a good product, but doesn&#x27;t fully cover the redness on the bridge of my nose and cheeks.  </li>
            <li>Every time I wear it, I get compliments on how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li>It felt light and did its job and best of all-</li>
            <li>It has SPF 20, and is a good value.  </li>
            <li>and I really loved this make up.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a wonderful light moisturizing foundation….wrong.</li>
            <li>This is like going to a fair and getting your face painted.</li>
            <li>I have always loved Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find the perfect foundation to evenly cover and feel light on my face.  </li>
            <li>I got this for free from bzzagent and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>I had to give the bottle a good shake to get the makeup out.</li>
            <li>It is longwear, and keeping with Neutrogena&#x27;s reputation, it seems to do your skin some good.  </li>
            <li>I really loved this foundation.</li>
            <li>I can not complain but the color was not the best fit for my skin.</li>
            <li>I loved the coverage.</li>
            <li>Apparently good for my skin</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d give it a fair shot before judging it.</li>
            <li>may not be the best option for extremely dry skin, but if you have well moisturized skin before application expect great coverage and perfectly dewy finish.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>This foundation has great coverage and went on very easily.</li>
            <li>It evened out my skin tone beautifully, and I love the velvety finish.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy there is no perfume and that it comes off easy during removal!</li>
            <li>It has excellent, lasting coverage and the color i chose matches perfectly.</li>
            <li>Love love love it!!!!</li>
            <li>I was really impressed, I have super oily skin</li>
            <li>The foundation went on nice and smooth, and it had excellent coverage.</li>
            <li>The coverage is great, it feels very light in my skin, and it makes me look like I&#x27;m glowing.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth and great coverage.  </li>
            <li>I got this product through a bzzagent campaign and im very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this makeup.</li>
            <li>It lasted most of the day and looked great on camera.</li>
            <li>Love that it lasts all day!</li>
            <li>I use this and love it!</li>
            <li>I love how it looks!</li>
            <li>How can I not be pleased!</li>
            <li>It also lasts all day while I am at work,l which can be up to 10 hours or more in a day!</li>
            <li>It makes me look like I&#x27;m wearing a better version of my own skin, which is all you can ask for!</li>
            <li>It made my skin look great and more importantly, feel great.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this foundation!  </li>
            <li>I also love that it has 20 SPF!</li>
            <li>I love this foundation!</li>
            <li>I got this one thru Bzzagent and fell in love!</li>
            <li>Love this makeup!  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Even my husband who notices nothing, saw a difference in how much better my face looked!  </li>
            <li>I love this make up!  </li>
            <li>It looks great, covers well, and is easy to blend.</li>
            <li>At first I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t match my skin tone (I am very fair skin), but it matched great and went on smooth and very light!  </li>
            <li>The tone blends well with skin tone and looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and silky, but does not make you feel oily which is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, an amazing product.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly, made my skin feel great &amp; lasted all day -</li>
            <li>It goes on light feeling but it gives great coverage.</li>
            <li>liked the coverage of this make up.</li>
            <li>It is also nice that this product will improve my skin tone and skin condition over time.</li>
            <li>how well I liked it.</li>
            <li>My opinions of the product are 100% my own.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this concealer.  </li>
            <li>but a pump would have been nice.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I forget I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li>The tone blended nicely</li>
            <li>I was given a sample of this make up, but the words and thoughts are my own.</li>
            <li>I liked that it made my skin look healthier</li>
            <li>but it does have a nice even coverage.</li>
            <li>I also felt like the foundation gave me a nice glow without being so dewy that I felt I needed a powder as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Neutrogena Healthy Skin makeup for about 8 years and have always loved it.</li>
            <li>I felt like this product had many good qualities</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m used to foundations not matching, but it would still be nice to see this made in a lighter shade.</li>
            <li>And, honestly, it went on and stayed on just as well as UD.  </li>
            <li>I have not had much of an issue with it rubbing off on my scarves or jackets this winter, which is great since I often forget I am wearing it!</li>
            <li>But I am loving how it wears during the day.  </li>
            <li>It smoothed on nicely and evened out nicely.</li>
            <li>but once it is rubbed in, it seems very light and smooth maintaining awesome full coverage!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was very easy to apply with a makeup sponge and it was a light, non-greasy texture that feels great on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and even, and feels light on your skin while providing really great coverage.  </li>
            <li>do* use it, I want something that is fairly easy to work with and, obviously, a good color match.</li>
            <li>but I found it to be quite nice, smooth and good coverage for me</li>
            <li>but I found it to be quite nice, smooth and good coverage for me</li>
            <li>and I could not be more pleased with a product!</li>
            <li>When I first applied this makeup, I was impressed with how easily it blended and covered well.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments saying that I look like I am glowing, how nice my skin looks, etc.</li>
            <li>I liked how it covered better than the Glow Sheers, but I didn&#x27;t feel like I looked cakey or covered in makeup.</li>
            <li>It looked natural and flawless.</li>
            <li>but this product is even smoother than my old product and it is awesome that it has sunscreen built into it for the winter months when  I forget to apply the sun lotion!</li>
            <li>I am surprised to say how happy I am with this product!</li>
            <li>I wore it the first day and was impressed on how light weight it was but was concerned that it wasn&#x27;t going to hold up to its LongWear promise -but</li>
            <li>The first thing that impressed me was how smoothly it went on.</li>
            <li>: it goes on smooth, stays on all day and continues to look good, it feels very light on my skin, there is a good selection of shades and it is readily available at stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am happy to say it just blended right in.</li>
            <li>The coverage is great, and the color blends right into my skin.  </li>
            <li>Overall, great foundation with great coverage.  </li>
            <li>A wider hole at the top would make it near perfect !</li>
            <li>have normal skin, but I&#x27;m very fair and have freckles.  </li>
            <li>and I just loved it right away!  </li>
            <li>This foundation goes on light and easy and has amazing coverage!</li>
            <li>I just love that you really don&#x27;t even feel it, plus you can feel that it is still moisturizing and that all the minerals and soy feel so good on the skin!</li>
            <li>Even after wearing it all day, it still looked great just like when I first applied it in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I am incredibly fair and my skin is cool</li>
            <li>I love this makeup - it goes on easy and lets skin breathe!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel it did anything for my fine lines!</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and evenly with just my fingers.</li>
            <li>It is very light weight.</li>
            <li>The makeup is also very light and airy which allows skin to breathe and not feel like tons of makeup is caked on.</li>
            <li>It has SPF20 what is very important for me.</li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my skin feel, and it is very light and feels like nothing on my skin.  </li>
            <li>The texture is very smooth and silky so it glides on</li>
            <li>The formula is nice and easy to apply, although I did find that the foundation settled into lines towards the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and blends incredibly nicely to my skin-tone.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample from bzzagent and absolutely love this makeup!</li>
            <li>stays on, great coverage and super light.  </li>
            <li>but i am so happy I got the opportunity with this particular product!)</li>
            <li>looked huge!</li>
            <li>so she asked me to buy more for her</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena</li>
            <li>However, I found that with each use I am having more and more difficulty getting the product out.</li>
            <li>i love it and will be buying again.</li>
            <li>I seem to get better concealment of scarring from mineral makeups than this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>am so glad a tried this product.</li>
            <li>and I hope it will look even better as summer arrives.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will buy it in the future.</li>
            <li>I love that it has sunscreen as well.</li>
            <li>Except that I do think my face looks better.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena products and continue to use them.  </li>
            <li>I love this liquid makeup.  </li>
            <li>There is no need to reapply on your lunch break, just put it on in the morning and still have the same flawless look at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>The color that I got was Warm Beige its just a tab bit to light</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this product and will definitely buy it.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Like most women over 35, I have imperfect skin.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this foundation and even more amazing that I got to try it free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this is that it has SPF.</li>
            <li>but once it was blended it felt more like my mineral makeup.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really pleased that the foundation has SPF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that is</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has 20 SPF but unsure of how it would feel on my skin during warmer months.</li>
            <li>It claims to improve your skin after a month of use, and I do feel my skin has been more even and smoother</li>
            <li>I love the longwear.</li>
            <li>so you a lot more of the product comes out then you want.</li>
            <li>and I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is a great quality product for a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>I love that the bottle is glass</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I was a skeptic.</li>
            <li>Overall, I have been very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product out</li>
            <li>It is better than any drug store foundation I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>It also contains vitamins A, C &amp; E, which as we all know is helpful for healthy skin.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love it, but it just didnt work.</li>
            <li>I love this formula.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with the make up and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it for free from BzzAgent but its retail price is amazing value for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how this foundation held up trough out the day, it&#x27;s not greasy or runny.</li>
            <li>The product went on so smoothly and evenly and covered all my problem areas!</li>
            <li>it really lasted all day and had great coverage!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t like the feel of most foundations.  </li>
            <li>Most foundations that I&#x27;ve used before disappear on my skin within an hour.  </li>
            <li>It works a lot like BB cream, with my skin looking more evenly-toned, but not \\&quot;painted,\\&quot; after application.</li>
            <li>I think it would be better suited as a spring/summer foundation, though, because the tint would be a no-brainer if I got some color.</li>
            <li>It really provides great coverage, covering up my skin&#x27;s imperfections without looking cakey.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product it gives you full coverage blends out evenly</li>
            <li>That worked much better.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of blemishes on my forehead, so it would be nice to enjoy the benefits of the foundation where I need it most.</li>
            <li>I have found with most liquid make up</li>
            <li>I have been using Clinique Even Better Wear for about 3 years now.</li>
            <li>The foundation tends to sit on top of the skin, no matter how well I blend.</li>
            <li>so I switched that to make sure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really love how well this one matched my skintone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made sure to moisturize and then used a blending sponge in this picture, skipping primer or BB cream.</li>
            <li>And I love that it already has SPF 20 in it.</li>
            <li>Tends to feel like it&#x27;s sitting on top of the skin instead of blending into it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made sure to moisturize and then used a blending sponge in this picture, skipping primer or BB cream.</li>
            <li>And I love that it already has SPF 20 in it.</li>
            <li>Tends to feel like it&#x27;s sitting on top of the skin instead of blending into it.</li>
            <li>After using this product for about 3 weeks I have to say that my face looks more even-</li>
            <li>but I can already tell that my skin is looking better.  </li>
            <li>Before, by midday I was alway reaching for more powder or for blotting papers.</li>
            <li>so I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with this foundation</li>
            <li>I am glad that I am able to try out this product being a BZZZAgent.</li>
            <li>I love the feel and the fact it kept me from looking shiny.</li>
            <li>The brand Neutrogena is great in itself and doesn&#x27;t really need any help, but I give a thumbs up to this product.</li>
            <li>I am sure that will annoy me much more when I get through more and more of it</li>
            <li>more even skin color</li>
            <li>I find this foundation ok.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great foundation for the budget buyer!</li>
            <li>I would love however to try a shade a tad lighter.</li>
            <li>It also has a smooth,  nice finish that isn&#x27;t cakey.  </li>
            <li>All in all - I enjoyed this makeup and am having my daughter try it as well</li>
            <li>I also find that it gives great coverage and makes your skin feel much cleaner and fresher.</li>
            <li>I love the longevity of this makeup and it does not rub off on clothes, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did because it changed the perception I have of drugstore makeup brands.</li>
            <li>When my shift was over I was sure my coverage would be as well.</li>
            <li>I will buy more.</li>
            <li>It has great coverage and blends right in to my skin tone, it feels smooth</li>
            <li>It was a perfect match to my skin colour and it looks barely noticeable and completely natural while providing great coverage and evening my skin tone and flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product was true to it&#x27;s skin tone, and I love it!</li>
            <li>However, if that turns out to be true, then even better!</li>
            <li>I am always changing my foundation because I enjoy trying new products and finding the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; product that both makes me look good and feel good.</li>
            <li>As I applied, I was worried that I got a shade too dark but it smoothed out nicely and blended with my skin perfectly so that I didn&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
            <li>(she is 14 years old) because it also seems to be very safe and very much good for your skin.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day long and evens out my skintone beautifully!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>All I am covering is some pores and it has worked pretty good for me.</li>
            <li>It is a nice full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I found this!</li>
            <li>I love how easily it glides onto the skin and how well it blends with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>And although, I don&#x27;t use it everyday, I know it&#x27;s doing wonders for my skin and that it makes me look beautiful and makes me feel amazing!</li>
            <li>It blends well with a nice color and it stays light and smooth on the skin throughout the day.</li>
            <li>As a BzzAgent, I received a free sample of this makeup and was able to compare it to my favorite CC cream.  </li>
            <li>It feels very smooth and light on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It feels very smooth and light on my skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this great value and super product to everyone!</li>
            <li>I think it settles in my fine lines a bit, but I think with a better shade it will resolve the issue.  </li>
            <li>This makeup went on smooth and easy- felt very light weight on my face.</li>
            <li>I love how I dont even realize im wearing it because its so light.</li>
            <li>It gives me such a nice glow and looks so nice with eye makeup!</li>
            <li>This lasts all day without drying my face out or becoming oily.</li>
            <li>I received this as a free sample from bzzagent and I am so glad I decided to give it a go.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free from Bzz Agent, and I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li>I was using their Healthy Skin Glow Sheers when I got a free bottle of this to try out through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I love how light this foundation is.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, I need something that still lets my skin &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li>I love how silky and smooth it goes on my skin as well.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this product - the coverage was great (not streaky or cakey) and the color match was spot on.  </li>
            <li>Free is even better</li>
            <li>This is especially true if I use too much.</li>
            <li>Surprising how much I ended up liking it.</li>
            <li>would recommend this foundation to someone who is looking for a good drugstore makeup at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>skin was kind of blah looking with it, no glow or fresh look to</li>
            <li>You really have to give it a good shake.  </li>
            <li>It feels great, light, and airy on the skin...very soft!</li>
            <li>So glad I got to try this complimentary from BzzAgent!</li>
            <li>I just wish it was a bit more matte because I still had to put powder on top of it, but overall this is a really nice addition to a makeup collection!</li>
            <li>this product is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It went on easy.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to remove.</li>
            <li>I prefer bottles that squeeze, or glass bottles with a pump, because I can get the product out easily.</li>
            <li>This foundation actually makes my skin look and feel great, unlike most liquid foundations.</li>
            <li>It smooths on easily and blends in well.</li>
            <li>: Easy to match&lt;br /&gt;Not drying or oily</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, odorless, and added bonus of SPF.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to get out of the bottle and apply.  </li>
            <li>but it just needs to be blended very quickly.</li>
            <li>I did notice that if I wiped my mouth or blew my nose, the makeup rubbed off easily on the napkin/tissue.</li>
            <li>It lasts through my 12-14 hour work days and blends easily.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the SPF 20, especially being a fair skinned person, because this is just nice to have in any foundation since it will eliminate a step in your routine.</li>
            <li>I loved the light texture of this make up, it has great coverage without being heavy.</li>
            <li>Its coverage is impeccable and long lasting, and the color matches my tone perfectly.</li>
            <li>It is nice and light, while create great coverage for acne, redness, and other skin problems.</li>
            <li>It  blends really easily and feels lightweight and smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li>in fact, it is slightly matte, which is great for my combination skin!</li>
            <li>However, half-way through the day, I noticed it was settling into my fine lines around my eyes, and my crease in my forehead</li>
            <li>Also, the color is a perfect match with my typically hard-to-match skin tone.</li>
            <li>The light-diffusing powders camouflage imperfections and mask fine lines.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Tends to settle into fine lines</li>
            <li>Anyway, the application was easy, the foundation blended well, and went on evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>It went on easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to fall into my fine lines either like</li>
            <li>I have also happily noticed that my skin appears smoother and more even after applying the NEUTROGENA® Nourishing Long Wear Makeup .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This make-up also feels very natural and seems to stay put fairly well.  </li>
            <li>With this long wear makeup, I&#x27;m good to go, even for drinks after work!</li>
            <li>It looked much better on my face and blended beautifully though I think I could have gone one shade lighter due to winter</li>
            <li>My skin looked absolutely flawless and a little bit shiny</li>
            <li>It is supposed to improve tone and texture of your skin in as little as four weeks while leaving you with wonderful even coverage.</li>
            <li>I have to be careful because I am very fair skinned</li>
            <li>Which is huge for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t a lot of color options, but they all seem to blend nicely with just about any skin tone, so the quality of the actual makeup is amazing.  </li>
            <li>a pump would make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now a huge fan of Neutrogena</li>
            <li>My skin&#x27;s health and appearance are a huge priority to me</li>
            <li>The coverage is light but still enough to cover what you want covered,and it feels great.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth and soft and the color is dewy and bright.</li>
            <li>It  gives my face great coverage without looking all caked up and allows my skin to breathe and lasts the entire day!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this makeup.</li>

            <li>The coverage on this is lighter than with the covergirl foundation, so if you are looking for really heavy coverage this may not be the best bet for you.</li>
            <li>I have perfect looking skin and the few things that I have like puffy eyes and circles under them</li>
            <li>It goes on really lightly and not oily at all-</li>

            <li>It really would be better if the bottle were designed with a pump on top instead of the screw-top.</li>
            <li>After struggling to get the foundation out it went on nice and smooth and felt very lightweight.</li>
            <li>So honestly, I did not feel all that comfortable leaving the house with it, because it doesn&#x27;t really match my skin.</li>
            <li>I really liked the way this smoothed on my skin, did not feel cakey, and left me with a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>You cannot get the full amount as the liquid does not get out of it easily AT ALL.  </li>
            <li>I saw results by the end of my first night wearing it!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was excited to try this foundation and got to try it for free because I&#x27;m a BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get a free sample of this makeup, given all the claims it makes about its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>But I received this a trial and the packaging was nice, the product was fragance free, and high quality.</li>
            <li>At first I had a very smooth and even coverage.</li>
            <li>The product goes on smooth with a clean finish that leaves my skin glowing.  </li>
            <li>I love the feel, it&#x27;s very silky and super light!</li>
            <li>It does last all day, as it claims, and also even put skin tone, provides good coverage, and applies easy and smooth.</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t have high hopes.</li>
            <li>I have found my new favorite :)</li>
            <li>Pretty good!&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad to be a @bzzagent</li>
            <li>It does a great job at evening out my skin and covering minor redness and marks.</li>
            <li>It is light and airy, while also providing full coverage.</li>
            <li>I wish I didn&#x27;t need another product (face primer) to use this product, but I&#x27;m so happy with the color match and the staying power that I think I will keep wearing Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to be able to sample this as a Bzz Agent and it felt amazing.  </li>
            <li>Full disclosure: I received this as a free sample from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>but I am really excited about this</li>
            <li>it goes on so smooth and evened out my skin tone and lasted the full 12 hrs for me.</li>
            <li>I had the chance to try out a sample of this foundation, and I was really excited to test it out.</li>
            <li>I received a full bottle of this product from BzzAgent to try for free.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use a primer first and the coverage was more that of a tinted moisturizer than that of a foundation.  </li>
            <li>I got this from bzz agent to test and was really excited to try it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li>The lightest shade is a good march for my fair skin tone, but it has a bit of a yellow undertone whereas I feel my skin is more pink, but it was easily blended into my skin.</li>
            <li>The color is a little darker than I would have liked, but it matched fairly well anyway</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super light.</li>
            <li>I received a bottle of this product from BzzAgent but will be buying my next bottle soon and definitely recommend for something light and easy that feels and looks great!</li>
            <li>Also it was great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I am lucky to have received this product free for review as a buzz agent.</li>
            <li>Also it was great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>With that said, I am loving the light, silky coverage that this foundation offers.</li>
            <li>My first impressions of the product were that I was really pleased that it was fair enough for my skin.</li>
            <li>It is very light, and blends in very well.</li>
            <li>it is very light weight and stays on very well.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and you don&#x27;t really need a lot.</li>
            <li>I think Neutrogena got it just right!</li>
            <li>pleased.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency and finish are right on par with my luxury foundations!</li>
            <li>I play roller derby which is an extremely athletic and challenging sport, that has the cool side that we also like to look good while we&#x27;re playing.</li>
            <li>Classic Ivory was a great match for my skin tone and it looked and felt natural.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great as an every day foundation, has a broad spectrum SPF in it, and is very affordable.</li>
            <li>and I always have a hard time finding a make-up color that matches my skin, but this blended perfectly.</li>
            <li>As a BzzAgent, I was super excited when I got to try this out.</li>
            <li>I received this product as a BzzAgent, and was super excited to receive and share my opinions on the newest Neutrogena</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a long time user of the Cover Girl Oil Control foundation and have had great success with it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and wears long, I also loved that it has sunscreen in it, so it saves me a step in the summer.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of covering my red splotches on my face and really helps with my circles under my eyes!</li>
            <li>It did a great job of covering that redness with minimal amount of product.</li>
            <li>It did a great job of covering that redness with minimal amount of product.</li>
            <li>It covers blemishes beautifully and really does last all day.</li>
            <li>I will have to continue using this foundation for a couple more weeks in order to really tell if it&#x27;s the cause of my breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received a full size sample of this product from Bzzagent.com</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t need a lot of the product to get full coverage.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed a difference in skin tone or texture, but it has not been the full four weeks</li>
            <li>I was chosen by BzzAgent to try this product and they sent me a full bottle to sample.  </li>
            <li>It has a light fresh feeling and stays put.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I can get good coverage without it being obvious that I&#x27;m wearing foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This foundation goes on smooth, blends well and leaves my skin feeling fresh and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I did a side by side comparison with makeup and without to see the full transformation.</li>
            <li>After I received my sample and it wasn&#x27;t a good color, I ventured out to find a paler shade at my local Ulta.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup - a nice natural look.</li>
            <li>However, I thought it was worth a shot since I got to try it for free from bzzagent.  </li>
            <li>I love the coverage of this foundation, but I really wish I could use it on my forehead.</li>
            <li>But overall, it is a good drugstore foundation.</li>
            <li>But, I still loved the opportunity to try this and will be likely to pass this on to someone else this shade.</li>
            <li>I am a BzzAgent and was sent a full size sample of this product to try and then review.</li>
            <li>Still, it didn&#x27;t have the coverage I was used to, but I really liked the natural look it gave</li>
            <li>The color matched fairly well, and the coverage did last all day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this foundation is a winner, especially if you get a good matching one.</li>
            <li>Good makeup overall.</li>
            <li>The makeup lasts about 8 hours which is not bad for my skin type.</li>
            <li>Overall I liked the makeup and would probably like it more if it were the right shade for me.</li>
            <li>It filled in without caking up and cover the dark circles which makes me super happy.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re looking for a long wear makeup, it is especially important to find the right one for you.</li>
            <li>This neutrogena went on smooth and was easy to apply and I really like how the color blended.</li>
            <li>I got it in the lightest shade available (Classic Ivory) and while it looked very peachy as a swatch, it did blend out fairly nicely.</li>
            <li>I have pink undertones and most foundations are too cool or too orange for me whereas this Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear was a PERFECT match for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Not only does it go on smooth and blend naturally, but it really does stay and keep its awesome flawlessness.  </li>
            <li>I am starting to get fine lines, which my daughter loves to so honestly point out.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin, so while it doesn&#x27;t last a full 12 hrs, it still holds out better than most.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The coverage is pretty much perfect as it evens my skin tone without totally blocking out my natural colors</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;d give this an excellent rating and I&#x27;d definitely use it again.</li>
            <li>I have combination Skin so in the summer my T Zone get super oily.</li>
            <li>I quickly lose interest in them, because I don&#x27;t want to be reapplying hour after hour or even worrying that my make up will disappear.  </li>
            <li>I have super oily skin so by about hour 3</li>
            <li>It would definitely be helpful to expand the range of tones to better match more skin tones.</li>
            <li>The color is good, the makeup itself is kind of thick.</li>
            <li>The foundation also blended very easily (I use my fingers to apply) and looked natural-</li>
            <li>It rubs right into my skin and dare I say -- feels soft and nice.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover dry skin as well as I would like, but if you scrub your skin and get it really fresh, the coverage is impeccable.</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty smoothly, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m covered in glop.</li>
            <li>Correcting the skin tones and evening them out is something I’m very interested in.</li>
            <li>So it really is a good long wear foundation.</li>
            <li>I got this for free from Bzz Agent, and was very happy with how well the shade matched my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely need to give the bottle a good shake to mix it up before applying, but the coverage is decent, and it absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t have that sticky heavy feeling that other make-ups</li>
            <li>I will have to say I am not the best at wearing or applying makeup, but mainly because everything I purchase is either to heavy, cakey, or makes me break out.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Neutrogena and BzzAgent for the full sized sample!)</li>
            <li>hard to match yellowy, greenish undertone skin is perfectly suited to the classic ivory shade, and my skin doesn&#x27;t have that cheap drugstore product look,</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite foundation</li>
            <li>I do love also the included SPF as I do live in Florida and get quite a lot son here.  </li>
            <li>in all, this is officially my new favorite concealer.</li>
            <li>I notice a slight bit of oiliness after 12+ hours of wear, but the makeup doesn&#x27;t seem to crease or cake and still looks great.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, I like that is product is easy to dispense and that it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I loved the all-day coverage and it didn&#x27;t make my face feel oily or dry.  </li>
            <li>It does though provide great full coverage, I just had to lighten mine with a powder foundation to make it wearable, since it made my face a few shades darker than my body color.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for the first time thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>rich soy smoothes and refines age spots and discolorations; Vitamins A, C &amp; E nourish skin and brighten skin tones; Light diffusing powders camouflage imperfections and mask fine lines; and Broad spectrum SPF 20 protects your skin from the sun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Neutrogena promised \\&quot;Anti-oxidant rich soy smoothes and refines age spots and discolorations; Vitamins A, C &amp; E nourish skin and brighten skin tones; Light diffusing powders camouflage imperfections and mask fine lines; and Broad spectrum SPF 20 protects your skin from the sun.\\</li>
            <li>I really like how this made my skin feel and look!!</li>
            <li>When  I first got it, I was excited by the glass bottle.  </li>
            <li>but I was excited to try a liquid foundation as I haven&#x27;t had much experience with this type!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this to every lady who wants to feel beautiful without having to wear too much.</li>
            <li>My skin stayed soft smooth and easy to wear and breath.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne, so coverage is very important.</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s not as light, it certain does provide coverage without looking like I have layers of product on my face.  </li>
            <li>Pro&#x27;s: Affordable, good quality, fine, highly pigmented, reasonably long wearing.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of coverage, blends easily, and really is long-wearing.</li>
            <li>It works great under my eyes to cover up the bags and dark lines that I can get sometimes!  </li>
            <li>This foundation dries quickly which is great, so I can apply my powder sooner and don&#x27;t need to worry about a sticky mess!</li>
            <li>This is also nice because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent like you get with other foundations.</li>
            <li>I had no issue in covering up any uneven skin tones on my face, though I do not suffer greatly in that area nor do I have any acne issues.</li>
            <li>It does go on really smooth and blends really well.</li>
            <li>I had no issue in covering up any uneven skin tones on my face, though I do not suffer greatly in that area nor do I have any acne issues.</li>
            <li>I love that it offers protection from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays while covering up imperfections on my face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this foundation is worth a try.</li>
            <li>It went on pretty dark (I got the natural beige), but because I put it on over ELF mineral primer and shook it for a couple of minutes before I used it, it went on perfectly.</li>
            <li>and it did a pretty good job of covering up minor acney.</li>
            <li>It evened out my skin for the most part, but blemishes were still clearly visible and needed additional concealing.</li>
            <li>This foundation had both pros and cons that are worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I love it so far.</li>
            <li>This foundation goes on nice and smooth, and really does last all day.</li>
            <li>So far, so smooth!</li>
            <li>Possibly if it were in a squeeze bottle or a pump it might be nice.</li>
            <li>I wonder if part of my success in application was that I had just moisturized.</li>
            <li>I apply it with a sponge applicator because I like a thinner application of foundation for a more natural look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using a deluxe sample I received for under a week, but I have to say I am impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have since made sure that I do not put any of this foundation directly on any creases (or use a primer)</li>
            <li>but I still think it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li>far I have been pleased.  </li>
            <li>But I would say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>My skin is pretty normal and usually cheap foundations make it oily!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light-weight, easy to apply, looks very natural and lasts all day!</li>
            <li>The other foundation I have been using had good coverage, but would get greasy looking in my smile creases by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend if you want a clean, light foundation!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend if you want a clean, light foundation!</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product at a decent price.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Long Wear Foundation is fabulous!!</li>
            <li>just all right.</li>
            <li>so you can choose what is right for you.</li>
            <li>Blends right in.</li>
            <li>When I put it on I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>and I still haven&#x27;t found one that&#x27;s JUST RIGHT.</li>
            <li>I had some brownish look spots on my cheeks because I wear always sunglasses and right under where the sunglasses stop</li>
            <li>and this was the right solution.</li>
            <li>I have to mention again that I moisturize right</li>
            <li>The consistency of the liquid is just about right</li>
            <li>I am a sign waver for a company right now and applied the coverage before my 3 hour shift.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try the Nourishing Long Wear makeup and was kind of hoping it would be the same as the Healthy Skin makeup but with longer wear time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to try NEUTROGENA® Nourishing Long Wear Makeup for free from BzzAgent</li>
            <li>I wore this for the first time last week and really liked it.</li>
            <li>Good coverage and non-drying (unusual for a long wear liquid make-up).</li>
            <li>I would recommend Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear makeup because it’s a great blend of long lasting and good coverage.</li>
            <li>The makeup looks a bit orange in fluorescent light but seems to match my skin much better in natural light, interestingly enough.</li>
            <li>and I have used bare minerals mostly</li>
            <li>I have really been surprised I liked this as much as I do.</li>
            <li>The color was slightly dark for me, but I think it&#x27;ll be a good match for my tanned summer skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used and liked Neutrogena products for a long time now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really liked how long wearing this makeup is while its not damaging my skin.</li>
            <li>I always get excited to try new makeup!</li>
            <li>I do tend to have more sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts in certain areas.</li>
            <li>but this will match up much better as I get a little more vitamin D from the sun</li>
            <li>I recently got this product from BzzAgent and after using it for less than a week, I am already pretty impressed!</li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to try New Neutrogena Nourishing Long-Wear Makeup from BzzAgent for free.</li>
            <li>In any event, I was given the opportunity to try New Neutrogena Nourishing Long-Wear Makeup from BzzAgent for #free.</li>
            <li>It was more coverage than I need, it felt more like stage makeup than everyday foundation.</li>
            <li>I just mix a few drops with my daily face lotion and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product to anyone that is looking for full coverage but that still feels light and looks natural!!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like most women, having the right foundation is key to putting a makeup look together.</li>
            <li>I received the warm beige 90 which is the darkest color they have unfortunately because I need something with a warm copper tint not beige for it to look more natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge makeup hoarder, and am always trying new foundations never really being thrilled with any of them.</li>
            <li>This is certainly a product worth trying.</li>
            <li>I am always open to trying new things and am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>The foundation initially goes on a little sticky, but once you smooth it out, it creates a great matte finish.</li>
            <li>The foundation initially goes on a little sticky, but once you smooth it out, it creates a great matte finish.</li>
            <li>Once they redesign the packaging/bottle I would be willing to try it again.</li>
            <li>would recommend this foundation for people who want to even skin tone, but don&#x27;t necessarily need to hide many scars or blemishes.</li>
            <li>it looks exactly like it did when I put it on in the morning.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t describe in what way exactly except even, I suppose.</li>
            <li>I got this product as part of a free sampling, and I was definitely surprised at</li>
            <li>I have been using the Covergirl long-wear foundation, but this definitely feel better on my skin.</li>
            <li>I really have iffy on drugstore foundations, but this works!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looking forward to seeing if continued use really evens out the tone of my skin!</li>
            <li>I did not wear foundation consistently before being on this campaign.</li>
            <li>The foundation feels smooth and not heavy on your skin.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena and this definitely fits their brand.</li>
            <li>It just leaves my skin feeling like there wasn&#x27;t that much on it to begin with!</li>
            <li>I did need to use concealer for my some specific problem areas, but I expect that from most any</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky!</li>
            <li>so I was pretty concerned about how it would match, but it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would compare this to higher end brands, like Benefit.</li>
            <li>I bounce back and forth between the ski clearing foundation and healthy skin.</li>
            <li>I switched brands and started using MAC and became an avid user of their pro longwear foundation.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ve got one happy, sexy looking derby player who totally believes in Long lasting coverage!</li>
            <li>Thanks Nuetrogena!</li>
            <li>When I first applied the Neutrogena</li>
            <li>the first time I applied this foundation, I already noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>My skin is completely breathable, and feels light.</li>
            <li>But it does last most of the day, as promised.</li>
            <li>The first time out of the bottle, I just evenly applied it all over my face, just as I did with my powder.</li>
            <li>The foundation felt light on my skin, and I thought it had a natural look.  </li>
            <li>It definitely has better coverage than my powder does, and its still feels pretty light and looks natural.</li>
            <li>As women we many times find a product we like and stick with it unless it suddenly isn&#x27;t being made anymore.</li>
            <li>It made my skin look healthy and it actually helped by also moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li>other then that i love it!</li>
            <li>But this stayed on thru a 9 hour work shift and the even tone of my skin was evident.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely use it more in the summer but</li>
            <li>I will surely buy this product in the future</li>
            <li>Also, as a person that does not reapply makeup, I was pleased with the lasting effects of my morning application.</li>
            <li>and I am pretty sure I have finally found the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It really did even out my skin tone!</li>
            <li>I feel that it’s a great balance of the two, without being too thick.</li>
            <li>It was smooth and even, not heavy</li>
            <li>I kept checking through the day and it held up pretty well.</li>
            <li>The second time, I used my Smashbox silicone primer with it and the results were better.  </li>
            <li>so I can actually get it out of the bottle (this would be more hygienic, too).</li>
            <li>so thanks Neutrogena!</li>
            <li>I was given a free trial in Natural Ivory.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As women we many times find a product we like and stick with it unless it suddenly isn&#x27;t being made anymore.</li>
            <li>I really like this foundation!</li>
            <li>The first day I wore it I kept getting compliments on my skin and everyone kept asking me if I had gotten a tan.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says....</li>
            <li>This stuff actually stays where it is supposed to and makes my skin look so smooth!</li>
            <li>I bought this product to try something new after using L&#x27;Oréal True Match for years.</li>
            <li>It was suitable for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, as the day wore on, I noticed pretty early that the foundation was settling into fine lines and pores in a way that was very unflattering.</li>
            <li>My skin does not look fake or caked on, it actually looks great, very nice and clear.</li>
            <li>Toward the afternoon, with a quick application of powder it looks like new.</li>
            <li>In all honesty, I&#x27;ve not worn much foundation in my life and have kept my makeup regimen to mostly eye shadow, mascara, blush, lip gloss and occasionally a bronzer.</li>
            <li>I always viewed it as something that would make me look fake and painted and surely wouldn&#x27;t be any good for my skin.</li>
            <li>I enjoy trying out new makeup products, so I was excited when I received the new Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup in the mail for free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I checked a few times throughout the day to make sure it still looked the same and it sure did!</li>
            <li>favorite part is that the Nourishing Long Wear Foundation lasts ALL day.</li>
            <li>I love the Long Wear Liquid Make-UP.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup worked better for me than all others.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I gave Neutrogena&#x27;s Long Wear Liquid Foundation a try.</li>
            <li>It is so light and airy and barely feels like you have anything on.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I had the chance to try this product and see what I was missing out on.</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed using my Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-Up.  </li>
            <li>Most &#x27;long wear&#x27; products just don&#x27;t work as well as they advertise.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s pretty much as advertised.</li>
            <li>I also love the long wear aspect and that it has a sunscreen included in it.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised as to how much I liked the Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Foundation!</li>
            <li>I have only used it a couple of days so far, but as of right now, im in love.</li>
            <li>The only place I noticed them was right above my nose where the foundation kind of makes them noticeable.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried when I got it that it would be too dark, but it&#x27;s a perfect match!</li>
            <li>It covers up blemishes and red spots and overall makes my skin feel more clear and healthy.</li>
            <li>I also mix it occasionally with my daily facial lotion and that proves to be a great tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>When I got Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Foundation to try through BzzAgent, I was super excited to see if it could stand up to the the literal beating I sometimes take.  </li>
            <li>Love the neutrogena long wear foundation!</li>
            <li>I love the coverage, the feel and how long it lasts!</li>
            <li>Fourth, I like that is product is easy to dispense.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have dry skin issues, it&#x27;s probably much better.</li>
            <li>but I have better luck with my normal brand lasting longer.</li>
            <li>This is perhaps better suited to darker skin tones and people without dry patches.</li>
            <li>This item went on smoothly and did not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>This one, however, has the staying power to last all day and still be easy to remove at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the price difference is so large.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am always hesitant to try a new foundation because I am worried I will not select the right color</li>
            <li>It is light, looks natural and literally made my blackheads (on my nose) disappear by covering them completely naturally!  </li>
            <li>My face would get very flaky and almost patchy/orange in certain (drier)</li>
            <li>The coverage is better than most other foundations I have tried and it really does last longer than most other foundations.  </li>
            <li>I love liquid foundation more than other types of foundation, so Neutrogena nourishing long wear makeup already had that going for it.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and it is hard to find foundation to match my skin color, along with rosacea.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding foundations that match my fair skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to wear a lot of make up, especially foundation, but I have to say, I&#x27;m a huge fan of this Neutrogena foundation.</li>
            <li>Overall I think this makeup does a great job of blending, covering any uneven color or blemishes and not wearing off.</li>
            <li>It felt light on my skin and did last my whole day.</li>
            <li>I actually wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of this and it pains me to admire that</li>
            <li>It matches my skin tine really well</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s the foundation or not.</li>
            <li>This foundation is very think</li>
            <li>Also, very lightweight in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It feels much lighter on the skin than it looks in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Fifth, I like that it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m really upset by the packaging.  </li>
            <li>That being said once in a while i like to just paint my whole face</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>I also really like the look and feel of the foundation.</li>
            <li>so I can squeeze out as much as I need without wasting it.</li>
            <li>As a bzzagent I got it free and got coupons, but am unsure if I will buy in the future.</li>
            <li>I expected more from this brand, and with &amp;#34;Nourishing&amp;#34; in the product title I thought I would get it.</li>
            <li>did not expect to like this foundation as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>I found that it really did improve the tone and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>This product was great, it goes on thin</li>
            <li>It matches really well and lasted all day.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this foundation</li>
            <li>It smooths just enough to smooth out my complexion</li>
            <li>I really like this foundation.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>This makeup really does do what it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, but really evens out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a melting mousse, really, that comes out in gobs.</li>
            <li>Given the price and how much I had to work with it</li>
            <li>As with all makeup, really, YMMV.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The color I received matches my skin tone very well, and</li>
            <li>Lastly I really like how well the coverage is, it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to do my whole face and it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve got caked</li>
            <li>has really helped even it out.</li>
            <li>Plus, I really trust the Neutrogena brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like Neutrogena products</li>
            <li>this make-up did not cover it very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear much make-up.</li>
            <li>But this product was gentle on my skin and it didn&#x27;t cause any skin issues.</li>
            <li>My skin was primed and ready to accept the foundation.</li>
            <li>I really like this foundation.</li>
            <li>The color DID match my skin very well, however.</li>
            <li>It lasts and it really evens out my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like that it has a built in sun screen as well.</li>
            <li>and I feel like it is a very buildable feel.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really light and fairly sheer for a foundation, I always forget i&#x27;m wearing it when I have it on!</li>
            <li>, my face is very oily and there was no difference in using this foundation...</li>
            <li>my skin was still very oily at the end of the day but the makeup still lasted.</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing came off on my napkin during a dinner-time mouth dab.</li>
            <li>and you really couldn&#x27;t tell I was wearing it.</li>
            <li>It really will control oil for 12 hours, and it leaves your skin with a glowy, not greasy, finish.</li>
            <li>I’m looking forward to seeing this on my skin as I use it over the next month, since I struggle with smooth and even-toned skin.</li>
            <li>You either get nothing, or way too much -just like a ketchup bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a few minute though, it kind of evened out.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really liked this makeup especially the color range.</li>
            <li>Nice if you want to use it for pictures of something that you only want to wear it a short time.</li>
            <li>The foundation is so thick that it takes a good deal of time and patience just trying to extract it from the bottle.  </li>
            <li>As it stands right now, though, I enjoyed this product enough that I will be purchasing it in the future.</li>
            <li>I love the new Neutrogena nourishing Long Wear Make-Up.  </li>
            <li>I really love this new long wear makeup from Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different kinds in the past and none of them really covered my blackheads effectively, and certainly didn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was hard to get the perfect amount out due to the bottle.  </li>
            <li>This is the first new foundation I have tried in a while.  </li>
            <li>Finally, this product offers a light but complete coverage - I have lots of small imperfections and blotches on my face, and this makeup is great at evening them out</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing that makes this super special, other than that it gives some UV sun protection.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a pretty good foundation, it’s not too heavy</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than the other foundations I have tried.</li>
            <li>However, that is a very minor issue and easily overlooked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally a non-irritating full coverage makeup that stays put the whole day.</li>
            <li>I received Neutrogena&#x27;s long wear foundation in the lightest shade for free thanks to bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li>I wish the bottle had a pump or something to get the product out more easily, but was also surprised at how thick and moisturizing this foundation seems to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to Bzzagent, I got to try this Neutrogena Long Wear Foundation for free</li>
            <li>All in all I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for a light long wear foundation.</li>
            <li>Has reasonable price but quality like high price product.</li>
            <li>I did not like the packaging, a pump would be much better or even a larger opening, thit did not seem large enough to get the product out.</li>
            <li>Definitely try to find your shade in store first before ordering so you can find the right one.</li>
            <li>Liquid Long Wear free to try.</li>
            <li>I received a free bottle of this Long Wear Makeup from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I received Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-up free as a BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>I received Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup for free for participating in a BzzAgent Campaign.</li>
            <li>I received a free bottle of this Long Wear Makeup from BzzAgent</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Long Wear Foundation goes on so light and blends into my skin so well.</li>
            <li>I have been using the neutrogena nourishing long wear foundation in ivory for about 3 weeks, which I received for free through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>this makeup would last the full 12 hours.</li>
            <li>When I did that, my skin looked very dry, and you could easily tell that I was wearing foundation.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to spread it around with your makeup sponge down under your neck and into your hair line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lasts most of the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Have to store bottle upside down for ease of use</li>
            <li>I tend to have pretty decent skin naturally.</li>
            <li>The smooth consistency applies more like a cream than a runny makeup and less goes a long way when covering.</li>
            <li>I really think if this bottle had a pump, it could have been used a little more efficiently which may have changed my review.</li>
            <li>Just found my new foundation!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new go to!</li>
            <li>The foundation is a pretty thick formula, so it really takes some shaking to get things out, especially after you&#x27;ve used a good portion of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Less is more in this case each time.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay put for 12 hours like it says, but it does provide decent coverage.</li>
            <li>It evens out my skin tone, provides decent coverage and brightens my complexion.</li>
            <li>the older</li>
            <li>Overall, the product works well enough, but I&#x27;ve used others that I like better.</li>
            <li>My main goal is oil control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend actually going to the makeup counter and trying the different selection to pick your color to avoid the problem that most of us have been reporting.</li>
            <li>But,  trying this product for over a week now has made me love this more than the expensive products.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than my more expensive dept store brand.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to wear obvious makeup, and though this streakiness was only in areas, it wasn&#x27;t my favorite finish.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it gave me decent coverage</li>
            <li>and I tend to break out with drugstore foundations in particular, and anyone that is oily/acne prone.</li>
            <li>I have only used one other kind of liquid foundation continuously (Mary Kay kind), and I usually stick with cream to powder or the FitMe stick.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to try Long Wear.</li>
            <li>After all, I&#x27;ve tried makeup that&#x27;s made these claims of being lightweight and long lasting with great coverage before with VERY little success.  </li>
            <li>Despite being lightweight, it stays and lasts all day, even in high humidity and heat.</li>
            <li>It feels very light on the skin, unlike some products that feel heavy and goopy.</li>
            <li>So, I had high expectations.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this foundation.</li>
            <li>Granted, I haven&#x27;t yet tried this in the summer when my face is at it&#x27;s shiniest, but I have high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It feels very light on the skin, unlike some products that feel heavy and goopy.</li>
            <li>Other than the above, the product does have a nice texture and coverage.</li>
            <li>The main problems I find with this product is the package--the bottle is attractive, but very difficult to get the product out of it-- and with its best feature--since this product is long lasting, I find myself using several makeup wipes to remove it all and still needing to scrub with an astringent later to get all the color off my face.</li>
            <li>SO I will start off by saying that I have never really worn face makeup, as I have been truly blessed with fair and normal skin, really blemish-free except for the occasional pimple once in a blue moon.</li>
            <li>but my face looks a little more shine than before.</li>
            <li>It is a tad thicker than I am used to, so it takes a little more effort to apply.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a little more than a week</li>
            <li>so well that I will be able to use it no problem even though it is a little darker than I&#x27;d normally wear.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very thick and almost not runny - which is not bad per se, but wanting to get it out of the container is rather challenging, since it doesn&#x27;t come with a pump, it&#x27;s just a bottle.</li>
            <li>I usually have a hard time of finding a perfect match in a drugstore brand but not with this!</li>
            <li>face felt soft and I didn&#x27;t even feel like I was wearing a liquid foundation ore, really, any makeup at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was extremely surprised how much make up was on my face at night when I removed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I applied it every morning before work, after even after a long day, the foundation stayed put on my face and still looked light and natural.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using to see if the promised benefits of evened skin tone come through, but so far-- very</li>
            <li>I also loved how it hid small blemishes on my skin saving me an extra step and not having to use concealor.</li>
            <li>I normally use BB cream, but this has been my go-to every morning since I received it.  </li>
            <li>This product needs to be in a squeeze tube or jar with a larger opening to be really useful.  </li>
            <li>and I dont have to worry about touching my makeup in a few hours</li>
            <li>so a product that does something beneficial to my skin and improves the appearance immediately was definitely something worth trying for me.</li>
            <li>With most foundations, you can take just one look and tell you are wearing a heavy coverup.  </li>
            <li>I got a bottle of this from a BZZ Campaign and upon using it I seen no difference between it and my normal brand.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I normally use powder foundation but am trying this out through Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>but it will just be a back up for when I run out of my still favorite long wearing drugstore foundation.</li>
            <li>There are some foundations that within a few hours I feel that they’ve worn off, but this Neutrogena Makeup felt like it lasted most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin, and normally my makeup smudges off by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I Love it and use it everyday now</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t feel thick on the skin, despite its nice coverage.</li>
            <li>I got a shade that is a little darker than I normally wear, but it is so easy to blend out that I haven&#x27;t had much of an issue.</li>
            <li>I have typically had a lot of success with liquid foundations, especially if the formula is creamy enough to add in my own moisturizer to offset any drying properties in the make up itself.</li>
            <li>The other issue I have is that it claims to hide fine lines.</li>
            <li>Secondly I loved that it dried fairly quickly, in the past when I&#x27;ve tried liquid make up</li>
            <li>mineral powder is all that I really wear but this covers really well, lasts super long, and last but not least - DOES NOT MAKE YOU BREAK OUT!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I frequently have long days where I can&#x27;t touch up my make up, so I am excited to see how this product performs.</li>
            <li>I have not determined whether the claims of this particular foundation being tone correcting, but it does a good job at covering the dark spots and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>The flaws I paid attention to the most, were a large dark freckle type spot and another red spot, both on my cheek/jaw area.</li>
            <li>but I want something that will smooth out my skin and hide my flaws (large pores, uneven skin tone, freckles, age spots and melasma).</li>
            <li>After 5 hours in a warm house with at least 30 other people, I still looked fresh &amp; had that glow!  </li>
            <li>but since I tend to break out for a number of reasons (stress, hormones, new skin products, etc.)</li>
            <li>The ingredients help bring out a new, healthier looking you and since its from Neutrogena you know its a product you can trust.</li>
            <li>often worry that when I switch to a new skincare product, my skin - which is combination dry/regular - will freak out.</li>
            <li>I got the opportunity through BZZ Agent to try this new brand of make-up.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m always on the look out for something new foundation-wise.</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to foundation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary: While I was initially impressed with the sunscreen and tone correctiveness of this makeup, the fact that it dried out my skin so drastically and turned into little skin colored plastic like balls after having moisturizer put over those spots leave me with no choice but to give a less than positive review.</li>
            <li>I requested the same shade as the Healthy Skin makeup I&#x27;d been using and found that it was a tad darker than I expected.</li>
            <li>The shade matched my skin very well (the lightest skin color there is), lasted long, covered pretty well, and didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>After using this foundation just once I am already in love with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it in Classic Ivory and it looked very pale in the container.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never worn a lot of foundation before because i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>like I was very young.</li>
            <li>Look very natural with power of covering all my imperfection face.</li>
            <li>I have to constantly close the bottle and shake it down then reopen it to be able to get a decent amount out to cover my face.</li>
            <li>It blends in pretty quickly and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin has stayed clear with this makeup and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li>currently use the Neutrogena oil free facial moisturizer and often use Neutrogena face wash products, like Visibly Clear, too.  </li>
            <li>The first day I used my hands to apply the next two days</li>
            <li>Sadly, no, and this makeup has been relegated to the back of the closet for fingerpainting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lines around my eyes completely evened out!</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this foundation!</li>
            <li>I have a nice lighter but not fair skin tone, so any wear from the makeup was not noticeable to me.</li>
            <li>- you can either get a very small amount or more than you really need.</li>
            <li>The key is how much you shake it!</li>
            <li>I have a nice lighter but not fair skin tone, so any wear from the makeup was not noticeable to me.</li>
            <li>Nourishing Long Wear Liquid Makeup Broad Spectrum is full coverage.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t strong or apparent at all, I feel like I am not really wearing anything at all!</li>
            <li>I was using a different cover up foundation prior to this that I really liked, but the benefits that this one says it provides seems to out way all of the other.</li>
            <li>I tend to have less breakouts and my skin seems smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I recently received and tried NEUTROGENA Nourishing Long Wear Makeup for free because I am a Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to take part of a Bzz Agent campaign to try out the Neutrogena&#x27;s Long Wear Foundation.</li>
            <li>Long lasting all day coverage, blends in well and is light to wear.</li>
            <li>It seems to dry quickly but not so fast that you can&#x27;t apply it properly.</li>
            <li>It seems to dry quickly, but not so fast that you can&#x27;t apply it properly.</li>
            <li>It seems to dry quickly but not so fast that you can&#x27;t apply it properly.</li>
            <li>As long as I did a touch up every 4 hours (afew dots of touching up not a whole reapplication)</li>
            <li>You will not be disappointed with how good the coverage is and how light it feels on your skin.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day, the make up still looks great and while it was long lasting like advertised, it wasn&#x27;t hard to remove.</li>
            <li>You have to shake it really hard to get the makeup out, and then too much can easily come pouring out.</li>
            <li>I recently received a free sample of Nourishing Long Wear Liquid Makeup to try and was pleasantly surprised by the product.</li>
            <li>It make my face smooth and little shining but not too shine.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth with little scent.  </li>
            <li>I always have a hard time finding makeup that works for me since I have really sensitive skin that tends to break out with most makeups.</li>
            <li>- it is thick enough to cover it easily, but also smooths in easily and stays on all day long!</li>
            <li>The formula felt lightweight and has medium to light coverage, it isn&#x27;t a heavy makeup.</li>
            <li>I initially used my fingers but it applies MUCH easier with a makeup sponge.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because personally I think it can start to look cake-y and masky if you accidentally apply to much.</li>
            <li>so there is such a thing as too much coverage.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it has not caused any irritation.</li>
            <li>I got it as a sample from BzzAgent and have been wearing it frequently.</li>
            <li>Also, I like that this makeup provides complete coverage.</li>
            <li>I say this because I do not think I shook the make up well enough because today I tried it again and shook the bottle really well.</li>
            <li>It made my 32 year old skin look like I was in my 20s.</li>
            <li>It covers, is lightweight, and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>The seven year old test is sometimes the toughest.  </li>
            <li>It is very long-lasting and my skin was glowing for an entire afternoon and evening out.</li>
            <li>This time around, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>and It really does last all day.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the real question is, would I purchase this for myself?</li>
            <li>It did, however correct the tones under my eyes, which had the product not dried my face out, would have immediately sold me on it.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well it covered.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a sensitive redhead who shudders in the sun</li>
            <li>Overall, I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and so far haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Not cakey, not tacky, not sticky, not heavy.</li>
            <li>Also, I tend to have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get greasy feeling throughout the day but it lasts all day and keeps my skin feeling soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised and don&#x27;t mind having foundation as part of my makeup routine now....</li>
            <li>I got it as a sample from BzzAgent and have been wearing it frequently.</li>
            <li>It really did last the 12 hours that they say it did!  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it has not irritated my skin at all or caused breakouts.</li>
            <li>It promised to be breathable, 12 hour makeup that will improve my skin’s natural tone and texture in 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>was hoping that this foundation would let me skip steps in my routine (primer, powder, etc), but I find I have to make sure to still use the primer at least to fill in the pores.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and so far, no break outs from it.</li>
            <li>sensitive skin issues-</li>
            <li>Neutrogena has always been my brand because of my issues with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this foundation stays on my skin all day, keeping blemishes covered.</li>
            <li>foundation is soft and silky.</li>
            <li>This could be because it has been so cold, but I would definitely recommend some kind of pump apparatus or different bottle design to make this more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No to mention, I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But when I did, I broke out, and I am just too old for that.</li>
            <li>It really does last all day.  </li>
            <li>And it really does last all day #</li>
            <li>The bottle means I&#x27;m pounding it out in my hand and has resulted in too much liquid coming out, splatters on my shirt and just an overall messy-ness to the application process.</li>
            <li>It is very long-lasting and my skin was glowing for an entire afternoon and evening out.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and it hasn&#x27;t made me feel like I&#x27;m crawling out of my skin.</li>
            <li>I think I would have to use it for at least a month or more to see if there is any difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had no trouble blending it in or getting it rubbed in all over.</li>
            <li>After I put it on, I felt like you could tell I was wearing makeup and did not feel natural.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t oxidize on my skin, because almost everything always does.</li>
            <li>It was light-weight and natural looking.</li>
            <li>In a clinical study 100% of women saw improvement in skin’s natural tone or texture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that it lasts hours on end and that its been improving both the natural tone and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>I want to note I have makeup sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin, it may be worth a try simply for the tone correction, especially in the under eye area.</li>
            <li>Long lasting - gets me through a full day.</li>
            <li>Long lasting - gets me through a full day.</li>
            <li>Good product to add to your collection- skip the expensive and go for what works</li>
            <li>The new Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup talks up a good game - but can it deliver?</li>
            <li>I really like the coverage I get with the new Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-up.  </li>
            <li>I will admit if you prefer full coverage and want very long lasting this would be the product to buy.</li>
            <li>First what I like it doesn&#x27;t dry and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>I use my beauty blender to put my foundation on, so there&#x27;s hardly a way to put too much on, but the first time I used it, my boyfriend said it looked like I had WAY too much makeup on, almost like a mask</li>
            <li>/&gt;Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup is said to give you 12 hours of silky, breathable coverage and that you’ll start to see smoother, softer, more radiant and even toned skin in as little as 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have an issue with the very small opening at the top of the bottle.</li>
            <li>have a touch of rosacea in my cheeks, which I usually don&#x27;t mind too much, but who wants to look super flushed all day long?</li>
            <li>At only $15.99 for a decent sized bottle, I will be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At only $15.99 for a decent sized bottle, I will be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A quick mid day application of a dot of foundation on my pink patches fixed the skin tone problem.</li>
            <li>As a new Stay at Home Mom, I am working on my new skincare routine, as it&#x27;s hard to justify taking time for a full face of makeup...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the new Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Liquid Makeup Broad Spectrum SPF 20!</li>
            <li>(even when it didn&#x27;t look like I had any with just moisturizer on) which I found quite odd for a foundation claiming to be &amp;#34;nourishing.&amp;#34; That being said, it didn&#x27;t really seem like it faded or slid around during the day, so they definitely got the long-wear part right.</li>
            <li>So often you see products listed as long wearing and they either feel really gross on your skin, or they wear right off.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like heavy coverage &amp; because my skin is getting more dry</li>
            <li>It did not quite last the 12 hours promised, but a few spot touch-ups after 8 hours kept it going strong all night.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really tried a long wearing foundation before.</li>
            <li>I usually splurge on my face makeup, but I received this free with Bzz Agent</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to like Neutrogena nourishing Long Wear Makeup as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I have tried full coverage foundations before and found them heavy</li>
            <li>There is going to be A LOT of waste, so the actual oz amount isn&#x27;t true to how much you&#x27;ll actually get to use.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle, so I have to make sure to keep it upside-down</li>
            <li>am just now starting to see some new blemishes</li>
            <li>I have used the same foundation for years and was a bit hesitant to try something new.</li>
            <li>First, I like that this makeup is long lasting.</li>
            <li>still, the opening isn&#x27;t big enough to really get everything.  </li>
            <li>I will purchase a different color, but overall I really like this foundation and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I currently like the foundation I use, but I was willing to give Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup a try.</li>
            <li>The product is so thick that it doesn&#x27;t easily pour out of the opening, and you spend some time trying to coax the foundation out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>And most women who have used a thick or stick like foundation can tell you, it doesn’t always wear very well over an active day.</li>
            <li>There is so much to choose from it is hard to find the right one for me and my skin.</li>
            <li>I think this is primarily because my skin is very dry due to the winter weather.</li>
            <li>&quot; Well, I have to admit, I have seen a major difference in the 2 weeks since I&#x27;ve started using the Neutrogena</li>
            <li>But the fact that I&#x27;m super pale isn&#x27;t Neutrogena&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li>I currently alternate between two BB creams (Garnier and Olay) and a MAC foundation and the people at the counter are always surprised at how dark they have to go to get the right color.</li>
            <li>I think I chose a shade that is slightly too dark for my skin-tone; however, the texture is creamy and light enough that it still blends very well.</li>
            <li>Anything that could cover better is usually very thick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a hard time blending it to the point where I would feel comfortable wearing it out and about.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to determine whether or not my skin really is \\&quot;brighter\\&quot; as a result of the make-up.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup also claims to have a tone correcting complex, that after 4 weeks of use, will make your skin tone more even.</li>
            <li>Second, I like that this makeup provides complete coverage.</li>
            <li>dry, mainly in the winter and can get oily in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;-sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;-acne-prone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would last 12 hours like the bottle says, but I don&#x27;t usually keep my makeup on that long anyway.</li>
            <li>I barely know I&#x27;m wearing makeup, and it is still in place at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Bare Minerals, didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>To my surprise and delight, it was still apparent.</li>
            <li>The shade selection was pretty small (maybe because it&#x27;s a new product).</li>
            <li>On top of all that, a little over a week into using the foundation and I am actually starting to see my natural skin tone even up a little.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend it for dry to normal skin.</li>
            <li>main negative I had about this makeup is that by the end of the day if I had applied it around the lines near my mouth, the makeup did settle in and make the lines very noticeable.</li>
            <li>I currently have a color that is a little too dark for me though since picking a color without being able to try it</li>
            <li>It made my skin tone even across my whole face and not blotchy like some other foundations.</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;m really hoping for is a foundation that, after simple moisturizer, would give me long lasting, breathable coverage that matches my skintone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should start off by stating that I am all about natural looking makeup and on a daily basis, only wear foundation, maybe some bronzer, mascara and lip gloss.</li>
            <li>I thought certain the bottle I received through BzzAgent was too dark in color.</li>
            <li>My skin is more even and the redness I usually have has gone down.  </li>
            <li>At first I was a little apprehensive about the this product.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s positive because that you can use less foundation  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I think it may have actually aggravated  my skin, I kind of broke out with a little inflammation and some itch.&lt;br /&gt;Since the texture was too thick</li>
            <li>As someone who wears foundation on daily bases I look for products that are easy to use, light on the skin, protect and don&#x27;t run or look weird after a few hours.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I first tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Long Wear Liquid Makeup, for free as a part of a bzzcampaign, because I always wear powder, mineral foundation.</li>
            <li>I generally buy foundation from the Urban Decay line, but I tried this product through the bzzzagent campaign.  </li>
            <li>looks natural, long wearing, it has spf 20  </li>
            <li>However, when I received the Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Foundation I was surprised.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free from BZZ agent, I first use this product Neutrogena Nourishing long wear make up, and it did not seem to blend well with my skin tone and coverage was questionable, but</li>
            <li>only issue with it is that it comes in a glass jar with a small opening and, due to the relatively thick consistency of the foundation (Which actually makes it very easy and great to apply) it is quite difficult to get out of the bottle and on to my sponge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s very nice, but if you usually have trouble matching drugstore foundations to your skin and are not willing to purchase two shades for mixing, this might not do the trick for you, because it is limited in shade choices!</li>
            <li>it is really oily and dry really dry.  </li>
            <li>Typically by the end of the day I&#x27;m ready for a reapply.</li>
            <li>Now, after 2 weeks, the dark and red spot have absolutely faded.</li>
            <li>just so I could really compare it to the mineral based makeup I usually wear and to see the effect it would have on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I was not happy with that, but that is an easy fix.</li>
            <li>I generally wear BB creams or tinted moisturizers, but lately I&#x27;ve needed a little more coverage.</li>
            <li>and this foundation completely evens out my complexion and smooths my skin so you can not see a single blemish.</li>
            <li>I was kind of nervous to try the Neutrogena Nourishing Long wear makeup because I never use liquid foundation since it’s hard to match up with my pale skin tone.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on as easily as the foundation I was using before, and it&#x27;s a little difficult to get the right amount out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>The slight roughness on my cheeks where the rosacea is has seemed less rough and becoming smoother.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover blemishes well, but it does even skintone perfectly.</li>
            <li> However, I am VERY happy about this product!</li>
            <li> The color (nude) was perfect.</li>
            <li> All and all it is excellent for covering up blemishes and keeping skin matte.</li>
            <li> Great make up!</li>
            <li> the color will be perfect.</li>
            <li> But, best of all, it provides SPF coverage, which is a must for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Plus the shade, Buff, was absolutely perfect!!</li>
            <li> Perfect!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the product.  </li>
            <li> It matched my skin perfectly, covered my blemished (although I must admit, I don&#x27;t have a ton), and didn&#x27;t make my skin oily by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I was really impressed!</li>

            <li> The color match was perfect.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very, very happy with this foundation.  </li>
            <li> The color options are also wonderful because there are a lot of options and I might even switch between two depending on the time of year and how tan I am.</li>
            <li> I received the ivory and it was a perfect match for my skin.  </li>
            <li> It looks great and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;ll be perfect for the summer).</li>
            <li> No matter, because once I blended it in well my skin looked great!</li>
            <li> Considering I have never tried Neutrogena&#x27;s makeup before, I was actually impressed with the coverage for this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that if I use a foundation brush to apply that I get the best results.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the coverage is excellent.  </li>
            <li> This Neutrogena offering is perfect.</li>
            <li> My foundation feels like my best accents have been showcased by having this touch my skin at the beginning of my day.</li>
            <li> Best foundation I have tried!</li>
            <li> This foundation has been the perfect solution for me.</li>
            <li> gives a flawless look.</li>
            <li> My skin looks flawless.  </li>
            <li> But this foundation is the perfect consistency</li>
            <li> but otherwise I find this is a perfect foundation-</li>
            <li> A very good color match as well!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s perfect for my oily/combination skin.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome foundation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> I think this foundation is great!</li>
            <li> I like it, probably the best of the Neutrogena foundations I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> All in all, an excellent product</li>
            <li> I tried this just today &amp; was so impressed!  </li>
            <li> The color match was perfect.</li>
            <li> Best affordable foundation I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel so confident!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I have very fair skin and sometime finding a shade that works with my skin tone can be tricky - not a problem here - the lightest color worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is very fair and freckled.  </li>
            <li> that is either wears off or runs with my skin type, but this one lasted all day which I found very surprising.  </li>
            <li> Yes, you will still have to blot your t-zone, but this stuff is incredible for the price.</li>
            <li> It brilliantly evened my skin with a lightweight, luminous finish.</li>
            <li> I think Neutrogena did a really good job with this product, I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I loved it!</li>
            <li> I loved this foundation!</li>
            <li> Good luck finding your perfect shade!</li>
            <li> Blends beautifully and covers everything.</li>
            <li> The Ivory shade works perfect with my fair complexion.</li>
            <li> but it applied beautifully.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;ve now used this product a bunch of times and I am really very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> It gives GREAT coverage</li>
            <li> However, this product works great</li>
            <li> It is great looking on the skin.  </li>
            <li> It lasts for hours and is great for work or a night out.  </li>
            <li> The color looks great on me, and I had to pick a color choice from a website, I did a great job picking the Ivory color.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like it&#x27;s mousturizing my skin while helping it look great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It WAS a great matte finish and didn&#x27;t leave my face looking dewey.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> After trying it, I can say that the primer GREATLY improved the look of this product.</li>
            <li> so I did not get a great color match.</li>
            <li> It is a great foundation</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great on my skin, gives me great coverage and lasts literally all day.</li>
            <li> Even after wearing it all day, I find that my skin is still looking and feeling great.  </li>
            <li> Great coverage.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I&#x27;ve been wearing it at home, and I do think there are some great benefits.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and it looked great all day.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of redness, but this works great to cover it</li>
            <li> It works great and feels great, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasted all day and made my skin look great.</li>
            <li> There are great colors to choose from in order to get the closest match to all skin tones.  </li>
            <li> The coverage is great on my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> This foundation also had some great wear.</li>
            <li> which is great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll see the promised improved skin in 4-weeks, but the foundation looks great on my skin.</li>
            <li> I began to spread it on my skin and to my surprise it went on great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great find.</li>
            <li> This makes your skin look great.</li>
            <li> The foundation provided great coverage.  </li>
            <li> GREAT perks to have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great foundation to use.  </li>
            <li> I like the slender glass bottle as it&#x27;s attractive</li>
            <li> I wore it for 14 hours yesterday and still had great coverage when I washed it off.  </li>
            <li> Love this makeup!!</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with this foundation and cannot wait to try more Neutrogena products!!</li>
            <li> I love this foundation!!</li>
            <li> This foundation is very nice.</li>
            <li> This covered blemishes very nicely and the color matched rather well on my skin.</li>
            <li> The best way I can describe it is that it feels like I&#x27;m putting very light, silky lotion on my face when I&#x27;m applying it.</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> The product is amazing!  </li>
            <li> I have to start by saying this makeup feels AMAZING on!</li>
            <li> I love the color and blended in my blemishes perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my skin feel and it looks great too!</li>
            <li> The color match was great, but even using it after moisturizer, it made my skin flake and didn&#x27;t look good.</li>
            <li> It provides great coverage that looks even and bright.</li>
            <li> was most impressed by how well the ivory shade matched my skin tone.</li>
            <li> The color is also a great match for my skin, which I owe to the fact that they offer so many great skin tones to choose from.</li>
            <li> so this is a good bargain.</li>
            <li> I received it free to try through BuzzAgent.com and am seriously impressed.  </li>
            <li> Maybe is too soon to write a good review, so I will continue to use it, and see how my skin reacts.</li>
            <li> DID serve as a good primer when I applied eye makeup</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li> Looked smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li> This would be a good makeup to use in the summer.</li>
            <li> Over all I think it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Years ago I had a Covergirl lotion/foundation that I loved.</li>
            <li> I think the foundation is a good product, but doesn&#x27;t fully cover the redness on the bridge of my nose and cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Every time I wear it, I get compliments on how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li> It felt light and did its job and best of all-</li>
            <li> It has SPF 20, and is a good value.  </li>
            <li> and I really loved this make up.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a wonderful light moisturizing foundation….wrong.</li>
            <li> This is like going to a fair and getting your face painted.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find the perfect foundation to evenly cover and feel light on my face.  </li>
            <li> I got this for free from bzzagent and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> I had to give the bottle a good shake to get the makeup out.</li>
            <li> It is longwear, and keeping with Neutrogena&#x27;s reputation, it seems to do your skin some good.  </li>
            <li> I really loved this foundation.</li>
            <li> I can not complain but the color was not the best fit for my skin.</li>
            <li> I loved the coverage.</li>
            <li> Apparently good for my skin</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d give it a fair shot before judging it.</li>
            <li> may not be the best option for extremely dry skin, but if you have well moisturized skin before application expect great coverage and perfectly dewy finish.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> This foundation has great coverage and went on very easily.</li>
            <li> It evened out my skin tone beautifully, and I love the velvety finish.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy there is no perfume and that it comes off easy during removal!</li>
            <li> It has excellent, lasting coverage and the color i chose matches perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love love love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I was really impressed, I have super oily skin</li>
            <li> The foundation went on nice and smooth, and it had excellent coverage.</li>
            <li> The coverage is great, it feels very light in my skin, and it makes me look like I&#x27;m glowing.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth and great coverage.  </li>
            <li> I got this product through a bzzagent campaign and im very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this makeup.</li>
            <li> It lasted most of the day and looked great on camera.</li>
            <li> Love that it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I use this and love it!</li>
            <li> I love how it looks!</li>
            <li> How can I not be pleased!</li>
            <li> It also lasts all day while I am at work,l which can be up to 10 hours or more in a day!</li>
            <li> It makes me look like I&#x27;m wearing a better version of my own skin, which is all you can ask for!</li>
            <li> It made my skin look great and more importantly, feel great.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this foundation!  </li>
            <li> I also love that it has 20 SPF!</li>
            <li> I love this foundation!</li>
            <li> I got this one thru Bzzagent and fell in love!</li>
            <li> Love this makeup!  </li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Even my husband who notices nothing, saw a difference in how much better my face looked!  </li>
            <li> I love this make up!  </li>
            <li> It looks great, covers well, and is easy to blend.</li>
            <li> At first I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t match my skin tone (I am very fair skin), but it matched great and went on smooth and very light!  </li>
            <li> The tone blends well with skin tone and looks amazing.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and silky, but does not make you feel oily which is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, an amazing product.</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly, made my skin feel great &amp; lasted all day -</li>
            <li> It goes on light feeling but it gives great coverage.</li>
            <li> liked the coverage of this make up.</li>
            <li> It is also nice that this product will improve my skin tone and skin condition over time.</li>
            <li> how well I liked it.</li>
            <li> My opinions of the product are 100% my own.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this concealer.  </li>
            <li> but a pump would have been nice.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I forget I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> The tone blended nicely</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this make up, but the words and thoughts are my own.</li>
            <li> I liked that it made my skin look healthier</li>
            <li> but it does have a nice even coverage.</li>
            <li> I also felt like the foundation gave me a nice glow without being so dewy that I felt I needed a powder as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Neutrogena Healthy Skin makeup for about 8 years and have always loved it.</li>
            <li> I felt like this product had many good qualities</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m used to foundations not matching, but it would still be nice to see this made in a lighter shade.</li>
            <li> And, honestly, it went on and stayed on just as well as UD.  </li>
            <li> I have not had much of an issue with it rubbing off on my scarves or jackets this winter, which is great since I often forget I am wearing it!</li>
            <li> But I am loving how it wears during the day.  </li>
            <li> It smoothed on nicely and evened out nicely.</li>
            <li> but once it is rubbed in, it seems very light and smooth maintaining awesome full coverage!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was very easy to apply with a makeup sponge and it was a light, non-greasy texture that feels great on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth and even, and feels light on your skin while providing really great coverage.  </li>
            <li> do* use it, I want something that is fairly easy to work with and, obviously, a good color match.</li>
            <li> but I found it to be quite nice, smooth and good coverage for me</li>
            <li> but I found it to be quite nice, smooth and good coverage for me</li>
            <li> and I could not be more pleased with a product!</li>
            <li> When I first applied this makeup, I was impressed with how easily it blended and covered well.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments saying that I look like I am glowing, how nice my skin looks, etc.</li>
            <li> I liked how it covered better than the Glow Sheers, but I didn&#x27;t feel like I looked cakey or covered in makeup.</li>
            <li> It looked natural and flawless.</li>
            <li> but this product is even smoother than my old product and it is awesome that it has sunscreen built into it for the winter months when  I forget to apply the sun lotion!</li>
            <li> I am surprised to say how happy I am with this product!</li>
            <li> I wore it the first day and was impressed on how light weight it was but was concerned that it wasn&#x27;t going to hold up to its LongWear promise -but</li>
            <li> The first thing that impressed me was how smoothly it went on.</li>
            <li> : it goes on smooth, stays on all day and continues to look good, it feels very light on my skin, there is a good selection of shades and it is readily available at stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am happy to say it just blended right in.</li>
            <li> The coverage is great, and the color blends right into my skin.  </li>
            <li> Overall, great foundation with great coverage.  </li>
            <li> A wider hole at the top would make it near perfect !</li>
            <li> have normal skin, but I&#x27;m very fair and have freckles.  </li>
            <li> and I just loved it right away!  </li>
            <li> This foundation goes on light and easy and has amazing coverage!</li>
            <li> I just love that you really don&#x27;t even feel it, plus you can feel that it is still moisturizing and that all the minerals and soy feel so good on the skin!</li>
            <li> Even after wearing it all day, it still looked great just like when I first applied it in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I am incredibly fair and my skin is cool</li>
            <li> I love this makeup - it goes on easy and lets skin breathe!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel it did anything for my fine lines!</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and evenly with just my fingers.</li>
            <li> It is very light weight.</li>
            <li> The makeup is also very light and airy which allows skin to breathe and not feel like tons of makeup is caked on.</li>
            <li> It has SPF20 what is very important for me.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my skin feel, and it is very light and feels like nothing on my skin.  </li>
            <li> The texture is very smooth and silky so it glides on</li>
            <li> The formula is nice and easy to apply, although I did find that the foundation settled into lines towards the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and blends incredibly nicely to my skin-tone.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample from bzzagent and absolutely love this makeup!</li>
            <li> stays on, great coverage and super light.  </li>
            <li> but i am so happy I got the opportunity with this particular product!)</li>
            <li> looked huge!</li>
            <li> so she asked me to buy more for her</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena</li>
            <li> However, I found that with each use I am having more and more difficulty getting the product out.</li>
            <li> i love it and will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I seem to get better concealment of scarring from mineral makeups than this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am so glad a tried this product.</li>
            <li> and I hope it will look even better as summer arrives.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will buy it in the future.</li>
            <li> I love that it has sunscreen as well.</li>
            <li> Except that I do think my face looks better.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products and continue to use them.  </li>
            <li> I love this liquid makeup.  </li>
            <li> There is no need to reapply on your lunch break, just put it on in the morning and still have the same flawless look at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> The color that I got was Warm Beige its just a tab bit to light</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product and will definitely buy it.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Like most women over 35, I have imperfect skin.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this foundation and even more amazing that I got to try it free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this is that it has SPF.</li>
            <li> but once it was blended it felt more like my mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really pleased that the foundation has SPF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that is</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it has 20 SPF but unsure of how it would feel on my skin during warmer months.</li>
            <li> It claims to improve your skin after a month of use, and I do feel my skin has been more even and smoother</li>
            <li> I love the longwear.</li>
            <li> so you a lot more of the product comes out then you want.</li>
            <li> and I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality product for a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> I love that the bottle is glass</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I was a skeptic.</li>
            <li> Overall, I have been very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product out</li>
            <li> It is better than any drug store foundation I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> It also contains vitamins A, C &amp; E, which as we all know is helpful for healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it, but it just didnt work.</li>
            <li> I love this formula.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the make up and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it for free from BzzAgent but its retail price is amazing value for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how this foundation held up trough out the day, it&#x27;s not greasy or runny.</li>
            <li> The product went on so smoothly and evenly and covered all my problem areas!</li>
            <li> it really lasted all day and had great coverage!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t like the feel of most foundations.  </li>
            <li> Most foundations that I&#x27;ve used before disappear on my skin within an hour.  </li>
            <li> It works a lot like BB cream, with my skin looking more evenly-toned, but not \\&quot;painted,\\&quot; after application.</li>
            <li> I think it would be better suited as a spring/summer foundation, though, because the tint would be a no-brainer if I got some color.</li>
            <li> It really provides great coverage, covering up my skin&#x27;s imperfections without looking cakey.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product it gives you full coverage blends out evenly</li>
            <li> That worked much better.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of blemishes on my forehead, so it would be nice to enjoy the benefits of the foundation where I need it most.</li>
            <li> I have found with most liquid make up</li>
            <li> I have been using Clinique Even Better Wear for about 3 years now.</li>
            <li> The foundation tends to sit on top of the skin, no matter how well I blend.</li>
            <li> so I switched that to make sure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really love how well this one matched my skintone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made sure to moisturize and then used a blending sponge in this picture, skipping primer or BB cream.</li>
            <li> And I love that it already has SPF 20 in it.</li>
            <li> Tends to feel like it&#x27;s sitting on top of the skin instead of blending into it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made sure to moisturize and then used a blending sponge in this picture, skipping primer or BB cream.</li>
            <li> And I love that it already has SPF 20 in it.</li>
            <li> Tends to feel like it&#x27;s sitting on top of the skin instead of blending into it.</li>
            <li> After using this product for about 3 weeks I have to say that my face looks more even-</li>
            <li> but I can already tell that my skin is looking better.  </li>
            <li> Before, by midday I was alway reaching for more powder or for blotting papers.</li>
            <li> so I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this foundation</li>
            <li> I am glad that I am able to try out this product being a BZZZAgent.</li>
            <li> I love the feel and the fact it kept me from looking shiny.</li>
            <li> The brand Neutrogena is great in itself and doesn&#x27;t really need any help, but I give a thumbs up to this product.</li>
            <li> I am sure that will annoy me much more when I get through more and more of it</li>
            <li> more even skin color</li>
            <li> I find this foundation ok.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great foundation for the budget buyer!</li>
            <li> I would love however to try a shade a tad lighter.</li>
            <li> It also has a smooth,  nice finish that isn&#x27;t cakey.  </li>
            <li> All in all - I enjoyed this makeup and am having my daughter try it as well</li>
            <li> I also find that it gives great coverage and makes your skin feel much cleaner and fresher.</li>
            <li> I love the longevity of this makeup and it does not rub off on clothes, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did because it changed the perception I have of drugstore makeup brands.</li>
            <li> When my shift was over I was sure my coverage would be as well.</li>
            <li> I will buy more.</li>
            <li> It has great coverage and blends right in to my skin tone, it feels smooth</li>
            <li> It was a perfect match to my skin colour and it looks barely noticeable and completely natural while providing great coverage and evening my skin tone and flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product was true to it&#x27;s skin tone, and I love it!</li>
            <li> However, if that turns out to be true, then even better!</li>
            <li> I am always changing my foundation because I enjoy trying new products and finding the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; product that both makes me look good and feel good.</li>
            <li> As I applied, I was worried that I got a shade too dark but it smoothed out nicely and blended with my skin perfectly so that I didn&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
            <li> (she is 14 years old) because it also seems to be very safe and very much good for your skin.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long and evens out my skintone beautifully!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> All I am covering is some pores and it has worked pretty good for me.</li>
            <li> It is a nice full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found this!</li>
            <li> I love how easily it glides onto the skin and how well it blends with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> And although, I don&#x27;t use it everyday, I know it&#x27;s doing wonders for my skin and that it makes me look beautiful and makes me feel amazing!</li>
            <li> It blends well with a nice color and it stays light and smooth on the skin throughout the day.</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent, I received a free sample of this makeup and was able to compare it to my favorite CC cream.  </li>
            <li> It feels very smooth and light on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It feels very smooth and light on my skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this great value and super product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I think it settles in my fine lines a bit, but I think with a better shade it will resolve the issue.  </li>
            <li> This makeup went on smooth and easy- felt very light weight on my face.</li>
            <li> I love how I dont even realize im wearing it because its so light.</li>
            <li> It gives me such a nice glow and looks so nice with eye makeup!</li>
            <li> This lasts all day without drying my face out or becoming oily.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample from bzzagent and I am so glad I decided to give it a go.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free from Bzz Agent, and I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li> I was using their Healthy Skin Glow Sheers when I got a free bottle of this to try out through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I love how light this foundation is.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, I need something that still lets my skin &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> I love how silky and smooth it goes on my skin as well.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product - the coverage was great (not streaky or cakey) and the color match was spot on.  </li>
            <li> Free is even better</li>
            <li> This is especially true if I use too much.</li>
            <li> Surprising how much I ended up liking it.</li>
            <li> would recommend this foundation to someone who is looking for a good drugstore makeup at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> skin was kind of blah looking with it, no glow or fresh look to</li>
            <li> You really have to give it a good shake.  </li>
            <li> It feels great, light, and airy on the skin...very soft!</li>
            <li> So glad I got to try this complimentary from BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a bit more matte because I still had to put powder on top of it, but overall this is a really nice addition to a makeup collection!</li>
            <li> this product is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It went on easy.</li>
            <li> It is also easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I prefer bottles that squeeze, or glass bottles with a pump, because I can get the product out easily.</li>
            <li> This foundation actually makes my skin look and feel great, unlike most liquid foundations.</li>
            <li> It smooths on easily and blends in well.</li>
            <li> : Easy to match&lt;br /&gt;Not drying or oily</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, odorless, and added bonus of SPF.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to get out of the bottle and apply.  </li>
            <li> but it just needs to be blended very quickly.</li>
            <li> I did notice that if I wiped my mouth or blew my nose, the makeup rubbed off easily on the napkin/tissue.</li>
            <li> It lasts through my 12-14 hour work days and blends easily.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the SPF 20, especially being a fair skinned person, because this is just nice to have in any foundation since it will eliminate a step in your routine.</li>
            <li> I loved the light texture of this make up, it has great coverage without being heavy.</li>
            <li> Its coverage is impeccable and long lasting, and the color matches my tone perfectly.</li>
            <li> It is nice and light, while create great coverage for acne, redness, and other skin problems.</li>
            <li> It  blends really easily and feels lightweight and smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li> in fact, it is slightly matte, which is great for my combination skin!</li>
            <li> However, half-way through the day, I noticed it was settling into my fine lines around my eyes, and my crease in my forehead</li>
            <li> Also, the color is a perfect match with my typically hard-to-match skin tone.</li>
            <li> The light-diffusing powders camouflage imperfections and mask fine lines.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Tends to settle into fine lines</li>
            <li> Anyway, the application was easy, the foundation blended well, and went on evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> It went on easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to fall into my fine lines either like</li>
            <li> I have also happily noticed that my skin appears smoother and more even after applying the NEUTROGENA® Nourishing Long Wear Makeup .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This make-up also feels very natural and seems to stay put fairly well.  </li>
            <li> With this long wear makeup, I&#x27;m good to go, even for drinks after work!</li>
            <li> It looked much better on my face and blended beautifully though I think I could have gone one shade lighter due to winter</li>
            <li> My skin looked absolutely flawless and a little bit shiny</li>
            <li> It is supposed to improve tone and texture of your skin in as little as four weeks while leaving you with wonderful even coverage.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful because I am very fair skinned</li>
            <li> Which is huge for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t a lot of color options, but they all seem to blend nicely with just about any skin tone, so the quality of the actual makeup is amazing.  </li>
            <li> a pump would make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now a huge fan of Neutrogena</li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s health and appearance are a huge priority to me</li>
            <li> The coverage is light but still enough to cover what you want covered,and it feels great.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin smooth and soft and the color is dewy and bright.</li>
            <li> It  gives my face great coverage without looking all caked up and allows my skin to breathe and lasts the entire day!</li>

            <li> The coverage on this is lighter than with the covergirl foundation, so if you are looking for really heavy coverage this may not be the best bet for you.</li>
            <li> I have perfect looking skin and the few things that I have like puffy eyes and circles under them</li>

            <li> since I got it free</li>

            <li> The Foundation applied smoothly with an even application.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS FOR FREE TO REVIEW FROM BZZ AGENT AND NEUTROGENA</li>
            <li> I should add that I recieved this free as a a BZZ agent.</li>
            <li> I got this for free as a BzzAgent sample.</li>
            <li> When I first applied the Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear, I was really impressed.</li>
            <li> It really would be better if the bottle were designed with a pump on top instead of the screw-top.</li>
            <li> After struggling to get the foundation out it went on nice and smooth and felt very lightweight.</li>
            <li> So honestly, I did not feel all that comfortable leaving the house with it, because it doesn&#x27;t really match my skin.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way this smoothed on my skin, did not feel cakey, and left me with a nice glow.  </li>
            <li> You cannot get the full amount as the liquid does not get out of it easily AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> I saw results by the end of my first night wearing it!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was excited to try this foundation and got to try it for free because I&#x27;m a BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get a free sample of this makeup, given all the claims it makes about its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> But I received this a trial and the packaging was nice, the product was fragance free, and high quality.</li>
            <li> At first I had a very smooth and even coverage.</li>
            <li> The product goes on smooth with a clean finish that leaves my skin glowing.  </li>
            <li> I love the feel, it&#x27;s very silky and super light!</li>
            <li> It does last all day, as it claims, and also even put skin tone, provides good coverage, and applies easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t have high hopes.</li>
            <li> I have found my new favorite :)</li>
            <li> Pretty good!&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad to be a @bzzagent</li>
            <li> It does a great job at evening out my skin and covering minor redness and marks.</li>
            <li> It is light and airy, while also providing full coverage.</li>
            <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t need another product (face primer) to use this product, but I&#x27;m so happy with the color match and the staying power that I think I will keep wearing Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to be able to sample this as a Bzz Agent and it felt amazing.  </li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I received this as a free sample from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> but I am really excited about this</li>
            <li> it goes on so smooth and evened out my skin tone and lasted the full 12 hrs for me.</li>
            <li> I had the chance to try out a sample of this foundation, and I was really excited to test it out.</li>
            <li> I received a full bottle of this product from BzzAgent to try for free.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use a primer first and the coverage was more that of a tinted moisturizer than that of a foundation.  </li>
            <li> I got this from bzz agent to test and was really excited to try it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> The lightest shade is a good march for my fair skin tone, but it has a bit of a yellow undertone whereas I feel my skin is more pink, but it was easily blended into my skin.</li>
            <li> The color is a little darker than I would have liked, but it matched fairly well anyway</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super light.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of this product from BzzAgent but will be buying my next bottle soon and definitely recommend for something light and easy that feels and looks great!</li>
            <li> Also it was great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am lucky to have received this product free for review as a buzz agent.</li>
            <li> Also it was great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> With that said, I am loving the light, silky coverage that this foundation offers.</li>
            <li> My first impressions of the product were that I was really pleased that it was fair enough for my skin.</li>
            <li> It is very light, and blends in very well.</li>
            <li> it is very light weight and stays on very well.</li>
            <li> It is very smooth and you don&#x27;t really need a lot.</li>
            <li> I think Neutrogena got it just right!</li>
            <li> pleased.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency and finish are right on par with my luxury foundations!</li>
            <li> I play roller derby which is an extremely athletic and challenging sport, that has the cool side that we also like to look good while we&#x27;re playing.</li>
            <li> Classic Ivory was a great match for my skin tone and it looked and felt natural.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s great as an every day foundation, has a broad spectrum SPF in it, and is very affordable.</li>
            <li> and I always have a hard time finding a make-up color that matches my skin, but this blended perfectly.</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent, I was super excited when I got to try this out.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a BzzAgent, and was super excited to receive and share my opinions on the newest Neutrogena</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of the Cover Girl Oil Control foundation and have had great success with it.  </li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth and wears long, I also loved that it has sunscreen in it, so it saves me a step in the summer.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job of covering my red splotches on my face and really helps with my circles under my eyes!</li>
            <li> It did a great job of covering that redness with minimal amount of product.</li>
            <li> It did a great job of covering that redness with minimal amount of product.</li>
            <li> It covers blemishes beautifully and really does last all day.</li>
            <li> I will have to continue using this foundation for a couple more weeks in order to really tell if it&#x27;s the cause of my breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received a full size sample of this product from Bzzagent.com</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t need a lot of the product to get full coverage.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a difference in skin tone or texture, but it has not been the full four weeks</li>
            <li> I was chosen by BzzAgent to try this product and they sent me a full bottle to sample.  </li>
            <li> It has a light fresh feeling and stays put.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I can get good coverage without it being obvious that I&#x27;m wearing foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This foundation goes on smooth, blends well and leaves my skin feeling fresh and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I did a side by side comparison with makeup and without to see the full transformation.</li>
            <li> After I received my sample and it wasn&#x27;t a good color, I ventured out to find a paler shade at my local Ulta.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup - a nice natural look.</li>
            <li> However, I thought it was worth a shot since I got to try it for free from bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> I love the coverage of this foundation, but I really wish I could use it on my forehead.</li>
            <li> But overall, it is a good drugstore foundation.</li>
            <li> But, I still loved the opportunity to try this and will be likely to pass this on to someone else this shade.</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and was sent a full size sample of this product to try and then review.</li>
            <li> Still, it didn&#x27;t have the coverage I was used to, but I really liked the natural look it gave</li>
            <li> The color matched fairly well, and the coverage did last all day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this foundation is a winner, especially if you get a good matching one.</li>
            <li> Good makeup overall.</li>
            <li> The makeup lasts about 8 hours which is not bad for my skin type.</li>
            <li> Overall I liked the makeup and would probably like it more if it were the right shade for me.</li>
            <li> It filled in without caking up and cover the dark circles which makes me super happy.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re looking for a long wear makeup, it is especially important to find the right one for you.</li>
            <li> This neutrogena went on smooth and was easy to apply and I really like how the color blended.</li>
            <li> I got it in the lightest shade available (Classic Ivory) and while it looked very peachy as a swatch, it did blend out fairly nicely.</li>
            <li> I have pink undertones and most foundations are too cool or too orange for me whereas this Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear was a PERFECT match for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Not only does it go on smooth and blend naturally, but it really does stay and keep its awesome flawlessness.  </li>
            <li> I am starting to get fine lines, which my daughter loves to so honestly point out.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin, so while it doesn&#x27;t last a full 12 hrs, it still holds out better than most.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The coverage is pretty much perfect as it evens my skin tone without totally blocking out my natural colors</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;d give this an excellent rating and I&#x27;d definitely use it again.</li>
            <li> I have combination Skin so in the summer my T Zone get super oily.</li>
            <li> I quickly lose interest in them, because I don&#x27;t want to be reapplying hour after hour or even worrying that my make up will disappear.  </li>
            <li> I have super oily skin so by about hour 3</li>
            <li> It would definitely be helpful to expand the range of tones to better match more skin tones.</li>
            <li> The color is good, the makeup itself is kind of thick.</li>
            <li> The foundation also blended very easily (I use my fingers to apply) and looked natural-</li>
            <li> It rubs right into my skin and dare I say -- feels soft and nice.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover dry skin as well as I would like, but if you scrub your skin and get it really fresh, the coverage is impeccable.</li>
            <li> It goes on pretty smoothly, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m covered in glop.</li>
            <li> Correcting the skin tones and evening them out is something I’m very interested in.</li>
            <li> So it really is a good long wear foundation.</li>
            <li> I got this for free from Bzz Agent, and was very happy with how well the shade matched my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely need to give the bottle a good shake to mix it up before applying, but the coverage is decent, and it absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t have that sticky heavy feeling that other make-ups</li>
            <li> I will have to say I am not the best at wearing or applying makeup, but mainly because everything I purchase is either to heavy, cakey, or makes me break out.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Neutrogena and BzzAgent for the full sized sample!)</li>
            <li> hard to match yellowy, greenish undertone skin is perfectly suited to the classic ivory shade, and my skin doesn&#x27;t have that cheap drugstore product look,</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite foundation</li>
            <li> I do love also the included SPF as I do live in Florida and get quite a lot son here.  </li>
            <li> in all, this is officially my new favorite concealer.</li>
            <li> I notice a slight bit of oiliness after 12+ hours of wear, but the makeup doesn&#x27;t seem to crease or cake and still looks great.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I like that is product is easy to dispense and that it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I loved the all-day coverage and it didn&#x27;t make my face feel oily or dry.  </li>
            <li> It does though provide great full coverage, I just had to lighten mine with a powder foundation to make it wearable, since it made my face a few shades darker than my body color.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for the first time thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> rich soy smoothes and refines age spots and discolorations; Vitamins A, C &amp; E nourish skin and brighten skin tones; Light diffusing powders camouflage imperfections and mask fine lines; and Broad spectrum SPF 20 protects your skin from the sun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Neutrogena promised \\&quot;Anti-oxidant rich soy smoothes and refines age spots and discolorations; Vitamins A, C &amp; E nourish skin and brighten skin tones; Light diffusing powders camouflage imperfections and mask fine lines; and Broad spectrum SPF 20 protects your skin from the sun.\\</li>
            <li> I really like how this made my skin feel and look!!</li>
            <li> When  I first got it, I was excited by the glass bottle.  </li>
            <li> but I was excited to try a liquid foundation as I haven&#x27;t had much experience with this type!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this to every lady who wants to feel beautiful without having to wear too much.</li>
            <li> My skin stayed soft smooth and easy to wear and breath.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne, so coverage is very important.</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s not as light, it certain does provide coverage without looking like I have layers of product on my face.  </li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s: Affordable, good quality, fine, highly pigmented, reasonably long wearing.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of coverage, blends easily, and really is long-wearing.</li>
            <li> It works great under my eyes to cover up the bags and dark lines that I can get sometimes!  </li>
            <li> This foundation dries quickly which is great, so I can apply my powder sooner and don&#x27;t need to worry about a sticky mess!</li>
            <li> This is also nice because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent like you get with other foundations.</li>
            <li> I had no issue in covering up any uneven skin tones on my face, though I do not suffer greatly in that area nor do I have any acne issues.</li>
            <li> It does go on really smooth and blends really well.</li>
            <li> I had no issue in covering up any uneven skin tones on my face, though I do not suffer greatly in that area nor do I have any acne issues.</li>
            <li> I love that it offers protection from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays while covering up imperfections on my face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think this foundation is worth a try.</li>
            <li> It went on pretty dark (I got the natural beige), but because I put it on over ELF mineral primer and shook it for a couple of minutes before I used it, it went on perfectly.</li>
            <li> and it did a pretty good job of covering up minor acney.</li>
            <li> It evened out my skin for the most part, but blemishes were still clearly visible and needed additional concealing.</li>
            <li> This foundation had both pros and cons that are worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I love it so far.</li>
            <li> This foundation goes on nice and smooth, and really does last all day.</li>
            <li> So far, so smooth!</li>
            <li> Possibly if it were in a squeeze bottle or a pump it might be nice.</li>
            <li> I wonder if part of my success in application was that I had just moisturized.</li>
            <li> I apply it with a sponge applicator because I like a thinner application of foundation for a more natural look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using a deluxe sample I received for under a week, but I have to say I am impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have since made sure that I do not put any of this foundation directly on any creases (or use a primer)</li>
            <li> but I still think it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> far I have been pleased.  </li>
            <li> But I would say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> My skin is pretty normal and usually cheap foundations make it oily!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light-weight, easy to apply, looks very natural and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> The other foundation I have been using had good coverage, but would get greasy looking in my smile creases by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend if you want a clean, light foundation!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend if you want a clean, light foundation!</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Long Wear Foundation is fabulous!!</li>
            <li> just all right.</li>
            <li> so you can choose what is right for you.</li>
            <li> Blends right in.</li>
            <li> When I put it on I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> and I still haven&#x27;t found one that&#x27;s JUST RIGHT.</li>
            <li> I had some brownish look spots on my cheeks because I wear always sunglasses and right under where the sunglasses stop</li>
            <li> and this was the right solution.</li>
            <li> I have to mention again that I moisturize right</li>
            <li> The consistency of the liquid is just about right</li>
            <li> I am a sign waver for a company right now and applied the coverage before my 3 hour shift.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try the Nourishing Long Wear makeup and was kind of hoping it would be the same as the Healthy Skin makeup but with longer wear time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was able to try NEUTROGENA® Nourishing Long Wear Makeup for free from BzzAgent</li>
            <li> I wore this for the first time last week and really liked it.</li>
            <li> Good coverage and non-drying (unusual for a long wear liquid make-up).</li>
            <li> I would recommend Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear makeup because it’s a great blend of long lasting and good coverage.</li>
            <li> The makeup looks a bit orange in fluorescent light but seems to match my skin much better in natural light, interestingly enough.</li>
            <li> and I have used bare minerals mostly</li>
            <li> I have really been surprised I liked this as much as I do.</li>
            <li> The color was slightly dark for me, but I think it&#x27;ll be a good match for my tanned summer skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used and liked Neutrogena products for a long time now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really liked how long wearing this makeup is while its not damaging my skin.</li>
            <li> I always get excited to try new makeup!</li>
            <li> I do tend to have more sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts in certain areas.</li>
            <li> but this will match up much better as I get a little more vitamin D from the sun</li>
            <li> I recently got this product from BzzAgent and after using it for less than a week, I am already pretty impressed!</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try New Neutrogena Nourishing Long-Wear Makeup from BzzAgent for free.</li>
            <li> In any event, I was given the opportunity to try New Neutrogena Nourishing Long-Wear Makeup from BzzAgent for #free.</li>
            <li> It was more coverage than I need, it felt more like stage makeup than everyday foundation.</li>
            <li> I just mix a few drops with my daily face lotion and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product to anyone that is looking for full coverage but that still feels light and looks natural!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like most women, having the right foundation is key to putting a makeup look together.</li>
            <li> I received the warm beige 90 which is the darkest color they have unfortunately because I need something with a warm copper tint not beige for it to look more natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge makeup hoarder, and am always trying new foundations never really being thrilled with any of them.</li>
            <li> This is certainly a product worth trying.</li>
            <li> I am always open to trying new things and am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> The foundation initially goes on a little sticky, but once you smooth it out, it creates a great matte finish.</li>
            <li> The foundation initially goes on a little sticky, but once you smooth it out, it creates a great matte finish.</li>
            <li> Once they redesign the packaging/bottle I would be willing to try it again.</li>
            <li> would recommend this foundation for people who want to even skin tone, but don&#x27;t necessarily need to hide many scars or blemishes.</li>
            <li> it looks exactly like it did when I put it on in the morning.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t describe in what way exactly except even, I suppose.</li>
            <li> I got this product as part of a free sampling, and I was definitely surprised at</li>
            <li> I have been using the Covergirl long-wear foundation, but this definitely feel better on my skin.</li>
            <li> I really have iffy on drugstore foundations, but this works!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looking forward to seeing if continued use really evens out the tone of my skin!</li>
            <li> I did not wear foundation consistently before being on this campaign.</li>
            <li> The foundation feels smooth and not heavy on your skin.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena and this definitely fits their brand.</li>
            <li> It just leaves my skin feeling like there wasn&#x27;t that much on it to begin with!</li>
            <li> I did need to use concealer for my some specific problem areas, but I expect that from most any</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky!</li>
            <li> so I was pretty concerned about how it would match, but it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would compare this to higher end brands, like Benefit.</li>
            <li> I bounce back and forth between the ski clearing foundation and healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I switched brands and started using MAC and became an avid user of their pro longwear foundation.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ve got one happy, sexy looking derby player who totally believes in Long lasting coverage!</li>
            <li> Thanks Nuetrogena!</li>
            <li> When I first applied the Neutrogena</li>
            <li> the first time I applied this foundation, I already noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> My skin is completely breathable, and feels light.</li>
            <li> But it does last most of the day, as promised.</li>
            <li> The first time out of the bottle, I just evenly applied it all over my face, just as I did with my powder.</li>
            <li> The foundation felt light on my skin, and I thought it had a natural look.  </li>
            <li> It definitely has better coverage than my powder does, and its still feels pretty light and looks natural.</li>
            <li> As women we many times find a product we like and stick with it unless it suddenly isn&#x27;t being made anymore.</li>
            <li> It made my skin look healthy and it actually helped by also moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li> other then that i love it!</li>
            <li> But this stayed on thru a 9 hour work shift and the even tone of my skin was evident.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely use it more in the summer but</li>
            <li> I will surely buy this product in the future</li>
            <li> Also, as a person that does not reapply makeup, I was pleased with the lasting effects of my morning application.</li>
            <li> and I am pretty sure I have finally found the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It really did even out my skin tone!</li>
            <li> I feel that it’s a great balance of the two, without being too thick.</li>
            <li> It was smooth and even, not heavy</li>
            <li> I kept checking through the day and it held up pretty well.</li>
            <li> The second time, I used my Smashbox silicone primer with it and the results were better.  </li>
            <li> so I can actually get it out of the bottle (this would be more hygienic, too).</li>
            <li> so thanks Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> I was given a free trial in Natural Ivory.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As women we many times find a product we like and stick with it unless it suddenly isn&#x27;t being made anymore.</li>
            <li> I really like this foundation!</li>
            <li> The first day I wore it I kept getting compliments on my skin and everyone kept asking me if I had gotten a tan.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says....</li>
            <li> This stuff actually stays where it is supposed to and makes my skin look so smooth!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to try something new after using L&#x27;Oréal True Match for years.</li>
            <li> It was suitable for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, as the day wore on, I noticed pretty early that the foundation was settling into fine lines and pores in a way that was very unflattering.</li>
            <li> My skin does not look fake or caked on, it actually looks great, very nice and clear.</li>
            <li> Toward the afternoon, with a quick application of powder it looks like new.</li>
            <li> In all honesty, I&#x27;ve not worn much foundation in my life and have kept my makeup regimen to mostly eye shadow, mascara, blush, lip gloss and occasionally a bronzer.</li>
            <li> I always viewed it as something that would make me look fake and painted and surely wouldn&#x27;t be any good for my skin.</li>
            <li> I enjoy trying out new makeup products, so I was excited when I received the new Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup in the mail for free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I checked a few times throughout the day to make sure it still looked the same and it sure did!</li>
            <li> favorite part is that the Nourishing Long Wear Foundation lasts ALL day.</li>
            <li> I love the Long Wear Liquid Make-UP.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup worked better for me than all others.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I gave Neutrogena&#x27;s Long Wear Liquid Foundation a try.</li>
            <li> It is so light and airy and barely feels like you have anything on.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I had the chance to try this product and see what I was missing out on.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed using my Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-Up.  </li>
            <li> Most &#x27;long wear&#x27; products just don&#x27;t work as well as they advertise.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s pretty much as advertised.</li>
            <li> I also love the long wear aspect and that it has a sunscreen included in it.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised as to how much I liked the Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Foundation!</li>
            <li> I have only used it a couple of days so far, but as of right now, im in love.</li>
            <li> The only place I noticed them was right above my nose where the foundation kind of makes them noticeable.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried when I got it that it would be too dark, but it&#x27;s a perfect match!</li>
            <li> It covers up blemishes and red spots and overall makes my skin feel more clear and healthy.</li>
            <li> I also mix it occasionally with my daily facial lotion and that proves to be a great tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> When I got Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Foundation to try through BzzAgent, I was super excited to see if it could stand up to the the literal beating I sometimes take.  </li>
            <li> Love the neutrogena long wear foundation!</li>
            <li> I love the coverage, the feel and how long it lasts!</li>
            <li> Fourth, I like that is product is easy to dispense.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have dry skin issues, it&#x27;s probably much better.</li>
            <li> but I have better luck with my normal brand lasting longer.</li>
            <li> This is perhaps better suited to darker skin tones and people without dry patches.</li>
            <li> This item went on smoothly and did not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This one, however, has the staying power to last all day and still be easy to remove at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the price difference is so large.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am always hesitant to try a new foundation because I am worried I will not select the right color</li>
            <li> It is light, looks natural and literally made my blackheads (on my nose) disappear by covering them completely naturally!  </li>
            <li> My face would get very flaky and almost patchy/orange in certain (drier)</li>
            <li> The coverage is better than most other foundations I have tried and it really does last longer than most other foundations.  </li>
            <li> I love liquid foundation more than other types of foundation, so Neutrogena nourishing long wear makeup already had that going for it.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and it is hard to find foundation to match my skin color, along with rosacea.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding foundations that match my fair skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to wear a lot of make up, especially foundation, but I have to say, I&#x27;m a huge fan of this Neutrogena foundation.</li>
            <li> Overall I think this makeup does a great job of blending, covering any uneven color or blemishes and not wearing off.</li>
            <li> It felt light on my skin and did last my whole day.</li>
            <li> I actually wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of this and it pains me to admire that</li>
            <li> It matches my skin tine really well</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s the foundation or not.</li>
            <li> This foundation is very think</li>
            <li> Also, very lightweight in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It feels much lighter on the skin than it looks in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Fifth, I like that it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m really upset by the packaging.  </li>
            <li> That being said once in a while i like to just paint my whole face</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> I also really like the look and feel of the foundation.</li>
            <li> so I can squeeze out as much as I need without wasting it.</li>
            <li> As a bzzagent I got it free and got coupons, but am unsure if I will buy in the future.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this brand, and with &amp;#34;Nourishing&amp;#34; in the product title I thought I would get it.</li>
            <li> did not expect to like this foundation as much as I do.  </li>
            <li> I found that it really did improve the tone and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> This product was great, it goes on thin</li>
            <li> It matches really well and lasted all day.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this foundation</li>
            <li> It smooths just enough to smooth out my complexion</li>
            <li> I really like this foundation.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> This makeup really does do what it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, but really evens out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a melting mousse, really, that comes out in gobs.</li>
            <li> Given the price and how much I had to work with it</li>
            <li> As with all makeup, really, YMMV.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The color I received matches my skin tone very well, and</li>
            <li> Lastly I really like how well the coverage is, it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to do my whole face and it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve got caked</li>
            <li> has really helped even it out.</li>
            <li> Plus, I really trust the Neutrogena brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like Neutrogena products</li>
            <li> this make-up did not cover it very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear much make-up.</li>
            <li> But this product was gentle on my skin and it didn&#x27;t cause any skin issues.</li>
            <li> My skin was primed and ready to accept the foundation.</li>
            <li> I really like this foundation.</li>
            <li> The color DID match my skin very well, however.</li>
            <li> It lasts and it really evens out my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like that it has a built in sun screen as well.</li>
            <li> and I feel like it is a very buildable feel.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really light and fairly sheer for a foundation, I always forget i&#x27;m wearing it when I have it on!</li>
            <li> , my face is very oily and there was no difference in using this foundation...</li>
            <li> my skin was still very oily at the end of the day but the makeup still lasted.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing came off on my napkin during a dinner-time mouth dab.</li>
            <li> and you really couldn&#x27;t tell I was wearing it.</li>
            <li> It really will control oil for 12 hours, and it leaves your skin with a glowy, not greasy, finish.</li>
            <li> I’m looking forward to seeing this on my skin as I use it over the next month, since I struggle with smooth and even-toned skin.</li>
            <li> You either get nothing, or way too much -just like a ketchup bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few minute though, it kind of evened out.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really liked this makeup especially the color range.</li>
            <li> Nice if you want to use it for pictures of something that you only want to wear it a short time.</li>
            <li> The foundation is so thick that it takes a good deal of time and patience just trying to extract it from the bottle.  </li>
            <li> As it stands right now, though, I enjoyed this product enough that I will be purchasing it in the future.</li>
            <li> I love the new Neutrogena nourishing Long Wear Make-Up.  </li>
            <li> I really love this new long wear makeup from Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different kinds in the past and none of them really covered my blackheads effectively, and certainly didn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was hard to get the perfect amount out due to the bottle.  </li>
            <li> This is the first new foundation I have tried in a while.  </li>
            <li> Finally, this product offers a light but complete coverage - I have lots of small imperfections and blotches on my face, and this makeup is great at evening them out</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing that makes this super special, other than that it gives some UV sun protection.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a pretty good foundation, it’s not too heavy</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than the other foundations I have tried.</li>
            <li> However, that is a very minor issue and easily overlooked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally a non-irritating full coverage makeup that stays put the whole day.</li>
            <li> I received Neutrogena&#x27;s long wear foundation in the lightest shade for free thanks to bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle had a pump or something to get the product out more easily, but was also surprised at how thick and moisturizing this foundation seems to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bzzagent, I got to try this Neutrogena Long Wear Foundation for free</li>
            <li> All in all I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for a light long wear foundation.</li>
            <li> Has reasonable price but quality like high price product.</li>
            <li> I did not like the packaging, a pump would be much better or even a larger opening, thit did not seem large enough to get the product out.</li>
            <li> Definitely try to find your shade in store first before ordering so you can find the right one.</li>
            <li> Liquid Long Wear free to try.</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of this Long Wear Makeup from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I received Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-up free as a BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> I received Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup for free for participating in a BzzAgent Campaign.</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of this Long Wear Makeup from BzzAgent</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Long Wear Foundation goes on so light and blends into my skin so well.</li>
            <li> I have been using the neutrogena nourishing long wear foundation in ivory for about 3 weeks, which I received for free through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> this makeup would last the full 12 hours.</li>
            <li> When I did that, my skin looked very dry, and you could easily tell that I was wearing foundation.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to spread it around with your makeup sponge down under your neck and into your hair line.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lasts most of the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Have to store bottle upside down for ease of use</li>
            <li> I tend to have pretty decent skin naturally.</li>
            <li> The smooth consistency applies more like a cream than a runny makeup and less goes a long way when covering.</li>
            <li> I really think if this bottle had a pump, it could have been used a little more efficiently which may have changed my review.</li>
            <li> Just found my new foundation!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new go to!</li>
            <li> The foundation is a pretty thick formula, so it really takes some shaking to get things out, especially after you&#x27;ve used a good portion of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less is more in this case each time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay put for 12 hours like it says, but it does provide decent coverage.</li>
            <li> It evens out my skin tone, provides decent coverage and brightens my complexion.</li>
            <li> the older</li>
            <li> Overall, the product works well enough, but I&#x27;ve used others that I like better.</li>
            <li> My main goal is oil control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend actually going to the makeup counter and trying the different selection to pick your color to avoid the problem that most of us have been reporting.</li>
            <li> But,  trying this product for over a week now has made me love this more than the expensive products.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than my more expensive dept store brand.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear obvious makeup, and though this streakiness was only in areas, it wasn&#x27;t my favorite finish.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it gave me decent coverage</li>
            <li> and I tend to break out with drugstore foundations in particular, and anyone that is oily/acne prone.</li>
            <li> I have only used one other kind of liquid foundation continuously (Mary Kay kind), and I usually stick with cream to powder or the FitMe stick.</li>
            <li> and I was excited to try Long Wear.</li>
            <li> After all, I&#x27;ve tried makeup that&#x27;s made these claims of being lightweight and long lasting with great coverage before with VERY little success.  </li>
            <li> Despite being lightweight, it stays and lasts all day, even in high humidity and heat.</li>
            <li> It feels very light on the skin, unlike some products that feel heavy and goopy.</li>
            <li> So, I had high expectations.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this foundation.</li>
            <li> Granted, I haven&#x27;t yet tried this in the summer when my face is at it&#x27;s shiniest, but I have high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It feels very light on the skin, unlike some products that feel heavy and goopy.</li>
            <li> Other than the above, the product does have a nice texture and coverage.</li>
            <li> The main problems I find with this product is the package--the bottle is attractive, but very difficult to get the product out of it-- and with its best feature--since this product is long lasting, I find myself using several makeup wipes to remove it all and still needing to scrub with an astringent later to get all the color off my face.</li>
            <li> SO I will start off by saying that I have never really worn face makeup, as I have been truly blessed with fair and normal skin, really blemish-free except for the occasional pimple once in a blue moon.</li>
            <li> but my face looks a little more shine than before.</li>
            <li> It is a tad thicker than I am used to, so it takes a little more effort to apply.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little more than a week</li>
            <li> so well that I will be able to use it no problem even though it is a little darker than I&#x27;d normally wear.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very thick and almost not runny - which is not bad per se, but wanting to get it out of the container is rather challenging, since it doesn&#x27;t come with a pump, it&#x27;s just a bottle.</li>
            <li> I usually have a hard time of finding a perfect match in a drugstore brand but not with this!</li>
            <li> face felt soft and I didn&#x27;t even feel like I was wearing a liquid foundation ore, really, any makeup at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was extremely surprised how much make up was on my face at night when I removed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I applied it every morning before work, after even after a long day, the foundation stayed put on my face and still looked light and natural.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using to see if the promised benefits of evened skin tone come through, but so far-- very</li>
            <li> I also loved how it hid small blemishes on my skin saving me an extra step and not having to use concealor.</li>
            <li> I normally use BB cream, but this has been my go-to every morning since I received it.  </li>
            <li> This product needs to be in a squeeze tube or jar with a larger opening to be really useful.  </li>
            <li> and I dont have to worry about touching my makeup in a few hours</li>
            <li> so a product that does something beneficial to my skin and improves the appearance immediately was definitely something worth trying for me.</li>
            <li> With most foundations, you can take just one look and tell you are wearing a heavy coverup.  </li>
            <li> I got a bottle of this from a BZZ Campaign and upon using it I seen no difference between it and my normal brand.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I normally use powder foundation but am trying this out through Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> but it will just be a back up for when I run out of my still favorite long wearing drugstore foundation.</li>
            <li> There are some foundations that within a few hours I feel that they’ve worn off, but this Neutrogena Makeup felt like it lasted most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin, and normally my makeup smudges off by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I Love it and use it everyday now</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t feel thick on the skin, despite its nice coverage.</li>
            <li> I got a shade that is a little darker than I normally wear, but it is so easy to blend out that I haven&#x27;t had much of an issue.</li>
            <li> I have typically had a lot of success with liquid foundations, especially if the formula is creamy enough to add in my own moisturizer to offset any drying properties in the make up itself.</li>
            <li> The other issue I have is that it claims to hide fine lines.</li>
            <li> Secondly I loved that it dried fairly quickly, in the past when I&#x27;ve tried liquid make up</li>
            <li> mineral powder is all that I really wear but this covers really well, lasts super long, and last but not least - DOES NOT MAKE YOU BREAK OUT!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I frequently have long days where I can&#x27;t touch up my make up, so I am excited to see how this product performs.</li>
            <li> I have not determined whether the claims of this particular foundation being tone correcting, but it does a good job at covering the dark spots and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The flaws I paid attention to the most, were a large dark freckle type spot and another red spot, both on my cheek/jaw area.</li>
            <li> but I want something that will smooth out my skin and hide my flaws (large pores, uneven skin tone, freckles, age spots and melasma).</li>
            <li> After 5 hours in a warm house with at least 30 other people, I still looked fresh &amp; had that glow!  </li>
            <li> but since I tend to break out for a number of reasons (stress, hormones, new skin products, etc.)</li>
            <li> The ingredients help bring out a new, healthier looking you and since its from Neutrogena you know its a product you can trust.</li>
            <li> often worry that when I switch to a new skincare product, my skin - which is combination dry/regular - will freak out.</li>
            <li> I got the opportunity through BZZ Agent to try this new brand of make-up.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m always on the look out for something new foundation-wise.</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to foundation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary: While I was initially impressed with the sunscreen and tone correctiveness of this makeup, the fact that it dried out my skin so drastically and turned into little skin colored plastic like balls after having moisturizer put over those spots leave me with no choice but to give a less than positive review.</li>
            <li> I requested the same shade as the Healthy Skin makeup I&#x27;d been using and found that it was a tad darker than I expected.</li>
            <li> The shade matched my skin very well (the lightest skin color there is), lasted long, covered pretty well, and didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> After using this foundation just once I am already in love with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it in Classic Ivory and it looked very pale in the container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never worn a lot of foundation before because i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> like I was very young.</li>
            <li> Look very natural with power of covering all my imperfection face.</li>
            <li> I have to constantly close the bottle and shake it down then reopen it to be able to get a decent amount out to cover my face.</li>
            <li> It blends in pretty quickly and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin has stayed clear with this makeup and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> currently use the Neutrogena oil free facial moisturizer and often use Neutrogena face wash products, like Visibly Clear, too.  </li>
            <li> The first day I used my hands to apply the next two days</li>
            <li> Sadly, no, and this makeup has been relegated to the back of the closet for fingerpainting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lines around my eyes completely evened out!</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this foundation!</li>
            <li> I have a nice lighter but not fair skin tone, so any wear from the makeup was not noticeable to me.</li>
            <li> - you can either get a very small amount or more than you really need.</li>
            <li> The key is how much you shake it!</li>
            <li> I have a nice lighter but not fair skin tone, so any wear from the makeup was not noticeable to me.</li>
            <li> Nourishing Long Wear Liquid Makeup Broad Spectrum is full coverage.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t strong or apparent at all, I feel like I am not really wearing anything at all!</li>
            <li> I was using a different cover up foundation prior to this that I really liked, but the benefits that this one says it provides seems to out way all of the other.</li>
            <li> I tend to have less breakouts and my skin seems smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I recently received and tried NEUTROGENA Nourishing Long Wear Makeup for free because I am a Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to take part of a Bzz Agent campaign to try out the Neutrogena&#x27;s Long Wear Foundation.</li>
            <li> Long lasting all day coverage, blends in well and is light to wear.</li>
            <li> It seems to dry quickly but not so fast that you can&#x27;t apply it properly.</li>
            <li> It seems to dry quickly, but not so fast that you can&#x27;t apply it properly.</li>
            <li> It seems to dry quickly but not so fast that you can&#x27;t apply it properly.</li>
            <li> As long as I did a touch up every 4 hours (afew dots of touching up not a whole reapplication)</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with how good the coverage is and how light it feels on your skin.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, the make up still looks great and while it was long lasting like advertised, it wasn&#x27;t hard to remove.</li>
            <li> You have to shake it really hard to get the makeup out, and then too much can easily come pouring out.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free sample of Nourishing Long Wear Liquid Makeup to try and was pleasantly surprised by the product.</li>
            <li> It make my face smooth and little shining but not too shine.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth with little scent.  </li>
            <li> I always have a hard time finding makeup that works for me since I have really sensitive skin that tends to break out with most makeups.</li>
            <li> - it is thick enough to cover it easily, but also smooths in easily and stays on all day long!</li>
            <li> The formula felt lightweight and has medium to light coverage, it isn&#x27;t a heavy makeup.</li>
            <li> I initially used my fingers but it applies MUCH easier with a makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because personally I think it can start to look cake-y and masky if you accidentally apply to much.</li>
            <li> so there is such a thing as too much coverage.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it has not caused any irritation.</li>
            <li> I got it as a sample from BzzAgent and have been wearing it frequently.</li>
            <li> Also, I like that this makeup provides complete coverage.</li>
            <li> I say this because I do not think I shook the make up well enough because today I tried it again and shook the bottle really well.</li>
            <li> It made my 32 year old skin look like I was in my 20s.</li>
            <li> It covers, is lightweight, and looks natural.  </li>
            <li> The seven year old test is sometimes the toughest.  </li>
            <li> It is very long-lasting and my skin was glowing for an entire afternoon and evening out.</li>
            <li> This time around, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> and It really does last all day.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the real question is, would I purchase this for myself?</li>
            <li> It did, however correct the tones under my eyes, which had the product not dried my face out, would have immediately sold me on it.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well it covered.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a sensitive redhead who shudders in the sun</li>
            <li> Overall, I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and so far haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Not cakey, not tacky, not sticky, not heavy.</li>
            <li> Also, I tend to have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get greasy feeling throughout the day but it lasts all day and keeps my skin feeling soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised and don&#x27;t mind having foundation as part of my makeup routine now....</li>
            <li> I got it as a sample from BzzAgent and have been wearing it frequently.</li>
            <li> It really did last the 12 hours that they say it did!  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it has not irritated my skin at all or caused breakouts.</li>
            <li> It promised to be breathable, 12 hour makeup that will improve my skin’s natural tone and texture in 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> was hoping that this foundation would let me skip steps in my routine (primer, powder, etc), but I find I have to make sure to still use the primer at least to fill in the pores.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and so far, no break outs from it.</li>
            <li> sensitive skin issues-</li>
            <li> Neutrogena has always been my brand because of my issues with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this foundation stays on my skin all day, keeping blemishes covered.</li>
            <li> foundation is soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This could be because it has been so cold, but I would definitely recommend some kind of pump apparatus or different bottle design to make this more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No to mention, I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But when I did, I broke out, and I am just too old for that.</li>
            <li> It really does last all day.  </li>
            <li> And it really does last all day #</li>
            <li> The bottle means I&#x27;m pounding it out in my hand and has resulted in too much liquid coming out, splatters on my shirt and just an overall messy-ness to the application process.</li>
            <li> It is very long-lasting and my skin was glowing for an entire afternoon and evening out.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and it hasn&#x27;t made me feel like I&#x27;m crawling out of my skin.</li>
            <li> I think I would have to use it for at least a month or more to see if there is any difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had no trouble blending it in or getting it rubbed in all over.</li>
            <li> After I put it on, I felt like you could tell I was wearing makeup and did not feel natural.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t oxidize on my skin, because almost everything always does.</li>
            <li> It was light-weight and natural looking.</li>
            <li> In a clinical study 100% of women saw improvement in skin’s natural tone or texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that it lasts hours on end and that its been improving both the natural tone and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I want to note I have makeup sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin, it may be worth a try simply for the tone correction, especially in the under eye area.</li>
            <li> Long lasting - gets me through a full day.</li>
            <li> Long lasting - gets me through a full day.</li>
            <li> Good product to add to your collection- skip the expensive and go for what works</li>
            <li> The new Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup talks up a good game - but can it deliver?</li>
            <li> I really like the coverage I get with the new Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-up.  </li>
            <li> I will admit if you prefer full coverage and want very long lasting this would be the product to buy.</li>
            <li> First what I like it doesn&#x27;t dry and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I use my beauty blender to put my foundation on, so there&#x27;s hardly a way to put too much on, but the first time I used it, my boyfriend said it looked like I had WAY too much makeup on, almost like a mask</li>
            <li> /&gt;Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup is said to give you 12 hours of silky, breathable coverage and that you’ll start to see smoother, softer, more radiant and even toned skin in as little as 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have an issue with the very small opening at the top of the bottle.</li>
            <li> have a touch of rosacea in my cheeks, which I usually don&#x27;t mind too much, but who wants to look super flushed all day long?</li>
            <li> At only $15.99 for a decent sized bottle, I will be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At only $15.99 for a decent sized bottle, I will be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A quick mid day application of a dot of foundation on my pink patches fixed the skin tone problem.</li>
            <li> As a new Stay at Home Mom, I am working on my new skincare routine, as it&#x27;s hard to justify taking time for a full face of makeup...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the new Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Liquid Makeup Broad Spectrum SPF 20!</li>
            <li> (even when it didn&#x27;t look like I had any with just moisturizer on) which I found quite odd for a foundation claiming to be &amp;#34;nourishing.&amp;#34; That being said, it didn&#x27;t really seem like it faded or slid around during the day, so they definitely got the long-wear part right.</li>
            <li> So often you see products listed as long wearing and they either feel really gross on your skin, or they wear right off.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like heavy coverage &amp; because my skin is getting more dry</li>
            <li> It did not quite last the 12 hours promised, but a few spot touch-ups after 8 hours kept it going strong all night.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really tried a long wearing foundation before.</li>
            <li> I usually splurge on my face makeup, but I received this free with Bzz Agent</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to like Neutrogena nourishing Long Wear Makeup as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I have tried full coverage foundations before and found them heavy</li>
            <li> There is going to be A LOT of waste, so the actual oz amount isn&#x27;t true to how much you&#x27;ll actually get to use.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle, so I have to make sure to keep it upside-down</li>
            <li> am just now starting to see some new blemishes</li>
            <li> I have used the same foundation for years and was a bit hesitant to try something new.</li>
            <li> First, I like that this makeup is long lasting.</li>
            <li> still, the opening isn&#x27;t big enough to really get everything.  </li>
            <li> I will purchase a different color, but overall I really like this foundation and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I currently like the foundation I use, but I was willing to give Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup a try.</li>
            <li> The product is so thick that it doesn&#x27;t easily pour out of the opening, and you spend some time trying to coax the foundation out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> And most women who have used a thick or stick like foundation can tell you, it doesn’t always wear very well over an active day.</li>
            <li> There is so much to choose from it is hard to find the right one for me and my skin.</li>
            <li> I think this is primarily because my skin is very dry due to the winter weather.</li>
            <li> &quot; Well, I have to admit, I have seen a major difference in the 2 weeks since I&#x27;ve started using the Neutrogena</li>
            <li> But the fact that I&#x27;m super pale isn&#x27;t Neutrogena&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> I currently alternate between two BB creams (Garnier and Olay) and a MAC foundation and the people at the counter are always surprised at how dark they have to go to get the right color.</li>
            <li> I think I chose a shade that is slightly too dark for my skin-tone; however, the texture is creamy and light enough that it still blends very well.</li>
            <li> Anything that could cover better is usually very thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time blending it to the point where I would feel comfortable wearing it out and about.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to determine whether or not my skin really is \\&quot;brighter\\&quot; as a result of the make-up.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup also claims to have a tone correcting complex, that after 4 weeks of use, will make your skin tone more even.</li>
            <li> Second, I like that this makeup provides complete coverage.</li>
            <li> dry, mainly in the winter and can get oily in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;-sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;-acne-prone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would last 12 hours like the bottle says, but I don&#x27;t usually keep my makeup on that long anyway.</li>
            <li> I barely know I&#x27;m wearing makeup, and it is still in place at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Bare Minerals, didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> To my surprise and delight, it was still apparent.</li>
            <li> The shade selection was pretty small (maybe because it&#x27;s a new product).</li>
            <li> On top of all that, a little over a week into using the foundation and I am actually starting to see my natural skin tone even up a little.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend it for dry to normal skin.</li>
            <li> main negative I had about this makeup is that by the end of the day if I had applied it around the lines near my mouth, the makeup did settle in and make the lines very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I currently have a color that is a little too dark for me though since picking a color without being able to try it</li>
            <li> It made my skin tone even across my whole face and not blotchy like some other foundations.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m really hoping for is a foundation that, after simple moisturizer, would give me long lasting, breathable coverage that matches my skintone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should start off by stating that I am all about natural looking makeup and on a daily basis, only wear foundation, maybe some bronzer, mascara and lip gloss.</li>
            <li> I thought certain the bottle I received through BzzAgent was too dark in color.</li>
            <li> My skin is more even and the redness I usually have has gone down.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a little apprehensive about the this product.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s positive because that you can use less foundation  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I think it may have actually aggravated  my skin, I kind of broke out with a little inflammation and some itch.&lt;br /&gt;Since the texture was too thick</li>
            <li> As someone who wears foundation on daily bases I look for products that are easy to use, light on the skin, protect and don&#x27;t run or look weird after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Long Wear Liquid Makeup, for free as a part of a bzzcampaign, because I always wear powder, mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> I generally buy foundation from the Urban Decay line, but I tried this product through the bzzzagent campaign.  </li>
            <li> looks natural, long wearing, it has spf 20  </li>
            <li> However, when I received the Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Foundation I was surprised.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free from BZZ agent, I first use this product Neutrogena Nourishing long wear make up, and it did not seem to blend well with my skin tone and coverage was questionable, but</li>
            <li> only issue with it is that it comes in a glass jar with a small opening and, due to the relatively thick consistency of the foundation (Which actually makes it very easy and great to apply) it is quite difficult to get out of the bottle and on to my sponge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s very nice, but if you usually have trouble matching drugstore foundations to your skin and are not willing to purchase two shades for mixing, this might not do the trick for you, because it is limited in shade choices!</li>
            <li> it is really oily and dry really dry.  </li>
            <li> Typically by the end of the day I&#x27;m ready for a reapply.</li>
            <li> Now, after 2 weeks, the dark and red spot have absolutely faded.</li>
            <li> just so I could really compare it to the mineral based makeup I usually wear and to see the effect it would have on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I was not happy with that, but that is an easy fix.</li>
            <li> I generally wear BB creams or tinted moisturizers, but lately I&#x27;ve needed a little more coverage.</li>
            <li> and this foundation completely evens out my complexion and smooths my skin so you can not see a single blemish.</li>
            <li> I was kind of nervous to try the Neutrogena Nourishing Long wear makeup because I never use liquid foundation since it’s hard to match up with my pale skin tone.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on as easily as the foundation I was using before, and it&#x27;s a little difficult to get the right amount out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> The slight roughness on my cheeks where the rosacea is has seemed less rough and becoming smoother.</li>
            <li> The slight roughness on my cheeks where the rosacea is has seemed less rough and becoming smoother.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of liquid foundation, but I was willing to give Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the right amount of foundation out at once.  </li>
            <li> I have a lighter olive tone and had a hard time finding the right shade.</li>
            <li> A little certainly goes a long way and after 3 week of use, I feel like my skin tone has evened out a bit.  </li>
            <li> It is a medium coverage makeup, more than a bb cream, but less than a typical heavy foundation.</li>
            <li> I could barely tell I had any dry flakes on my face.</li>
            <li> It is a little thicker than I normally use and requires several seconds of shaking prior to application.  </li>
            <li> The price is around $15 which I feel is a little high for a drugstore brand</li>
            <li> I possibly need to use it longer, or maybe the effects are so small I couldn&#x27;t really notice them, but I did not see any tone correction as the product claims to provide.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I don&#x27;t need very much of the makeup to cover my face and since it&#x27;s so thick, it can be used as concealer as well.</li>
            <li> , this makeup is a little expensive, but I promise you, you&#x27;ll love it!  </li>
            <li> Same result, only this time no flakes just dry patches.</li>
            <li> The only reason i didn&#x27;t give it 5 out of 5 is because the makeup was very slow to come out of the bottle and with a 2 year old pulling on me all the time i need something that i can put on fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been much for foundation - I usually use tinted moisturizer or BB cream.  </li>
            <li> and I actually covers pimples and dark circles reasonably well without concealer though I&#x27;d still prefer concealer for my dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I get to the end of the work day without my skin looking like an oil slick, and that&#x27;s what I really care</li>
            <li> The opening is too small, and it&#x27;s really a pain to get the product out.</li>
            <li> I currently have neutral feelings toward Neutrogena&#x27;s Nourishing Long Wear Foundation.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely long lasting as promised.</li>
            <li> I like that this makeup is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I have not seen a difference in the condition of my skin yet, but I think that is because I have not used it long enough.  </li>
            <li> And to just give you an idea on how well Neutrogena&#x27;s nourishing long wear makeup stood up, after a 16 hour day including getting caught in a shower on my walk back to the office from lunch</li>
            <li> And it truly is LONG lasting.</li>
            <li> I received Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear from BzzAgent and read up on how it can actually improve my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I usually only use department store cosmetics, but after receiving a bottle of the long wear makeup I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I recently used the Neutrogena nourishing long wear make up</li>
            <li> This definitely lives up to its &amp;#34;Long Wear&amp;#34; name, and lasts through my long 12 hour work days.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only issue I have with the Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-Up is the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I found the coverage to last as long as I needed.</li>
            <li> Another thing I didn&#x27;t like about this foundation is that it does not last as long as it claims.</li>
            <li> It almost appears flat and one dimensional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found the coverage to last as long as I needed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used it long enough to see any changes in my skin.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this makeup is that it’s thick.</li>
            <li> This happens to me with every foundation except for extremely thick pancake type (and that pancake stick type of coverage doesn&#x27;t stay to pretty as the day goes</li>
            <li> I have a very uneven complexion... red spots as I get older...</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and I&#x27;ve actually started tapering off using this make up because I don&#x27;t like the way it highlights any flaky bits.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only complaint I really have is the bottle.</li>
            <li> very quickly so it&#x27;s a bit difficult to blend.</li>
            <li> With my new Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup, my face still looks smooth and even, without looking cakey and fake!</li>
            <li> : No pump, hard to get out once the bottle is half full.</li>
            <li> It is an average foundation and to me not worth the extra money as compared to my normal brand.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the feel of it on my skin, it wasn&#x27;t too heavy or thick feeling like other long wearing foundations that I have tried/used in the past.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s Nourishing Long Wear Makeup Not Nourishing Enough for Dry,</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin with lots of dark spots.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t wear coverup, in fact I only wear Mascara because I like a very natural look.</li>
            <li> I have had little success in the past with Neutrogena products staying on, but they came up with a winner on this one.  </li>
            <li> But for a make up that&#x27;s supposed to be all day, it&#x27;s not a nice feeling to feel on your face for a whole day.</li>
            <li> I was give a bottle of Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-Up to try from Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-Up through Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> I like that my skin stays matte all day with this foundation and it lives up to its long wearing claims.</li>
            <li> It looks sleek, classy, heavy duty.  </li>
            <li> I received a bottle of the Neutrogena Long Wear from BzzAgent and I was reluctant to try it.</li>
            <li> The difference between this makeup and the one that I usually wear is that is lighter but it also does not least all day, I had to reapply some at evening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and received the Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear foundation to review.</li>
            <li> I feel like the foundation has 12 hour staying power, but I feel like I want to remove it long before the 12 hours is up.</li>
            <li> It is a long wearing foundation with medium coverage.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup in nude that I received from BzzAgent #igotitfree.</li>
            <li> I also like that it is long wearing AND provides SPF protection.</li>
            <li> Positives: they were not joking about the long wear capabilities.</li>
            <li> Negatives: They weren&#x27;t kidding about the long wear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup*&lt;br /&gt;Overall Review:&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> It covers well and wears well throughout a long day.</li>
            <li> nourishing long wear make up.</li>
            <li> nourishing long wear make up.</li>
            <li> But I received Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear from BzzAgent and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Not so with Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, this make up claims to be long wearing.  </li>
            <li> This is a minor inconvenience but an inconvenience nonetheless.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long wearing (I wear my makeup for 8-10 hours a day and</li>
            <li> Today I tried Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear makeup.</li>
            <li> Now keep in mind the makeup brags about long term tone correction benefits.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Foundation and concealer are the two products I faithfully splurge on, using MAC and Smashbox, so I was apprehensive about the finish and cover I&#x27;d get from NEUTROGENA&#x27;s Nourishing Long Wear</li>
            <li> Additionally, I didn&#x27;t feel like it lasted as long as it said it would.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was tickled with how well Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup works.  </li>
            <li> The formula does indeed feel soft and hydrating and it melts into the skin without caking or feeling at all heavy.</li>
            <li> have been using the Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup for about a week now.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Neutrogena Long Wear liquid makeup through Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am dissapointed with Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-Up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my NEUTROGENA® Nourishing Long Wear Makeup for about a week now.  </li>
            <li> Nourishing Long Wear Makeup  </li>
            <li> I do like how it stayed on all day long - and I didn&#x27;t notice it rubbing off on any of my clothes or even on my phone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot at once, perhaps people who think it feels thick are using too much at once?  </li>
            <li> It either comes out too slowly, or I get too much.  </li>
            <li> My skin is strange: I have a weird blend of T-zone oily bits, super dry cheeks that can sometimes get a little rough, and my pores seem to be getting larger as I get older despite using salcylic acid cleansers, etc.</li>
            <li> I typically use powder foundation as most liquids are difficult to apply and become splotched and horrid looking after hours of wear.  </li>
            <li> and I hope Neutrogena keeps making it for a long time!</li>
            <li> I would recommend the neutrogena long wear makeup!</li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s very hard to get the liquid out of the bottle</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and this seemed to moisturize well also.</li>
            <li> air has been really dry here in the Midwest this winter</li>
            <li> All three times the foundation and my dry skin did not mix well.  </li>
            <li> blend well on dry skin</li>
            <li> I have chronically dry skin and STILL didn&#x27;t have any problems getting in blended.</li>
            <li> I already notice a change in my overall complexion, even though it&#x27;s only been a few days.</li>
            <li> The one I got is a bit too dark, and the majority of the 8 shades are very pink and red in undertone, while I am a bit yellow.</li>
            <li> Normally by the time I get home at the end of the day, my makeup has faded and it&#x27;s hard to see if I had worn any that day.</li>
            <li> Though we had a limited color spectrum to choose from online.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works on correcting dark spots and such, as it is supposed to help even out skin tone-</li>
            <li> I still didn&#x27;t want to have that &amp;#34;foundation face&amp;#34; (you know what I&#x27;m talking about), but definitely wanted to cover up a dark spot here and there.</li>
            <li> As far as it improving skin tone, I am not really sure if it is or not.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t like liquid foundations because they feel and look thick on my skin.</li>
            <li> I find that it&#x27;s a bit thicker than what I would normally use ,but it doesn&#x27;t feel thick or greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have also found that I no longer grab my loose powder.  </li>
            <li> My pores are larger, I have some dark spots, and there is a slight scar on my left cheek.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was little apprehensive about how well Neutrogena&#x27;s Nourishing Long Wear Makeup would actually work.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it on a daily basis, simply because the sample I received is a slightly too dark shade for my winter-pale</li>
            <li> Of course, After sweating and body slamming, skating and hip checking for an hour, most make up ends up looking pretty awful.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try and get another shade; I brought my usual foundation with me to try and match, and I just couldn&#x27;t find anything, so I actually probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it unless I was deep into the summer with a tan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I typically wear only tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It feels a little heavy and a little sticky when I first apply it but that only lasts a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And other reviewers aren&#x27;t kidding when they talk about it truly being long wear.  </li>
            <li> This makeup (so far!) has not affected my skin negatively...</li>
            <li> There is no grease or grit that comes with other long wear foundations.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that I wish the bottle was squeeze or a little easier to get the product out.</li>
            <li> The packaging is pretty simplistic, very similar to any other liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> but it was simply too dark!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need a ton of foundation for my skin, but I definitely need it to lighten the dark circles under my eyes and cover some blemishes!</li>
            <li> - The foundation is a little too matte for my personal taste.  </li>
            <li> The difference is subtle, but this is definitely a wearable, long lasting foundation.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to seeing what happens over the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s foundations seem to run pink.</li>
            <li> I felt like this foundation really aged me.</li>
            <li> I did find that it lasted all day with minimal touch ups.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I&#x27;ve seen no real difference in regards to the claim that it will improve my skin.</li>
            <li> A few cons are that it does not last 12 hours like the packaging</li>
            <li> The makeup itself seems quite fluid, but when I applied it I found it immediately dried out my face.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use my bottle, but unsure if I will purchase another when it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> Personally, I did not notice any difference after using it everyday for 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have pink tones in my skin so that was the 1st thing I noticed.</li>
            <li> I will touch back after a few weeks with an update.</li>
            <li> The pink patches were all gone for about 4 hours.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does for me over the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> the make-up actually does withstand everyday wear and tear.</li>
            <li> The makeup was not heavy or thick on my skin.</li>
            <li> I realized how pale I actually am!</li>
            <li> so far I think it is working on some small spots I have on my chin!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried at first because I normally only use expensive foundation.....</li>
            <li> Like I have read from other reviews, the product is darker than you would have expected.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, the bottle makes it difficult to get out the right amount</li>
            <li> In the past month the healthy skin has made my face break out like crazy.</li>
            <li> I was grateful to receive a free sample of this product and was anxious to try it since my expensive foundation I had been using was causing breakouts if I wore it for longer than 4 hours.</li>
            <li> Typically foundation seems to draw out all the areas that are dry and make them stand out.</li>
            <li> My skin is less dry and it just feels healthier.</li>
            <li> Typically foundation seems to draw out all the areas that are dry and make them stand out.</li>
            <li> I received a little bottle of NEUTROGENA® NOURISHING LONG WEAR MAKEUP via BzzAgent about a week ago.</li>
            <li> Neutrgena Nurhing Long Wear Foudation felt a little sticky and gloopy to me.</li>
            <li> This product was a little tough to get out of the bottle, but once it went on it was well worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li> Being pregnant has bad my skin tone become different and splotchy and this make up</li>
            <li> Upon my first use of this product I had a really difficult time getting the foundation of out the bottle.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first because I didn&#x27;t want to feel like I was wearing a mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is something that I would wear in the summer (only time will tell)</li>
            <li> The only disadvantage is that it sometimes makes my skin feel a little oily and makes it look a little shiny.</li>
            <li> The only disadvantage is that it sometimes makes my skin feel a little oily and makes it look a little shiny.</li>
            <li> I have small crows feet that are starting around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I definitely am going to incorporate this product into my everyday use!  </li>
            <li> a pump, due to its consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> My one qualm would be the bottle, it doesn&#x27;t come it easily enough, I am not sure what will happen when it gets to the bottom…</li>
            <li> Got the Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup in the mail a few days ago as part of a bzz campaign.  </li>
            <li> Once you get it out, it&#x27;s comparable to other makeups that I&#x27;ve already used.</li>
            <li> was pretty skeptical.</li>
            <li> and/or use other products to make it manageable, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming it may be due to some perfume in the foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Cover Girl, Maybelline, and other foundations</li>
            <li> but this foundation did not only cover it but somehow diminish the uneven look!  </li>
            <li> wore this the other night at a bachelorette party</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this foundation I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first tried this makeup.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed since I usually love Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> It goes on and stays on all day, does not make my skin oily like other foundations in this price category.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way</li>
            <li> However, I ended up with a flaky forehead, and when I attempted to correct the dryness by adding a tiny bit of moisturizer to the spots that the makeup dried out, it clumped up and formed what felt like little plastic balls on my forehead.</li>
            <li> and I am active at work</li>
            <li> this past week, I have noticed my skin appears less oily and definitely has less shine at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> What I appreciate about this product is that it smooths out my skin and evens out my skin tone which gives me a boost of confidence in the middle of this dreary winter where my skin tends to be noticeably dull and blotchy.</li>
            <li> The only criticism I have with this product is that it is a bit hard to get out of the bottle, but that&#x27;s not a deal-breaker for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely picky when choosing foundation, because I want something lightweight that will cover my slight redness and dark spots around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Then, it was hard to blend it in all over my face because there was so much liquid that got on the sponge and no good way to get it off.  </li>
            <li> I am always looking for products with SPF because I get dark spots on my face from the sun.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the bottle.</li>
            <li> I got a shade too dark and it blended</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the bottle.</li>
            <li> So, using that knowledge I ordered a shade darker in this, too, which ended up being way too dark and orange.  </li>
            <li> I have a medium to dark skin tone</li>
            <li> It worked well for my dark under eye circles too.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the glass bottle.</li>
            <li> The color that was sent is a bit too dark for my face.  </li>
            <li> My problems are two-fold...one, it does not last all day on my skin (perhaps I am too oily late in the day or something) and two</li>
            <li> My only complaint is during the application, I found the makeup to be streaky and when I attempted to fix it, then it became too cakey looking.  </li>
            <li> I have dark spots that have been a nightmare to cover correctly.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and not sheer and it&#x60;s smoothest foundation I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
            <li> It came out slow and then all the sudden would all pour out.  </li>
            <li> It does have a slight &amp;#34;makeup smell&amp;#34;, but the scent it gives off is much less overpowering than that of some of the other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I am unhappy that it the foundation is very noticeable on my forehead, and makes it look dry and unnatural.</li>
            <li> My face has always been oily year round and dry during the harsh winter months.</li>
            <li> Tapping it on my hand doesn&#x27;t work, storing upside down doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> It also helps to tone down my oily spots, while not drying out my drier areas.</li>
            <li> so i feel like when i get down to the bottom of the bottle there</li>
            <li> It is like the ketchup bottles that you shake upside down forever</li>
            <li> I was always afraid long lasting foundation would dry out my already dry skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear make up often, so when I do, I usually notice my face starts to feel itchy, or dry, or like I&#x27;m wearing a mask.</li>
            <li> I have extraordinarily dry skin and usually I use a BB cream instead of foundation because foundation tends to flake off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I hardly ever have any outbreaks, I am now left with pimples in my face in places I never had before, so this might be due to the foundation clogging my pores massively as well, since I&#x27;m on vacation and hardly can blame it on my usually stress-related outbreaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know, I feel ridiculous typing that because it sounds cheesy, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel heavy on and all my other makeup stayed on well with this foundation.  </li>
            <li> I do think that the packaging is bad because the foundation is thick and in order to get anything out of the bottle i have to bang on it to get the foundation to come to the top</li>
            <li> I know that sounds crazy to say but for me I like foundation to make my skin look natural only enhanced</li>
            <li> Maybe applying less would cause less settling, but then what is the point?</li>
            <li> I want a slightly dewy finish so that I don&#x27;t look all cakey.</li>
            <li> In this case, I was less than impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Click to read my review:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> You could see them through the makeup I wore previously.</li>
            <li> it is also a lot less cakey feeling.</li>
            <li> It even seemed to make my skin less oily.</li>
            <li> The only drawback to the product is the packaging - it&#x27;s difficult to get enough out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I tend to have oily skin and by half way through the day, the shine is coming through.  </li>
            <li> I thought the color of nude would be a little dark for my skin.</li>
            <li> less breakouts, less blackheads and a little (although I have rocesea</li>
            <li> I was concerned by how thin of a liquid it is, but really covers up imperfections yet doesn&#x27;t look thick or heavy and doesn&#x27;t feel like it either.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like to use foundation on a daily basis because it makes my skin feel twice as thick, and I don&#x27;t like that feeling.</li>
            <li> There was slight issue covering up any uneven skin tones on my face.</li>
            <li> and it would cause lots of little bumps all over my face.  </li>
            <li> a little cake-y&lt;br /&gt;Settled in creases</li>
            <li> After buying, it was STILL too dark!</li>
            <li> Instead, I&#x27;ve begun using a q-tip to scoop a little out at a time.</li>
            <li> I bought a little make up spoon</li>
            <li> I thought they should have included a little spoon-</li>
            <li> Even my little touch ups went on well.</li>
            <li> I cant wait to see results in as little as 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, even with applying moisturizer to my forehead before I applied the foundation, it still looked weird and dry, just as it did on the rest of my face without the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The only little thing I do not like about this product is the glass bottle as I find it very hard to get the foundation out of it.</li>
            <li> Every small crease around my smile looked exaggerated and the pores on my forehead (which I didn&#x27;t know I had, eek!)</li>
            <li> Its thicker than previous foundations that I&#x27;ve used, but once it sinks into my skin, it does not feel thick or heavy at all.  </li>
            <li> I had thought that maybe once I used the product a little gravity and air pressure would help the product out of the bottle (think about a Heinz ketchup bottle after you have used it a few times).</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is a little hard to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it&#x27;s sometimes hard to get it out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel heavy at all.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I think glass bottles result in a lot of wasted product, when they get to the end.</li>
            <li> so I had applied the Neutrogena moisturizer a few minutes before applying this product.</li>
            <li> DID cover up a few sun spots that I have on my nose and outer</li>
            <li> However, once I spread it onto my face, it does not feel heavy at all.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and has not caused any break-outs or skin problems.  </li>
            <li> I wear make-up everyday</li>
            <li> I got neutrogena 12 hr base to try free from bzzagent</li>
            <li> I do not wear liquid foundation everyday, but gave this a try.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks in a few weeks and also how this will hold up with summer heat and humidity.</li>
            <li> I am NOT a foundation person because I find it always to be either heavy or cakey.</li>
            <li> They feel heavy on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It does not feel cake your heavy.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Smooths out uneven skin tone&lt;br /&gt;Contains</li>
            <li> I did notice a few breakouts around my nose and chin.</li>
            <li> will still be so much wasted.</li>
            <li> The makeup does not feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> If you need uber heavy duty foundation, then this is for you; otherwise I would pass.</li>
            <li> I also have the issue of foundations coming off after a few hours, causing me to lose coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> And after a few weeks, your skin does improve.</li>
            <li> something I tend to have trouble with.  </li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t broken out yet either from this which is always a plus!</li>
            <li> and I will waste my money.</li>
            <li> I do not like heavy coverage</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t want to waste the stuff.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tend to wear foundation, but when I heard that this make-up both helped with uneven skin tone and contained sunblock, I was compelled to try it.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the NYC brand, Neutrogena doesn&#x27;t feel heavy when using it.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I feel like make up base is too thick and feel like I have a mask on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of liquid cover up....</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Clinique and usually break out or am not happy with other brands.  </li>
            <li> Pretty impossible to blend in around the jaw/neck area</li>
            <li> First of all, and maybe this is just my bottle, but it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> says and the bottle is not easy to pour</li>
            <li> downside is the bottle is not easy to use</li>
            <li> While I did notice some brightening of my skin and a little improvement in the skin tone, the results were not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I do dislike the packaging, it can be difficult to get enough product out without spending half your time shaking the glass bottle.</li>
            <li> only real complaint about this product is with the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually too heavy and it tends to make me break out.</li>
            <li> This makeup has never done that, even after a long and exhausting day at work.</li>
            <li> I tend to stay away from liquid foundations and favor BB/CC creams because they are usually too heavy and look unnatural on me.  </li>
            <li> The only con I would say is the packaging because it makes it a little difficult to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> nourishing long wear make up, I thought if may be a bit too dark for my skin tone, but maybe I was wearing the wrong color.</li>
            <li> Its also not super thick in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I was not thrilled with the small opening on the bottle, because I had a little trouble getting the foundation on to my fingertips to apply to my skin.</li>
            <li> I had a bad feeling it would be pretty heavy and thick on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed, as I usually love Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about trying a liquid because it almost always looks too thick and \\&quot;chalky\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This product is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> do agree that the opening is too small.  </li>
            <li> I have bought countless foundations before all claiming the same thing, and was disappointed time and time again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that thick, so the trouble getting it out of the bottle is deceptive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This foundation got rid of the excessive shine that is usually around my nose.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t try drugstore brands</li>
            <li> I usually use powder foundation.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and my nose and forehead are usually my oily areas.</li>
            <li> No more worrying for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I used a small cosmetic sponge wedge) and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a minerals girl, but when I got the chance to try this I figured, why not?</li>
            <li> Going on, it feels thick &amp; heavy</li>
            <li> I also noticed it has no noticeable smell (something that bothers me about some foundations I’ve used in the past.)</li>
            <li> All in all, I was not highly pleased with the product I recieved.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup.</li>
            <li> usually use powder foundation, and haven&#x27;t used liquid foundation for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I guess I am used to my usual foundation that comes in a squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li> I usually apply my foundation about 5:45 in the morning and work until 3:15</li>
            <li> I usually use my fingers to apply foundation and not a make up sponge.</li>
            <li> I thought this makeup was thick and felt heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> I started using it instead of the usual foundation I use which is NYC brand foundation.</li>
            <li> I mean that it corrected some problem areas without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> It was a little thick which made it hard to get it out of the bottle</li>
            <li> and I would say is very heavy coverage.</li>
            <li> You have to turn it upside down and pound it on your hand really hard to get it out!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried when I got it because the bottle was so cold from being in the back of a mail truck in winter.</li>
            <li> never used foundation before because I always hated the look on some women when you can tell a lot was applied specially in the crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> Bottle design -- very narrow neck, hard to pour.</li>
            <li> Bottle design -- very narrow neck, hard to pour.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ignoring the fact that the color was wrong, I had hoped the makeup would \\&quot;settle in\\&quot; throughout the day, but found that my face stayed dry looking</li>
            <li> And, the bottle is longer, so it can be a little tough to get the foundation out.</li>
            <li> hard to get out the bottle.</li>
            <li> The makeup is hard to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I found it hard to find a match for my skintone.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting the makeup to come out.</li>
            <li> I would prefer to not have to work this hard to get makeup out of a bottle but it would not dissuade me from another</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to see)</li>
            <li> it was really hard to get it out of the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time finding one that matched my skin tone but didn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting the foundation of the bottle sometimes.</li>
            <li> One start off for how hard it is to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to BB cream so it felt a little heavy on my skin, nothing uncomfortable though.</li>
            <li> I also have had a really hard time getting this foundation to &amp;#34;flow&amp;#34; out of the bottle because it is so thick.</li>
            <li> The formula isn&#x27;t that thick, but for some reason, it is really hard to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li> that being said, my one complaint is the lack of shade choices.</li>
            <li> The makeup claims to have a tone correcting complex.</li>
            <li> but I know it can take at least a month or two to notice anything.</li>
            <li> It has a thick consistency, but doesn&#x27;t feel thick while you are wearing it.  </li>
            <li> thick to shake and get out of the bottle</li>
            <li> It made me feel like my face had an orange tint and was also thick.</li>
            <li> Product FEELS thick, but lightweight once it&#x27;s on (pro!)works for all of</li>
            <li> This stuff is like a thick ooze.</li>
            <li> It was almost like having a thick layer on your face.</li>
            <li> But maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s lasts all day, as it&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li> Again, I wish it came with some type of scoop to get the product out of the bottle, because it&#x27;s probably too thick of a formula for a pump.</li>
            <li> When I applied the makeup, it didn’t feel too thick.</li>
            <li> started to mix the foundation with my moisturizer, which helps a lot with the orange-ness this makeup causes until this bottle is empty, and then switch back to L&#x27;Oréal.... too bad!</li>
            <li> The glass bottle has a very small opening to get the product out--you can&#x27;t dip in your finger or makeup brush.  </li>
            <li> First, I hated how the bottle was designed.  </li>
            <li> Also, this emphasized my dry patches like crazy</li>
            <li> and I think when it gets low that it will be impossible to get the makeup out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The product bottle design makes it a little difficult to get any of the foundation out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fix this problem, but at least it doesn&#x27;t make it worse.</li>
            <li> I do not like liquid foundation, however mineral powder is not good for occasions where longevity is needed.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not good.  </li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so hard to get the product out of the bottle, though!  </li>
            <li> It is hard to get the make up out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> I was also really shocked at how it lasted all day long.</li>
            <li> But after about a week of use, I&#x27;m disappointed overall.</li>
            <li> Product FEELS thick, but lightweight once it&#x27;s on (pro!)</li>
            <li> It is thick, and you are supposed to pour it out!?</li>
            <li> You need to have a sponge or brush to put this foundation on, and its very difficult to get out of the bottle so be careful!</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s very thick  </li>
            <li> The coverage however was very thick, and i felt like i had something i needed to wipe off my face all day.</li>
            <li> The downfall is the poor packaging.  </li>
            <li> I also have broken capillaries in my cheeks, and this did not cover as well as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I also tend to be on the oily side at the end of the day, and this product doesn&#x27;t make that problem worse for me.</li>
            <li> I wore it every day for a week and each time I looked in the mirror it looked worse.</li>
            <li> See the problem was that it was so thin that it didn&#x27;t cover anything</li>
            <li> If you have poor skin and need coverage, look else where.</li>
            <li> The only problem that I have with this foundation is that it is almost impossible to get it out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it desperately needs a pump as it is quite annoying having to shake the glass bottle to get the foundation out.</li>
            <li> I hate that wet feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> I usually have a very difficult time finding a foundation that doesn&#x27;t cake onto your skin AND is affordable.</li>
            <li> It is a slightly thick substance so it is very difficult to get it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This makeup is quite thick (think chocolate mousse) and almost impossible to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the color didn&#x27;t match my skin at all</li>
            <li> but how wrong I was with this</li>
            <li> Then I tried to get it out and the thickness again made me doubt, but on both counts, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I hate these glass bottles, they get messy after a while.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical trying this because I&#x27;m used to department store brands.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did get a foundation just a tad bit darker than my skin tone</li>
            <li> I was wrong</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying this product.  </li>
            <li> Going to the expensive stores to purchase &amp;#</li>
            <li> : It is extremely difficult to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It was really difficult to get the foundation out.</li>
            <li> I also found it rather difficult to get the liquid out of the bottle that it comes in.</li>
            <li> Sorry guys this was a miss for me.</li>
            <li> , it feels rather sticky and somewhat uncomfortable  on my face, so not at all</li>
            <li> Single worst makeup experience of my life, and</li>
            <li> My personal experience with this makeup was awful, and I admit, I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t use it at all on my forehead because of the weird result :(  </li>
            <li> I was on the verge of cold creaming my hands.</li>
            <li> You also have to use make up remover pads or cold cream to get this stuff off of your face.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would clog my pores and cause me to break out</li>
            <li> I am afraid that I might have had issues because I recieved my product in the mail instead of from the store.</li>
            <li> I was proven wrong!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It was also very difficult to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I just hate the packaging though.</li>
            <li> The bottle design is terrible, I have to shake it like crazy to get the foundation to come out.  </li>
            <li> It worked perfectly as a base foundation for my skin and didn&#x27;t give me any of my &amp;#34;usual&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So if you have porcelain skin and want an all-day base for your make-up, this is your product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed!</li>
            <li> but I HATE the bottle!!</li>
            <li> It looks like the foundation gets stuck there and when the person smiles it looks terrible...</li>
            <li> The one time I tried to apply this foundation without using a make up sponge was very annoying.</li>
            <li> This was so disgusting that I immediately washed and exfoliated my face, then moisturized and tried again.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> and I work 12-hour shifts, so I need a long-lasting makeup that doesnt look terrible by the end of my shift.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My mom loves it so she asked me to buy more for her so she wouldn&#x27;t run off of it</li>
            <li> Finally a non-irritating full coverage makeup that stays put the whole day. Yes, you will still have to blot your t-zone, but this stuff is incredible for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled with this product.  I love Neutrogena but this looks streaky and color is off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand who designed the packaging for this product. The foundation is a liquefied mousse-like texture. Upon my first use of this product I had a really difficult time getting the foundation of out the bottle. I had thought that maybe once I used the product a little gravity and air pressure would help the product out of the bottle (think about a Heinz ketchup bottle after you have used it a few times). However, I found that with each use I am having more and more difficulty getting the product out. Other than the above, the product does have a nice texture and coverage. I just wish I can get it out of the bottle. For now I have no desire to continue to use this product. Once they redesign the packaging/bottle I would be willing to try it again.</li>
            <li> Pretty good!&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad to be a @bzzagent and I received NEUTROGENA® Liquid Long Wear free to try. Unfortunately, the color didn&#x27;t match my skin at all so I gave it to a friend after trying it. The formula felt lightweight and has medium to light coverage, it isn&#x27;t a heavy makeup. It doesn&#x27;t cover blemishes well, but it does even skintone perfectly. The makeup stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t rub off. Good luck finding your perfect shade!</li>
            <li> I got this product through a bzzagent campaign and im very pleased with it. I love how I dont even realize im wearing it because its so light. It matches my skin tine really well and I cant wait to see the effect it has on my complexion.</li>
            <li> i will give this all 5 stars. this product is so easy to use. i love it and will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I currently have neutral feelings toward Neutrogena&#x27;s Nourishing Long Wear Foundation. I have been using this foundation for just under a week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I have very fair skin and sometime finding a shade that works with my skin tone can be tricky - not a problem here - the lightest color worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the coverage of this make up. It went on easy. I initially used my fingers but it applies MUCH easier with a makeup sponge. I have a lot of ice pick scars that were covered up just all right. I seem to get better concealment of scarring from mineral makeups than this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face felt soft and I didn&#x27;t even feel like I was wearing a liquid foundation ore, really, any makeup at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am just now starting to see some new blemishes but since I tend to break out for a number of reasons (stress, hormones, new skin products, etc.) I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s the foundation or not. I will have to continue using this foundation for a couple more weeks in order to really tell if it&#x27;s the cause of my breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part is that the Nourishing Long Wear Foundation lasts ALL day. I was extremely surprised how much make up was on my face at night when I removed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this foundation for people who want to even skin tone, but don&#x27;t necessarily need to hide many scars or blemishes.</li>
            <li> I really like how this made my skin feel and look!! I saw results by the end of my first night wearing it!! It makes me feel so confident!!!</li>
            <li> The coverage and color is on point!! Love that it lasts all day! I will order again - but I HATE the bottle!! You cannot get the full amount as the liquid does not get out of it easily AT ALL.  If this continues to be the type of bottle, it will stop me from buying again!! Neutrogena - FIX THIS PLEASE!!!!</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and received this product to test it.&lt;br /&gt;I never used foundation before because I always hated the look on some women when you can tell a lot was applied specially in the crow&#x27;s feet. It looks like the foundation gets stuck there and when the person smiles it looks terrible... but how wrong I was with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad a tried this product. It  gives my face great coverage without looking all caked up and allows my skin to breathe and lasts the entire day! It is also easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I got this product through BzzAgent. I was a little worried at first because I normally only use expensive foundation.....However, I am VERY happy about this product! It gives GREAT coverage</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this makeup. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now. It reminds me of my BB cream. It helps my overall tone, and I do not feel suffocated when wearing it. It is however a bit heavier than a BB/CC cream. #gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
            <li> I received a full size sample of this product from Bzzagent.com&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this makeup. Once applied, I don&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s there, but it covers and blends fantastically. Despite being lightweight, it stays and lasts all day, even in high humidity and heat. The color is a little darker than I would have liked, but it matched fairly well anyway and I hope it will look even better as summer arrives.  The main problems I find with this product is the package--the bottle is attractive, but very difficult to get the product out of it-- and with its best feature--since this product is long lasting, I find myself using several makeup wipes to remove it all and still needing to scrub with an astringent later to get all the color off my face.</li>
            <li> I got this foundation to try and review from BuzzAgent. In all honesty, I&#x27;ve not worn much foundation in my life and have kept my makeup regimen to mostly eye shadow, mascara, blush, lip gloss and occasionally a bronzer. I was a bit skeptical at first because I didn&#x27;t want to feel like I was wearing a mask. As I applied, I was worried that I got a shade too dark but it smoothed out nicely and blended with my skin perfectly so that I didn&#x27;t even notice it. What I appreciate about this product is that it smooths out my skin and evens out my skin tone which gives me a boost of confidence in the middle of this dreary winter where my skin tends to be noticeably dull and blotchy. I&#x27;m not sure if this is something that I would wear in the summer (only time will tell) but I now consider myself to be a dedicated user of this product during these winter months!</li>
            <li> I was give a bottle of Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-Up to try from Bzzagent.  I&#x27;ve never worn a lot of foundation before because i have very sensitive skin and it would cause lots of little bumps all over my face.  However, this product works great and I don&#x27;t have any bumps with it whatsoever.  The coverage is great, it feels very light in my skin, and it makes me look like I&#x27;m glowing.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will buy it in the future.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-Up through Bzz Agent. I have used the same foundation for years and was a bit hesitant to try something new. I wore this for the first time last week and really liked it. It helped even out my skin tone. It didn&#x27;t feel heavy at all. This make up lasts all day. When I go to take this make up off at night it looks exactly like it did when I put it on in the morning. I love that it has sunscreen as well.</li>
            <li> From someone that never wears foundation, I think I might be a convert. I thought certain the bottle I received through BzzAgent was too dark in color. Then I tried to get it out and the thickness again made me doubt, but on both counts, I was wrong. The color (nude) was perfect. I don&#x27;t have that different color face/neck region. And despite the thickness out of the bottle, I don&#x27;t even realize I am wearing the foundation! Except that I do think my face looks better. I can&#x27;t describe in what way exactly except even, I suppose. I wear it every day now!</li>
            <li> I received this product for free to review from Bzzagent. My first impressions of the product were that I was really pleased that it was fair enough for my skin. I am incredibly fair and my skin is cool so sometimes I have a lot of difficulties finding foundation that is not to orange for my skin. This foundation is very think and I would say is very heavy coverage. I gave it 4 stars because personally I think it can start to look cake-y and masky if you accidentally apply to much. I know that sounds crazy to say but for me I like foundation to make my skin look natural only enhanced so there is such a thing as too much coverage. I also have had a really hard time getting this foundation to &amp;#34;flow&amp;#34; out of the bottle because it is so thick. I actually spilled it all over my bathroom trying to get it onto my sponge yesterday morning. I like that my skin stays matte all day with this foundation and it lives up to its long wearing claims. I have sensitive skin and it has not caused any irritation. A little goes a very long way so this is a good bargain. All and all it is excellent for covering up blemishes and keeping skin matte.</li>
            <li> I love the Long Wear Liquid Make-UP.  It is great looking on the skin.  It lasts for hours and is great for work or a night out.  The tone blends well with skin tone and looks amazing.  I recommend this product.  I love Neutrogena products and continue to use them.  I tend to have less breakouts and my skin seems smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product from BzzAgent.  I love this liquid makeup.  It feels very smooth and light on my skin.  I don&#x27;t use a lot at once, perhaps people who think it feels thick are using too much at once?  Its also not super thick in the bottle.  I&#x27;ve been using it every day since I received it and I think I will replace my Mary Kay foundation with this one!  The color looks great on me, and I had to pick a color choice from a website, I did a great job picking the Ivory color.  It covers up blemishes and red spots and overall makes my skin feel more clear and healthy.</li>
            <li> I use this and love it! It goes on very smoothly and evenly with just my fingers. It lasts all day long and evens out my skintone beautifully!  I got it as a sample from BzzAgent and have been wearing it frequently.</li>
            <li> Great make up! I got this from Bzzagent and it stays on all day. Doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and it is hard to find foundation to match my skin color, along with rosacea. I have worn this make up or 3 days in a row and I thoroughly enjoy it. I work 9-5 and go to school 2 nights a week from 6-8:45. I drive 90 miles to my class and 90 miles home, at the end of my day I still have to wash the make up off! Sot it&#x27;s definitely long lasting as promised. Also, very lightweight in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love the new Neutrogena nourishing Long Wear Make-Up.  The product goes on smooth with a clean finish that leaves my skin glowing.  I love that it offers protection from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays while covering up imperfections on my face.  This foundation lasts all day.  There is no need to reapply on your lunch break, just put it on in the morning and still have the same flawless look at the end of the day.  The ingredients help bring out a new, healthier looking you and since its from Neutrogena you know its a product you can trust. I Received a free sample of this product from BzzAgent</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend this makeup.  I like that this makeup is long lasting. It lasts all day as promised. Also, I like that this makeup provides complete coverage. It helps hide my imperfections well. It is also nice that this product will improve my skin tone and skin condition over time. It has vitamins A, C &amp; E to improve the condition of my skin over time.  However, I have not seen a difference in the condition of my skin yet. Furthermore, I like that is product is easy to dispense and that it is reasonably priced. The only disadvantage is that it sometimes makes my skin feel a little oily and makes it look a little shiny. This is especially true if I use too much.</li>
            <li> Nourishing Long Wear Liquid Makeup Broad Spectrum is full coverage. It is thick and not sheer and it&#x60;s smoothest foundation I&#x27;ve ever worn. Application is like a dream. Blends beautifully and covers everything. It feels much lighter on the skin than it looks in the bottle. And it looks like skin.</li>
            <li> I recently received and tried NEUTROGENA Nourishing Long Wear Makeup for free because I am a Bzzagent. Overall, I would recommend this makeup for several reasons. First, I like that this makeup is long lasting. Second, I like that this makeup provides complete coverage. It helps hide my imperfections well. Third, this product will improve my skin condition over time because it has vitamins A, C &amp; E.  I have not seen a difference in the condition of my skin yet, but I think that is because I have not used it long enough.  Fourth, I like that is product is easy to dispense. Fifth, I like that it is reasonably priced. The only disadvantage is that it sometimes makes my skin feel a little oily and makes it look a little shiny.</li>
            <li> I got this product as part of a free sampling, and I was definitely surprised at how well I liked it. I have been using the Covergirl long-wear foundation, but this definitely feel better on my skin. It  blends really easily and feels lightweight and smooth on my skin. I got a shade that is a little darker than I normally wear, but it is so easy to blend out that I haven&#x27;t had much of an issue. It does a great job at evening out my skin and covering minor redness and marks. The coverage on this is lighter than with the covergirl foundation, so if you are looking for really heavy coverage this may not be the best bet for you. I notice a slight bit of oiliness after 12+ hours of wear, but the makeup doesn&#x27;t seem to crease or cake and still looks great. My only issue is that I wish the bottle was squeeze or a little easier to get the product out. I think glass bottles result in a lot of wasted product, when they get to the end. I will be repurchasing this.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free from BZZ agent, I first use this product Neutrogena Nourishing long wear make up, and it did not seem to blend well with my skin tone and coverage was questionable, but lo- and be hold I think it was user error. I say this because I do not think I shook the make up well enough because today I tried it again and shook the bottle really well. It looked much better on my face and blended beautifully though I think I could have gone one shade lighter due to winter but this will match up much better as I get a little more vitamin D from the sun the color will be perfect. I have perfect looking skin and the few things that I have like puffy eyes and circles under them are my biggest issue. I have small crows feet that are starting around my eyes. It filled in without caking up and cover the dark circles which makes me super happy. I am looking forward to seeing what happens over the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> I really love this new long wear makeup from Neutrogena.  It goes on really lightly and not oily at all- in fact, it is slightly matte, which is great for my combination skin! It works great under my eyes to cover up the bags and dark lines that I can get sometimes!  I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works on correcting dark spots and such, as it is supposed to help even out skin tone- so far I think it is working on some small spots I have on my chin! I definitely am going to incorporate this product into my everyday use!  So glad I got to try this complimentary from BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> At first I was a little apprehensive about the this product. The color that I got was Warm Beige its just a tab bit to light but I make it work. Adding darker setting powder and contouring can work miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the pros and cons about this product for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&lt;br /&gt;-Available at the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;-Long-lasting, it stays put. Only a tiny bit of oil throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;-Price.&lt;br /&gt;-buildable cover, medium to full.&lt;br /&gt;-has SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-limited color selections: open up the shade range please.&lt;br /&gt;-Its hard to get out the bottle. I had to use the handle of a shadow brush to get the product out. (4 star rating)&lt;br /&gt;-Needs a pump, due to its consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this foundation is worth a try. It lasts all day for me and I have had no problems with breakouts! Which is huge for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facts about my skin that may help you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-combination/dry, mainly in the winter and can get oily in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;-sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;-acne-prone.</li>
            <li> I really have iffy on drugstore foundations, but this works! It also does not make me breakout! It has excellent, lasting coverage and the color i chose matches perfectly. I am very impressed with this product and will definitely buy it. My only complaint is that it is a little hard to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product free as part of a campaign with bzzagent.com.  This makeup feels so light on your skin.  I was concerned by how thin of a liquid it is, but really covers up imperfections yet doesn&#x27;t look thick or heavy and doesn&#x27;t feel like it either.  There aren&#x27;t a lot of color options, but they all seem to blend nicely with just about any skin tone, so the quality of the actual makeup is amazing.  However, I&#x27;m really upset by the packaging.  When  I first got it, I was excited by the glass bottle.  It looks sleek, classy, heavy duty.  But then I started wondering, when there isn&#x27;t a lot left in the bottle, how the hell am I supposed to get it out?  You have to stick makeup brushes or q-tips in the glass and still, the opening isn&#x27;t big enough to really get everything.  There is going to be A LOT of waste, so the actual oz amount isn&#x27;t true to how much you&#x27;ll actually get to use.</li>
            <li> I have only used one other kind of liquid foundation continuously (Mary Kay kind), and I usually stick with cream to powder or the FitMe stick. I received a bottle of the Neutrogena Long Wear from BzzAgent and I was reluctant to try it. It went on pretty dark (I got the natural beige), but because I put it on over ELF mineral primer and shook it for a couple of minutes before I used it, it went on perfectly. Just make sure to spread it around with your makeup sponge down under your neck and into your hair line. It made my 32 year old skin look like I was in my 20s. My skin looked absolutely flawless and a little bit shiny like I was very young. LOVE IT. Surprising how much I ended up liking it.</li>
            <li> I got this for free from Bzz Agent, and was very happy with how well the shade matched my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely need to give the bottle a good shake to mix it up before applying, but the coverage is decent, and it absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t have that sticky heavy feeling that other make-ups give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing if continued use really evens out the tone of my skin!</li>
            <li> This product is unbelievable. It evens out my ton. It is very light weight. This product stays on your face and doesn&#x27;t come of. It blends in with your skin tone. I would totally recommend it to a friend. — For Bzzagent Campaign</li>
            <li> Like most women over 35, I have imperfect skin.  My pores are larger, I have some dark spots, and there is a slight scar on my left cheek.  I have tried full coverage foundations before and found them heavy, almost clay-like.  Not to mention, I looked like I was wearing a mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup worked better for me than all others.  I received it free to try through BuzzAgent.com and am seriously impressed.  It covers, is lightweight, and looks natural.  It covers all my \\&quot;trouble\\&quot; areas, all day.  I have also found that I no longer grab my loose powder.  This leaves my face smooth and oil free.  But, best of all, it provides SPF coverage, which is a must for me.&lt;br /&gt;I do agree that the opening is too small.  The first few days entailed thumping the bottle against my hand to get it out--kind of like a ketchup bottle!  Other than that, this is a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this foundation and even more amazing that I got to try it free from BzzAgent. I did not wear foundation consistently before being on this campaign. Pros: The foundation feels smooth and not heavy on your skin. I love the color and blended in my blemishes perfectly. Definitely &amp;#34;Long Wear&amp;#34; and it is nourishing for my skin. The only con I would say is the packaging because it makes it a little difficult to get out of the bottle. I love Neutrogena and this definitely fits their brand.</li>
            <li> SO I will start off by saying that I have never really worn face makeup, as I have been truly blessed with fair and normal skin, really blemish-free except for the occasional pimple once in a blue moon. I am often threaded by my friends as they&#x27;re envious of my skin and how I don&#x27;t have to do anything to it or even wear any makeup! That being said once in a while i like to just paint my whole face and I have used bare minerals mostly but I was excited to try a liquid foundation as I haven&#x27;t had much experience with this type! Anyway, I&#x27;ve now used this product a bunch of times and I am really very pleased with it! I have been putting it on with face moisturizer and using the tips from the Neutrogena website to apply. I love how it looks! It isn&#x27;t strong or apparent at all, I feel like I am not really wearing anything at all! It gives me such a nice glow and looks so nice with eye makeup! I have gotten so many compliments saying that I look like I am glowing, how nice my skin looks, etc. How can I not be pleased! I love the feel, it&#x27;s very silky and super light! I just love that you really don&#x27;t even feel it, plus you can feel that it is still moisturizing and that all the minerals and soy feel so good on the skin! Plus the shade, Buff, was absolutely perfect!! I am so happy there is no perfume and that it comes off easy during removal! It just leaves my skin feeling like there wasn&#x27;t that much on it to begin with! I think Neutrogena did a really good job with this product, I would recommend it to anyone! My one qualm would be the bottle, it doesn&#x27;t come it easily enough, I am not sure what will happen when it gets to the bottom… But whatever! And although, I don&#x27;t use it everyday, I know it&#x27;s doing wonders for my skin and that it makes me look beautiful and makes me feel amazing! (I received this product for free and am reviewing it in return but i am so happy I got the opportunity with this particular product!) Perfect!!!!! Love love love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I received a little bottle of NEUTROGENA® NOURISHING LONG WEAR MAKEUP via BzzAgent about a week ago. I have combination skin, acne marks and prone to breakouts. With this makeup I also used powder on my chin and nose. The difference between this makeup and the one that I usually wear is that is lighter but it also does not least all day, I had to reapply some at evening. I have not suffered any breakouts but my face looks a little more shine than before. Maybe is too soon to write a good review, so I will continue to use it, and see how my skin reacts.</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of this Long Wear Makeup from BzzAgent. I really like the product. My favorite thing about this is that it has SPF. I am always looking for products with SPF because I get dark spots on my face from the sun. I also really like the look and feel of the foundation. It is light and airy, while also providing full coverage. I am definitely a fan! My only complaint is the bottle. I prefer bottles that squeeze, or glass bottles with a pump, because I can get the product out easily. A pump would make it easier to use.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this makeup from Bzzagent. When I first applied this makeup, I was impressed with how easily it blended and covered well. It is a medium coverage makeup, more than a bb cream, but less than a typical heavy foundation. I have dry skin, and this seemed to moisturize well also. However, half-way through the day, I noticed it was settling into my fine lines around my eyes, and my crease in my forehead (I have a deeper line across my forehead). I&#x27;m sure it would last 12 hours like the bottle says, but I don&#x27;t usually keep my makeup on that long anyway. Maybe applying less would cause less settling, but then what is the point? It is also a pain to get out of the jar.  I would prefer the container to be flexible so I can squeeze out as much as I need without wasting it.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup!! I was a little worried when I got it that it would be too dark, but it&#x27;s a perfect match! It goes on smooth, blends well, and stays put . Love how it makes my skin feel and it looks great too! Just found my new foundation!</li>
            <li> Got the Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup in the mail a few days ago as part of a bzz campaign.  I typically use powder foundation as most liquids are difficult to apply and become splotched and horrid looking after hours of wear.  However, the Neutrogena foundation feels extremely light on my face and I feel like it&#x27;s mousturizing my skin while helping it look great.  The hubby is a fan as well and said he can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;m wearing any makeup!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the product.  It matched my skin perfectly, covered my blemished (although I must admit, I don&#x27;t have a ton), and didn&#x27;t make my skin oily by the end of the day.  I am starting to get fine lines, which my daughter loves to so honestly point out.  When I started wearing this she told me, &amp;#34;your face lines are gone Mommy.&amp;#34;  This is a definite plus for me.  The seven year old test is sometimes the toughest.  I wore the foundation all day at work, and it didn&#x27;t come off on everything I touched, and I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed to wash my face as soon as I got home either.  I will definitely recommend this to my friends as well as purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed, I have super oily skin and I am active at work and I wasn&#x27;t shiny after and it felt like I wasn&#x27;t wearing any makeup. I got a shade too dark and it blended so well you can&#x27;t tell. I just wish the bottle was a pump or something. I hate these glass bottles, they get messy after a while.</li>
            <li> The makeup is hard to get out of the bottle. Once you get it out, it&#x27;s comparable to other makeups that I&#x27;ve already used. There&#x27;s nothing that makes this super special, other than that it gives some UV sun protection. The color is good, the makeup itself is kind of thick. It doesn&#x27;t stay put for 12 hours like it says, but it does provide decent coverage. As a bzzagent I got it free and got coupons, but am unsure if I will buy in the future. I&#x27;ll use if for another week and then decide. #GotItFree</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Long Wear Liquid Makeup, for free as a part of a bzzcampaign, because I always wear powder, mineral foundation. I was really impressed! This foundation actually makes my skin look and feel great, unlike most liquid foundations. It went on liquid but once it was blended it felt more like my mineral makeup. I was also really shocked at how it lasted all day long. Typically by the end of the day I&#x27;m ready for a reapply. My only complaint is the bottle. It&#x27;s hard to get the right amount of foundation out at once.  I am so glad I gave Neutrogena&#x27;s Long Wear Liquid Foundation a try. I will definitely keep using it and would recommend it to a friend!</li>
            <li> The foundation initially goes on a little sticky, but once you smooth it out, it creates a great matte finish. It is very long-lasting and my skin was glowing for an entire afternoon and evening out. It feels very light on the skin, unlike some products that feel heavy and goopy. I definitely recommend if you want a clean, light foundation!</li>
            <li> I love the way this product feels on my skin. It&#x27;s light-weight, easy to apply, looks very natural and lasts all day! I just wish the product came in packaging with a pump.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s Nourishing Long Wear Makeup Not Nourishing Enough for Dry, Winter Skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try this foundation and got to try it for free because I&#x27;m a BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently use the Neutrogena oil free facial moisturizer and often use Neutrogena face wash products, like Visibly Clear, too.  So, I had high expectations. I currently alternate between two BB creams (Garnier and Olay) and a MAC foundation and the people at the counter are always surprised at how dark they have to go to get the right color. So, using that knowledge I ordered a shade darker in this, too, which ended up being way too dark and orange.  Pretty impossible to blend in around the jaw/neck area to look natural.&lt;br /&gt;The air has been really dry here in the Midwest this winter so I had applied the Neutrogena moisturizer a few minutes before applying this product. The first day I used my hands to apply the next two days I used the beauty blender.  All three times the foundation and my dry skin did not mix well.  My face would get very flaky and almost patchy/orange in certain (drier) areas.&lt;br /&gt;Ignoring the fact that the color was wrong, I had hoped the makeup would \\&quot;settle in\\&quot; throughout the day, but found that my face stayed dry looking all three days.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;It DID cover up a few sun spots that I have on my nose and outer cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;It DID serve as a good primer when I applied eye makeup - I felt like my eye shadow stayed on well (without a specific eye shadow primer) on the three days that I used it.&lt;br /&gt;It WAS a great matte finish and didn&#x27;t leave my face looking dewey.&lt;br /&gt;Great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Felt a little cake-y&lt;br /&gt;Settled in creases</li>
            <li> My skin looks so flawless with this makeup and I&#x27;m starting to notice definite improvements in my skin&#x27;s condition and quality! I could not be happier with this foundation and cannot wait to try more Neutrogena products!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was little apprehensive about how well Neutrogena&#x27;s Nourishing Long Wear Makeup would actually work. I have bought countless foundations before all claiming the same thing, and was disappointed time and time again. This time around, I was pleasantly surprised. Not only did the foundation hold up, but I could almost see immediate results with my skin&#x27;s texture. It went on smooth and I didn&#x27;t need a lot of the product to get full coverage. I also loved how it hid small blemishes on my skin saving me an extra step and not having to use concealor. And to just give you an idea on how well Neutrogena&#x27;s nourishing long wear makeup stood up, after a 16 hour day including getting caught in a shower on my walk back to the office from lunch I still looked put together that evening when I went to go wash my face. If I wasn&#x27;t a fan before, I am now!</li>
            <li> I found it hard to find a match for my skintone. Neutrogena&#x27;s foundations seem to run pink. I settled on &amp;#34;Buff&amp;#34; and have been using it for about two weeks. It&#x27;s pretty good. It evens out my skin tone, provides decent coverage and brightens my complexion. The makeup lasts about 8 hours which is not bad for my skin type. It smooths on easily and blends in well. I just hate the packaging though. It&#x27;s very difficult to get out of the bottle. A pump would have helped immensely. Overall, a good product at a decent price. I received a sample as part of a Bzz Agent campaign.</li>
            <li> I got this free from BzzAgent. The color match was great, but even using it after moisturizer, it made my skin flake and didn&#x27;t look good. If you don&#x27;t have dry skin issues, it&#x27;s probably much better. And I have to agree with others...a pump would make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and received the Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear foundation to review. When I first applied the Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear, I was really impressed. I have a hard time finding foundations that match my fair skin. I have pink undertones and most foundations are too cool or too orange for me whereas this Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear was a PERFECT match for my skin tone. It really evened out my skin tone by correcting some redness to give a nice even look to my complexion. I appreciate that the coverage was so solid for what I would call a medium-coverage foundation, by that I mean that it corrected some problem areas without feeling heavy. I did need to use concealer for my some specific problem areas, but I expect that from most any foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really pleased that the foundation has SPF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as the day wore on, I noticed pretty early that the foundation was settling into fine lines and pores in a way that was very unflattering. I felt like this foundation really aged me. Every small crease around my smile looked exaggerated and the pores on my forehead (which I didn&#x27;t know I had, eek!) looked huge! I feel like the foundation has 12 hour staying power, but I feel like I want to remove it long before the 12 hours is up. I&#x27;d never used a face primer before, but I decided to pick up a primer to try with this foundation. After trying it, I can say that the primer GREATLY improved the look of this product. I wouldn&#x27;t have kept wearing the foundation without a primer, but now it looks beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often worry that when I switch to a new skincare product, my skin - which is combination dry/regular - will freak out. This foundation did not cause me to break out, which was a relief. I have not noticed a difference in skin tone or texture, but it has not been the full four weeks that the description recommends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my feelings about this foundation are mixed. I wish I didn&#x27;t need another product (face primer) to use this product, but I&#x27;m so happy with the color match and the staying power that I think I will keep wearing Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this foundation for a week and like it. It is a long wearing foundation with medium coverage. I did find that it lasted all day with minimal touch ups. I did not like the packaging, a pump would be much better or even a larger opening, thit did not seem large enough to get the product out. I did receive this foundation from bzzagent.com so I did not get a great color match. I will purchase a different color, but overall I really like this foundation and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it.  I was fortunate enough to be able to sample this as a Bzz Agent and it felt amazing.  Looked smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li> I was chosen by BzzAgent to try this product and they sent me a full bottle to sample.  It is a great foundation and It really does last all day.  It is a tad thicker than I am used to, so it takes a little more effort to apply.  However, once I spread it onto my face, it does not feel heavy at all.  It has a light fresh feeling and stays put.  Overall, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised as to how much I liked the Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Foundation! I got to try it free via BzzAgent &amp; I was pretty skeptical. I don&#x27;t like heavy coverage &amp; because my skin is getting more dry the older I get I&#x27;m very picky! I want a slightly dewy finish so that I don&#x27;t look all cakey. This lasts all day without drying my face out or becoming oily. I had to pick out my color online so I was pretty concerned about how it would match, but it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy to match&lt;br /&gt;Not drying or oily&lt;br /&gt;Lasts most of the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Have to store bottle upside down for ease of use</li>
            <li> I love this makeup - it goes on easy and lets skin breathe!  I love that is has SPF and helps to even skin tone.  I would definitely recommend this makeup to anyone and everyone!!</li>
            <li> I’ve been using Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup in nude that I received from BzzAgent #igotitfree. Overall, it is a pretty good foundation, it’s not too heavy and I feel that it has plenty of coverage for my complexion. I love the fact that it has 20 SPF but unsure of how it would feel on my skin during warmer months. It claims to improve your skin after a month of use, and I do feel my skin has been more even and smoother but I did notice a couple breakouts. I do dislike the packaging, it can be difficult to get enough product out without spending half your time shaking the glass bottle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this foundation. I&#x27;m extremely picky when choosing foundation, because I want something lightweight that will cover my slight redness and dark spots around my eyes. This foundation is lightweight, breathable, reduces my redness and looks flawless. I would compare this to higher end brands, like Benefit. My only complaint would be that it desperately needs a pump as it is quite annoying having to shake the glass bottle to get the foundation out.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t wear coverup, in fact I only wear Mascara because I like a very natural look. This product was true to it&#x27;s skin tone, and I love it! I now use it occasionally. It is very light, and blends in very well. It also lasts all day while I am at work,l which can be up to 10 hours or more in a day! Amazing!</li>
            <li> This foundation goes on light and easy and has amazing coverage! It&#x27;s my new go to! It has lots of colors so you can choose what is right for you.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of this Neutrogena make-up from BzzAgent.  My opinions of the product are 100% my own.  I have been using the foundation for a couple of weeks now.  It is a little thicker than I normally use and requires several seconds of shaking prior to application.  It goes on and blends nicely, which I really like.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and has not caused any break-outs or skin problems.  I also like that it is long wearing AND provides SPF protection. I would definitely recommend this product and plan to buy it once I run out.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I received this as a free sample from BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve had this foundation for about a month now, and I&#x27;ve been waiting to to review it until I&#x27;d given it a solid chance. I haven&#x27;t used it on a daily basis, simply because the sample I received is a slightly too dark shade for my winter-pale skin.&lt;br /&gt;  Positives: they were not joking about the long wear capabilities. I&#x27;ve fallen asleep with it on, and my pillowcase was just as white the next morning as it had been the night before. There are some downsides to that, but I&#x27;ll get to those in a moment. It goes on pretty smoothly, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m covered in glop. I feel like I can get good coverage without it being obvious that I&#x27;m wearing foundation.&lt;br /&gt;  Negatives: They weren&#x27;t kidding about the long wear. The one time I tried to apply this foundation without using a make up sponge was very annoying. I washed my hands with no effect, and I finally had to scrub the make up off with a towel. I was on the verge of cold creaming my hands. You also have to use make up remover pads or cold cream to get this stuff off of your face. Additionally, I&#x27;ve seen no real difference in regards to the claim that it will improve my skin. I have dry skin, and I&#x27;ve actually started tapering off using this make up because I don&#x27;t like the way it highlights any flaky bits.&lt;br /&gt;  Overall, the real question is, would I purchase this for myself? Probably, if I could find the correct shade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using neutrogena products for years. I bounce back and forth between the ski clearing foundation and healthy skin. In the past month the healthy skin has made my face break out like crazy. I switched brands and started using MAC and became an avid user of their pro longwear foundation. When neutrogena came out with a longwear foundation I decided to try it thinking the two products would have similarities at a lower cost. I love the longwear. It&#x27;s great on my skin, gives me great coverage and lasts literally all day. The only drawback it the range of colors. I have a medium to dark skin tone and I need yellow undertones in my foundation which I found in the MAC foundation. But the price difference is so large.</li>
            <li> I got the opportunity through BZZ Agent to try this new brand of make-up. I wear make-up everyday and I always have a hard time finding a make-up color that matches my skin, but this blended perfectly. It goes on smooth and silky, but does not make you feel oily which is great. A few cons are that it does not last 12 hours like the packaging says and the bottle is not easy to pour so you a lot more of the product comes out then you want.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample from bzzagent and I am so glad I decided to give it a go. I&#x27;m the type of person that likes to stick with what I know but I am really excited about this make up. It has great coverage and blends right in to my skin tone, it feels smooth and I don&#x27;t have to touch up throughout the day, I will defiantly be getting this again!</li>
            <li> I was very impressed  by the coverage , it matched my skin perfectly  it&#x27;s a medium coverage. looks natural, long wearing, it has spf 20  so don&#x27;t use it if you are taking picture at night.&lt;br /&gt;negative point it doesn&#x27;t come out with pump but you can use a q tip.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very thick  that&#x27;s positive because that you can use less foundation  it dosen&#x27;t oxidize the texture it&#x27;s super light.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like most women, having the right foundation is key to putting a makeup look together. When you&#x27;re looking for a long wear makeup, it is especially important to find the right one for you. I have typically had a lot of success with liquid foundations, especially if the formula is creamy enough to add in my own moisturizer to offset any drying properties in the make up itself. In this case, I was less than impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Click to read my review:&lt;br /&gt;  The packaging is pretty simplistic, very similar to any other liquid foundation. It does have a slight &amp;#34;makeup smell&amp;#34;, but the scent it gives off is much less overpowering than that of some of the other brands I have tried. I appreciate the SPF 20, especially being a fair skinned person, because this is just nice to have in any foundation since it will eliminate a step in your routine. The makeup itself seems quite fluid, but when I applied it I found it immediately dried out my face. It did, however correct the tones under my eyes, which had the product not dried my face out, would have immediately sold me on it. However, I ended up with a flaky forehead, and when I attempted to correct the dryness by adding a tiny bit of moisturizer to the spots that the makeup dried out, it clumped up and formed what felt like little plastic balls on my forehead. This was so disgusting that I immediately washed and exfoliated my face, then moisturized and tried again. Same result, only this time no flakes just dry patches. My personal experience with this makeup was awful, and I admit, I am disappointed. I expected more from this brand, and with &amp;#34;Nourishing&amp;#34; in the product title I thought I would get it. Sadly, no, and this makeup has been relegated to the back of the closet for fingerpainting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup*&lt;br /&gt;Overall Review:&lt;br /&gt;2 out of 5 Stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: While I was initially impressed with the sunscreen and tone correctiveness of this makeup, the fact that it dried out my skin so drastically and turned into little skin colored plastic like balls after having moisturizer put over those spots leave me with no choice but to give a less than positive review. Bottom line? Single worst makeup experience of my life, and I would not recommend it for dry to normal skin. If you have oily skin, it may be worth a try simply for the tone correction, especially in the under eye area.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical trying this because I&#x27;m used to department store brands.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well it covered.  The color match was perfect.  It feels light on my skin. Overall I&#x27;d give this an excellent rating and I&#x27;d definitely use it again.</li>
            <li> I play roller derby which is an extremely athletic and challenging sport, that has the cool side that we also like to look good while we&#x27;re playing. Of course, After sweating and body slamming, skating and hip checking for an hour, most make up ends up looking pretty awful. When I got Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Foundation to try through BzzAgent, I was super excited to see if it could stand up to the the literal beating I sometimes take.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed! Not only does it go on smooth and blend naturally, but it really does stay and keep its awesome flawlessness.  Add in the fact that its got 20 spf and I&#x27;m a sensitive redhead who shudders in the sun and you&#x27;ve got one happy, sexy looking derby player who totally believes in Long lasting coverage! Thanks Nuetrogena!</li>
            <li> I received Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-up free as a BzzAgent.  I&#x27;ve been a long time user of the Cover Girl Oil Control foundation and have had great success with it.  This is the first new foundation I have tried in a while.  It has worked well.  My complexion is quite oily - so I was worried it would cause issues with this, but it has not.  It has a thick consistency, but doesn&#x27;t feel thick while you are wearing it.  It lasts through the work day for me. Toward the afternoon, with a quick application of powder it looks like new. I will definitely consider buying it again.  The Ivory shade works perfect with my fair complexion.</li>
            <li> I got neutrogena 12 hr base to try free from bzzagent and I love this product. it goes on so smooth and evened out my skin tone and lasted the full 12 hrs for me. I put it on that morning and it lasted till I washed it off that night.</li>
            <li> I really liked this concealer.  It went on smoothly and has medium coverage.  I also use it as a concealer when I do not feel like covering my entire face!  Overall, I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I received this product for free from Bzz Agent, and I&#x27;m really glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal skin, but I&#x27;m very fair and have freckles.  This foundation was light on my skin, yet provided medium, buildable coverage.  It evened out my skin tone beautifully, and I love the velvety finish.  It did not quite last the 12 hours promised, but a few spot touch-ups after 8 hours kept it going strong all night.  Classic Ivory was a great match for my skin tone and it looked and felt natural.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so hard to get the product out of the bottle, though!  A pump would be perfect for this foundation.  It&#x27;s not that thick, so the trouble getting it out of the bottle is deceptive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not expect to like this foundation as much as I do.  I normally use BB cream, but this has been my go-to every morning since I received it.  The sun protection is a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very, very happy with this foundation.  It makes me look like I&#x27;m wearing a better version of my own skin, which is all you can ask for!</li>
            <li> This is a great quality product for a very affordable price. It covers well and wears well throughout a long day. The color options are also wonderful because there are a lot of options and I might even switch between two depending on the time of year and how tan I am. The ONLY thing I DISLIKE is the packaging. It is a slightly thick substance so it is very difficult to get it out of the bottle. I love that the bottle is glass but a pump would have been nice.</li>
            <li> I really like the coverage I get with the new Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-up.  It&#x27;s very smooth and even, and feels light on your skin while providing really great coverage.  The downfall is the poor packaging.  The glass bottle has a very small opening to get the product out--you can&#x27;t dip in your finger or makeup brush.  The product is so thick that it doesn&#x27;t easily pour out of the opening, and you spend some time trying to coax the foundation out of the bottle.  This product needs to be in a squeeze tube or jar with a larger opening to be really useful.  I would definitely buy again, but will continue to curse the packaging! #GotItFree</li>
            <li> This product was a little tough to get out of the bottle, but once it went on it was well worth the trouble.  It went on smooth, covered well, and lasted all day with no touch-up needed.  If this thing had a pump, it would be a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I received this makeup thru my Bzz agent campaign. I will have to say I am not the best at wearing or applying makeup, but mainly because everything I purchase is either to heavy, cakey, or makes me break out. However, when I received the Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Foundation I was surprised. It is so light and airy and barely feels like you have anything on. I have several blemishes and scars and I didn&#x27;t even have to use concealer with this foundation. I am sold on this and will never buy another brand ever. I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> I would have never tried this product if it weren&#x27;t for BzzAgent!  They gave me a chance to try this out and I have to say that it works wonders!  My skin is very fair and freckled.  This foundation goes on smooth, blends well and leaves my skin feeling fresh and not greasy.  Even after wearing it all day, I find that my skin is still looking and feeling great.  I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I got this product for free via BzzAgent.  I do not wear liquid foundation everyday, but gave this a try.  I received the ivory and it was a perfect match for my skin.  It went on smooth and gave me an even skin tone once applied.  I like that when applied it does not looked caked on, but natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was hard to get the perfect amount out due to the bottle.  It came out slow and then all the sudden would all pour out.  Neutrogena claims that your skin will be softer after using this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks and so far haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big foundation girl, but I am a Neutrogena girl. I was using their Healthy Skin Glow Sheers when I got a free bottle of this to try out through BzzAgent. I liked how it covered better than the Glow Sheers, but I didn&#x27;t feel like I looked cakey or covered in makeup. It looked natural and flawless. It worked well for my dark under eye circles too. I still wear moisturizer underneath, which I think helps smooth on the makeup. It looks great and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Received product to review through Bzzagent. Ok, so I was a skeptic. I thought, \\&quot;How is makeup going to fix facial flaws?\\&quot; Well, I have to admit, I have seen a major difference in the 2 weeks since I&#x27;ve started using the Neutrogena nourishing long wear make up. The flaws I paid attention to the most, were a large dark freckle type spot and another red spot, both on my cheek/jaw area. You could see them through the makeup I wore previously. When I first applied the Neutrogena nourishing long wear make up, I thought if may be a bit too dark for my skin tone, but maybe I was wearing the wrong color. After a few minute though, it kind of evened out. It does last all day, as it claims, and also even put skin tone, provides good coverage, and applies easy and smooth. Now, after 2 weeks, the dark and red spot have absolutely faded. The makeup covers them well, but when I take off the makeup, I can tell they have lightened. My skin also seems to have cleared up, with fewer acne breakouts. I&#x27;m now a huge fan of Neutrogena nourishing long wear make up. I&#x27;ll continue to be a faithful user after the campaign is over!</li>
            <li> Overall, I have been very happy with this product. I found that it really did improve the tone and texture of my skin. Also, the color is a perfect match with my typically hard-to-match skin tone. Finally, this product offers a light but complete coverage - I have lots of small imperfections and blotches on my face, and this makeup is great at evening them out so they&#x27;re almost unnoticeable. The only drawbacks are that the product realistically lasts about eight hours (not 12) and the bottle is a pain because it&#x27;s not squeezable and doesn&#x27;t have a pump.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product out and I just loved it right away!  It goes on so smooth and wears long, I also loved that it has sunscreen in it, so it saves me a step in the summer.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Great coverage. Blends right in. My face feels so smooth and I dont have to worry about touching my makeup in a few hours</li>
            <li> I received Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup for free for participating in a BzzAgent Campaign. I was a little hesitant about trying a liquid because it almost always looks too thick and \\&quot;chalky\\&quot;.I did a side by side comparison with makeup and without to see the full transformation. I still look like myself and not like I have pound of makeup on my face. I have not determined whether the claims of this particular foundation being tone correcting, but it does a good job at covering the dark spots and dark circles under my eyes. The Neutrogena.com site states it takes about 4 weeks and I will continue to use to see if it actually evens out my skin tone. It has Anti-oxidant enriched soy to help smooth and refine age spots and discolorations as well as, Vitamin A + C + E to help nourish skin and brighten skin tone. The light-diffusing powders camouflage imperfections and mask fine lines. The lines around my eyes completely evened out! I like the fact that it is SPF 20 and it will further protect my skin from damage. This would be a good makeup to use in the summer. I have combination Skin so in the summer my T Zone get super oily. This foundation got rid of the excessive shine that is usually around my nose. I received the warm beige 90 which is the darkest color they have unfortunately because I need something with a warm copper tint not beige for it to look more natural. The application work all day. Over all I think it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I feel like make up base is too thick and feel like I have a mask on. This product was great, it goes on thin and I didn&#x27;t need a lot of it to even out my skin tone. It lasted most of the day and looked great on camera. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I got this makeup for free from bzz agent. It is better than any drug store foundation I&#x27;ve tried. It looks great, covers well, and is easy to blend. The only complaint I have is the glass bottle. I had a hard time getting the makeup to come out.</li>
            <li> I am always changing my foundation because I enjoy trying new products and finding the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; product that both makes me look good and feel good. I received Neutrogena&#x27;s long wear foundation in the lightest shade for free thanks to bzzagent.com. I wish the bottle had a pump or something to get the product out more easily, but was also surprised at how thick and moisturizing this foundation seems to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I frequently have long days where I can&#x27;t touch up my make up, so I am excited to see how this product performs. The lightest shade is a good march for my fair skin tone, but it has a bit of a yellow undertone whereas I feel my skin is more pink, but it was easily blended into my skin. This foundation dries quickly which is great, so I can apply my powder sooner and don&#x27;t need to worry about a sticky mess! I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks in a few weeks and also how this will hold up with summer heat and humidity.</li>
            <li> I have really been surprised I liked this as much as I do. I usually don&#x27;t try drugstore brands but I received this to try as a bzzagent and I am so glad I did. It matches really well and lasted all day. I have read some reviews where people state it doesn&#x27;t cover well.  All I am covering is some pores and it has worked pretty good for me. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to wear a lot of make up, especially foundation, but I have to say, I&#x27;m a huge fan of this Neutrogena foundation. I was given this product by BzzAgent specifically to review it. I honestly didn&#x27;t have high hopes. I don&#x27;t like wearing make up that I can feel on my skin. But when I put this on, it truly was nourishing. I know, I feel ridiculous typing that because it sounds cheesy, but it&#x27;s true. The best way I can describe it is that it feels like I&#x27;m putting very light, silky lotion on my face when I&#x27;m applying it. It rubs right into my skin and dare I say -- feels soft and nice. And then it feels... gone. Not cakey, not tacky, not sticky, not heavy. I can honestly say I forget I&#x27;m wearing it. And visually, it looks great. The color is also a great match for my skin, which I owe to the fact that they offer so many great skin tones to choose from. At the end of the day, the make up still looks great and while it was long lasting like advertised, it wasn&#x27;t hard to remove. Also, I tend to have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t bother my skin at all!  All in all, I&#x27;m a Neutrogena foundation convert. It made my skin look great and more importantly, feel great. It also contains vitamins A, C &amp; E, which as we all know is helpful for healthy skin. I definitely would recommend it, especially because it is SPF 20 (skin protection is crucial for me, especially in SOCAL.)</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this foundation but it was simply too dark! After I received my sample and it wasn&#x27;t a good color, I ventured out to find a paler shade at my local Ulta. After buying, it was STILL too dark! The formula made my skin greasy and I looked like a clown. I wanted to love it, but it just didnt work.</li>
            <li> My face has always been oily year round and dry during the harsh winter months. I am always open to trying new things and am so glad I did! Unfortunately I did get a foundation just a tad bit darker than my skin tone (it&#x27;ll be perfect for the summer). No matter, because once I blended it in well my skin looked great! It definitely maintained my oily skin throughout the day, and made my pores look smaller. It hasn&#x27;t lasted all day for me yet (I teach during the day and go to school at night, so sometimes my days are 12+ days). I would definitely recommend this product to others!</li>
            <li> Considering I have never tried Neutrogena&#x27;s makeup before, I was actually impressed with the coverage for this. I used this all day and the only thing that I would say is that my skin is not oily, and as I used this I noticed that my skin was a tad bit oily. Overall, I really liked this makeup especially the color range.</li>
            <li> Years ago I had a Covergirl lotion/foundation that I loved. It was lightweight and smoothed and moisturized at the same time. Well, they stopped making it so I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement ever since. Thanks to Bzzagent, I got to try this Neutrogena Long Wear Foundation for free and it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for! It&#x27;s lightweight, I don&#x27;t even notice that I&#x27;m wearing it. It smooths just enough to smooth out my complexion but it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup - a nice natural look. It doesn&#x27;t get greasy feeling throughout the day but it lasts all day and keeps my skin feeling soft throughout the day. This is my new favorite foundation and I hope Neutrogena keeps making it for a long time!</li>
            <li> This foundation has great coverage and went on very easily. It has a powder finish and stayed on for about 10 hours. I absolutely loved the feel of it on my skin, it wasn&#x27;t too heavy or thick feeling like other long wearing foundations that I have tried/used in the past. The only problem that I have with this foundation is that it is almost impossible to get it out of the bottle! You have to turn it upside down and pound it on your hand really hard to get it out! The formula isn&#x27;t that thick, but for some reason, it is really hard to get out of the bottle. I would recommend either a pump on the bottle or an easier way to get the foundation out. That is the only reason this foundation didn&#x27;t get five stars</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s: Affordable, good quality, fine, highly pigmented, reasonably long wearing.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: No pump, hard to get out once the bottle is half full.</li>
            <li> I think the foundation is a good product, but doesn&#x27;t fully cover the redness on the bridge of my nose and cheeks.  The bottle design is terrible, I have to shake it like crazy to get the foundation to come out.  I was afraid it would clog my pores and cause me to break out but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be happening.</li>
            <li> I really like this foundation.  It was a little thick which made it hard to get it out of the bottle but it applied beautifully. My skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> I usually use powder foundation. But I received this a trial and the packaging was nice, the product was fragance free, and high quality. The coverage however was very thick, and i felt like i had something i needed to wipe off my face all day. I will admit if you prefer full coverage and want very long lasting this would be the product to buy. For now I will stick with my powder foundation.</li>
            <li> I like the coverage of the product, and I like the way it feels on my face.  The color that was sent is a bit too dark for my face.  I&#x27;ve had a hard time blending it to the point where I would feel comfortable wearing it out and about.  With that being said, I&#x27;ve been wearing it at home, and I do think there are some great benefits.  I like to coverage and it helps with my redness. I&#x27;ve noticed that if I use a foundation brush to apply that I get the best results.  I think it settles in my fine lines a bit, but I think with a better shade it will resolve the issue.  I will be using the enclosed coupons to purchase a lighter shade and try it again.  It has promise. I received a free sample of the product to try and review from bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li> I had the chance to try out a sample of this foundation, and I was really excited to test it out. But after about a week of use, I&#x27;m disappointed overall. First of all, and maybe this is just my bottle, but it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get out of the bottle. Tapping it on my hand doesn&#x27;t work, storing upside down doesn&#x27;t help. Instead, I have to use a mini scoop to get product out. I have combination skin, and my nose and forehead are usually my oily areas. Within three hours, I was oily. I also have broken capillaries in my cheeks, and this did not cover as well as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of foundation. It&#x27;s usually too heavy and it tends to make me break out. But I received Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear from BzzAgent and decided to give it a try. The shade selection was pretty small (maybe because it&#x27;s a new product). I have medium, olive skin and chose medium beige. The color was slightly dark for me, but I think it&#x27;ll be a good match for my tanned summer skin. I&#x27;m used to BB cream so it felt a little heavy on my skin, nothing uncomfortable though. And it truly is LONG lasting. I dabbed some on my hand before applying it to my face with a brush and I could see the foundation spot on my hand even after washing (and rubbing!) it.</li>
            <li> I have never worn foundation in my entire life, never even tried it. I always viewed it as something that would make me look fake and painted and surely wouldn&#x27;t be any good for my skin. I received Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear from BzzAgent and read up on how it can actually improve my skin tone. My skin&#x27;s health and appearance are a huge priority to me so a product that does something beneficial to my skin and improves the appearance immediately was definitely something worth trying for me. My skin does not look fake or caked on, it actually looks great, very nice and clear. I was pleasantly surprised and don&#x27;t mind having foundation as part of my makeup routine now....I can&#x27;t believe I ever did without it. I also believe I am starting to see a difference in my skin without makeup. I am very glad I had the chance to try this product and see what I was missing out on. I will definitely continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this formula. I got it as a sample from BzzAgent and have been wearing it frequently. Every time I wear it, I get compliments on how good my skin looks. It feels light and doesn&#x27;t feel or look cakey as some foundations do. My only criticism is that the bottle is not well-designed. You have to shake it really hard to get the makeup out, and then too much can easily come pouring out. Instead, I&#x27;ve begun using a q-tip to scoop a little out at a time. It really would be better if the bottle were designed with a pump on top instead of the screw-top.</li>
            <li> I usually only use department store cosmetics, but after receiving a bottle of the long wear makeup I decided to give it a try.  I loved the all-day coverage and it didn&#x27;t make my face feel oily or dry.  I am sold!  I loved it!</li>
            <li> I am NOT a foundation person because I find it always to be either heavy or cakey. I have tried many different kinds in the past and none of them really covered my blackheads effectively, and certainly didn&#x27;t look natural. This stuff is awesome! It is light, looks natural and literally made my blackheads (on my nose) disappear by covering them completely naturally!  I love this stuff. FINALLY a solution!</li>
            <li> I received this bottle of makeup by taking part in a campaign on BzzAgent. It doesn&#x27;t cover dry skin as well as I would like, but if you scrub your skin and get it really fresh, the coverage is impeccable. It also feels light on my skin. I have combination skin, and it looked great all day. It truly does improve your complexion as well. I was very happy with the make up and would definitely recommend it to others. I also mix it occasionally with my daily facial lotion and that proves to be a great tinted moisturizer. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> After using this foundation just once I am already in love with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it in Classic Ivory and it looked very pale in the container. Upon comparing it against my face I realized how pale I actually am! It was a perfect match to my skin colour and it looks barely noticeable and completely natural while providing great coverage and evening my skin tone and flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very easy to apply with a makeup sponge and it was a light, non-greasy texture that feels great on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with it is that it comes in a glass jar with a small opening and, due to the relatively thick consistency of the foundation (Which actually makes it very easy and great to apply) it is quite difficult to get out of the bottle and on to my sponge. However, that is a very minor issue and easily overlooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it for free from BzzAgent but its retail price is amazing value for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping in mind that this is foundation is also meant to improve your skin tone over time and is also SPF 20, I thoroughly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was grateful to receive a free sample of this product and was anxious to try it since my expensive foundation I had been using was causing breakouts if I wore it for longer than 4 hours. This neutrogena went on smooth and was easy to apply and I really like how the color blended. It felt light and did its job and best of all- no breakouts even after 8+ hours of wear!</li>
            <li> I love how light this foundation is. It blends well with a nice color and it stays light and smooth on the skin throughout the day. As someone who wears foundation on daily bases I look for products that are easy to use, light on the skin, protect and don&#x27;t run or look weird after a few hours. I love how this foundation held up trough out the day, it&#x27;s not greasy or runny. The smooth consistency applies more like a cream than a runny makeup and less goes a long way when covering. I definitely recommend it to all my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of this via the BzzAgent campaign. The product went on so smoothly and evenly and covered all my problem areas! I just wish it was a bit more matte because I still had to put powder on top of it, but overall this is a really nice addition to a makeup collection!</li>
            <li> I recently got this product from BzzAgent and after using it for less than a week, I am already pretty impressed! I already notice a change in my overall complexion, even though it&#x27;s only been a few days. It stays on a lot longer compared to the foundation that I used to use... it is also a lot less cakey feeling. I usually don&#x27;t like to use foundation on a daily basis because it makes my skin feel twice as thick, and I don&#x27;t like that feeling. But with this product, I don&#x27;t even notice that I am wearing makeup. It is nice and light, while create great coverage for acne, redness, and other skin problems. I also tend to be on the oily side at the end of the day, and this product doesn&#x27;t make that problem worse for me. It doesn&#x27;t fix this problem, but at least it doesn&#x27;t make it worse. Overall, I would definitely recommend this item to anyone!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I got it from BzzAgent.  I wore it the first day and was impressed on how light weight it was but was concerned that it wasn&#x27;t going to hold up to its LongWear promise -but I was wrong it really lasted all day and had great coverage!&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again and again</li>
            <li> I got this product for free to try from BzzAgent. This makeup went on smooth and easy- felt very light weight on my face. I have sensative skin and I was suprised that I didn&#x27;t get any irritation from this makeup at all! The tone blended nicely and it did a pretty good job of covering up minor acney. Good product to add to your collection- skip the expensive and go for what works</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying this product.  After all, I&#x27;ve tried makeup that&#x27;s made these claims of being lightweight and long lasting with great coverage before with VERY little success.  However, I thought it was worth a shot since I got to try it for free from bzzagent.  Let me tell you, I&#x27;m a believer now!  This makeup really does do what it says!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the coverage is excellent.  With most foundations, you can take just one look and tell you are wearing a heavy coverup.  Not so with Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-up.  It&#x27;s lightweight, but really evens out my skin tone.  I have a lot of redness, but this works great to cover it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t like the feel of most foundations.  They feel heavy on my skin.  I feel caked up and unable to smile, because there&#x27;s so much make up on my face.  If the foundation isn&#x27;t that way, it doesn&#x27;t seem to offer any coverage at all or disappears.  This make up, though, once you rub it in, feels almost powdery and silky smooth.  I promise you&#x27;ll forget you&#x27;re even wearing it.  It works great and feels great, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, this make up claims to be long wearing.  Most foundations that I&#x27;ve used before disappear on my skin within an hour.  I quickly lose interest in them, because I don&#x27;t want to be reapplying hour after hour or even worrying that my make up will disappear.  This stayed on my skin until I took it off.  It really did last the 12 hours that they say it did!  No more worrying for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this makeup is a little expensive, but I promise you, you&#x27;ll love it!  Give it a try once, and you&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li> I generally wear BB creams or tinted moisturizers, but lately I&#x27;ve needed a little more coverage. I still didn&#x27;t want to have that &amp;#34;foundation face&amp;#34; (you know what I&#x27;m talking about), but definitely wanted to cover up a dark spot here and there. Most importantly, I need something that still lets my skin &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. This Neutrogena offering is perfect. It has just the right amount of coverage, blends easily, and really is long-wearing. Love it!</li>
            <li> I got a bottle of this from a BZZ Campaign and upon using it I seen no difference between it and my normal brand. After struggling to get the foundation out it went on nice and smooth and felt very lightweight. I put it on before leaving for work and after working my 8 hour shift there was no makeup left on my face. It is supposed to be long-lasting and last up to 12 hours but I have better luck with my normal brand lasting longer. It is an average foundation and to me not worth the extra money as compared to my normal brand.</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent, tried this product for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first time I applied this foundation, I already noticed a difference. My skin is completely breathable, and feels light. My foundation feels like my best accents have been showcased by having this touch my skin at the beginning of my day. Definitely recommend this to every lady who wants to feel beautiful without having to wear too much. Less is more in this case each time.</li>
            <li> I recently used the Neutrogena nourishing long wear make up and it works just like they say. It lasted all day and made my skin look great. It also helped my eyeshadow and blush last all day too! It does not feel cake your heavy. Best foundation I have tried! Also I #gotitfree courtesy of BzzAgent! Will definitely be purchasing it later though! One change I wish Neutrogena would make Is the bottle. It is hard to get the make up out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> Tried this make-up free, in the color \\&quot;nude,\\&quot; as part of a BzzAgents campaign. I think I chose a shade that is slightly too dark for my skin-tone; however, the texture is creamy and light enough that it still blends very well. It works a lot like BB cream, with my skin looking more evenly-toned, but not \\&quot;painted,\\&quot; after application. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to determine whether or not my skin really is \\&quot;brighter\\&quot; as a result of the make-up. But it does last most of the day, as promised.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I do not wear foundation on a daily basis. So when I *do* use it, I want something that is fairly easy to work with and, obviously, a good color match. As a BzzAgent, I was super excited when I got to try this out. I got it in the lightest shade available (Classic Ivory) and while it looked very peachy as a swatch, it did blend out fairly nicely. I think it would be better suited as a spring/summer foundation, though, because the tint would be a no-brainer if I got some color. I was constantly worrying about it blending into my neck/hairline properly. But the fact that I&#x27;m super pale isn&#x27;t Neutrogena&#x27;s fault. The texture, however, left something to be desired. Since it&#x27;s in a glass bottle, I would assume the foundation is a liquid. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s like a melting mousse, really, that comes out in gobs. Getting it out was like banging on a glass ketchup bottle. For that reason, I think the packaging should have been a jar or a squeeze bottle. The coverage was so-so. It evened out my skin for the most part, but blemishes were still clearly visible and needed additional concealing. Also, this emphasized my dry patches like crazy (even when it didn&#x27;t look like I had any with just moisturizer on) which I found quite odd for a foundation claiming to be &amp;#34;nourishing.&amp;#34; That being said, it didn&#x27;t really seem like it faded or slid around during the day, so they definitely got the long-wear part right. Given the price and how much I had to work with it and/or use other products to make it manageable, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d repurchase. This is perhaps better suited to darker skin tones and people without dry patches. As with all makeup, really, YMMV.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this foundation!  I was a Covergirl foundation girl before, but after I got to try this out from Bzz Agent I have now converted!  This definitely lives up to its &amp;#34;Long Wear&amp;#34; name, and lasts through my long 12 hour work days.  I love how silky and smooth it goes on my skin as well.  Its thicker than previous foundations that I&#x27;ve used, but once it sinks into my skin, it does not feel thick or heavy at all.  There are great colors to choose from in order to get the closest match to all skin tones.  It also helps to tone down my oily spots, while not drying out my drier areas. Overall, great foundation with great coverage.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product as a Bzzagent.  I highly recommend the new Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Liquid Makeup Broad Spectrum SPF 20! It really provides great coverage, covering up my skin&#x27;s imperfections without looking cakey.  It lasts all day and well into the night!</li>
            <li> I got this product free to try from Bzzagent. I am a nurse and I work 12-hour shifts, so I need a long-lasting makeup that doesnt look terrible by the end of my shift. The other foundation I have been using had good coverage, but would get greasy looking in my smile creases by the end of the day. This makeup has never done that, even after a long and exhausting day at work. The coverage is great on my acne prone skin. I would definitely recommend this makeup to others.</li>
            <li> As a new Stay at Home Mom, I am working on my new skincare routine, as it&#x27;s hard to justify taking time for a full face of makeup... yet I still want to keep up my appearance to some degree. This foundation has been the perfect solution for me. Super easy to apply (I used a small cosmetic sponge wedge) and lasts all day. I have sensitive skin and it has not irritated my skin at all or caused breakouts. I like the coverage and how it helps to even out my skin tone. I received a bottle of this product from BzzAgent but will be buying my next bottle soon and definitely recommend for something light and easy that feels and looks great!</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of liquid foundation, but I was willing to give Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup a try. I am a BzzAgent and got this for free to try. This foundation had both pros and cons that are worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Good coverage&lt;br /&gt;Long wearing&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t cause over oily skin&lt;br /&gt;Smooths out uneven skin tone&lt;br /&gt;Contains SPF 20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Too thick to shake and get out of the bottle&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t blend well on dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Tends to settle into fine lines&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this foundation to someone who is looking for a good drugstore makeup at a reasonable cost. I will continue to use my bottle, but unsure if I will purchase another when it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of this Long Wear Makeup from BzzAgent I am very pleased with the product it gives you full coverage blends out evenly gives a flawless look.It feels very smooth and light on my skin.</li>
            <li> The first time out of the bottle, I just evenly applied it all over my face, just as I did with my powder. When I did that, my skin looked very dry, and you could easily tell that I was wearing foundation. My next go at it I applied moisturizer all over before the foundation. That worked much better. The foundation went on nice and smooth, and it had excellent coverage. The foundation felt light on my skin, and I thought it had a natural look.  This foundation also had some great wear. I applied it every morning before work, after even after a long day, the foundation stayed put on my face and still looked light and natural. Oddly enough, even with applying moisturizer to my forehead before I applied the foundation, it still looked weird and dry, just as it did on the rest of my face without the moisturizer. I love the coverage of this foundation, but I really wish I could use it on my forehead. I get a lot of blemishes on my forehead, so it would be nice to enjoy the benefits of the foundation where I need it most. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t use it at all on my forehead because of the weird result :(  Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup also claims to have a tone correcting complex, that after 4 weeks of use, will make your skin tone more even. Personally, I did not notice any difference after using it everyday for 4 weeks. I possibly need to use it longer, or maybe the effects are so small I couldn&#x27;t really notice them, but I did not see any tone correction as the product claims to provide.  Overall, I really like this foundation! It definitely has better coverage than my powder does, and its still feels pretty light and looks natural. Even after wearing it all day, it still looked great just like when I first applied it in the morning.  I am unhappy that it the foundation is very noticeable on my forehead, and makes it look dry and unnatural. I also did not see any correction in my skin after using it.</li>
            <li> The shades of this make up are hit or miss. I have a lighter olive tone and had a hard time finding the right shade. It made me feel like my face had an orange tint and was also thick. Definitely try to find your shade in store first before ordering so you can find the right one.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of this from BzzAgent.  Overall, I like it with a couple of reservations.  The color I received matches my skin tone very well, and I like the level of coverage.  I would say it is about medium...not too sheer, and not too pancake-y.  It has SPF 20, and is a good value.  My problems are two-fold...one, it does not last all day on my skin (perhaps I am too oily late in the day or something) and two, it says that it improves skin over time, but after 3 or so weeks, I have not yet noticed an improvement in my makeup-less skin.  But overall, it is a good drugstore foundation.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I normally use powder foundation but am trying this out through Bzzagent. The first thing that impressed me was how smoothly it went on. Secondly I loved that it dried fairly quickly, in the past when I&#x27;ve tried liquid make up I hate that wet feeling on my face. Lastly I really like how well the coverage is, it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to do my whole face and it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve got caked make up on. I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family!  And other reviewers aren&#x27;t kidding when they talk about it truly being long wear.  I have combination skin and where it is oily it is really oily and dry really dry.  I have found with most liquid make up that is either wears off or runs with my skin type, but this one lasted all day which I found very surprising.  It even seemed to make my skin less oily.</li>
            <li> Love the neutrogena long wear foundation! Buzz agent sent me a free sample and I could not be more pleased with a product! It lasts all day and does not make my face feel greasy! It does a great job of covering my red splotches on my face and really helps with my circles under my eyes! I also love that it has 20 SPF!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product from BzzAgent.  I have really enjoyed using my Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-Up.  The coverage is better than most other foundations I have tried and it really does last longer than most other foundations.  I have oily skin, so while it doesn&#x27;t last a full 12 hrs, it still holds out better than most.  My skin looks flawless.  It feels a little heavy and a little sticky when I first apply it but that only lasts a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have with the Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-Up is the packaging.  The foundation is so thick that it takes a good deal of time and patience just trying to extract it from the bottle.  Neutrogena would do well to consider a squeeze tube for this product.  If that happens I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I tried this out as a BzzAgent. I always get excited to try new makeup! I love liquid foundation more than other types of foundation, so Neutrogena nourishing long wear makeup already had that going for it. It feels great, light, and airy on the skin...very soft! I had tried another foundation that felt that airy, but it made me break out! This makeup (so far!) has not affected my skin negatively...no bumps, no pimples, no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, my one complaint is the lack of shade choices. The one I got is a bit too dark, and the majority of the 8 shades are very pink and red in undertone, while I am a bit yellow. So honestly, I did not feel all that comfortable leaving the house with it, because it doesn&#x27;t really match my skin. I had some coupons, so I thought I would try and get another shade; I brought my usual foundation with me to try and match, and I just couldn&#x27;t find anything, so I actually probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it unless I was deep into the summer with a tan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s very nice, but if you usually have trouble matching drugstore foundations to your skin and are not willing to purchase two shades for mixing, this might not do the trick for you, because it is limited in shade choices!</li>
            <li> I got the opportunity to try this through a bzzagent campaign. I tried this out for over a week just so I could really compare it to the mineral based makeup I usually wear and to see the effect it would have on my sensitive skin. Neutrogena Long Wear Foundation is fabulous!! I have combination problem skin. Acne, blackheads, visible pores...you name it. I need a foundation that&#x27;ll cover without being obvious. Neutrogena Long Wear Foundation goes on so light and blends into my skin so well. Plus it lasts all day. I pair it with my Neutrogena BB cream for moisture. I haven&#x27;t noticed any breakouts because of this yet which is great.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try New Neutrogena Nourishing Long-Wear Makeup from BzzAgent for free. Neutrogena promised &amp;#34;Anti-oxidant rich soy smoothes and refines age spots and discolorations; Vitamins A, C &amp; E nourish skin and brighten skin tones; Light diffusing powders camouflage imperfections and mask fine lines; and Broad spectrum SPF 20 protects your skin from the sun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been much for foundation - I usually use tinted moisturizer or BB cream.  I was pleasantly surprised by this product - the coverage was great (not streaky or cakey) and the color match was spot on.  However, I&#x27;m having the hardest time getting it out of the bottle each morning - wish it had a pump instead.</li>
            <li> As women we many times find a product we like and stick with it unless it suddenly isn&#x27;t being made anymore. I was given the opportunity to try Neutrogena Nourishing Long-Wear Makeup. The Foundation applied smoothly with an even application. I did not have to spend a lot of time blending into the edges. It seems to dry quickly but not so fast that you can&#x27;t apply it properly. Also it was great for my dry skin. Typically foundation seems to draw out all the areas that are dry and make them stand out. I had no issue in covering up any uneven skin tones on my face, though I do not suffer greatly in that area nor do I have any acne issues. I found the coverage to last as long as I needed. I have a nice lighter but not fair skin tone, so any wear from the makeup was not noticeable to me. I am not a daily wearer of foundation but I found it to be quite nice, smooth and good coverage for me</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need a ton of foundation for my skin, but I definitely need it to lighten the dark circles under my eyes and cover some blemishes! But this foundation is the perfect consistency - it is thick enough to cover it easily, but also smooths in easily and stays on all day long! I have found my new favorite :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person that sticks with a brand when I like it. I have been using Clinique Even Better Wear for about 3 years now. I have acne-prone skin and get nervous using drugstore brands just because of the perfume in them. Even though non-comeodegenic, the perfume causes my breakouts. In any event, I was given the opportunity to try New Neutrogena Nourishing Long-Wear Makeup from BzzAgent for #free. Neutrogena promised \\&quot;Anti-oxidant rich soy smoothes and refines age spots and discolorations; Vitamins A, C &amp; E nourish skin and brighten skin tones; Light diffusing powders camouflage imperfections and mask fine lines; and Broad spectrum SPF 20 protects your skin from the sun.\\&quot; It&#x27;s something that wouldn&#x27;t have tempted me to buy the product anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Foundation applied smoothly with an even application. I did not have to spend a lot of time blending into the edges. It seems to dry quickly, but not so fast that you can&#x27;t apply it properly. It was suitable for my dry skin. There was slight issue covering up any uneven skin tones on my face. I like makeup to not be noticeable on me. This provided that. I did notice a few breakouts around my nose and chin. I&#x27;m assuming it may be due to some perfume in the foundation. That would be the reason for me sticking with Clinique. But, I still loved the opportunity to try this and will be likely to pass this on to someone else this shade.</li>
            <li> I was kind of nervous to try the Neutrogena Nourishing Long wear makeup because I never use liquid foundation since it’s hard to match up with my pale skin tone. It promised to be breathable, 12 hour makeup that will improve my skin’s natural tone and texture in 4 weeks. When I put it on I noticed a difference right away. It made my skin tone even across my whole face and not blotchy like some other foundations. It made my skin look healthy and it actually helped by also moisturizing my face. My skin is less dry and it just feels healthier. While I don’t yet see an improvement in skin tone, there is definitely a difference in texture. I love it so far. This is certainly a product worth trying.</li>
            <li> I loved the light texture of this make up, it has great coverage without being heavy. I barely know I&#x27;m wearing makeup, and it is still in place at the end of the day. I have adult acne, so coverage is very important. Easy to apply, odorless, and added bonus of SPF. I would recommend this. I was given a sample of this make up, but the words and thoughts are my own.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this item via BzzAgent. This foundation goes on nice and smooth, and really does last all day. As other reviewers have mentioned, the bottle makes it difficult to get out the right amount - you can either get a very small amount or more than you really need. Neutrogena needs to repackage this product for me to purchase it again. I would also like a lighter weight product - I have been mixing mine with my Neutrogena brand face lotion, and I prefer that consistency (this works because I was sent a darker color of makeup to try than my actual skin tone).</li>
            <li> I received a full bottle of this product from BzzAgent to try for free. This has not influenced my review and no compensation has been offered or accepted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a touch of rosacea in my cheeks, which I usually don&#x27;t mind too much, but who wants to look super flushed all day long? My skin is strange: I have a weird blend of T-zone oily bits, super dry cheeks that can sometimes get a little rough, and my pores seem to be getting larger as I get older despite using salcylic acid cleansers, etc. So I&#x27;m always on the look out for something new foundation-wise. When this campaign was offered to me by BzzAgent, I snatched it up. I&#x27;ve used and liked Neutrogena products for a long time now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Bare Minerals, didn&#x27;t like it. I&#x27;ve tried Cover Girl, Maybelline, and other foundations and I still haven&#x27;t found one that&#x27;s JUST RIGHT. What I&#x27;m really hoping for is a foundation that, after simple moisturizer, would give me long lasting, breathable coverage that matches my skintone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foundation is a step towards that direction for me. It is supposed to improve tone and texture of your skin in as little as four weeks while leaving you with wonderful even coverage. So far, so smooth! The difference is subtle, but this is definitely a wearable, long lasting foundation. I&#x27;ve worn it for a couple weeks now (Thanks to Neutrogena and BzzAgent for the full sized sample!) and have had time for trial and error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping that this foundation would let me skip steps in my routine (primer, powder, etc), but I find I have to make sure to still use the primer at least to fill in the pores. The foundation tends to sit on top of the skin, no matter how well I blend. I thought maybe it was my moisturizer so I switched that to make sure. I&#x27;ve tried it without, but it does tend to sit on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really love how well this one matched my skintone. I chose correctly! Got a few friends to try it out, and the range of colors really works for all of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made sure to moisturize and then used a blending sponge in this picture, skipping primer or BB cream. It did a great job of covering that redness with minimal amount of product. I used a blending sponge and my fingers to apply the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the two + weeks I&#x27;ve been using this product, I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts. The slight roughness on my cheeks where the rosacea is has seemed less rough and becoming smoother. And I love that it already has SPF 20 in it. Extra sunprotection helps! At only $15.99 for a decent sized bottle, I will be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: lightweight, even coverage, improving skin tone texture. Long lasting - gets me through a full day. No breakouts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Bottle design -- very narrow neck, hard to pour. Tends to feel like it&#x27;s sitting on top of the skin instead of blending into it. Product FEELS thick, but lightweight once it&#x27;s on (pro!)works for all of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made sure to moisturize and then used a blending sponge in this picture, skipping primer or BB cream.

            <li> I got to try this for free through BzzAgent. I like this foundation but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than the other foundations I have tried. It does go on really smooth and blends really well. The thing I don&#x27;t like about it are that it does not have a pump dispenser so i feel like when i get down to the bottom of the bottle there will still be so much wasted. Another thing I didn&#x27;t like about this foundation is that it does not last as long as it claims. It claims that it lasts about 12 hours but I could tell it was starting to wear off around 5 hours.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation! I have oily skin but this does not make my face shine! After using this product for about 3 weeks I have to say that my face looks more even- the blotchiness almost diminished. I had some brownish look spots on my cheeks because I wear always sunglasses and right under where the sunglasses stop I was darker- but this foundation did not only cover it but somehow diminish the uneven look!  I do love also the included SPF as I do live in Florida and get quite a lot son here.  This is a fantastic foundation. The only little thing I do not like about this product is the glass bottle as I find it very hard to get the foundation out of it. I bought a little make up spoon and this was the right solution. I thought they should have included a little spoon- but otherwise I find this is a perfect foundation- even my color is perfection for me! I got this free from bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I got this makeup for free being a bzzagent and I really loved this make up. Being pregnant has bad my skin tone become different and splotchy and this make up has really helped even it out. it is very light weight and stays on very well. The only reason i didn&#x27;t give it 5 out of 5 is because the makeup was very slow to come out of the bottle and with a 2 year old pulling on me all the time i need something that i can put on fast. other then that i love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge makeup hoarder, and am always trying new foundations never really being thrilled with any of them. I got this one thru Bzzagent and fell in love! I have super oily skin so by about hour 3 my face is naked again. But this stayed on thru a 9 hour work shift and the even tone of my skin was evident. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of liquid cover up....I&#x27;m usually a minerals girl, but when I got the chance to try this I figured, why not? I was not disappointed! The makeup does not feel heavy or greasy. It covers blemishes beautifully and really does last all day. I have really sensitive skin and so far, no break outs from it. Overall, I&#x27;d purchase this product and use it regularly.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free through BzzAgent.  It covers well and is long-lasting, as it says it is, but I don&#x27;t think I will buy it once mine is gone.  It doesn&#x27;t go on as easily as the foundation I was using before, and it&#x27;s a little difficult to get the right amount out of the bottle.  It either comes out too slowly, or I get too much.  This is a minor inconvenience but an inconvenience nonetheless.  I also try to buy products that aren&#x27;t tested on animals, and I think Neutrogena does animal testing.  Overall, the product works well enough, but I&#x27;ve used others that I like better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear make up often, so when I do, I usually notice my face starts to feel itchy, or dry, or like I&#x27;m wearing a mask. I was really excited to get a free sample of this makeup, given all the claims it makes about its effectiveness. Plus, I really trust the Neutrogena brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore this the other night at a bachelorette party and I didn&#x27;t feel it at all. I fell asleep with the makeup on and didn&#x27;t end up with smudges all over my pillow or any pimples. My face still felt comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is pretty much perfect as it evens my skin tone without totally blocking out my natural colors and I actually covers pimples and dark circles reasonably well without concealer though I&#x27;d still prefer concealer for my dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is officially my new favorite concealer.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a wonderful light moisturizing foundation….wrong. This is like going to a fair and getting your face painted. I&#x27;m very disappointed, as I usually love Neutrogena products. This stuff is like a thick ooze. I tend to have pretty decent skin naturally. I just need something to even out my skin tones a bit. This is almost like a concealer. If you need uber heavy duty foundation, then this is for you; otherwise I would pass.</li>
            <li> I really like Neutrogena products and I was excited to try Long Wear. I suffer from acne and this make-up did not cover it very well. I like the light feeling of the makeup and I will definitely use it more in the summer but for winter it just didn&#x27;t cover.  You need to have a sponge or brush to put this foundation on, and its very difficult to get out of the bottle so be careful! All in all I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for a light long wear foundation. (I got this free from BzzAgent)</li>
            <li> I recently received a free sample of Nourishing Long Wear Liquid Makeup to try and was pleasantly surprised by the product. It worked perfectly as a base foundation for my skin and didn&#x27;t give me any of my &amp;#34;usual&amp;#34; sensitive skin issues- no itching, rash or hives appeared. Neutrogena has always been my brand because of my issues with sensitive skin but this product is even smoother than my old product and it is awesome that it has sunscreen built into it for the winter months when  I forget to apply the sun lotion! I will surely buy this product in the future see</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been wearing this makeup for a week now but I can already tell that my skin is looking better.  My skin is more even and the redness I usually have has gone down.  I work in an office and always felt that my makeup would be gone by the end of the day.  With this long wear makeup, I&#x27;m good to go, even for drinks after work!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t like liquid foundations because they feel and look thick on my skin. I also have the issue of foundations coming off after a few hours, causing me to lose coverage. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this foundation stays on my skin all day, keeping blemishes covered. It also doesn&#x27;t feel thick on the skin, despite its nice coverage. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend!</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and was sent a full size sample of this product to try and then review. I will not address the claims of it improving your skin tone as I have only been using it for a week. However, if that turns out to be true, then even better! As it stands right now, though, I enjoyed this product enough that I will be purchasing it in the future. The coverage is light but still enough to cover what you want covered,and it feels great. For a foundation, and a long-wear one at that, it is incredibly comfortable. It almost has a soothing/smoothing feel as you blend it in. Also, as a person that does not reapply makeup, I was pleased with the lasting effects of my morning application. The only criticism I have with this product is that it is a bit hard to get out of the bottle, but that&#x27;s not a deal-breaker for me. I will be buying this again in the future.</li>
            <li> This foundation is very nice. It is very smooth and you don&#x27;t really need a lot. It also does last on your face for 12 hours. This is also nice because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent like you get with other foundations. I do think that the packaging is bad because the foundation is thick and in order to get anything out of the bottle i have to bang on it to get the foundation to come to the top and then i take my foundation brush to get some of it out. Possibly if it were in a squeeze bottle or a pump it might be nice.</li>
            <li> (I received a free bottle of this product through Buzz Agent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I have found a keeper. I&#x27;ve been trying different foundations for ages, trying to find something that will work on my oily skin and that I don&#x27;t have to retouch a million times a day. For me, this doesn&#x27;t quite last 12 hours, but I get to the end of the work day without my skin looking like an oil slick, and that&#x27;s what I really care about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foundation is soft and silky. It applies evenly and smoothly. It blends in pretty quickly and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll see the promised improved skin in 4-weeks, but the foundation looks great on my skin. I don&#x27;t wear much make-up. My main goal is oil control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My morning routine is now this foundation, a bit of matte powder and lipgloss. Before, by midday I was alway reaching for more powder or for blotting papers. But since I&#x27;ve switched to this foundation, I haven&#x27;t had to do that. Granted, I haven&#x27;t yet tried this in the summer when my face is at it&#x27;s shiniest, but I have high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I really have is the bottle. The opening is too small, and it&#x27;s really a pain to get the product out.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a BzzAgent, and was super excited to receive and share my opinions on the newest Neutrogena product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The product bottle design makes it a little difficult to get any of the foundation out of the bottle. I had to resort to using a Q-tip to get any out. This could be because it has been so cold, but I would definitely recommend some kind of pump apparatus or different bottle design to make this more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2. Like I have read from other reviews, the product is darker than you would have expected. Though we had a limited color spectrum to choose from online. It does though provide great full coverage, I just had to lighten mine with a powder foundation to make it wearable, since it made my face a few shades darker than my body color. Hopefully by summer this will change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 3. If you are prone to breakouts, this probably isn&#x27;t the foundation for you. This broke out my skin after one usage, even with removing the makeup before bedtime. Hopefully this doesn&#x27;t happen to everyone. I do tend to have more sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts in certain areas. Overall, this is a quality product that does provide the coverage advertised. I would recommend actually going to the makeup counter and trying the different selection to pick your color to avoid the problem that most of us have been reporting. It would definitely be helpful to expand the range of tones to better match more skin tones.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for the first time thanks to BzzAgent. I always have a hard time finding makeup that works for me since I have really sensitive skin that tends to break out with most makeups. But this product was gentle on my skin and it didn&#x27;t cause any skin issues. That is a really big bonus for me so I love this product. The makeup is also very light and airy which allows skin to breathe and not feel like tons of makeup is caked on. I liked that it made my skin look healthier and it evened out my skin tone without being too obvious that I was wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> I receive this item for free through bzzagent. I have always loved Neutrogena products. I haven&#x27;t really tried a long wearing foundation before. I was always afraid long lasting foundation would dry out my already dry skin. I was proven wrong! This item went on smoothly and did not dry out my skin. No to mention, I have sensitive skin. This product didn&#x27;t break me out and it lasted all day. A very good color match as well! I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The product is amazing!  I have been trying to find the perfect foundation to evenly cover and feel light on my face.  Going to the expensive stores to purchase &amp;#34;their bests.&amp;#34;  But,  trying this product for over a week now has made me love this more than the expensive products.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup!  It lasted all day for me at an important outdoor festival.  All my working, set up, etc. - no need to reapply!  This is so much better than my more expensive dept store brand.  Good coverage and non-drying (unusual for a long wear liquid make-up). (I am a BzzAgent and got this product as a free sample)</li>
            <li> I received this foundation as a Bzzagent and I love it! It is a nice full coverage foundation. Going on, it feels thick &amp; heavy but once it is rubbed in, it seems very light and smooth maintaining awesome full coverage! This is my new go-to foundation. The things I don&#x27;t like about it: It is extremely difficult to get out of the bottle. It is thick, and you are supposed to pour it out!? I wish they made it a pump or something. The other issue I have is that it claims to hide fine lines. I didn&#x27;t feel it did anything for my fine lines! However, this foundation is moisturizing and my skin feels healthier when I use it. Its coverage is impeccable and long lasting, and the color matches my tone perfectly. I love this foundation!!</li>
            <li> I received it from BzzAgent to try. I have dry sensitive skin with lots of dark spots. First what I like it doesn&#x27;t dry and irritated my skin. Look very natural with power of covering all my imperfection face. It make my face smooth and little shining but not too shine. It has SPF20 what is very important for me. Has reasonable price but quality like high price product. I will recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> This covered blemishes very nicely and the color matched rather well on my skin. However, the texture and feeling of it on my skin felt very oily and heavy. It was almost like having a thick layer on your face. Nice if you want to use it for pictures of something that you only want to wear it a short time. But for a make up that&#x27;s supposed to be all day, it&#x27;s not a nice feeling to feel on your face for a whole day. But maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s lasts all day, as it&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li> Let me just tell you that this makeup does everything it says it will do! I have a very uneven complexion... red spots as I get older... and this foundation completely evens out my complexion and smooths my skin so you can not see a single blemish. It&#x27;s long wearing (I wear my makeup for 8-10 hours a day and this stays put!), and it has a matte finish so it&#x27;s perfect for my oily/combination skin. I am absolutely in love with this foundation and I am pretty sure I have finally found the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; foundation for me!!!</li>
            <li> At first I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t match my skin tone (I am very fair skin), but it matched great and went on smooth and very light!  I am glad that I am able to try out this product being a BZZZAgent.</li>
            <li> I got this for free from bzzagent and it&#x27;s wonderful. It goes on smooth and truly lasts all day. It feels light but it does have a nice even coverage.</li>
            <li> Today I tried Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear makeup. I received the color of nude. It has SPF 20 in it. The makeup claims to have a tone correcting complex. I have pink tones in my skin so that was the 1st thing I noticed. Correcting the skin tones and evening them out is something I’m very interested in. The makeup is in a liquid foundation form and it comes in a 1 oz bottle. The first thing I noticed about this makeup is that it’s thick. I also noticed it has no noticeable smell (something that bothers me about some foundations I’ve used in the past.) I had to give the bottle a good shake to get the makeup out. Neutrogena recommends 4 seconds. I had a bad feeling it would be pretty heavy and thick on my skin. I began to spread it on my skin and to my surprise it went on great. The makeup was not heavy or thick on my skin. On a side note- I wonder if part of my success in application was that I had just moisturized. My skin was primed and ready to accept the foundation. I thought the color of nude would be a little dark for my skin. I am happy to say it just blended right in. At first I had a very smooth and even coverage. It really did even out my skin tone! Now keep in mind the makeup brags about long term tone correction benefits. It says you should see results in about 4 weeks. For this review, I’m just focusing on the immediate results. I will touch back after a few weeks with an update. The pink patches were all gone for about 4 hours. As the day went by they were visible again. This happens to me with every foundation except for extremely thick pancake type (and that pancake stick type of coverage doesn&#x27;t stay to pretty as the day goes by!)This may be from my oily skin. My skin never appeared oily or shiny though. With this foundation it appeared vey matte throughout the day. It also felt smooth and velvety. A quick mid day application of a dot of foundation on my pink patches fixed the skin tone problem. As long as I did a touch up every 4 hours (afew dots of touching up not a whole reapplication) this makeup would last the full 12 hours. Even my little touch ups went on well. No visible difference or splotchy look. So it really is a good long wear foundation. I say that with amazement. I admit I was a skeptic. I really like this foundation. I love the feel and the fact it kept me from looking shiny. I have to mention again that I moisturize right be fore I apply foundation. I think this makes all the difference. I would recommend Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear makeup because it’s a great blend of long lasting and good coverage. I feel that it’s a great balance of the two, without being too thick. Anything that could cover better is usually very thick. And most women who have used a thick or stick like foundation can tell you, it doesn’t always wear very well over an active day. This foundation can go the distance without smothering your skin. I think Neutrogena got it just right! I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does for me over the next few weeks. I am lucky to have received this product free for review as a buzz agent. It&#x27;s a great find.</li>
            <li> After trying this product for about a week, I switched back to my regular makeup. Neutrgena Nurhing Long Wear Foudation felt a little sticky and gloopy to me. It was more coverage than I need, it felt more like stage makeup than everyday foundation. It almost felt like I was wearing a mud mask. My skin could not breathe. I wore it every day for a week and each time I looked in the mirror it looked worse. It started to glob up on my face. It was also very difficult to get out of the bottle. It would have been a lot easier to apply with a pump. I applied the product after moisturizer and light concealer. The color DID match my skin very well, however. All in all, I was not highly pleased with the product I recieved. I am afraid that I might have had issues because I recieved my product in the mail instead of from the store. I was a little worried when I got it because the bottle was so cold from being in the back of a mail truck in winter. It is possible that this may have affected the composition of the product.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome foundation. I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time but I can already see the results coming. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing. It lasts and it really evens out my skin. I love it! I got my bottle for free from BzzAgent.com. I also have coupons for $2 off. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> I think this foundation is great! I&#x27;ve been using it for three days now. I apply it with a sponge applicator because I like a thinner application of foundation for a more natural look. It was smooth and even, not heavy and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was wearing a mask. I kept checking through the day and it held up pretty well. I like it, probably the best of the Neutrogena foundations I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I just received this product from Bzzagent to try and review. I have only used it a couple of days so far, but as of right now, im in love. I was using a different cover up foundation prior to this that I really liked, but the benefits that this one says it provides seems to out way all of the other. I cant wait to see results in as little as 4 weeks. I will definitely been waiting to see those. I really like that it has a built in sun screen as well. The brand Neutrogena is great in itself and doesn&#x27;t really need any help, but I give a thumbs up to this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using a deluxe sample I received for under a week, but I have to say I am impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Foundation and concealer are the two products I faithfully splurge on, using MAC and Smashbox, so I was apprehensive about the finish and cover I&#x27;d get from NEUTROGENA&#x27;s Nourishing Long Wear Makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Color me IMPRESSED.&lt;br /&gt;This may not be the best option for extremely dry skin, but if you have well moisturized skin before application expect great coverage and perfectly dewy finish.&lt;br /&gt;My hard to match yellowy, greenish undertone skin is perfectly suited to the classic ivory shade, and my skin doesn&#x27;t have that cheap drugstore product look, like I&#x27;ve applied spackle to it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using to see if the promised benefits of evened skin tone come through, but so far-- very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency and finish are right on par with my luxury foundations!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this foundation I was not impressed. First, I hated how the bottle was designed.  I prefer a pump not only for convience but for cleanliness.  It was really difficult to get the foundation out. I didn&#x27;t use a primer first and the coverage was more that of a tinted moisturizer than that of a foundation.  Additionally, I didn&#x27;t feel like it lasted as long as it said it would.  Five hours into wearing I felt like I no longer had anything on.  The second time, I used my Smashbox silicone primer with it and the results were better.  Still, it didn&#x27;t have the coverage I was used to, but I really liked the natural look it gave and I feel like it is a very buildable feel.  I also felt like the foundation gave me a nice glow without being so dewy that I felt I needed a powder as well.</li>
            <li> I got this free from Buzzagent.com. I am not a make up girl...mineral powder is all that I really wear but this covers really well, lasts super long, and last but not least - DOES NOT MAKE YOU BREAK OUT! This makes me the happiest of all. I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup. But when I did, I broke out, and I am just too old for that. This makes your skin look great. BUT, it does come in a glass bottle that kinda scares me because I know I will end up breaking it. And, the bottle is longer, so it can be a little tough to get the foundation out. I am sure that will annoy me much more when I get through more and more of it and it is tougher and tougher to get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product from Neutrogena to try via BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tickled with how well Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup works.  Most &#x27;long wear&#x27; products just don&#x27;t work as well as they advertise.  This one, however, has the staying power to last all day and still be easy to remove at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros - The foundation provided great coverage.  It goes on smooth with little scent.  It&#x27;s easy to get out of the bottle and apply.  It really does last all day.  GREAT perks to have. On top of all that, a little over a week into using the foundation and I am actually starting to see my natural skin tone even up a little.  My skin does look younger and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons - The foundation is a little too matte for my personal taste.  It almost appears flat and one dimensional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great foundation to use.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now. My skin seems to like it (I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts#. And it really does last all day #although, I have to reapply powder because I get shiny).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint about this product is with the bottle. I really prefer some kind of pump system to dispense my foundation. Or a squeeze tube. The bottle means I&#x27;m pounding it out in my hand and has resulted in too much liquid coming out, splatters on my shirt and just an overall messy-ness to the application process. The foundation is a pretty thick formula, so it really takes some shaking to get things out, especially after you&#x27;ve used a good portion of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s pretty much as advertised. It is longwear, and keeping with Neutrogena&#x27;s reputation, it seems to do your skin some good.  I just wish it had a different dispensing method.</li>
            <li> I typically wear only tinted moisturizer.  Let me tell you, this has converted me from a tinted moisturizer girl to a liquid foundation fan. The formula does indeed feel soft and hydrating and it melts into the skin without caking or feeling at all heavy. It provides great coverage that looks even and bright. It brilliantly evened my skin with a lightweight, luminous finish. Even my husband who notices nothing, saw a difference in how much better my face looked!  I am a BzzAgent and received the product for free.</li>
            <li> The foundation initially goes on a little sticky, but once you smooth it out, it creates a great matte finish. It is very long-lasting and my skin was glowing for an entire afternoon and evening out. It feels very light on the skin, unlike some products that feel heavy and goopy. I definitely recommend if you want a clean, light foundation!</li>
            <li> I got this makeup as a Bzz Agent to try out and review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use powder foundation, and haven&#x27;t used liquid foundation for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup for about a week now.  I like the way it makes my skin feel, and it is very light and feels like nothing on my skin.  The color matched fairly well, and the coverage did last all day.  My only complaint is during the application, I found the makeup to be streaky and when I attempted to fix it, then it became too cakey looking.  I don&#x27;t like to wear obvious makeup, and though this streakiness was only in areas, it wasn&#x27;t my favorite finish.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little more than a week and already I can see a difference in the texture and color of my skin even when I am not wearing the foundation. It leaves my skin smooth and soft and the color is dewy and bright. I love how easily it glides onto the skin and how well it blends with my skin tone.I have sensitive skin, and it hasn&#x27;t made me feel like I&#x27;m crawling out of my skin. I also love the long wear aspect and that it has a sunscreen included in it.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the neutrogena nourishing long wear foundation in ivory for about 3 weeks, which I received for free through BzzAgent. Overall I think this makeup does a great job of blending, covering any uneven color or blemishes and not wearing off. I do use spot concealer and powder to finish off my make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was most impressed by how well the ivory shade matched my skin tone. I usually have a hard time of finding a perfect match in a drugstore brand but not with this! The foundation also blended very easily (I use my fingers to apply) and looked natural- no caking here! As far as it improving skin tone, I am not really sure if it is or not. I think I would have to use it for at least a month or more to see if there is any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main negative I had about this makeup is that by the end of the day if I had applied it around the lines near my mouth, the makeup did settle in and make the lines very noticeable. I think this is primarily because my skin is very dry due to the winter weather. I have since made sure that I do not put any of this foundation directly on any creases (or use a primer) and the problem is solved.  I also found it rather difficult to get the liquid out of the bottle that it comes in. It is like the ketchup bottles that you shake upside down forever but once you get it going it will come out. I would prefer to not have to work this hard to get makeup out of a bottle but it would not dissuade me from another purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall- I would recommend the neutrogena long wear makeup!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Neutrogena Long Wear liquid makeup through Bzz Agent. I am surprised to say how happy I am with this product! I am a long time user of Clinique and usually break out or am not happy with other brands.  My skin has stayed clear with this makeup and it lasts all day! I currently have a color that is a little too dark for me though since picking a color without being able to try it is a challange.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I received this foundation free from BzzAgent and have been using it for about 2 weeks. I&#x27;ve been using the Neutrogena Healthy Skin makeup for about 8 years and have always loved it. I was so excited to try the Nourishing Long Wear makeup and was kind of hoping it would be the same as the Healthy Skin makeup but with longer wear time. I like the slender glass bottle as it&#x27;s attractive but it&#x27;s also the reason I subtracted a star from my review. This makeup is quite thick (think chocolate mousse) and almost impossible to get out of the bottle. I have to constantly close the bottle and shake it down then reopen it to be able to get a decent amount out to cover my face. I&#x27;ve noticed that the makeup dries and &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; very quickly so it&#x27;s a bit difficult to blend. The texture is very smooth and silky so it glides on but it just needs to be blended very quickly. I requested the same shade as the Healthy Skin makeup I&#x27;d been using and found that it was a tad darker than I expected. The makeup looks a bit orange in fluorescent light but seems to match my skin much better in natural light, interestingly enough. I feel like I don&#x27;t need very much of the makeup to cover my face and since it&#x27;s so thick, it can be used as concealer as well. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin&#x27;s tone or texture but I know it can take at least a month or two to notice anything. All in all, an excellent product BUT it needs to be in a pump form so I can actually get it out of the bottle (this would be more hygienic, too).</li>
            <li> I love the coverage, the feel and how long it lasts! The key is how much you shake it! And after a few weeks, your skin does improve. I noticed specifically, less breakouts, less blackheads and a little (although I have rocesea so it&#x27;s hard to see) more even skin color</li>
            <li> I felt like this product had many good qualities: it goes on smooth, stays on all day and continues to look good, it feels very light on my skin, there is a good selection of shades and it is readily available at stores.&lt;br /&gt;The downside is the bottle is not easy to use and I think when it gets low that it will be impossible to get the makeup out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> So often you see products listed as long wearing and they either feel really gross on your skin, or they wear right off.  This foundation is neither - it goes on smoothly, and lasts all day.  I wore it for 14 hours yesterday and still had great coverage when I washed it off.  I have been using it daily now, and not one break out.  The coverage is great, and the color blends right into my skin.  I have had little success in the past with Neutrogena products staying on, but they came up with a winner on this one.  This will replace my go-to Lancome foundation now!</li>
            <li> I got this from bzz agent to test and was really excited to try it. I have to start by saying this makeup feels AMAZING on! It is like air. There is no grease or grit that comes with other long wear foundations. It goes on smooth and I am guessing it stays on. See the problem was that it was so thin that it didn&#x27;t cover anything and I couldn&#x27;t see it. So if you have porcelain skin and want an all-day base for your make-up, this is your product. If you have poor skin and need coverage, look else where.</li>
            <li> I tried this just today &amp; was so impressed!  It went on smoothly, made my skin feel great &amp; lasted all day - something I tend to have trouble with.  Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> I tend to stay away from liquid foundations and favor BB/CC creams because they are usually too heavy and look unnatural on me.  As a BzzAgent, I received a free sample of this makeup and was able to compare it to my favorite CC cream.  Though it&#x27;s not as light, it certain does provide coverage without looking like I have layers of product on my face.  It smooths out my tone and hides my pores well.  I like the added benefits of skin nourishing vitamins and SPF.  The only drawback to the product is the packaging - it&#x27;s difficult to get enough out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I find this foundation ok. I like that it&#x27;s really light and fairly sheer for a foundation, I always forget i&#x27;m wearing it when I have it on! The lightest shade is still a tad too orange for me though. You reallly have to shake up the bottle each use so the orange doesn&#x27;t over power. I am paper white so i&#x27;m used to foundations not matching, but it would still be nice to see this made in a lighter shade. I do use this though and it seems to work as a tinted moisturizer. I just mix a few drops with my daily face lotion and it&#x27;s perfect! So in that respect this product i&#x27;m a fan of. So far I haven&#x27;t broken out yet either from this which is always a plus! The price is around $15 which I feel is a little high for a drugstore brand but I still think it&#x27;s worth a shot. I&#x27;d say this foundation is a winner, especially if you get a good matching one.</li>
            <li> I really loved this foundation. This, coming from a powder-foundation lover, is quite something. The formula is nice and easy to apply, although I did find that the foundation settled into lines towards the end of the day. It smells very neutral, and I liked the color options. Overall, a great foundation for the budget buyer!</li>
            <li> I am a bzzagent and tried this product for free...&lt;br /&gt;I am always hesitant to try a new foundation because I am worried I will not select the right color and I will waste my money. There is so much to choose from it is hard to find the right one for me and my skin. I do not like heavy coverage but I want something that will smooth out my skin and hide my flaws (large pores, uneven skin tone, freckles, age spots and melasma). I currently like the foundation I use, but I was willing to give Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup a try. I was not thrilled with the small opening on the bottle, because I had a little trouble getting the foundation on to my fingertips to apply to my skin. This is the only way I apply my makeup (with my fingertips) and I guess I am used to my usual foundation that comes in a squeeze bottle. Anyway, the application was easy, the foundation blended well, and went on evenly and smoothly. It felt light on my skin and did last my whole day. I usually apply my foundation about 5:45 in the morning and work until 3:15 but I end up having errands after work and the makeup does not come off until about 7pm. The biggest problem I had was the color...since I got it free I can not complain but the color was not the best fit for my skin. I would love however to try a shade a tad lighter. I felt like the color was off and I was not happy with that, but that is an easy fix. I tend to have combination skin and at the end of the day, my face is very oily and there was no difference in using this foundation...my skin was still very oily at the end of the day but the makeup still lasted. I did notice that if I wiped my mouth or blew my nose, the makeup rubbed off easily on the napkin/tissue. Overall I liked the makeup and would probably like it more if it were the right shade for me. Oh, and it gave me decent coverage and I was please with how it hid my imperfections.</li>
            <li> I generally buy foundation from the Urban Decay line, but I tried this product through the bzzzagent campaign.  I applied it just as I do my UD foundation...with my beauty blender.  And, honestly, it went on and stayed on just as well as UD.  Very smooth and great coverage.  It didn&#x27;t feel heavy on and all my other makeup stayed on well with this foundation.  I do think I should have chosen one shade lighter, but even so, it blended in so well that I will be able to use it no problem even though it is a little darker than I&#x27;d normally wear.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I do not like liquid foundation, however mineral powder is not good for occasions where longevity is needed.  I received a sample of this foundation from BzzAgent and decided to try it out by wearing it to a party hosted by my husband&#x27;s boss.  I really liked the way this smoothed on my skin, did not feel cakey, and left me with a nice glow.  After 5 hours in a warm house with at least 30 other people, I still looked fresh &amp; had that glow!  I will definitely keep this around for those times where the powder isn&#x27;t enough!</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to take part of a Bzz Agent campaign to try out the Neutrogena&#x27;s Long Wear Foundation. I usually have a very difficult time finding a foundation that doesn&#x27;t cake onto your skin AND is affordable. This product however, hits every mark! I&#x27;ve had no issue with smearing or smudging and the make-up actually does withstand everyday wear and tear. Absolutely nothing came off on my napkin during a dinner-time mouth dab.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a buzz agent and received this make up to test. I hadn&#x27;t worn liquid foundation in years so I wondered what to expect. I loved this foundation! It went on easily and smoothly. I had no trouble blending it in or getting it rubbed in all over. I have chronically dry skin and STILL didn&#x27;t have any problems getting in blended. I loved the coverage. I will be using this regularly now so thanks Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> I actually wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of this and it pains me to admire that because I wanted to be!&lt;br /&gt;Pros: it did last all day&lt;br /&gt;  Apparently good for my skin so that&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the texture, it wasn&#x27;t silky or liquidy, if that makes any sense?&lt;br /&gt;My skin was kind of blah looking with it, no glow or fresh look to it.&lt;br /&gt;I think it may have actually aggravated  my skin, I kind of broke out with a little inflammation and some itch.&lt;br /&gt;Since the texture was too thick it was really hard to get it out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to throw this out but it will just be a back up for when I run out of my still favorite long wearing drugstore foundation. Sorry guys this was a miss for me.</li>
            <li> I love this make up!  I have dark spots that have been a nightmare to cover correctly.  This has been the answer to my problem!  It also has a smooth,  nice finish that isn&#x27;t cakey.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to fall into my fine lines either like a lot of liquid make up seems to do after time.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am dissapointed with Neutrogena Long Wear Liquid Make-Up.  I got a free bottle from BzzAgent so that I could try it and share my opinion and it&#x27;s not good.  First of all, it&#x27;s very hard to get the liquid out of the bottle and once you do, it pours out and you don&#x27;t want to waste the stuff.  Then, it was hard to blend it in all over my face because there was so much liquid that got on the sponge and no good way to get it off.  I really think if this bottle had a pump, it could have been used a little more efficiently which may have changed my review.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tend to wear foundation, but when I heard that this make-up both helped with uneven skin tone and contained sunblock, I was compelled to try it.  I was given a free trial in Natural Ivory.&lt;br /&gt;So far I have been pleased.  The color and consistency of the product worked well for me.  A little certainly goes a long way and after 3 week of use, I feel like my skin tone has evened out a bit.  This make-up also feels very natural and seems to stay put fairly well.  I have not had much of an issue with it rubbing off on my scarves or jackets this winter, which is great since I often forget I am wearing it!</li>
            <li> As women we many times find a product we like and stick with it unless it suddenly isn&#x27;t being made anymore. I was given the opportunity to try Neutrogena Nourishing Long-Wear Makeup. The Foundation applied smoothly with an even application. I did not have to spend a lot of time blending into the edges. It seems to dry quickly but not so fast that you can&#x27;t apply it properly. Also it was great for my dry skin. Typically foundation seems to draw out all the areas that are dry and make them stand out. I had no issue in covering up any uneven skin tones on my face, though I do not suffer greatly in that area nor do I have any acne issues. I found the coverage to last as long as I needed. I have a nice lighter but not fair skin tone, so any wear from the makeup was not noticeable to me. I am not a daily wearer of foundation but I found it to be quite nice, smooth and good coverage for me I RECEIVED THIS FOR FREE TO REVIEW FROM BZZ AGENT AND NEUTROGENA</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my NEUTROGENA® Nourishing Long Wear Makeup for about a week now.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used it long enough to see any changes in my skin.  But I am loving how it wears during the day.  I tend to have oily skin and by half way through the day, the shine is coming through.  Since using NEUTROGENA® Nourishing Long Wear Makeup  this past week, I have noticed my skin appears less oily and definitely has less shine at the end of the day.  I have also happily noticed that my skin appears smoother and more even after applying the NEUTROGENA® Nourishing Long Wear Makeup .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what my results will be after another week or two.  My only complaint would be that it&#x27;s sometimes hard to get it out of the bottle.  You really have to give it a good shake.  But I would say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first tried this makeup. The new Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup talks up a good game - but can it deliver? I have extraordinarily dry skin and usually I use a BB cream instead of foundation because foundation tends to flake off. Neutrogena came through for me on this detail. I could barely tell I had any dry flakes on my face. The only place I noticed them was right above my nose where the foundation kind of makes them noticeable. Otherwise, no noticeable flakes at all. While I did notice some brightening of my skin and a little improvement in the skin tone, the results were not overwhelming. I do like how it stayed on all day long - and I didn&#x27;t notice it rubbing off on any of my clothes or even on my phone. The consistency of the liquid is just about right - didn&#x27;t run all over and wasn&#x27;t gloppy and gross. It smoothed on nicely and evened out nicely. The color match was perfect. I have to be careful because I am very fair skinned and you really couldn&#x27;t tell I was wearing it. All in all - I enjoyed this makeup and am having my daughter try it as well (she is 14 years old) because it also seems to be very safe and very much good for your skin. The Neutrogena brand continues to impress me with their products.</li>
            <li> So I got this product and didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I find that it&#x27;s a bit thicker than what I would normally use ,but it doesn&#x27;t feel thick or greasy.  I also find that it gives great coverage and makes your skin feel much cleaner and fresher. I would be using this product again and aain.</li>
            <li> I love the longevity of this makeup and it does not rub off on clothes, etc. I have an issue with the very small opening at the top of the bottle. I usually use my fingers to apply foundation and not a make up sponge. I have to dot this on my fingers then my face over and over and over again to get enough to apply. A wider hole at the top would make it near perfect !I should add that I recieved this free as a a BZZ agent. Free is even better but I would but it for the quality of it !</li>
            <li> I really like this foundation! I was having a hard time finding one that matched my skin tone but didn&#x27;t make me break out. I was so excited when I found this! I only wish it was in a bottle that would squeeze out. I have a hard time getting the foundation of the bottle sometimes.</li>
            <li> I thought this makeup was thick and felt heavy on my skin. After I put it on, I felt like you could tell I was wearing makeup and did not feel natural. I was disappointed since I usually love Neutrogena products. I will not purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I usually splurge on my face makeup, but I received this free with Bzz Agent so I thought I&#x27;d give it a fair shot before judging it. I&#x27;m glad I did because it changed the perception I have of drugstore makeup brands. The shade matched my skin very well (the lightest skin color there is), lasted long, covered pretty well, and didn&#x27;t break me out. I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t oxidize on my skin, because almost everything always does. The only downside I could think of was that I am not a fan of the way this dispenses from the bottle (no pump), and the formula is a bit thicker than what I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;But, it&#x27;s great as an every day foundation, has a broad spectrum SPF in it, and is very affordable. I would suggest this to anyone that is acne prone, as it did not break me out and I tend to break out with drugstore foundations in particular, and anyone that is oily/acne prone. It really will control oil for 12 hours, and it leaves your skin with a glowy, not greasy, finish. Again, I wish it came with some type of scoop to get the product out of the bottle, because it&#x27;s probably too thick of a formula for a pump. But for now, I just use a Q-tip and that helps me get the product out for now. Good makeup overall.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to like Neutrogena nourishing Long Wear Makeup as much as I do. I got it as a sample from #Bzzagent. I started using it instead of the usual foundation I use which is NYC brand foundation. Unlike the NYC brand, Neutrogena doesn&#x27;t feel heavy when using it. It goes on light feeling but it gives great coverage. I am a sign waver for a company right now and applied the coverage before my 3 hour shift. When my shift was over I was sure my coverage would be as well. To my surprise and delight, it was still apparent. I highly recommend this great value and super product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I enjoy trying out new makeup products, so I was excited when I received the new Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup in the mail for free from BzzAgent. When I applied the makeup, it didn’t feel too thick. It was light-weight and natural looking. There are some foundations that within a few hours I feel that they’ve worn off, but this Neutrogena Makeup felt like it lasted most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup is said to give you 12 hours of silky, breathable coverage and that you’ll start to see smoother, softer, more radiant and even toned skin in as little as 4 weeks. In a clinical study 100% of women saw improvement in skin’s natural tone or texture. I’m looking forward to seeing this on my skin as I use it over the next month, since I struggle with smooth and even-toned skin.</li>
            <li> I got this for free as a BzzAgent sample. The first day I wore it I kept getting compliments on my skin and everyone kept asking me if I had gotten a tan. It lasts through my 12-14 hour work days and blends easily. Will definitely buy this when my current bottle runs out. One start off for how hard it is to get out of the bottle. I use q tips and it did the trick.</li>
            <li> I should start off by stating that I am all about natural looking makeup and on a daily basis, only wear foundation, maybe some bronzer, mascara and lip gloss. With that said, I am loving the light, silky coverage that this foundation offers. I&#x27;ve noticed that it lasts hours on end and that its been improving both the natural tone and texture of my skin. I highly recommend the product to anyone that is looking for full coverage but that still feels light and looks natural!!</li>
            <li> I really liked how long wearing this makeup is while its not damaging my skin. My skin stayed soft smooth and easy to wear and breath. I would recommend this to all of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Also I want to note I have makeup sensitive skin and I had no issues with this makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to try NEUTROGENA® Nourishing Long Wear Makeup for free from BzzAgent</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of Neutrogena Long-Wear Foundation through BzzAgent. It&#x27;s easy to use, and blends incredibly nicely to my skin-tone. To my surprise, it actually lasted all day! Normally by the time I get home at the end of the day, my makeup has faded and it&#x27;s hard to see if I had worn any that day. With my new Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Makeup, my face still looks smooth and even, without looking cakey and fake! Definitely a foundation I&#x27;ll continue to use even after I run out of my current bottle! The only downside is that it&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle, so I have to make sure to keep it upside-down so it&#x27;s easier to use.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says....stays on, great coverage and super light.  Totally worth it.  I will buy more.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample from bzzagent and absolutely love this makeup! I have always stick to one brand and never realized what else could be out there! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin, and normally my makeup smudges off by the end of the day. This stuff actually stays where it is supposed to and makes my skin look so smooth!</li>
            <li> Long lasting all day coverage, blends in well and is light to wear. I Love it and use it everyday now</li>
            <li> I bought this product to try something new after using L&#x27;Oréal True Match for years. What a mistake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very thick and almost not runny - which is not bad per se, but wanting to get it out of the container is rather challenging, since it doesn&#x27;t come with a pump, it&#x27;s just a bottle. You either get nothing, or way too much -just like a ketchup bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others mentioned, it gives you an orange tone! I use my beauty blender to put my foundation on, so there&#x27;s hardly a way to put too much on, but the first time I used it, my boyfriend said it looked like I had WAY too much makeup on, almost like a mask....&lt;br /&gt;Also, it feels rather sticky and somewhat uncomfortable  on my face, so not at all lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I hardly ever have any outbreaks, I am now left with pimples in my face in places I never had before, so this might be due to the foundation clogging my pores massively as well, since I&#x27;m on vacation and hardly can blame it on my usually stress-related outbreaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to mix the foundation with my moisturizer, which helps a lot with the orange-ness this makeup causes until this bottle is empty, and then switch back to L&#x27;Oréal.... too bad!</li>
            <li> Best affordable foundation I&#x27;ve ever come across. Bought it at Target. It goes on and stays on all day, does not make my skin oily like other foundations in this price category. My skin is pretty normal and usually cheap foundations make it oily! You will not be disappointed with how good the coverage is and how light it feels on your skin. I checked a few times throughout the day to make sure it still looked the same and it sure did!</li>
