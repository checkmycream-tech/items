            <li>I went on a road trip not long ago and really didn&#x27;t need all that makeup, but it was just so easy to pick it up and go instead of going through and picking out which make up</li>
            <li>The positive reviews are absolutely correct.</li>

            <li>Now on to the things that you really want to know.  </li>
            <li>I really needed.  </li>
            <li>Now on an airplane I go much lighter.  </li>
            <li>SO much nicer than any of the train cases</li>
            <li>I would suggest this item for anyone who wants to keep there makeup neat and orderly.</li>
            <li>sturdy construction, has more room than any other make-up case that i&#x27;ve checked out (and I did quite a bit of price/quality comparison before purchasing it!)-</li>
            <li>My wife LOVED IT!!!A little expensive, but as far as I can tell, it&#x27;s good quality.</li>
            <li>It is big enough to carry all the make-up she needs plus still being able to fit in some jewelry and other accessories.</li>
            <li>Wipes down easy inside when you get makeup or powder on the shelves.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S EXACTLY THE SAME as Mac&#x27;s for the fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>It is larger than many other standard train cases found in department stores and was reasonably priced for a quality product.</li>
            <li>I needed something large enough to hold all of my makeup and this does the job!  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 17 year old for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Really professional, built well.</li>
            <li>and it all fits in and is completely organized.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 12 year old who loves doing her nails.  </li>
            <li>I feel like a professional make up artist</li>
            <li>I wish it was bigger to put also my mani/pedi stuff, maybe I need to buy a second one ;)</li>
            <li>If they had  sewn it the other way I could fit all my long brushes.</li>
            <li>I do wish the bottom was a little deeper, and the slots were a bit bigger, but they fit all of my foundation bottles, eyeshadow palettes etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seems very well made,  has a ton of storage and she loves the pink color.</li>
            <li>Very compact and lighter than I expected.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this for anyone who has a young lady at home.</li>
            <li>I will update in a few months to see how it holds up to a 13 year old ;)</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s built very well; sturdy and comes with a couple of keys for security should you need it and a shoulder strap.</li>
            <li>Not long ago I was eyeing up MAC train case for over $200.</li>

            <li> I ordered it because I needed more space to hold my diabetic supplies such as test strips, syringes and lancets.  </li>
            <li> Each compartment (except the bottom) is covered by clear plastic, which will make it easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li> The box looks exactly as pictured and is very durable.  </li>
            <li> It is really well made and so pretty.</li>
            <li> I went on a road trip not long ago and really didn&#x27;t need all that makeup, but it was just so easy to pick it up and go instead of going through and picking out which make up</li>
            <li> The positive reviews are absolutely correct.</li>
            <li> Box is well made, lots of room, very rugged and comes with two keys.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy and functional.</li>
            <li> It fits absolutely any and all makeup I could ever have.</li>

            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> I love the pink color which of course is so girlie for makeup.  </li>
            <li> Now on to the things that you really want to know.  </li>
            <li> I really needed.  </li>
            <li> Now on an airplane I go much lighter.  </li>
            <li> SO much nicer than any of the train cases</li>
            <li> I would suggest this item for anyone who wants to keep there makeup neat and orderly.</li>
            <li> sturdy construction, has more room than any other make-up case that i&#x27;ve checked out (and I did quite a bit of price/quality comparison before purchasing it!)-</li>
            <li> My wife LOVED IT!!!A little expensive, but as far as I can tell, it&#x27;s good quality.</li>
            <li> It is big enough to carry all the make-up she needs plus still being able to fit in some jewelry and other accessories.</li>
            <li> Wipes down easy inside when you get makeup or powder on the shelves.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S EXACTLY THE SAME as Mac&#x27;s for the fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> It is larger than many other standard train cases found in department stores and was reasonably priced for a quality product.</li>
            <li> I needed something large enough to hold all of my makeup and this does the job!  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 17 year old for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Really professional, built well.</li>
            <li> and it all fits in and is completely organized.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 12 year old who loves doing her nails.  </li>
            <li> I feel like a professional make up artist</li>
            <li> I wish it was bigger to put also my mani/pedi stuff, maybe I need to buy a second one ;)</li>
            <li> If they had  sewn it the other way I could fit all my long brushes.</li>
            <li> I do wish the bottom was a little deeper, and the slots were a bit bigger, but they fit all of my foundation bottles, eyeshadow palettes etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seems very well made,  has a ton of storage and she loves the pink color.</li>
            <li> Very compact and lighter than I expected.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this for anyone who has a young lady at home.</li>
            <li> I will update in a few months to see how it holds up to a 13 year old ;)</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s built very well; sturdy and comes with a couple of keys for security should you need it and a shoulder strap.</li>
            <li> Not long ago I was eyeing up MAC train case for over $200.</li>
            <li> It looks nice but is very expensive.</li>
            <li> I mean exactly.</li>
            <li> Items have to lay flat, each drawer extremely shalow, cant stack two powder boxes in the same compartment.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> will buy again, a bit smaller than expected but sturdy and transportable.  </li>
            <li> I do like it; just expected something bigger.</li>
            <li> pink looks just like the picture</li>
            <li> She chose the pink color.</li>
            <li> lock is pretty lame.</li>
            <li> OTHER THAN THAT</li>
            <li> if I&#x27;m a little rough with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> every small compartment has a thick plastic film covering the bottom in case any loose make-up scatters which i find a big plus for easier cleaning!</li>
            <li> Though the lock for the key seems a little useless, since it can be opened with anything with a flat head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I was afraid the bottom compartment would be too small to fit my palettes, but it&#x27;s at least 3 inches</li>
            <li> Holds all my make up, wish it was a little lighter but it is made well.</li>
            <li> Works well but a little cumbersome in size when opened.</li>
            <li> Other than that, 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> this was a present from a wish list, the color was black not pink.the person that received this present was disappointed</li>
            <li> IT GETS HEAVY!</li>
            <li> No more clutter.  </li>
            <li> Will keep for traveling but inconvenient for daily use</li>
            <li> Too expensive</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this case.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Lots of space. Great case!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Sturdy - I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to break if I&#x27;m a little rough with it.&lt;br /&gt;*The pink looks just like the picture, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;*The bottom of the trays are lined with plastic! Awesome idea in case make-up spills! (The sides of the trays do not have plastic though)&lt;br /&gt;*I was afraid the bottom compartment would be too small to fit my palettes, but it&#x27;s at least 3 inches deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*The lock is pretty lame. If you&#x27;re wanting this because it locks, don&#x27;t get it.&lt;br /&gt;*The elastic sewn on the sides for brushes is pretty spiffy. The only problem is it only holds tiny brushes. If they had  sewn it the other way I could fit all my long brushes. *sigh*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely thinking of buying a second one in a different color for jewelry/hair accessories.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 17 year old for Christmas. She loved it. It&#x27;s a nice sturdy case with lots of room and the color is super cute.</li>
            <li> THIS IS REALLY GOOD. IT CARRIES A LOT OF MAKE UP AND ITS PERFECT. ALL I SAY IS THAT ONCE YOU HAVE IT FULL OF MAKE UP IT GETS HEAVY! OTHER THAN THAT ITS PERFECT. I USE IT FOR DANCE COMEPTITIONS!</li>
            <li> Very happy. It holds a lot and love the way it looks. It is easy yo carry. And also store</li>
            <li> Holds all my make up, wish it was a little lighter but it is made well. I did not want to store my make up on the bathroom counter and this is great to throw under the seat.</li>
            <li> sturdy construction, has more room than any other make-up case that i&#x27;ve checked out (and I did quite a bit of price/quality comparison before purchasing it!)- I am very happy! every small compartment has a thick plastic film covering the bottom in case any loose make-up scatters which i find a big plus for easier cleaning!</li>
            <li> i like it because it has a lot of space and all my make ups fit in it . I will definitly recommende to people its really worth it!!!</li>
            <li> The box looks exactly as pictured and is very durable.  Holds plenty of makeup and is stylish in the bathroom or on the road.  Worth the cost as cheaper cases fall apart quickly.  Consolidated makeup into this one box.  My daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> it was exactly what i wanted.  It was exactly what the picture showed.  Many compartments  just as  i wanted.  I am very happy and pleased with my case.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves it.  It&#x27;s seems very well made,  has a ton of storage and she loves the pink color.</li>
            <li> Love this!, is cute, spacious, everything fits great, LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Box is well made, lots of room, very rugged and comes with two keys.  Lots of room, yet very organized and a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Beautiful case and full of room. Very sturdy and functional. I&#x27;m so glad i decided to purchase this particular one!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. It fits absolutely any and all makeup I could ever have. It also has locks, and a set of two keys comes with it. It looks really cute, and is a great color. Very compact and lighter than I expected.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cosmetic box for my daughter because she is into makeup.  She loved it!  She takes it everywhere she goes.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this case.  It holds all her makeup and keeps the bathroom clean.  No more clutter.  Definitely recommend this for anyone who has a young lady at home.</li>
            <li> It was shipped as promised! I just love it! It is exactly what I needed plenty of room for all of my Makeup, combs, brushes, wigs., hair accessories etc.,&lt;br /&gt;It is very beautiful, has plenty of room for whatever I want to carry!&lt;br /&gt;It is very well constructed i.e., built strong and steady!</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected. Items have to lay flat, each drawer extremely shalow, cant stack two powder boxes in the same compartment. Will keep for traveling but inconvenient for daily use</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a nice, sturdy travel case for your makeup, but don&#x27;t need a huge train case with rollers--this is it! I have tons of room for all of my makeup. I do wish the bottom was a little deeper, and the slots were a bit bigger, but they fit all of my foundation bottles, eyeshadow palettes etc. I like the spots on top where you can store your lipsticks etc. and not take up anymore space in the case. I liked this so much, I got a 2nd one. The drawers aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;flimsy&amp;#34; like a lot that are out there. It probably would be great for other tools-hair nails etc.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my daughter wanted for her makeup. Lots of compartment space. Great price for this size case.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a makeup guru... she has had many cases and searched for a new one bef Christmas, I got her this one as a surprise and she just told me she loves, loves, loves it.. its the best one she has had in a long time.. my granddaughter just asked me to get her the same one...  Love when that happens...</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it. Really professional, built well. Pretty color. My daughter love storage, keep her makeup neat and tidy.</li>
            <li> You need to be very strong if you plan on carrying this. It looks nice but is very expensive.</li>
            <li> She needed something better to use and asked specifically for this case. She loves it and uses it all the time to take to photo shoots. It is big enough to carry all the make-up she needs plus still being able to fit in some jewelry and other accessories. She especially loves that it has a lock.</li>
            <li> I bought this case for my Granddaughter for Christmas and it was a huge hit. It is really well made and so pretty. It is larger than many other standard train cases found in department stores and was reasonably priced for a quality product. Would defiantly purchase again.</li>
            <li> good quality... very functional!!!</li>
            <li> Works well but a little cumbersome in size when opened.</li>
            <li> I wish it was bigger to put also my mani/pedi stuff, maybe I need to buy a second one ;)</li>
            <li> Not long ago I was eyeing up MAC train case for over $200. Too expensive and I had to look for an alternative. I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I came across this case. IT&#x27;S EXACTLY THE SAME as Mac&#x27;s for the fraction of the price. I mean exactly. I love it and it helps to keep my beauty goodies tidy. It has a lot of trays and lockable. Great value for beautiful case.</li>
            <li> I had so much stuff that was taking up drawer space. I bought this and it all fits in and is completely organized. Just love it.</li>
            <li> This is a quality item, well worth the price. Arrived is perfect condition and so cute and big enough plus great for keeping everything organized</li>
            <li> On time and the correct item</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 12 year old who loves doing her nails.  It fit most everything she needed/wanted.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> Wife wanted a make-up case that was big enough for all her make-up. Saw this one and ordered about 2 weeks before Christmas and arrived about 3 days I ordered it. Fast Shipping. My wife LOVED IT!!!A little expensive, but as far as I can tell, it&#x27;s good quality. Really nice color and has plenty of space inside it. Though the lock for the key seems a little useless, since it can be opened with anything with a flat head. Other than that, 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves it!!! will buy again, a bit smaller than expected but sturdy and transportable.  No problems opening or closing at all</li>
            <li> I needed something large enough to hold all of my makeup and this does the job!  I love that the drawers expand out so you can see all of the makeup at once and I like that it comes with a carrying strap.  I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this case! I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it. I love the inside space and most of all the strap that is detachable!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! I haven&#x27;t had any problems, actually, don&#x27;t remember when exactly panel was sheeped, but all together absolutely satisfied me!</li>
            <li> I think the organizer is nice and has nice features but I honestly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth $69.99. I feel I could have found something bigger and just as nice for that price at a cosmetics store. Other than that, it&#x27;s built very well; sturdy and comes with a couple of keys for security should you need it and a shoulder strap. If you work in the beauty industry, this case has a fun, professional and respectable look to it, so it&#x27;s worth the purchase for that reason as well. I do like it; just expected something bigger.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect size and I am very Happy with my new orgazer... Best buy so far as far as a make up organizersgoes.</li>
            <li> Although it is a gift for my daughter for Christmas, I did a thorough inspection upon delivery and found it to be the PERFECT size and excellent quality - very sturdy and so cute! Excellent purchase and highly recommend.  I will update in a few months to see how it holds up to a 13 year old ;)</li>
            <li> This train case is so cute and fits all my stuff great! It sure is big enough and folds out nicely</li>
            <li> This was bought as a birthday gift for my daughter. She loves it! It holds all of her cosmetics and closes securely. She chose the pink color. It is pretty and well made.</li>
            <li> I have looked and looked and finally found a case I like.  Being quite a shopper that says a lot!  I love the pink color which of course is so girlie for makeup.  Now on to the things that you really want to know.  Very sturdy, compartments pull out easily and there is a lot of room. Wipes down easy inside when you get makeup or powder on the shelves.  I had no idea I had so much makeup!!  I use it daily because it is compact and I can find everything with just opening two clamps.  I went on a road trip not long ago and really didn&#x27;t need all that makeup, but it was just so easy to pick it up and go instead of going through and picking out which make up I really needed.  My girlfriend thought it was very cute.  Now on an airplane I go much lighter.  I am so glad I found this cosmetic case!!  The positive reviews are absolutely correct.</li>
            <li> this was a present from a wish list, the color was black not pink.the person that received this present was disappointed and i was upset, end of story. i would like a reply please.</li>
            <li> This organizer let&#x27;s me easily organize all of my products making them very easy to find. It&#x27;s so functional-I love it!</li>
            <li> Sturdy, cute, great organizer.  Very good deal for the money.  The pink is a great color.  Organizes all of my makeup and looks good at the same time!</li>
            <li> The case is everything I was hoping it would be.  It seems quite sturdy and comes with a key and locking closures.  For me, the locking feature will be very useful, because I plan on using the case to carry my medications when I travel.  I have diabetes and have a lot of items I need to carry, such as insulin pens, needles, glucose meter, testing strips, lancets, and alcohol pads. The interior has collapsible/expandable compartments to organize everything.  Each compartment (except the bottom) is covered by clear plastic, which will make it easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift for my daughter, but it is so great, I&#x27;d like to keep it!  SO much nicer than any of the train cases I looked at in stores!  She is going to love this!  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> My case came yesterday in perfect condition.  I ordered it because I needed more space to hold my diabetic supplies such as test strips, syringes and lancets.  This case holds a full box of each of those PLUS the bottom of the box fits both of my 30 day medicine holders, a full box of alcohol wipes with room for more.  It is sturdy, too.  I had a make-up box many years ago...when I opened the trays sideways, they would bend.  Not this one.  When you open the trays they remain sturdy and stable.  Couldn&#x27;t wobble them if I&#x27;d wanted to.  You cannot go wrong with this case.  It serves many uses in my case and, of course, would be great for make-up, too.  Most importantly, it locks.  If I have company, I don&#x27;t want to leave my supplies unguarded and, if there&#x27;s an earthquake, I won&#x27;t worry about my pills falling on the floor where they&#x27;d be available for my cats to nibble on.  Okay, I like this case, can you tell?  :)</li>
            <li> Excellent case for my wife who does housecall haircuts and styling. It is one of the largest cases on Amazon in its category and quite durable and attractive.</li>
            <li> This item was perfert for her make-up.  It came overnight, well before Christmas. She loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a 5 star rating because it is beautiful and just as described.  There are many section inwhich to store all of your make up. I would suggest this item for anyone who wants to keep there makeup neat and orderly.</li>
            <li> Awesome Cosmetic Organizer I feel like a professional make up artist I want to buy my cousin one as well.... I recommend this product....</li>
