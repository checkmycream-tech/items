            <li>, It&#x27;s the best, as far as moisture, and aroma scent.</li>
            <li>...but happily, this is the right stuff.</li>
            <li>For the money, you can&#x27;t buy a better after shave conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Glad Amazon has it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using AFTA for more than 20 years.</li>
            <li>many stores are not carrying it.</li>
            <li>I sincerely hope that Amazon continues to offer it.</li>
            <li>I have used Mennen&#x27;s Afta for most of my life.</li>
            <li>I like this products and glad i was able to het it here</li>
            <li>The pre shave does seem to make my shaver work better and also improves cleaning.</li>
            <li>I have used Afta for many years.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>They better not ever stop making this stuff...</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing this for my husband for many years.  </li>
            <li>Buying it in a muti pack that lasts me almost a year is covenient and the price is excellent compared to what I used to pay for individual bottles when I could find it on the shelves.</li>
            <li>I know what I am talking about as I have used this after shave for many years.</li>
            <li>Have used it for many years.</li>
            <li>Glad itb was available via Amazon.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and good for skin.</li>
            <li>It soothes rather than burns and I am seventy years old and people often mistake me for being in my fifties, many people comment upon the pleasant smell of the product.</li>
            <li>I have been using Afta Original After Shave for many years and didn&#x27;t want to change,</li>
            <li>Too strong of an alcohol smell to use.</li>
            <li>The product is fine, I have used for years and expect to continue using.  </li>
            <li>Just like they used to carry at the drugstores and I could no longer fine.</li>
            <li>The bottles are identical so it is easy to buy the pre-electric shave thing it is the original Afta, I have made that mistake a couple times .</li>
            <li>Look at the fine print to be sure that you are getting the right product.  </li>
            <li>I bought several bottles at a great price.</li>
            <li>Afta has a light smell and soothes the skin after shaving.</li>
            <li>Hope it continues to be available.</li>
            <li>and by ordering the package of 6 he will be assured of having goodly supply to last him most of the year.</li>
            <li>Good old standby, not over powering and not greasy</li>
            <li>After Shave, Original, 3-Ounces (Pack of 6)]]</li>
            <li>I have been using the original Afta skin conditioner/after shave for decades.</li>
            <li>Using an electric razor causes a clean shave</li>
            <li>It has a clean scent that my wife appreciates and makes your face feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Mennen Fresh doesn&#x27;t do it for me - the smell is too strong.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not too strong, and the lotion aspect makes for a far more comfortable finish than alcohol-based after shave.</li>
            <li>Fresh light clean smell.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s tried &amp; true aftershave he has been using for years.</li>
            <li>The regular Afta has a nice aroma, without being too strong.</li>
            <li>Super produce, have been using it for over 30 years.  </li>
            <li>Its nice consistency allows you to portion out the right amount and not waste any of it.</li>
            <li>but there is minor irritation, plus who doesn&#x27;t want to smell and feel good after cleaning up?</li>
            <li>First Wal-Mart stopped selling Afta Original</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best after shave on the planet but its getting very hard to find at a lot of chain retail stores that always used to carry it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find it in any of our local stores, so we are glad to see that it is still available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>used and enjoyed by us old guys...........</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin there is nothing better.  </li>
            <li>This leaves him totally free of razor burn and smells fantastic, but not overbearing like some masculine smelling products.  </li>
            <li>Great item, hard to find in any stores</li>
            <li>A  hard to find great product.  </li>
            <li>The product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve done that you&#x27;ll agree, there is simply nothing better, not even Kuehl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>My father was first to introduce me to Afta...</li>
            <li>My husband is light complexion and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After shave, original  for year&#x27;s, and as far as I&#x27;m concerned, I hope the keep making it</li>
            <li>Great product that I have used for a long long time.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is subtle and very nice.</li>
            <li>it is very soothing, easy on sensitive skin and not heavily scented like so many similar products.  </li>
            <li>We both love the freshness and long lastingness of this fregrance!</li>
            <li>It removes the after burn quickly and keeps the skin soft.  </li>
            <li>Although acceptable, I find the Afta fragrance to be too strong and quite different from what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>thanks Amazon.com</li>
            <li>really ticks me off.    </li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon and its subs</li>
            <li>the price, quality, and delivery were all very satisfactory.</li>
            <li>online made real sense to me - and the price was competitive.</li>
            <li>Very soothing.  </li>
            <li>This after shave is very soothing to the face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li>The same as it has been for 60 years, no longer available in stores.  </li>
            <li>He isn&#x27;t much for &#x27;smelly stuff&#x27;</li>
            <li>but I think he likes how much I like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks to amazon for coming to the rescue.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find in other stores anymore.</li>
            <li>They also provide health and grooming products to people with particular</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that is very irritated after shaving.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>My husband has used this since high school.</li>
            <li>Terrific for use right after shaving and before using aftershave.</li>
            <li>CVS drugstores have a clone with a less strong perfume.</li>
            <li>I gave a bottle to my 14 year old son and he loves it!</li>
            <li>It is not a heavy perfumed product .Afta</li>
            <li>My wife likes the aroma and I llike what it does for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Used to be imposible with sensitive skin to shave w/o razor burn.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband, who has sensitive skin, but is too manly to apply the word &#x27;sensitive&#x27; to himself.</li>
            <li>one is a ble which is heavy on the perfume side and a pre-electric shave which seems to be what they are stocking most local.</li>
            <li>I bought this in bulk and even though it is the same exact bottle and scent, the stuff I got recently is a solid milky green color and not translucent green like my current stuff and the scent is off and not in a good way.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected--</li>
            <li>I love Afta but at least 2 of the 6 containers were filled with watery bootleg version of the after shave.</li>
            <li>Poor packaging and two of the six containers had spilled most of the content.</li>
            <li>It is getting harder and harder to find the original Afta in local stores , they are either sold out and or stopped stocking it.</li>
            <li>I have been using Afta original after shave lotion for many years, but recently it has become impossible to find locally.  </li>
            <li>Becomming harder to find (last order via Amazon)....don&#x27;t know why, several Mennen products (Pre-electric and Fresh scent) are packaged the same and make it easy to pick up the wrong product.....</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find it in any of our local stores, so we are glad to see that it is still available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> used and enjoyed by us old guys...........</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin there is nothing better.  </li>
            <li> This leaves him totally free of razor burn and smells fantastic, but not overbearing like some masculine smelling products.  </li>
            <li> Great item, hard to find in any stores</li>
            <li> A  hard to find great product.  </li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve done that you&#x27;ll agree, there is simply nothing better, not even Kuehl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My father was first to introduce me to Afta...</li>
            <li> My husband is light complexion and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After shave, original  for year&#x27;s, and as far as I&#x27;m concerned, I hope the keep making it</li>
            <li> Great product that I have used for a long long time.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle and very nice.</li>
            <li> it is very soothing, easy on sensitive skin and not heavily scented like so many similar products.  </li>
            <li> We both love the freshness and long lastingness of this fregrance!</li>
            <li> It removes the after burn quickly and keeps the skin soft.  </li>
            <li> Although acceptable, I find the Afta fragrance to be too strong and quite different from what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> thanks Amazon.com</li>
            <li> really ticks me off.    </li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon and its subs</li>
            <li> the price, quality, and delivery were all very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> online made real sense to me - and the price was competitive.</li>
            <li> Very soothing.  </li>
            <li> This after shave is very soothing to the face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li> The same as it has been for 60 years, no longer available in stores.  </li>
            <li> He isn&#x27;t much for &#x27;smelly stuff&#x27;</li>
            <li> but I think he likes how much I like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to amazon for coming to the rescue.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find in other stores anymore.</li>
            <li> They also provide health and grooming products to people with particular</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is very irritated after shaving.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this since high school.</li>
            <li> Terrific for use right after shaving and before using aftershave.</li>
            <li> CVS drugstores have a clone with a less strong perfume.</li>
            <li> I gave a bottle to my 14 year old son and he loves it!</li>
            <li> It is not a heavy perfumed product .Afta</li>
            <li> My wife likes the aroma and I llike what it does for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Used to be imposible with sensitive skin to shave w/o razor burn.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who has sensitive skin, but is too manly to apply the word &#x27;sensitive&#x27; to himself.</li>
            <li> one is a ble which is heavy on the perfume side and a pre-electric shave which seems to be what they are stocking most local.</li>
            <li> I bought this in bulk and even though it is the same exact bottle and scent, the stuff I got recently is a solid milky green color and not translucent green like my current stuff and the scent is off and not in a good way.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected--</li>
            <li> I love Afta but at least 2 of the 6 containers were filled with watery bootleg version of the after shave.</li>
            <li> Poor packaging and two of the six containers had spilled most of the content.</li>
            <li> It is getting harder and harder to find the original Afta in local stores , they are either sold out and or stopped stocking it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Afta original after shave lotion for many years, but recently it has become impossible to find locally.  </li>
            <li> Becomming harder to find (last order via Amazon)....don&#x27;t know why, several Mennen products (Pre-electric and Fresh scent) are packaged the same and make it easy to pick up the wrong product.....</li>
            <li> The sale price was decent, but the shipping charge was so high that it made the transaction a poor bargain.  </li>
            <li> This product is becoming increasingly difficult to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> used for years, unable to locate locally, like it  better than any other I have used.</li>
            <li> This six-pack should last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other &amp;#34;balms&amp;#34;, but there is nothing that soothes and cools and conditions with no alcohol sting/burn and no irritation later on.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry my skin the way other after shaves do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this stuff for a long time.</li>
            <li> For some reason this product is very hard to find in the stores, my husband will only use this product so I found it on Amazon for him and he was very greatful.  </li>
            <li> Other brands that say they are the same......</li>
            <li> I have tried other aftershaves but always come back to Aftashave.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other sfershaves and they were too expensive, too strong an aroma - if that is what you could call it.</li>
            <li> Got what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It has become harder and harder to find Afta at retail outlets, so buying 6 at one time</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find.  </li>
            <li> I had trouble finding the product in local stores, so I bought it when I found it on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble finding this scent locally.</li>
            <li> Only a few stores carry this.  </li>
            <li> also has other styles</li>
            <li> first shipmeny was wrong.</li>
            <li> Have been using Afta for 20 years and it continues to surpass any other product I have tried</li>
            <li> I ordered this six pack and they are not right.</li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard and very tender skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like they were watered down with alcohol.</li>
            <li> Conditioner\\&quot; which I had used previously.</li>
            <li> Not sure why so hard to find in central KY stores???</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> After Shave (Green) since the mid--1970&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It was just a little hard on my sensitve skin.</li>
            <li> This aftershave is hard to come by in any retail store..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s hard to find the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; on store shelves.</li>
            <li> It is often hard to find at stores slow to restock.</li>
            <li> This is at least a 50% savings from the store price.  </li>
            <li> Not a good combination.  </li>
            <li> Very hard item to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m told, really soothes and protects skin, especially in cold weather  </li>
            <li> If you are addicted to this product, Amazon to the rescue.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very frustrated to discover that the retail store where I have been buying it for years no longer carries it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been out of this for months because the big box retailer never had any in stock. So I bought a sleeve of these and now my face is happy again. Using an electric razor causes a clean shave but there is minor irritation, plus who doesn&#x27;t want to smell and feel good after cleaning up? I got the habit of using this after borrowing my dad&#x27;s. It makes me smell good, soothes my face and reminds me of him all in one application! Great service and quick delivery as always, which is why Amazon rules.</li>
            <li> First Wal-Mart stopped selling Afta Original After Shave then Safeway stopped so I checked Amazon.com and found it.  I have been using Afta Original After Shave for many years and didn&#x27;t want to change, thanks Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Good product. Not sure why so hard to find in central KY stores???</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for deacdes, literally!  It gets rid of that just-shaved-look and the tell-tale scent doesn&#x27;t linger like perfume.  For the money, you can&#x27;t buy a better after shave conditioner.  I just hope it&#x27;s never discontinued.</li>
            <li> Like the afta after shave on my husband!</li>
            <li> Got what I expected.  Better than going to Walmart!</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described. Timely delivery made this transaction a pleasure. Thanks for a great product !!</li>
            <li> Great product...been using Afta \\&quot;Original\\&quot; for years  Pros: Dosen&#x27;t burn, smells great...so I&#x27;m told, really soothes and protects skin, especially in cold weather  Cons: Becomming harder to find (last order via Amazon)....don&#x27;t know why, several Mennen products (Pre-electric and Fresh scent) are packaged the same and make it easy to pick up the wrong product.....really ticks me off.    Other brands that say they are the same......not even close.....don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since it came out.  I have a very tough beard and very tender skin.  Not a good combination.  I like the pleasant smell of Afta.  It soothes rather than burns and I am seventy years old and people often mistake me for being in my fifties, many people comment upon the pleasant smell of the product. I think that the product moisturizes my skin and helps my skin remain youthful in appearance.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, I have used for years and expect to continue using.  The sale price was decent, but the shipping charge was so high that it made the transaction a poor bargain.  I tried to cancel the order when I saw the shipping charge, but the website would not permit me to do so.  So, I recommend the product, but not the Amazon sales tactic -- I&#x27;ve been burned, and will think twice in the future about buying from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a while but at one point could not find it in local stores.  I had to go to another after shave but didn&#x27;t think about looking on Amazon.  Found it on Amazon and ordered it.  Great product.</li>
            <li> For some reason this product is very hard to find in the stores, my husband will only use this product so I found it on Amazon for him and he was very greatful.  It smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Great price - I&#x27;ve used it for many years. Great for after shaving.</li>
            <li> I have been using Afta for years with no issue. I ordered this six pack and they are not right. It&#x27;s like they were watered down with alcohol. Too strong of an alcohol smell to use. I had to throw them out. I&#x27;m working with Colgate to determine if it&#x27;s their fault or if this supplier is crooked.</li>
            <li> afta is a great product but most of the bottles were leaking when i received them</li>
            <li> I have been using Afta original after shave lotion for many years, but recently it has become impossible to find locally.  What the local stores (I looked at six) have is Afta Electric Pre-shave only.  This six pack cost me only $2.56 each--a bargain.  The fragrance is subtle and very nice.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product--fast delivery at a great price. Terrific for use right after shaving and before using aftershave. Relieves and razor burn</li>
            <li> good stuff but ordered by mistake.  i was looking for the preshave!</li>
            <li> Product was good husband has used it for yrs. Only problem we had was the 2 times have ordered when it arrived one of bottles was broke.</li>
            <li> I have been using this After Shave for years but retailers seem to have quit carrying it. Thanks to Amazon and its subs I bought several bottles at a great price.</li>
            <li> While it is a good pre-shave, it has a very strong perfume that my wife cannot stand. CVS drugstores have a clone with a less strong perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this stuff for a long time. It always gets me the after hours attention.  I bought this in bulk and even though it is the same exact bottle and scent, the stuff I got recently is a solid milky green color and not translucent green like my current stuff and the scent is off and not in a good way.  Maybe I got stuff from china, or maybe they changed the formula without putting on the bottom &amp;#34;new and crappier scent&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Looked for this for awhile, great aftershave</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s tried &amp; true aftershave he has been using for years. It has a pleasant smell and is non-irrating. I can&#x27;t seem to find it in any of our local stores, so we are glad to see that it is still available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used Afta for years now. Do not and can not take allot of perfume style products. Afta has a light smell and soothes the skin after shaving. It is not a heavy perfumed product .Afta also has other styles one is a ble which is heavy on the perfume side and a pre-electric shave which seems to be what they are stocking most local. The bottles are identical so it is easy to buy the pre-electric shave thing it is the original Afta, I have made that mistake a couple times . It is getting harder and harder to find the original Afta in local stores , they are either sold out and or stopped stocking it. Glad Amazon has it.  Great product and does what it is designed to do. This pack of 6 for this price is a bargain . I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Afta is an excellent skin conditioner and after shave lotion that has stood the test of time. It is getting increasingly more difficult to find in stores. Glad itb was available via Amazon.</li>
            <li> My husband has been looking for this for years and just couldn&#x27;t find it! Now he has a lot and is very glad for that! We both love the freshness and long lastingness of this fregrance!</li>
            <li> I have been using AFTA for more than 20 years. It is a great moisturizing after shave lotion. It is a great value but&lt;br /&gt;because of it&#x27;s low cost many stores are not carrying it. I sincerely hope that Amazon continues to offer it.</li>
            <li> Look at and try all of them.  Once you&#x27;ve done that you&#x27;ll agree, there is simply nothing better, not even Kuehl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This product is becoming increasingly difficult to find in the stores. My husband has used it for years and we are so happy to be able to purchase them online.</li>
            <li> This is the only place I could find this for my husband.  It is no longer carried in the stores where we shop.  The price was very&lt;br /&gt;reasonable and by ordering the package of 6 he will be assured of having goodly supply to last him most of the year.</li>
            <li> This aftershave is hard to come by in any retail store..the price, quality, and delivery were all very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> This was purchased to hopefully replace CVS&#x27; comparable product which is no longer being sold. I had mistakenly believed that this was the same stuff because the ingredients all matched up and the bottle looks similar to that from CVS.    When I ultimately tried this product, I was dismayed to find that the fragrance is entirely different from the \\&quot;CVS Aftershave Skin Conditioner\\&quot; which I had used previously. Although acceptable, I find the Afta fragrance to be too strong and quite different from what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> I have used Mennen&#x27;s Afta for most of my life. The regular Afta has a nice aroma, without being too strong.I have tried other sfershaves and they were too expensive, too strong an aroma - if that is what you could call it. The Mennen Fresh doesn&#x27;t do it for me - the smell is too strong. It has become harder and harder to find Afta at retail outlets, so buying 6 at one time online made real sense to me - and the price was competitive.</li>
            <li> NOT AS GOOD LIKE YEARS AGO!</li>
            <li> I like this products and glad i was able to het it here</li>
            <li> Great product that I have used for a long long time. I have found nothing that works as well. In all of these years the manufacturer has kept the same formulation. I purchased a case because it is not being offered on store shelves anymore. Too bad.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product since I started shaving(50 yrs), as had my dad.  Very soothing.  Reasonably priced and good for skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff. I haven&#x27;t been able to find in other stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I ordered the After Shave by mistake but after some of the glowing reviews I decided to give it a try.  My wife didn&#x27;t like it so I will probably end up donating the rest to our local food bank.  They also provide health and grooming products to people with particular needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered the pre shave after I realized my mistake.  The bottles are almost identical.  Look at the fine print to be sure that you are getting the right product.  The pre shave does seem to make my shaver work better and also improves cleaning.</li>
            <li> This after shave is very soothing to the face &amp; neck. You will not be disappointed.[[ASIN:B0000530HH Afta After Shave, Original, 3-Ounces (Pack of 6)]]</li>
            <li> Great item, hard to find in any stores</li>
            <li> Super produce, have been using it for over 30 years.  However, it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find.  Just in case, I think I&#x27;ll order another 6.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.....hard to find &amp;#34;the Original&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Probably used and enjoyed by us old guys...........</li>
            <li> Just like they used to carry at the drugstores and I could no longer fine. If you are addicted to this product, Amazon to the rescue.</li>
            <li> Poor packaging and two of the six containers had spilled most of the content. No option to get replacements!</li>
            <li> Excellent after shave if you are entering the shower right after shaving. After shower, I apply aqua velva, purchased in 3 pack,7oz bottles.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for 30 years!  If you have sensitive skin there is nothing better.  I&#x27;ve used several other &amp;#34;balms&amp;#34;, but there is nothing that soothes and cools and conditions with no alcohol sting/burn and no irritation later on.  And I have never known a woman who didn&#x27;t like the scent....well there was one, but...</li>
            <li> The same as it has been for 60 years, no longer available in stores.  My husband has used this since high school.</li>
            <li> I love Afta but at least 2 of the 6 containers were filled with watery bootleg version of the after shave.</li>
            <li> A  hard to find great product.  My local stores are always out.  I bought six bottles at a much better price!  No complaints, just praises for Amazon!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t take off stars because this product is what it says it is. It was just a little hard on my sensitve skin.</li>
            <li> I have used Afta for many years. My wife likes the aroma and I llike what it does for my sensitive skin. I had trouble finding the product in local stores, so I bought it when I found it on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Good buy. Just like off the shelf. Works just as well. I have had trouble finding this scent locally. blank</li>
            <li> I have used Afta shave since I started shaving.  I have tried other aftershaves but always come back to Aftashave.  It removes the after burn quickly and keeps the skin soft.  Smells great too.  Love it.</li>
            <li> My father was first to introduce me to Afta... It&#x27;s the best after shave on the planet but its getting very hard to find at a lot of chain retail stores that always used to carry it. I have order 3 packs of 6 just to stockpile it. I gave a bottle to my 14 year old son and he loves it! Use it after you shave/shower...it soothes your skin with no burn at all. I use it all over and even put it in my hair instead of gel. Ladies love it!!! If you have never tried this product BUY IT!!! They better not ever stop making this stuff...I&#x27;m gonna order another 6 pack right now!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It is a great ending to the shave you get with the Afta Pre-Electric. I recomment washing your face after shaving with the Afta Pre-electric Shave and then putting on the Afta After Shave. Great smell. My wife likes it. It does not dry my skin the way other after shaves do. Its nice consistency allows you to portion out the right amount and not waste any of it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product. It is often hard to find at stores slow to restock. Ordering it on line solved this problem.</li>
            <li> Very hard item to find in stores.  So greatful!</li>
            <li> first shipmeny was wrong., corrected with response.</li>
            <li> ...but happily, this is the right stuff. This six-pack should last me a very long time. I&#x27;m just happy its still manufactured, yet most retailers, (WalMart, KMart, Walgreens, CVS) refuse to carry it???</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected--no issues what so ever.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this for my husband for many years.  Only a few stores carry this.  This is at least a 50% savings from the store price.  GREAT VALUE!!!  Happy husband....happy wife :)</li>
            <li> I like this product becuase it is very soothing, easy on sensitive skin and not heavily scented like so many similar products.  Buying it in a muti pack that lasts me almost a year is covenient and the price is excellent compared to what I used to pay for individual bottles when I could find it on the shelves.</li>
            <li> Mennen AFTA After Shave is one of the very best protectant creams to use on your sensitive skin after a close electric shave or any shave!!!!  Thank you, Mennen!!!!</li>
            <li> I use it as a shaving cream &amp; it works GRET that way! Used to be imposible with sensitive skin to shave w/o razor burn. Had this in my cabnet &amp; one day ran out of shaving cream. Used the afta aftershave as a temporary substitute. NEVER TURNED BACK! SHAME AMAZON ONLY PLACE TO GET IT THESE DAYS!</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. I like the lotion instead of the burn of an after shave</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who has sensitive skin, but is too manly to apply the word &#x27;sensitive&#x27; to himself. This leaves him totally free of razor burn and smells fantastic, but not overbearing like some masculine smelling products.  He isn&#x27;t much for &#x27;smelly stuff&#x27; but I think he likes how much I like it.</li>
            <li> this was a product that that my father in law was looking for. We found it at Amazon for at a great price.</li>
            <li> Mio marito sostiene che questo prodotto è ottimo, purtroppo  in italia non si trova, l&#x27;hanno  provato  anche &#x27; nostri  famigliari e ne sono entusiasti.</li>
            <li> Since I couldn&#x27;t find this locally I bought through here.  Original and great.</li>
            <li> My husband is light complexion and sensitive skin. Fresh light clean smell. Men and women ask him what he is wearing?</li>
            <li> Happy with product. I&#x27;ve used this Mennen After shave, original  for year&#x27;s, and as far as I&#x27;m concerned, I hope the keep making it, It&#x27;s the best, as far as moisture, and aroma scent.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is very irritated after shaving.  Afta is very good in reliving that discomfort.  The scent is nice too.  I know what I am talking about as I have used this after shave for many years.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific pre- electric shave at a phenominal price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Mennen AFTA After Shave (Green) since the mid--1970&#x27;s.  It smells the same, soothes the skin the same - and, way before political correctness - the opposite gender (i.e. females) used to tell me that &amp;#34;I smelled nice.&amp;#34;  That&#x27;s all I needed.  I still purchase this product, as well as the AFTA Blue, but to a lesser extent.  Alcohol-base after shaves are a time-a-dozen, here today and gone tomorrow.  The AFTA brand has stood the test of time.</li>
            <li> Great product used it for years. Had a problem finding it so went to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good old standby, not over powering and not greasy</li>
            <li> Have been using Afta for 20 years and it continues to surpass any other product I have tried</li>
            <li> This is very good after shave. The fragrance is not too strong, and the lotion aspect makes for a far more comfortable finish than alcohol-based after shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I have been using for years.  Hope it continues to be available.</li>
            <li> I have been using the original Afta skin conditioner/after shave for decades. It provides the finishing touch to a good close shave and refreshes your face.  It has a clean scent that my wife appreciates and makes your face feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very frustrated to discover that the retail store where I have been buying it for years no longer carries it.  I almost went into withdrawal when I could no longer find it.  Thanks to amazon for coming to the rescue.</li>
            <li> shaving lotion - smells good - nice and clean</li>
            <li> Great product. Unfortunately it&#x27;s hard to find the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; on store shelves.</li>
            <li> Great pricing and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> used for years, unable to locate locally, like it  better than any other I have used.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. Have used it for many years. Does the job for me as a after shave conditioner!</li>
