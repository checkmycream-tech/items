            <li>Nice product received from maybelline, I really liked the Color which compliments my wheatish skin tone!</li>
            <li>Love the dual sided compact!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nice to have a softer matter look on the skin and this product made&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it would be good to have a liquid powder or powder foundation with the 20 SPF or more in a&lt;br /&gt;matte finish.</li>
            <li>age rewind has great shine control, plus when it is terribly hot, it also helps control sweat, love it, peeper</li>
            <li>This an extremely nice powder as when I bought it was a bit to light</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay :)</li>
            <li>But the product was what I&#x27;ve been searching for but wasn&#x27;t able to find in stores.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and love the way it feels on my face.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores</li>
            <li>I was happy when I found it on Amazon at such a good price</li>
            <li>and i just love it.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>You can buy without problems. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky about my compact so, I was thrilled with this product!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to others :-)</li>
            <li>love Tanima</li>
            <li>I wish they would make this without the illuminators they put in so many power products these days.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>This powder came quickly, but the case had a large crack in it.  </li>
            <li>Matches my skin tone pretty well.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for &amp; needed.</li>
            <li>since it is so hot we need something that has spf in it.</li>
            <li>skin look more ruddy (not that smooth) and seemed to accentuate the negative.</li>
            <li>It covers very well.</li>
            <li>it fits very well.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove and doesn&#x27;t feel all cakey all day long.</li>
            <li>I use to  buy this at local drugstore and when I found it at this incredible price at Amazon was thrilled; it is a personal favorite for me, doesn&#x27;t clump up in creases, has SPF and a subtle sparkle to brighten up the complexion; I do recommend investing in a good powder brush whether you use this or another product; I have tried other powders now and then and always come back to this; I don&#x27;t know why I wasted my money on more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>Makes my liquid foundation feel much less liquidy. :)</li>
            <li>older person</li>
            <li>also a very soft texture..</li>
            <li>Not heavy, but covers imperfections well.</li>
            <li>Product looked used and old when I received it.  </li>
            <li>However, a month into using it the powder completely broke apart.</li>
            <li>but for a younger person who wants coverage with the highlighter side effect, then&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>In general there wasn&#x27;t a lot of product, and what product there was</li>

            <li> This an extremely nice powder as when I bought it was a bit to light but now that winter is here my skin loses its tan but it&#x27;s okay :)</li>
            <li> Not too pigmented, and takes a lot to get it on a brush... but it does the trick of &amp;#34;finishing&amp;#34;. Makes my liquid foundation feel much less liquidy. :)</li>
            <li> This age defying make up arrived before it was said to arrived. Which is good all by itself. But the product was what I&#x27;ve been searching for but wasn&#x27;t able to find in stores. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I like this product. Matches my skin tone pretty well. Not heavy, but covers imperfections well. Easy to remove and doesn&#x27;t feel all cakey all day long.</li>

            <li> As my skin tone es medium i picked up this color, and was perfect for me! :)&lt;br /&gt;is also a very soft texture..</li>
            <li> Of course, everything that covers well and doesn&#x27;t irritate gets discontinued.  Oh well, it was great and I ordered a few before they disappeared completely.</li>
            <li> age rewind has great shine control, plus when it is terribly hot, it also helps control sweat, love it, peeper</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is exactly what I was looking for &amp; needed. I will be buyin it again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love the way it feels on my face. It covers very well. I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores so I looked on line. I was happy when I found it on Amazon at such a good price so I ordered 2. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Product looked used and old when I received it.  It felt a little sketchy to use.</li>
            <li> This powder came quickly, but the case had a large crack in it.  The powder itself has glitter in it which I found annoying, but that of course is personal taste.  However, a month into using it the powder completely broke apart. In general there wasn&#x27;t a lot of product, and what product there was I personally found to be not to my taste.</li>
            <li> i chose this rating because i think it works great. since it is so hot we need something that has spf in it. and this does it it smells great, works great and i just love it.</li>
            <li> I get this one for me.. is good quality.. that&#x27;s ok. I think that i can recommen. I&#x27;m happy with it. You can buy without problems. :)</li>

            <li> Nice product received from maybelline, I really liked the Color which compliments my wheatish skin tone! I recommend this product to others :-) love Tanima</li>
            <li> I wish they would make this without the illuminators they put in so many power products these days.&lt;br /&gt;Once you get over 45 or so, it&#x27;s nice to have a softer matter look on the skin and this product made&lt;br /&gt;my skin look more ruddy (not that smooth) and seemed to accentuate the negative. Not a good look for&lt;br /&gt;an older person but for a younger person who wants coverage with the highlighter side effect, then&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it would be good to have a liquid powder or powder foundation with the 20 SPF or more in a&lt;br /&gt;matte finish.</li>
