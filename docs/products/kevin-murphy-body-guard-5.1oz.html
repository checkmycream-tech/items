            <li> Repurchase - have used a long time and really like the moisture it adds to my hair</li>
            <li> It does not disappoint and really keeps your hair from looking dried out if you have to use blow dryers, curling or flat irons.  </li>
            <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this shiny in a long time.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to make my hair feel dry with no discernible benefit.  </li>
            <li> Other days my hair seems to be very dry after using this</li>
            <li> It helps my curly hair stay extremely hydrated and works well with the curl contouring lotion I use.  </li>
            <li> Use it as you would any other leave in treatment and blow dry as usual.</li>
            <li> It is thick and does;t smell the same.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying from this seller</li>
            <li> so I bought a few bottles because it&#x27;s soon to become a discontinued</li>
            <li> No matter how put together my outfit was, my air usually ruined it unless I spent money on expensive blowdrys and keratin treatments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find</li>
            <li> I am super sad that Kevin Murphy has discontinued it :(</li>
            <li> frizz can&#x27;t go wrong with this brand</li>
            <li> I think I will throw it out because it stinks.</li>
            <li> Ordered two bottles and was extremely disappointed when I opened it.</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> After using it for some time, I realize it smells terrible and does not moisturize my hair.  </li>

            <li> the is not the authentic body guard that i have used in the past.  It is thick and does;t smell the same.  Since this is a discontinued product by Kevin Murphy, it looks like the seller tampered with it and put a different product in the container.  Don&#x27;t waste your money buying from this seller</li>
            <li> I love bodyguard.  It&#x27;s so hard to find but it is the perfect touch in my hairstyling routine.  It helps my curly hair stay extremely hydrated and works well with the curl contouring lotion I use.  It&#x27;s lovely and smells great!</li>
            <li> Works well with my super curly hair.</li>
            <li> For 30 years I have struggled with fuzzy, unruly wavy hair with a mind of its own. No matter how put together my outfit was, my air usually ruined it unless I spent money on expensive blowdrys and keratin treatments. I just tried this stuff today and was amazed. My hair looks like it&#x27;s been blown out professionally!! Use it as you would any other leave in treatment and blow dry as usual. I recommend one of those coarse bristle brushes (forget what they are called bu tthey are more dense and shorther and allow for a smoother blowdry). you will not be disappointed! A great product!!</li>
            <li> Still undecided some days my hair looks great not frizzy and is left smooth  and a nice shine.Other days my hair seems to be very dry after using this ,I&#x27;m thinking mybe I&#x27;m using to much sometimes I really don&#x27;t know.I still plan on using this because I was very happy the first few time using this product so that said I&#x27;m not giving up yet I&#x27;m hoping to achieve the same good results as when I first started using this.I believe this product I received is the real deal from what I can tell.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product and most Kevin Murphy products. Gives LOTS of body and volume. So glad to get this at an affordable price. My guess is because it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product after finishing my bottle from my salon--was thrilled to see how inexpensive it was. Ordered two bottles and was extremely disappointed when I opened it. It smelled off and the color was not the same as the product from my salon (it was a gross yellow rather than the translucent butter color I was expecting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned both bottles and am bummed because it was a great product!</li>
            <li> Really nice. Feels and smells like I stepped out of a high priced salon. My hair looks blown out professionally when I use this.</li>
            <li> When the price dropped significantly, I finally bought this product.  I honestly forgot why i wanted it, but it&#x27;s very lightweight and smells good and I think my stylist said it was good for my hair.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend buying this product, mostly because Kevin Murphy has discontinued is. So what you are buying is an old product that has expired.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about $24 per bottle at my hair dresser, so I bought it through Amazon.  It was a great price.</li>
            <li> I am already using Kevin Murphy shampoo and thought I would give this a try.  It does not disappoint and really keeps your hair from looking dried out if you have to use blow dryers, curling or flat irons.  My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this shiny in a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am super sad that Kevin Murphy has discontinued it :( So happy to be able to fetch another bottle on here :)</li>
            <li> Love everything Kevin Murphy and since I&#x27;m a hairdresser that&#x27;s saying something using this and the angel wash shampoo and cond eliminates frizz can&#x27;t go wrong with this brand</li>
            <li> Kevin Murphy&#x27;s products are my absolute favorite.  Every product that I have tried has exceeded my expectations.  I love the fresh scents and the fact that all his products and packaging are environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product. Have used it for over 10 years (not the same bottle😜) and will always have some in my cabinet!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my stylist and sister use Kevin Murphy products. My sister was raving about this so I bought a few bottles because it&#x27;s soon to become a discontinued item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict is: I just don&#x27;t love it. My hair is long, highlighted and wavy, but fine textured. This product seemed to make my hair feel dry with no discernible benefit.  I&#x27;ll give the rest to my sister since it seems to work with her coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent, my wife loves this product to protect her hair from the heat of the blow dryer and curling iron</li>
            <li> great for course curly hair as a hydrated. Mix with motion lotion and your hair will have bouncy curls.. Can&#x27;t find motion lotion at a decent price on internet.&lt;br /&gt;Here is an update.  After using it for some time, I realize it smells terrible and does not moisturize my hair.  So I have to take back my good review, because I would not purchase it again.  I think I will throw it out because it stinks.</li>
            <li> Repurchase - have used a long time and really like the moisture it adds to my hair</li>
