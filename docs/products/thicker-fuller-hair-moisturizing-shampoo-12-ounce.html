    <ol>
            <li>Works great and does what it says!</li>
            <li>I really am impressed and realize buying all three products is probably what did it.  </li>
            <li>My husband says it is the best shampoo he have used in his life.  </li>
            <li>and it is great!!!</li>
            <li>My hair is fuller and thicker and It feels great!</li>
            <li>Either quality or delivery is very good.</li>
            <li>so happy</li>
            <li>Also, I know many people feel the need to rotate their hair products for best results.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own but is still a great product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for quite some time now and have found it to be of good quality.</li>
            <li>Sometimes this stuff works really good</li>
            <li>Has a great scent and leaves hair very clean.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product... really helps!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had fine hair, and I&#x27;ve been using this every day wih good results.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that never gives me the volume I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>There are better volumizing products out there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;WOW, was I ever glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>It makes me feel more confident.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Another user had recommended it--and I am pleased I used it.</li>
            <li>and I get to keep most of my hair</li>
            <li>This seems to be a fine shampoo, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to result in thicker or fuller hair for me and neither does the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I originally discovered and purchased this shampoo at a supermarket, and immediately fell in love with the clean, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing special.  </li>
            <li>As a 56 year young man, I was (and still) getting thinner hair and more brains...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>Suffice it to say, that since the scent, which was what made me want to look for and purchase this shampoo again, is no longer as it was, I guess my love affair with this shampoo is over - especially since I never did notice any significant thickening of my hair with its use.  </li>
            <li>For the price and the positive experience, this item is a steel!</li>
            <li>ok, maybe not the later.</li>
            <li>He only uses this shampoo now and requests more when we run out.</li>
            <li>Not that effective, and not real value fr money.  </li>
            <li>I agree that it doesn&#x27;t do much to improve the thickness of hair on</li>
            <li>Thankfully it didn&#x27;t cost too much.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather very well.  </li>
            <li>so maybe that&#x27;s why the scent isn&#x27;t as intense as I recalled?  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really affect my hair noticeably.</li>
            <li>The only thing I like is the cool sensation on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>Alas, upon using it, I noticed that the smell, while still pleasant, was not as heavenly as what I remembered.  </li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair in feeling very clean and never feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t see my scalp yet, but it is getting there and in places my hair wants to naturally part, yes</li>
            <li>I have very thin fine hair, thicker fuller shampoo gives me more body.</li>
            <li>My second bottle - my first one lasted 4-5 months, so it&#x27;s quite the bargain..</li>
            <li>have fine, limp and oily hair.  </li>
            <li>shampoo makes my hair thicker, fuller and soft to touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You CANNOT see my scalp even on the areas that want to part naturally, it&#x27;s covered.  </li>
            <li>Does not irritate his scalp, Leaves hair looking alive.  </li>
            <li>Also, the ingredients have been modified - there was no caffeine in the old formula; so that too could account for the milder smell.  </li>
            <li>Once the shampoo was gone, I looked for it in the stores but could no longer find it; so when I found it on Amazon - for $1.99 no less - I snapped it up.  </li>
            <li>My wife has fine, somewhat thin hair, and she absolutely LOVES this product.  </li>
            <li>Instantly Thick, Thickening Serum, which seems to add some fullness and texture to my fine and thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Most shampoos are heavy and weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my spouse who has always had thin, fine, baby hair.</li>

            <li> Bought this for my spouse who has always had thin, fine, baby hair.</li>
            <li> I feel a tingle when I put it on but not sure If it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Left my hair very dry.  </li>
            <li> My thin, fine hair felt limp after shampooing with other hair cleaning products.</li>
            <li> Hair is fluffy but not dry looking.</li>
            <li> I also loose hair due to stress.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only way I could get thickness and body to my hair,in the past, was to perm it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though this product claims to be moisturizing, I found it a little drying.  </li>
            <li> I blew dried my hair and shall put some curls in it with a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Visibly  adds volume to limp or thin hair when dried after washing.</li>
            <li> It really works; but I&#x27;m disappointed that it contains sulfates, which strips the color off of dyed hair like mine, so I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> And, I have hard water to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I used this for 4 to 5 months with no results which sucks.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I purchased the shampoo and was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> was skeptical, since past products made promises and did not deliver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had worse shampoos though.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say</li>
            <li> My hair is weird.</li>
            <li> I have awful, baby-fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Am disappointed it didn&#x27;t work.</li>

            <li> Even though this product claims to be moisturizing, I found it a little drying.  It&#x27;s nothing special.  There are better volumizing products out there.</li>
            <li> As a 56 year young man, I was (and still) getting thinner hair and more brains...ok, maybe not the later. This shampoo within 3 days of use made my baby locks look and feel thicker and softer. For the price and the positive experience, this item is a steel!</li>
            <li> My wife has fine, somewhat thin hair, and she absolutely LOVES this product.  It makes her hair seem thicker, fuller and healthier with every shampoo.  A lot of products make claims, but this one actually delivers.</li>
            <li> Has a great scent and leaves hair very clean.  I agree that it doesn&#x27;t do much to improve the thickness of hair on it&#x27;s own but is still a great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of this at a local drug store and thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical, since past products made promises and did not deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW, was I ever glad I tried it.  It does what it says...makes hair thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, limp and oily hair.  And, I have hard water to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way I could get thickness and body to my hair,in the past, was to perm it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo makes my hair thicker, fuller and soft to touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot guarantee it will work for everyone, but for me it did.</li>
            <li> Left my hair very dry.  Thankfully it didn&#x27;t cost too much. Am disappointed it didn&#x27;t work. I also used the conditioner and serum.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for quite some time now and have found it to be of good quality. Works great and does what it says!</li>
            <li> I have very thin fine hair, thicker fuller shampoo gives me more body. I have tried several shampoos, none worked.</li>
            <li> I feel a tingle when I put it on but not sure If it really makes a difference. Probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that never gives me the volume I&#x27;d like.  I thought this would help me out.  The only thing I like is the cool sensation on my scalp.  It doesn&#x27;t lather very well.  There is no noticeable thickness even after 3 weeks of using it.  No volume either.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price I paid for it.  I have had worse shampoos though.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my spouse who has always had thin, fine, baby hair. I don&#x27;t use it because I don&#x27;t need it, but it seems to be working for him. He only uses this shampoo now and requests more when we run out. We&#x27;ve definitely seen a difference with his hair: Thicker, fuller, softer, but he is also taking Biosil on a regular basis, so that may be part of the results as well.</li>
            <li> Either quality or delivery is very good. It works. My hair is thicker from the day I use it. It makes me feel more confident.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66 and my hair is thinning.  You can&#x27;t see my scalp yet, but it is getting there and in places my hair wants to naturally part, yes, there you can see my scalp.  A few years ago I purchased the shampoo and was not impressed.  This time I went all out and purchased the shampoo, the conditioner and the root spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You CANNOT see my scalp even on the areas that want to part naturally, it&#x27;s covered.  I really am impressed and realize buying all three products is probably what did it.  I blew dried my hair and shall put some curls in it with a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using these three products.  I&#x27;m just an Amazon customer and rely on the reviews.  Please know that this may not work for you, but it did for me and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have awful, baby-fine, thin hair.  Most shampoos are heavy and weigh my hair down.  This product leaves my hair in feeling very clean and never feeling weighed down. Also, I know many people feel the need to rotate their hair products for best results.  Not me.  I have been using this for years, and never need to (or want to) change.  Even when I visit family, I bring my travel-sized bottle of Thicker Fuller Hair so I am never without it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product... really helps!</li>
            <li> Sorry to say but I used this for 4 to 5 months with no results which sucks. Supposedly a study was conducted that showed men regrew hair after using caffeine in their shampoo. I even bought extra caffeine and added it to the shampoo with no avail.</li>
            <li> My thin, fine hair felt limp after shampooing with other hair cleaning products. But after purchasing Thicker Fuller Hair Shampoo from Amazon and using that shampoo, my hair felt and appeared fuller. Another user had recommended it--and I am pleased I used it.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a fine shampoo, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to result in thicker or fuller hair for me and neither does the conditioner. I won&#x27;t bother buying this product again. However, I do like and recommend the Thicker Fuller Hair Instantly Thick, Thickening Serum, which seems to add some fullness and texture to my fine and thinning hair.</li>
            <li> My husband says it is the best shampoo he have used in his life.  Perfume is not offensive.  Does not irritate his scalp, Leaves hair looking alive.  Hair is fluffy but not dry looking.</li>
            <li> My hair is weird. Sometimes this stuff works really good and I get to keep most of my hair and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. I think it&#x27;s my chemistry though and not the product. I also loose hair due to stress.</li>
            <li> I originally discovered and purchased this shampoo at a supermarket, and immediately fell in love with the clean, fresh scent.  Had there been a body wash with this scent, I&#x27;d have definitely bought it.  Once the shampoo was gone, I looked for it in the stores but could no longer find it; so when I found it on Amazon - for $1.99 no less - I snapped it up.  Alas, upon using it, I noticed that the smell, while still pleasant, was not as heavenly as what I remembered.  This is the moisturizing shampoo, while the one that I purchased from the store was the revitalizing shampoo - so maybe that&#x27;s why the scent isn&#x27;t as intense as I recalled?  Also, the ingredients have been modified - there was no caffeine in the old formula; so that too could account for the milder smell.  Suffice it to say, that since the scent, which was what made me want to look for and purchase this shampoo again, is no longer as it was, I guess my love affair with this shampoo is over - especially since I never did notice any significant thickening of my hair with its use.  Sniff sniff, a tear.</li>
            <li> My second bottle - my first one lasted 4-5 months, so it&#x27;s quite the bargain.. I&#x27;ve always had fine hair, and I&#x27;ve been using this every day wih good results.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this shampoo for about a month now and it is great!!! Ive tried different shampoos for thinning hair and none had worked for me. My hair is fuller and thicker and It feels great! Im so happy I gave this product a try. Def dont regret it at all.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really affect my hair noticeably.</li>
            <li> Not that effective, and not real value fr money.  But some people I shared this with seemed to like it</li>
            <li> Visibly  adds volume to limp or thin hair when dried after washing. Works well with volumizing serum to add body.</li>
            <li> It really works; but I&#x27;m disappointed that it contains sulfates, which strips the color off of dyed hair like mine, so I won&#x27;t be buying it again. If it wasn&#x27;t for that, I&#x27;d rated it 5 stars.</li>
