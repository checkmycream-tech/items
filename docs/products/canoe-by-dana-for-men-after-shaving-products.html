            <li>So, great timeliness and popularity scan.  </li>
            <li>Smells great but doesn&#x27;t seem to stay with you over time.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it and happy</li>
            <li>It lets you smell great yet not overbearing like so many others.</li>

            <li>Very nice, and easy to order.</li>
            <li>I Love It and was more that happy with the price.</li>
            <li>I HAVE LIKED CANOE SINCE THE 70&#x27;S.  </li>
            <li>To add insult to injury, I can&#x27;t even return it because it is classified as hazardous material.  </li>
            <li>Canoe After Shave smells nice, and from time-to-time I still have ladies at work stating that they like it and asking what brand it is.</li>
            <li>I have had it before and liked it.</li>
            <li>one VERY HAPPY man who HIGH RECOMMENDS \\&quot;CANOE\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Smelled right, and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance very light.  </li>
            <li>Every time he considers changing I have to reassure him that I love the way he smells and would not like that to change.</li>
            <li>I was pleased that I was able to locate and purchase it on this site.  </li>
            <li>A great old product that is still as nice today as it was years ago.  </li>
            <li>Is the Aftershave that I have used for many years.</li>
            <li>Not a knockoff like most.</li>
            <li>This is a much better size.</li>
            <li>Glad I can still find this product</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I love when he uses this fragrance.</li>
            <li>My favorite aftershave...</li>
            <li>Took me back to great times at the beach and my life forty years ago!  </li>
            <li>By far the best scent for a true gentlemen.  </li>
            <li>The nice thing about Canoe is it&#x27;s mild fragrance and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting harder to find in stores, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Great value and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It was easy to get anf</li>
            <li>I liked the price very much, too.  </li>
            <li>It is a masculine, pleasant scent.    </li>
            <li>for it and enjoy.</li>
            <li>I heard the price was right!</li>
            <li>True story</li>
            <li>..ran into her at the mall about 6 moths later and asked her how did he like it..said he loved it</li>
            <li>do not know how to describe what it smells like, but it is fresh and light but not flowery.</li>
            <li>A fresh and clean citrus scent that won&#x27;t send others running out of the room.  </li>
            <li>Fresh smelling and feeling, and not overpowering to me or those around me.</li>
            <li>I normally get the smaller size, so this was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>It is back in style again after the very loud and strong body sprays have overpowered so many people.  </li>
            <li>the ER Doctor who attended to me said hope you are not as banged up as good as you smell or something to that affect as was a little groggy at the time..</li>
            <li>Now, as I become more interested in aftershave products, I thought I would see if Canoe was the same as I remembered; and it is.  </li>
            <li>My husband has used Canoe for over 30 years, but recently we have not been able to find it in any of the stores.      </li>
            <li>Love the odor and have gotten compliments when using it and not overly strong as have sinus problems and a masculine scent unlike some other aftershaves.</li>
            <li>Good price, as usual, delivery.  </li>
            <li>Huge bottle, didn&#x27;t know it would be so big.  </li>
            <li>Great scent but after shave only lasts a few minutes , should have gotten cologne rather than the after shave.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>The real deal.</li>
            <li>Thanks, T. Smith</li>
            <li>This junk does not even come close to smelling like the real Canoe.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t stand those obnoxious after shaves that announce you are coming 30 seconds before you get there (or let people know</li>
            <li>It seems like a very watered-down version.  </li>
            <li>A real deal.</li>
            <li>I used this when I was in High School and got away from it while I was in the military and now 30 years later it is still as good as ever.</li>
            <li>I like this aftershave, even though it is different then the original.</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean, not too heavy on your nose or those around you.  </li>
            <li>I TRIED TO FIND IT AT LOCAL STORES WITHOUT SUCCESS.  </li>
            <li>The bottles looked good but the color was a strange green...  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Canoe has been hard to find in stores for a while, so we are glad that Amazon sellers still have it readily</li>
            <li>The little scent that is there when he first puts it on quickly dissipates.  </li>
            <li>Got exactly what I ordered at a very low price</li>
            <li>My wife surprised me!</li>
            <li>They made multiple phone calls to be certain that the address they had was correct.  </li>
            <li>Canoe after-shave is NOT green.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was purchased from Amazon directly...  </li>
            <li>I went to the movies, and was completely distracted by the scent of someone in the theatre wearing Canoe by Dana.  </li>
            <li>a year later later I married her</li>
            <li>Additionally, the smell only lasted two hours on my skin max--then it completely went away.</li>
            <li>My only complaint with this order was that the shipper should have made sure the lids were on tight.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The top on the bottle was broken up in pieces, but none of the aftershave wasted out.</li>
            <li> This is a scent my husband has worn for as long as I&#x27;ve known him.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 20+ years and is getting harder to find locally.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little spice mixed with oak?</li>
            <li> He is back to using it everyday.</li>
            <li> This item came boxed and just as I expected.</li>
            <li> Canoe is an old school subtle fragrance that I have been using for years.  </li>
            <li> It had plenty of staying power, but the one you sent seems to be a watered down.</li>
            <li> unlike Brut or some of the others in doesn&#x27;t advertise that &amp;#34;I&#x27;m wearing aftershave&amp;#34; with an overpowering, knock you down blast, the offends the nose.</li>
            <li> It is simply green tinted alcohol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Canoe for years and usually got the 4oz.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe Amazon would tarnish its reputation by selling such obvious crap.</li>
            <li> I had hard time to find it in the stores of VA and MD</li>
            <li> it is hard to find!</li>
            <li> But even the Splash is a fake.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea what is wrong, but he may as well not even use it.  </li>
            <li> It is a green color and it smells awful.  </li>
            <li> I have also used with this vendor before and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> We are very disappointed in this bottle that we received.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Got exactly what I ordered at a very low price</li>
            <li> Great value and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My husbands go to scent... Yummy</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing Canoe for years.  Every time he considers changing I have to reassure him that I love the way he smells and would not like that to change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 and this scent was just not for me. Additionally, the smell only lasted two hours on my skin max--then it completely went away. I was using the .5 oz edt I received from a variety pack.</li>
            <li> The bottles looked good but the color was a strange green...  Canoe after-shave is NOT green. Canoe after-shave is made in France,NOT China. Upon use one finds that there is no scent at all...  It is simply green tinted alcohol. Chemical analysis shows it to be Methyl [wood] alcohol which is definitely NOT approved for use on the skin, or anywhere else on -- or in -- one&#x27;s body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was purchased from Amazon directly...  I must conclude that Amazon is being cheated as well.</li>
            <li> I used this product years ago and it was very good. It had plenty of staying power, but the one you sent seems to be a watered down. The fragrance only last for about two hours.</li>
            <li> Having used this product for many years, I was unable to find it through the former retail outlets.  I was not going to give it up.  I was pleased that I was able to locate and purchase it on this site.  I Love It and was more that happy with the price.</li>
            <li> A great old product that is still as nice today as it was years ago.  A fresh and clean citrus scent that won&#x27;t send others running out of the room.  And this is the best price I have ever seen, by a lot!</li>
            <li> I HAVE LIKED CANOE SINCE THE 70&#x27;S.  I TRIED TO FIND IT AT LOCAL STORES WITHOUT SUCCESS.  WENT AMAZON.COM AND LO AND BEHOLD I FOUND WHAT I WANTED AT A GREAT PRICE.  COULD NOT BELEIVE THE QUANTITY FOR THE PRICE. MY FIANCEE ALSO LIKES IT ON ME.  THANKS AMAZON.COM, YOU CAME THROUGH AS YOU ALWAYS DO.</li>
            <li> Is the Aftershave that I have used for many years. Perfect for me.</li>
            <li> The real deal. Not a knockoff like most.</li>
            <li> the only thing my husband uses. It was easy to get anf the bottle is big enough to last the duration</li>
            <li> I used Canoe as a youngster.  Now, as I become more interested in aftershave products, I thought I would see if Canoe was the same as I remembered; and it is.  Fresh and clean, not too heavy on your nose or those around you.  Glad I found it and happy it maintained it&#x27;s character after all these years.</li>
            <li> This is a scent my husband has worn for as long as I&#x27;ve known him.  It&#x27;s getting harder to find in stores, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon.  My only complaint with this order was that the shipper should have made sure the lids were on tight.  Both bottles leaked, and the boxes they come in had to be thrown away.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 20+ years and is getting harder to find locally. Love the odor and have gotten compliments when using it and not overly strong as have sinus problems and a masculine scent unlike some other aftershaves. True story I had this on 20 or so years ago and was headed into my office when involved in a car accident..the ER Doctor who attended to me said hope you are not as banged up as good as you smell or something to that affect as was a little groggy at the time..she asked me what it was as wanted to get it for her boyfriend..ran into her at the mall about 6 moths later and asked her how did he like it..said he loved it but we are not together any longer...well CANOE you did your trick as a year later later I married her and she still is my best friend ever and we celebrate our 19th anniversary this November 16th...one VERY HAPPY man who HIGH RECOMMENDS \\&quot;CANOE\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Been using it for years.  Good price, as usual, delivery.  Thanks, T. Smith</li>
            <li> The top on the bottle was broken up in pieces, but none of the aftershave wasted out.</li>
            <li> I used this when I was in High School and got away from it while I was in the military and now 30 years later it is still as good as ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Canoe for years and usually got the 4oz. bottle. This is a much better size. The nice thing about Canoe is it&#x27;s mild fragrance and unlike Brut or some of the others in doesn&#x27;t advertise that &amp;#34;I&#x27;m wearing aftershave&amp;#34; with an overpowering, knock you down blast, the offends the nose. The delivery was prompt and just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Scent does not last but who cares. It&#x27;s Canoe. ... Nastalgia</li>
            <li> Husband loves this Aftershave and has used it for years. He is back to using it everyday. Has great Smell.</li>
            <li> My husband has used Canoe for over 30 years, but recently we have not been able to find it in any of the stores.      I like Canoe because it is not over-powering.  It is a masculine, pleasant scent.    My husband likes the way it makes his face feel.</li>
            <li> I should have trusted the review I read about this product.  This junk does not even come close to smelling like the real Canoe.  It is a green color and it smells awful.  Further, I ordered Canoe After shave, and I got Canoe Splash.  There is a difference.  But even the Splash is a fake.  To add insult to injury, I can&#x27;t even return it because it is classified as hazardous material.  I can&#x27;t believe Amazon would tarnish its reputation by selling such obvious crap.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time, and I smell great.</li>
            <li> This is just a great product. It lets you smell great yet not overbearing like so many others. I have used it forever.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for over 40 years.  By far the best scent for a true gentlemen.  My wife loves it and that is what counts.</li>
            <li> Canoe After Shave smells nice, and from time-to-time I still have ladies at work stating that they like it and asking what brand it is. I really can&#x27;t stand those obnoxious after shaves that announce you are coming 30 seconds before you get there (or let people know you were there 5 minutes after you have already left)... and this is definitely not one of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know how to describe what it smells like, but it is fresh and light but not flowery. Maybe a little spice mixed with oak? I don&#x27;t know... but I like it. Fresh smelling and feeling, and not overpowering to me or those around me. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A college girlfriend gave me a bottle of Canoe After Shave and I have been wearing it on and off over the years since. It is always the after shave that I come back to after using something else for a while, just to switch it up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Canoe has been hard to find in stores for a while, so we are glad that Amazon sellers still have it readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it and enjoy.</li>
            <li> Vendor was persistent in getting shipment to me even when it was returned initially.  They made multiple phone calls to be certain that the address they had was correct.  Great service.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle, didn&#x27;t know it would be so big.  I normally get the smaller size, so this was a pleasant surprise.  Smelled right, and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  I got 2, so it should last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I have had it before and liked it. I liked the price very much, too.  Yes, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband has worn Canoe after shave for years.  We are very disappointed in this bottle that we received.  It seems like a very watered-down version.  I have no idea what is wrong, but he may as well not even use it.  The little scent that is there when he first puts it on quickly dissipates.  I ordered Canoe Aftershave and when it came it said \\&quot;Canoe Aftershave Splash.\\&quot;  I don&#x27;t know if this has anything to do with it or not, but I would not purchase this product from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Fragrance very light.  Not like the Canoe I used years ago.</li>
            <li> Glad I can still find this product</li>
            <li> I like this aftershave, even though it is different then the original. I wish I would have known they changed their formula.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I love when he uses this fragrance. It is an excellent price performer. A real deal.</li>
            <li> My favorite aftershave... Canoe!  My wife surprised me! it is hard to find! I heard the price was right!</li>
            <li> Great scent but after shave only lasts a few minutes , should have gotten cologne rather than the after shave.</li>
            <li> I had to find this and purchase it as soon as I located it!  I went to the movies, and was completely distracted by the scent of someone in the theatre wearing Canoe by Dana.  Took me back to great times at the beach and my life forty years ago!  So I ordered some for all my sons...age forty one, thirty two, and twenty eight!  They all love it, too!  So, great timeliness and popularity scan.  I love it!</li>
            <li> hardtofindaroundmyplaceandagreatprice iloveit</li>
            <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t seem to stay with you over time.</li>
            <li> This item came boxed and just as I expected.</li>
            <li> Canoe is an old school subtle fragrance that I have been using for years.  It is back in style again after the very loud and strong body sprays have overpowered so many people.  This product has understated class.</li>
            <li> Did not get After Shave Per say, After Shave Splash, but it is very similar to the After Shave. I have used Canoe for years and I like it. I have also used with this vendor before and have not been disappointed. Quality product, good shipping time, Very Happy</li>
            <li> Very nice, and easy to order. I had hard time to find it in the stores of VA and MD</li>
