            <li>My skin is sensitive and this product is great.</li>
            <li>great product wish I had more in larger bottle arrived quickly</li>
            <li>It is light, covers well</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin moist and not oily nor greasy but above all it just feels great.  </li>
            <li>this facial moisturizer is really one of the best that I have used.  </li>
            <li>Smells great helps dry skin</li>
            <li>I saw this advertised on the telly and just had to try it; however, I chose Amazon as my vendor and am delighted with the Facial Moisturizer and Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love Amir Argan Oil products but this particular one was not so moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Love the results and the scent never smells like normal bronzing lotions.</li>
            <li>The aroma is not heavy, but is pleasant, and my skin does stay nice and moist, perhaps wrinkles are even slightly less (?)</li>
            <li>I use this product regularly and just love it!</li>
            <li>This is not a light moisturizer, but great consistency and</li>
            <li>Great with a few drops of argan oil.</li>
            <li>Oil is an excellent moisturizer for very dry skin &amp; especially for mature skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li>My favorite facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I enjoyed this enough to start using Argan oil shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this Amir Argan Oil Facial Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love the way that this facial mosturizer absorbs into my skin without the greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is a very good moisturizer that I use if other treatments dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>So...the expense of this Amir is not worth it when I can purchase another product just as good or better and for less money.</li>
            <li>but honestly I have not noticed any significant difference between Amir Argan Oil and other facial creams that I used before</li>
            <li>and my face has never broken out.</li>
            <li>This goes on fine; does not feel greasy, but my face is still dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>kinda guy (hello, New England!),</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have used several facial moisturizers in the last few years and this is the best one yet.</li>
            <li>Lovely, heavy moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have really dry sensitive skin specially in the winter.</li>
            <li>It makes your face and skin feel soft not oily!</li>
            <li>makes my face feel smooth and helps with little wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>So far I like the results.&lt;br /&gt;Argan</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a month, it is a moisturizing cream, no reaction or side effects so far  </li>
            <li>Amir argan oil has a light soothing calming citrus scent that is not overpowering or heavy.</li>
            <li>Not greasy feeling, absorbs in completely.</li>
            <li>Love the texture, not too thick or greasy.</li>
            <li>The lotion works like the previous bottle, however with the self tanner in it, it makes my skin smell funny.</li>
            <li>I have used other Amir Argan Oil products and they have all worked very well.</li>
            <li>The plastiv is so rigid, it is very hard to squeeze to dispense &amp; I have strong doctor hands,</li>

            <li> The plastiv is so rigid, it is very hard to squeeze to dispense &amp; I have strong doctor hands,</li>
            <li> subtle fragrance and easy to apply in the upside down plastic bottle</li>
            <li> I have used it on several different dry areas and it works well.</li>
            <li> ran out tonight, 4 oz bottle lasted a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Where there is a dry area of skin it will be covered in Amir Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> Have tried expensive moisturizes in the past and this moisturizer is 1/4 of the price and works so much better for me.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little unhappy that my face sweats right after I put on the Amir Argan facial lotion</li>
            <li> Formula needs revising - too many harsh chemicals negate the benefits that Argan oil can provide :(</li>
            <li> I will not use the product on my face for this reason, but will use it for my feet and hands so that I don&#x27;t have to throw my money down the drain.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I received this product within a few days.</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil, but was very disappointed when I received this product.  </li>
            <li> I hate to say it, but I do look so much younger than my friends the same age.</li>
            <li> Bottle hard to squeeze to get cream.</li>
            <li> It is very thick cream and feels heavy on your face, but if you like that, it probably works just as well as the Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I get red patches that hurts and burn like crazy.</li>
            <li> Disappointed because alcohol was the third ingredient listed - not good on the Face!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product has wax listed as one of the ingredients.  </li>

            <li> Love this. Not too heavy. Perfect for me</li>
            <li> Good product.  Love the fragrance and the moisturizing effect on my face.  It arrived before promised date.  So far I like the results.&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil is an excellent moisturizer for very dry skin &amp; especially for mature skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer</li>
            <li> Disappointed because alcohol was the third ingredient listed - not good on the Face! Formula needs revising - too many harsh chemicals negate the benefits that Argan oil can provide :(</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I have been using it for some months now. It is light, covers well and my face has never broken out. I have used other Amir Argan Oil products and they have all worked very well.</li>
            <li> Love the texture, not too thick or greasy. And it smells great!</li>
            <li> Not what I was looking for. I have really sensitive skin and this just was not the thing for me. Can&#x27;t use it since it breaks me out...ah well...</li>
            <li> It was just ok. Had to use quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest.  Bottle hard to squeeze to get cream.</li>
            <li> Have tried expensive moisturizes in the past and this moisturizer is 1/4 of the price and works so much better for me.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is great ... and it is a large tube, so a good buy price-wise.  I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone.</li>
            <li> I saw this advertised on the telly and just had to try it; however, I chose Amazon as my vendor and am delighted with the Facial Moisturizer and Amazon.  It leaves my skin moist and not oily nor greasy but above all it just feels great.  I do not limit it to my face.  Where there is a dry area of skin it will be covered in Amir Argan Oil.  I have used it on several different dry areas and it works well.</li>
            <li> It is very thick cream and feels heavy on your face, but if you like that, it probably works just as well as the Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my sister and she loves it. Lovely smell and feels so good on face. Thank you</li>
            <li> This moisturizer soaks in with out any greasiness and smell wonderful like I&#x27;m in Bora Bora! I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is my third time buying this product. Love it</li>
            <li> I love this Amir Argan oil product! I&#x27;ve been really happy with how my skin feels clean and smooth all the time. I&#x27;m a little unhappy that my face sweats right after I put on the Amir Argan facial lotion &#x3D;-(, so I put it on before bed instead of .  morning. I will continue to use this product, I love it!</li>
            <li> makes my face feel smooth and helps with little wrinkles.  i would recomend this product to my friends and family</li>
            <li> Lovely, heavy moisturizer.  This is not a light moisturizer, but great consistency and the fragrance is very pleasant. I use it for face and body and it feels very good on my skin.</li>
            <li> I received this product within a few days. This is a excellent cream.  My skin is sensitive and this product is great. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this product at night on my face.  I could notice a difference in the texture of my skin &amp; at the age of 56 that is very important to me.  I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> definitely a five star</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month, it is a moisturizing cream, no reaction or side effects so far  but honestly I have not noticed any significant difference between Amir Argan Oil and other facial creams that I used before (and they were cheaper than this one).</li>
            <li> Great with a few drops of argan oil.</li>
            <li> My favorite facial moisturizer. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who fancies argan oil products!</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil, but was very disappointed when I received this product.  A facial moisturizer should never contain wax, as it will clog your pores.  Unfortunately this product has wax listed as one of the ingredients.  I will not use the product on my face for this reason, but will use it for my feet and hands so that I don&#x27;t have to throw my money down the drain.</li>
            <li> subtle fragrance and easy to apply in the upside down plastic bottle</li>
            <li> this facial moisturizer is really one of the best that I have used.  The texture makes my skin feel like silk.</li>
            <li> Just the thing I&#x27;ve been looking for. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, not to sticky, just creamy and smooth. Love it and will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Bj&lt;br /&gt;Jacksonville, Fl</li>
            <li> This is a very good moisturizer that I use if other treatments dry out my skin.  I&#x27;m very happy to have this as a backup.</li>
            <li> I have used several facial moisturizers in the last few years and this is the best one yet. It is light and absorbs wonderfully. Amir argan oil has a light soothing calming citrus scent that is not overpowering or heavy. This facial and their body moisturizer are my go to&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I heard about Argan oil from an article in Esquire, so thought I&#x27;d try it. I&#x27;m not a big cream and lotion kinda guy (hello, New England!), but I use this daily on my face and hands. The aroma is not heavy, but is pleasant, and my skin does stay nice and moist, perhaps wrinkles are even slightly less (?) Regardless, I enjoyed this enough to start using Argan oil shampoo. Do they make an Argan cooking oil? Probably not.....</li>
            <li> The lotion works like the previous bottle, however with the self tanner in it, it makes my skin smell funny. Don&#x27;t like the smell at all. It is the smell of most self tanners.</li>
            <li> great product wish I had more in larger bottle arrived quickly no problems love love it  highly recommend product and great seller to buy from</li>
            <li> This product is as good as any store bought moisturizers I have used over the years. So...the expense of this Amir is not worth it when I can purchase another product just as good or better and for less money.</li>
            <li> Great service - Great product</li>
            <li> Love it! It makes your face and skin feel soft not oily!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. For some reason it takes the red out of your skin</li>
            <li> This goes on fine; does not feel greasy, but my face is still dry and flaky. I was hoping it would help prevent that.</li>
            <li> I love this Amir Argan Oil Facial Moisturizer.  It has a wonderful smell and does not hurt my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love the results and the scent never smells like normal bronzing lotions.</li>
            <li> Smells great helps dry skin</li>
            <li> This was bought by my wife. I asked her if she liked it and If it mmet her expectations. She said yup.</li>
            <li> Great product, will reorder ...this very nourishing product. I do suggest that R&amp; D ck packaging. The plastiv is so rigid, it is very hard to squeeze to dispense &amp; I have strong doctor hands,</li>
            <li> I love the way that this facial mosturizer absorbs into my skin without the greasy feeling.  Also, love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Just ran out tonight, 4 oz bottle lasted a very long time.  A little goes a long way.  Already on Amazon looking to buy more.</li>
            <li> I am so in love, or rather my face is so in love with this product. I have really dry sensitive skin specially in the winter. I get red patches that hurts and burn like crazy. But finally I have found something that takes care of my skin so perfectly.</li>
            <li> I use this product regularly and just love it! Not greasy feeling, absorbs in completely. I hate to say it, but I do look so much younger than my friends the same age.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and price, super fast delivery.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love Amir Argan Oil products but this particular one was not so moisturizing.</li>
