            <li>ok gotta go</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;much love jubilees</li>
            <li>This flat iron is great!  </li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron !!</li>
            <li>But if you have fine hair like me, this flat iron is great!</li>
            <li>great flat iron better than any</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>Because it works just as well and for the huge price difference from the Chi.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m going to keep it just because it was dirt cheap</li>
            <li>I already had this hair straightener, and was really happy that I could replace it with the same model I already had.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was cheap as Chi&#x27;s are about 150.00.</li>
            <li>Just got this one because the hair dryer was so good that I decided to get a better flat iron as well.  </li>
            <li>I now know why a cheap flat iron does nothing and a good one makes all the difference.  </li>
            <li>The red color of product looks nice but comes off and stains surfaces easily when heated.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t seem very hot even when I set it on the highest option.</li>
            <li>My stylist used the same iron on my hair and it worked well, so I got one and love it!  </li>
            <li>anyway i really liked it so wanted to buy the exact same one and while this one looks just like my first one, it doesn&#x27;t run as smoothly over the hair.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and stays hot.</li>
            <li>It smooths my hair and goes in exactly the direction</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t asking it for much - my hair is already straight.  </li>
            <li>I have very course and curly hair and it DOES work just as well as the Chi.</li>
            <li>I later got the Remington S5500 Digital Anti Static 1 Inch Ceramic Hair Straightener.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>the next ones work right..</li>
            <li>Waiting for the new ones</li>
            <li>A family member suggested this to me when I was looking for a new one.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Even on max temp, this one doesn&#x27;t do that, and it doesn&#x27;t smooth all the frizzies down.</li>
            <li>The chord comes loose easily and tends to short out.</li>
            <li>i got my first flat iron like this about four years ago and really liked it for curling/waving hair (not good for straightening).</li>
            <li>This exact flat iron is the one we are given in our &#x27;kit&#x27; at cosmetology school.</li>
            <li>It gives your hair a smooth look that last long !!</li>
            <li>Usually when using a good flat iron, after running it down my hair, my hair is so hot</li>
            <li>I had previously owned an Andis flat iron from Walmart that I was just as satisfied with.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of naturally wavy/curly hair and keep it set at just under heat level 15.</li>
            <li>hair hair is silky soft looking and feeling after use</li>
            <li>I was surprised.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is better than my 2002 iron for obvious reasons but you can tell because of the price you&#x27;re going to get an average iron.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work properly had to return for a new pair hopefully</li>
            <li>I still use both of them but the latter is far better(temperature</li>
            <li>So far I like this flat iron.</li>

            <li> So far I like this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron burns and the ceramic heating plate wares.</li>
            <li> I got this flat iron for under $30 about a year ago for humid days.</li>
            <li> I recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> The other Andis products we get is the red blow dryer and the red Marcel iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and this flat iron handles very well.  </li>
            <li> The cord is industrial strength and about 8ft long.</li>
            <li> This Flat Iron DOES NOT HAVE AN AUTO SHUT-OFF!!!!</li>
            <li> I have stick straight, very thin hair that I wear in a short bob.  </li>
            <li> My previous iron was 1/2 the price at $15 and it did have auto shut-off as well as a locking feature.</li>
            <li> or i just need to break it in a little bit.</li>
            <li> Gives a heavy burn odor when on.</li>
            <li> so i obviously use it alot and it was wearing out (still works, just getting really dirty and the on/off switch is coming loose from being dropped in my iron holder at work).</li>
            <li> I can give it just a little curl on the end and go!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using extremely expensive flat irons for years.</li>
            <li> The plates are small so if you have thick hair the 1\\&quot; will take you a while to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Seriously missed the mark on this product Andis.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that iron wasn&#x27;t avail.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m disappointed at the lack of auto shut off feature.</li>

            <li> My stylist used the same iron on my hair and it worked well, so I got one and love it!  I have stick straight, very thin hair that I wear in a short bob.  It works wonderfully!  I can give it just a little curl on the end and go!  I bought one for my travel bag and one to keep at our cabin....low price for a great product!!!</li>
            <li> So far I like this flat iron. It does it&#x27;s job well. It heats up quickly and stays hot. I have a lot of naturally wavy/curly hair and keep it set at just under heat level 15. However, I&#x27;m disappointed at the lack of auto shut off feature. Especially since twice I have left it on for over 24 hours. I had previously owned an Andis flat iron from Walmart that I was just as satisfied with. My previous iron was 1/2 the price at $15 and it did have auto shut-off as well as a locking feature. Unfortunately that iron wasn&#x27;t avail. For the purpose of straightening/flatting my hair...it does work well!</li>
            <li> I now know why a cheap flat iron does nothing and a good one makes all the difference.  Just got this one because the hair dryer was so good that I decided to get a better flat iron as well.  Works great.  No frizzies; smooth hair with great shine.  My hair is thick and this flat iron handles very well.  I am impressed with this brand.</li>
            <li> This flat iron burns and the ceramic heating plate wares. Gives a heavy burn odor when on. The red color of product looks nice but comes off and stains surfaces easily when heated. The chord comes loose easily and tends to short out.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Andis products before and bought this for the quality that I have come to expect from this brand name. This Flat Iron DOES NOT HAVE AN AUTO SHUT-OFF!!!! The cord is industrial strength and about 8ft long. Seriously missed the mark on this product Andis.</li>
            <li> I got this flat iron for under $30 about a year ago for humid days. But it doesn&#x27;t seem very hot even when I set it on the highest option. I later got the Remington S5500 Digital Anti Static 1 Inch Ceramic Hair Straightener. I still use both of them but the latter is far better(temperature setting control)and better priced.</li>
            <li> Usually when using a good flat iron, after running it down my hair, my hair is so hot I can&#x27;t touch it.  Even on max temp, this one doesn&#x27;t do that, and it doesn&#x27;t smooth all the frizzies down.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work properly had to return for a new pair hopefully the next ones work right.. Waiting for the new ones</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Happy with my purchase.  Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is better than my 2002 iron for obvious reasons but you can tell because of the price you&#x27;re going to get an average iron. To get an amazing good quality iron i suggest buying babybliss pro nano its stupendous!! ok gotta go&lt;br /&gt;much love jubilees</li>
            <li> i got my first flat iron like this about four years ago and really liked it for curling/waving hair (not good for straightening). but i&#x27;m a hairstylist so i obviously use it alot and it was wearing out (still works, just getting really dirty and the on/off switch is coming loose from being dropped in my iron holder at work). anyway i really liked it so wanted to buy the exact same one and while this one looks just like my first one, it doesn&#x27;t run as smoothly over the hair. so i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a different finish or i just need to break it in a little bit. we&#x27;ll see. i&#x27;m going to keep it just because it was dirt cheap and i don&#x27;t want the hassle of returning it.</li>
            <li> Heats fast, works great!</li>
            <li> great flat iron better than any Ive used doesnt pull break nor frizz hair hair is silky soft looking and feeling after use&lt;br /&gt;Deff must buy</li>
            <li> Returned this item.  It didn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything to my hair.  I wasn&#x27;t asking it for much - my hair is already straight.  And it pulled my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron !! It gives your hair a smooth look that last long !! Your hair look so beautiful and shining !!</li>
            <li> I already had this hair straightener, and was really happy that I could replace it with the same model I already had.  I am kind of a creature of habit, and I stick with something when it works well for me.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> This exact flat iron is the one we are given in our &#x27;kit&#x27; at cosmetology school. I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work as well as my Chi iron. I thought it was cheap as Chi&#x27;s are about 150.00. I have very course and curly hair and it DOES work just as well as the Chi. I was surprised. The other Andis products we get is the red blow dryer and the red Marcel iron. They all work well too. Because it works just as well and for the huge price difference from the Chi. I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is great!  Price is good and product is just as described in the description. I recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using extremely expensive flat irons for years. A family member suggested this to me when I was looking for a new one. I love it! I have fine hair so I use a low heat setting. It smooths my hair and goes in exactly the direction I want it to; while not feeling like I&#x27;m frying it. The plates are small so if you have thick hair the 1\\&quot; will take you a while to get the job done. But if you have fine hair like me, this flat iron is great!</li>
